It is a regularly\noccurring and official count of a particular population. {{cite book\n | last = Sullivan first = Arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors =\n | Steven M.

The United\n | Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as\n | \"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory,\n | simultaneity and defined periodicity\", and recommends that population\n | censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations\n | also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions,\n | classifications and other useful information to coordinate international\n | practice.

The modern census\nis essential to international comparisons of any kind of statistics and\ncensuses collect data on many attributes of the population, not just how many\npeople there are, although population estimates remain an important function of\nthe census.\n\nThe census can be contrasted with sampling in which information is obtained only\nfrom a subset of a population, sometimes as an intercensal estimate. Census data\nare commonly used for research, business marketing, and planning, as well as a\nbaseline for sampling surveys. Census counts are necessary to adjust samples to\nbe representative of a population by weighting them as is common in opinion\npolling. Similarly, stratification requires knowledge of the relative sizes of\ndifferent population strata which are derived from census enumerations. In some\ncountries, census data are used to apportion electoral representation (sometimes\ncontroversially â e.g., [[Utah v. Evans]]).\n","linknr":396,"url":"Census","recorded":1362570881,"links":96,"instances":["statistics","statistics"],"pdf":["http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/docs/P&R_Rev2.pdf","http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/CES_2010_Census_Recommendations_English.pdf","http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/standmeth/handbooks/Manual_PESen.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/census-coverage-survey/trout--catfish-and-roach.pdf","http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/Register_based_statistics_in_Nordic_countries.pdf","http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/publications/Register_based_statistics_in_Nordic_countries.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00124.x/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00124.x/pdf"],"categories":["Censuses","Genealogy","Population","Demography","Survey methodology","Sampling (statistics)","Latin words and phrases"],"headings":["Sampling","Residence definitions","Enumeration strategies","Technology","Uses of Census data","Privacy","Historical examples","Modern implementation","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Volkstelling_1925_Census.jpg/300px-Volkstelling_1925_Census.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampling","statistics"],["sampling","statistics"],["microdata","statistics"]],"members":["microdata","sampling"],"related":["Netherlands","Information","Population","Population_and_housing_censuses_by_country","United_Nations","Latin_language","Roman_Republic","Sampling_(statistics)","Intercensal_estimate","Marketing","Opinion_poll","Stratified_sampling","Sampling_frame","Census_Day","Capture-recapture","Demographic","Office_for_National_Statistics","Royal_Statistical_Society","Official_statistics","Office_for_National_Statistics","Sampling_(statistics)","Canada_2011_Census","Munir_Sheikh","Propensity_score_matching","Microdata_(statistics)","Conditional_probability_distribution","Histogram","Mixture_distribution","IPUMS","SDMX","Census_in_Egypt","Bible","Flat_tax","Tabernacle","Book_of_Numbers","Moab","David","Solomon","Gospel_of_Luke","Jesus","Han_Dynasty","Chandragupta_Maurya","Kautilya","Ancient_Rome","Latin","Walter_Scheidel","Servius_Tullius","Livy","Livy","Fabius_Pictor","Middle_Ages","Caliphate","Rashidun_Caliphate","Caliph","Umar","Domesday_Book","William_I_of_England","Crusade","Kingdom_of_Jerusalem","Saladin","Egypt","Syria","Inca_Empire","Quipus","Llama","Alpaca","Base-10","Philip_II_of_Spain","IBM_and_the_Holocaust","Race_and_ethnicity_in_censuses","Social_research"]}
