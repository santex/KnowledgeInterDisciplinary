Convolution is similar to cross-\ncorrelation. It has applications that include probability, statistics, computer\nvision, image and signal processing, electrical engineering, and differential\nequations.\n\nThe convolution can be defined for functions on groups other than Euclidean\nspace. For example, periodic functions, such as the discrete-time Fourier\ntransform, can be defined on a circle and convolved by periodic convolution.\n(See row 10 at DTFT#Properties.)&nbsp; And discrete convolution can be defined\nfor functions on the set of integers. Generalizations of convolution have\napplications in the field of numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra,\nand in the design and implementation of finite impulse response filters in\nsignal processing.\n\nComputing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as deconvolution.\n","title":"convolution","headings":["Definition","Historical developments","Circular convolution","Discrete convolution","Circular discrete convolution","Domain of definition","Properties","Convolutions on groups","Convolution of measures","Bialgebras","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Impulse_response","4: Periodic_summation","3: Convolution_theorem","3: Borel_measure","2: Autocorrelation","2: Functional_analysis","2: Cross-correlation","2: Statistics","2: Image_processing","2: Electrical_engineering","2: Finite_impulse_response","2: Deconvolution","2: Circular_convolution","2: Cyclic_group","2: Fast_Fourier_transform","2: Digital_signal_processing","2: Lebesgue_integral","2: Fubini's_theorem#Tonelli's_theorem","2: Schwartz_function","2: Total_variation","2: Abelian_group","2: Fourier_transform","2: Titchmarsh_convolution_theorem","2: Locally_compact","2: Haar_measure","2: Compact_operator_on_Hilbert_space","2: Probability_distribution","2: Random_variable","1: Mathematics","1: Probability","1: Computer_vision","1: Signal_processing","1: Differential_equations","1: Euclidean_space","1: Periodic_function","1: Discrete-time_Fourier_transform","1: Circle","1: DTFT#Properties","1: Integers","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Numerical_linear_algebra","1: Asterisk","1: Integral_transform","1: LTI_system_theory#Overview","1: Fourier_transforms","1: Transfer_function","1: Free_variables_and_bound_variables","1: Unit_impulse","1: Jean-le-Rond_D'Alembert","1: Sylvestre_François_Lacroix","1: Pierre_Simon_Laplace","1: Jean_Baptiste_Joseph_Fourier","1: Siméon_Denis_Poisson","1: German_language","1: Vito_Volterra","1: Polynomial","1: Cauchy_product","1: Modular_arithmetic","1: Multiplication","1: Discrete_Fourier_transform#Circular_convolution_theorem_and_cross-correlation_theorem","1: Schönhage–Strassen_algorithm","1: Overlap–save_method","1: Overlap–add_method","1: Compact_support","1: Continuous_function","1: Locally_integrable_function","1: Lp_space","1: Banach_algebra","1: Young's_inequality#Young's_inequality_for_convolutions","1: Elliott_H._Lieb","1: Brascamp–Lieb_inequality","1: Lp_space#Weak_Lp","1: Rapidly_decreasing_function","1: Bounded_variation","1: Banach_space","1: Linear_space","1: Commutative_algebra","1: Identity_element","1: Commutativity","1: Associativity","1: Distributivity","1: Multiplicative_identity","1: Dirac_delta","1: Nascent_delta_function","1: Inverse_element","1: Fubini's_theorem","1: Derivative","1: Partial_derivative","1: Young's_inequality","1: Difference_operator","1: Normalizing_constant","1: Fourier_transform#Properties_of_the_Fourier_transform","1: Laplace_transform","1: Two-sided_Laplace_transform","1: Z-transform","1: Mellin_transform","1: Linear_operator","1: Time-invariant_system","1: LTI_system_theory","1: Continuous_linear_operator","1: Topology","1: Fourier_multiplier","1: Hausdorff_space","1: Topological_group","1: Unimodular_group","1: Circle_group","1: Hilbert_space","1: Normal_operator","1: Multiplication_operator","1: Circulant_matrices","1: Discrete_Fourier_transform","1: Unitary_representation","1: Peter–Weyl_theorem","1: Harmonic_analysis","1: Absolute_continuity","1: Radon–Nikodym_theorem","1: Probability_measure","1: Statistical_independence","1: Bialgebra","1: Endomorphism_algebra","1: Hopf_algebra","1: Halftone","1: Digital_image_processing","1: Algorithm","1: Edge_detection","1: Optics","1: Bokeh","1: Analytical_chemistry","1: Signal-to-noise_ratio","1: Moving_average_model","1: Acoustics","1: Reverberation","1: Electronic_music","1: Spectrum","1: Linear_time-invariant_system","1: Physics","1: Linear_system","1: Superposition_principle","1: Spectroscopy","1: Normal_distribution","1: Spectral_line_shape","1: Cauchy_distribution","1: Voigt_function","1: Time-resolved_spectroscopy","1: Computational_fluid_dynamics","1: Large_eddy_simulation","1: Turbulence_model","1: Probability_theory","1: Kernel_density_estimation","1: Analog_signal_processing","1: Circulant_matrix","1: Convolution_for_optical_broad-beam_responses_in_scattering_media","1: Convolution_power","1: Dirichlet_convolution","1: Jan_Mikusinski","1: List_of_convolutions_of_probability_distributions","1: LTI_system_theory#Impulse_response_and_convolution","1: Scaled_correlation","1: Toeplitz_matrix","1: MathWorld"]}
