{"cursor":"960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'analyte', or 'component' (in clinical chemistry), is a substance or\nchemical constituent that is of interest in an analytical procedure.\nGrammatically speaking, experiments always seek to measure properties of\nanalytesâanalytes themselves can never be measured. For instance, one cannot\nmeasure a table (analyte-component) but, the height, width, etc. of a table can\nbe measured. Likewise, one cannot measure glucose but can measure the glucose\nconcentration. In this example \"glucose\" is the component and \"concentration\"\nis the measurable property. In laboratory and layman jargon the \"property\" is\noften left out provided the omission does not lead to an ambiguity of what\nproperty is measured.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Analyte","recorded":1362509860,"links":25,"instances":["furniture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/35px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["table","furniture"]],"members":["table"],"related":["Clinical_chemistry","Chemical","Chemical_property","Table_(furniture)","Analytical_chemistry","Immunoassay","Magnetic_immunoassay"]}
