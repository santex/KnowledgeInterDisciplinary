The\nlumper/splitter problem occurs when there is the need to create\nclassifications and assign examples to them, for example schools of\nliterature, biological taxa and so on. A \"lumper\" is an individual who takes a\nview of a definition, and assigns examples broadly, assuming that differences\nare not as important as signature similarities. A \"splitter\" is an individual\nwho takes precise definitions, and creates new categories to classify samples\nthat differ in key ways.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Lumpers_and_splitters","recorded":1362902539,"links":15,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(137)ruhlen12.pdf"],"categories":["Knowledge representation","Taxonomy"],"headings":["Origin of the terms","Usage in various fields","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["genetic","linguistics"]],"members":["genetic"],"related":["Literature","Biology","Taxon","Victor_McKusick","J._H._Hexter","John_Edward_Christopher_Hill","Max_Weber","Calvinist","Isaiah_Berlin","The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox","Evolution","Organism","Germany","Goethe","Johann_Nepomuk_Hummel","Sergei_Rachmaninoff","Software_engineering","Model-driven_architecture","Historical_linguistics","Language_family","Altaic_languages","Pamaâ€“Nyungan_languages","Nilo-Saharan","Classification_schemes_for_indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas","Mutually_intelligible","Dialect_continuum","Comparative_method","Protolanguage","Genetic_(linguistics)","Mass_lexical_comparison","Lexicostatistics","Linguistic_divergence","Language_convergence","Vladislav_Illich-Svitych","Sergei_Starostin","Morris_Swadesh","Edward_Sapir","Merritt_Ruhlen","Paul_F._Bradshaw","Liturgy","Smartism","Shaivism","Vaishnavism","Shaktism","Evolutionary_biology","Prototype_theory","Sorites_paradox","TV_Tropes"]}
