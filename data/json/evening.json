Though the term is subjective, evening\nis typically understood to begin a few hours before sunset, when temperatures\nbegin to fall, and lasts until just after nightfall, when complete darkness has\nbeen reached. In layman's terms, the evening can range anywhere from four\no'clock to nine.\n\nIn the vernacular of at least parts of the rural Southern United States (notably\nAppalachia) and in some British dialects, \"evening\" is used to mean \"afternoon\",\nas the main meal of the day, dinner, traditionally has occurred at midday. While\nthe exact meaning of the word in this sense is subject to interpretation,\n\"evening\" in the South usually has been thought of as beginning at about noon\nand extending roughly until sunset or suppertime.<ref></ref> , India]]\n",
