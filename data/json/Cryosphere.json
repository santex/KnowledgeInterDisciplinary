Thus there is a wide\noverlap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere is an integral part of the global\nclimate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its\ninfluence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation,\nhydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these feedback\nprocesses, the cryosphere plays a significant role in global climate and in\nclimate model response to global change.\n","linknr":423,"url":"Cryosphere","recorded":1362267981,"links":42,"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":["http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/science_plan/Ch6.pdf"],"categories":["Arctic geography terminology","Earth sciences","Environment of Antarctica","Forms of water","Hydrology","Structure of the Earth"],"headings":["Structure","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cryosphere_Fuller_Projection.png/300px-Cryosphere_Fuller_Projection.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["precipitation"],"related":["Ancient_Greek","Earth","Water","Solid","Sea_ice","Ice","Snow","Glaciers","Ice_cap","Ice_sheet","Permafrost","Hydrosphere","Global_climate","Feedback","Cloud","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Hydrology","Feedback","Global_climate","Climate_model","Frozen_water","Earth","Snow","Freshwater","Ice","Lakes","Rivers","Sea_ice","Glaciers","Ice_sheets","Permafrost","Arctic","Glaciers","Ice_sheets","East_Antarctica","Antarctica","East_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet","Northern_Hemisphere","Snow","Ice","Climate_research","Atmosphere","Albedo","Latent_heat","Emissivity","Dielectric","Snow","Ice","Radar","Backscatter","Crystal","Microwave","Energy","Solar_radiation","Albedo","Climatologists","Albedo","Shortwave","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Albedo","Albedo","Reflectivity","Cloud_cover","Albedo","Cloud_cover","Solar_radiation","Latitudes","Arctic_Ocean","Albedo","Feedback","Sea-ice","Earth","Irradiance","Solar_radiation","Thermal","Snow","Ice","Thermal","Air","Diffusivity","Snow","Ice","Orders_of_magnitude","Air","Hydrological_cycle","Snow","Ice","Latent_heat","Atmosphere","Eurasia","Monsoon","Feedback","United_States","Snow","Feedback","Atmosphere","Global_climate","Ice_sheet","Feedback","Snow","Northern_Hemisphere","Time","Northern_Hemisphere","North_America","Satellite","Northern_Hemisphere","Snow","Northern_Hemisphere","Northern_Hemisphere","Air_temperature","In_situ","Eurasia","North_America","Satellite","Northern_Hemisphere","Climate_change","Snow","Snowpack","Snowpack","Earth","Groundwater","Colorado_River","Snowmelt","Surface_runoff","Ecosystem","Feedback","Soil_moisture","Ocean","Ablation","Sea-ice","Sea_ice","Satellite","Sea-ice","Southern_Hemisphere","Arctic_Ocean","Northern_Hemisphere","Sea_of_Okhotsk","Japan","Satellite","Arctic_sea_ice","Arctic","Sea_ice","Antarctic","Sea_ice","Ice","Rivers","Lakes","Lake","Inflow","Arctic","Radar_imagery","Inflow","Permafrost","Vegetation","Northern_Hemisphere","Active_layer","Hydrologic","Geomorphic","Permafrost","Mackenzie_Valley","Manitoba","Permafrost","Earth","Cape_Thompson","Alaska","Permafrost","Maritime_climate","Prudhoe_Bay","Alaska","Active_layer","Ice_sheet","Glacier","Ice_flow_dynamics","Antarctica","Greenland","Glacier_retreat","Global_climate","Irrigation","Hydropower","Ecosystem","Glacier_mass_balance","Glacier_mass_balance","Antarctic","Ablation","Antarctica","Ocean","Ice_calving","Ice_shelf","Ross_Sea","Greenland_ice_sheet","Antarctic_ice_sheet","West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet","West_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet","Ross_Ice_Shelf","Rutford_Ice_Stream","Ronne-Filchner_shelf","Weddell_Sea","Pine_Island_Glacier","Amundsen_Ice_Shelf","Ross_Ice_Shelf","Ice","Snow","Sea_ice","Glaciers","Ice_cap","Ice_sheet","Permafrost","Active_layer","Hydrosphere","University_of_Washington"]}
