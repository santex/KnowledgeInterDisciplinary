[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=imm.TOC&depth=2\nJaneway's Immunobiology textbook] Searchable free online version at the National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information It deals with the physiological\nfunctioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases;\nmalfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (autoimmune\ndiseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, transplant rejection); the\nphysical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the\nimmune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Immunology has applications in\nseveral disciplines of science, and as such is further divided.\n\nEven before the concept of immunity (from immunis, Latin for \"exempt\") was\ndeveloped, numerous early physicians characterized organs that would later prove\nto be part of the immune system. The key primary lymphoid organs of the immune\nsystem are the thymus and bone marrow, and secondary lymphatic tissues such as\nspleen, tonsils, lymph vessels, lymph nodes, adenoids, and skin and liver. When\nhealth conditions warrant, immune system organs including the thymus, spleen,\nportions of bone marrow, lymph nodes and secondary lymphatic tissues can be\nsurgically excised for examination while patients are still alive.\n\nMany components of the immune system are actually cellular in nature and not\nassociated with any specific organ but rather are embedded or circulating in\nvarious tissues located throughout the body.\n","recorded":1362124010,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"403","instances":["medicine","immunology","medical","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunology|","Subjects taught in medical school"],"headings":["Classical immunology","Clinical immunology","Developmental immunology","Immunotherapy","Diagnostic immunology","Evolutionary immunology","Reproductive immunology","Immunologist","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["immunity","medical"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","anatomy"],["specialty","medicine"],["immunity","medical"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","anatomy"],["specialty","medicine"],["isotype","immunology"],["immunity","medical"],["v(dj_recombination"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monocyte.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Monocyte.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monocyte.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Biomedical_science","Science","Immune_system","Organism","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Physiology","Autoimmune_diseases","Hypersensitivity","Immune_deficiency","Transplant_rejection","In_vitro","In_vivo","Immunity_(medical)","Latin","Thymus","Bone_marrow","Spleen","Tonsil","Lymphatic_system","Lymph_node","Adenoid","Skin","Surgery","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(anatomy)","Epidemiology","Medicine","Pathogen","Pandemic","Athens","Thucydides","Nurse","Innate_immunity","Adaptive_immunity","Humoral_immunity","Cell-mediated_immunity","Antibody","Antigen","Lymphocytes","Disease","Immunodeficiency","Chronic_granulomatous_disease","Autoimmunity","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Hashimoto's_disease","Myasthenia_gravis","Hypersensitivity","Asthma","Allergy","Acquired_Immunodeficiency_Syndrome","Human_Immunodeficiency_Virus","T_cells","Dendritic_cells","Macrophages","Transplant_rejection","Allograft","Neonate","Staphylococcus","Pseudomonas","Complement_cascade","Integrin","Selectin","Cytokine","Immunoglobulin","Passive_immunity","Hormone","Testosterone","Estradiol","Androgen","DHEA","Cancer","Chemotherapy","Medication","Radiotherapy","Electromagnetic_radiation","HIV","Antigen","Extant_species","Evolution","Phagocytosis","Arthropods","Antimicrobial_peptide","Vertebrate","Lymphatic_system","Insect","Arthropod","Chitin","Plant","Pre-eclampsia","Profession","Specialty_(medicine)","Science","Laboratory","Medicine","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Doctor_of_Medicine","Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine","Hospital","Clinic","Academia","Physician","Research_scientist","American_Academy_of_Allergy,_Asthma,_and_Immunology","Research_scientist","Ph.D.","Physicians","Outline_of_immunology","List_of_immunologists","Immunomics","History_of_immunology","Osteoimmunology","BioMed_Central","Open_access_journal"],"members":["specialty","isotype","immunity","tissue","cell"],"book":[]}
