{"cursor":"73136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThis is an incomplete 'list of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] of the [[Parliament\nof the United Kingdom]] for the years 1920â1939'. Note that the first\nparliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and\n1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For Acts passed\nup until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of\nthe Parliament of Scotland. For Acts passed from 1707 to 1800 see List of Acts\nof the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament\nof Ireland.\n\nFor Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom,\nsee the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts\nof the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the\nNational Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of\nNorthern Ireland.\n\nThe number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed\nbefore 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign\nduring which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with\nIreland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th Act passed\nduring the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and\nwhich finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention\nis to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo.\nIII\"). Note also that Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great\nBritain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both\ncited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar\nyear and chapter number.\n","linknr":1777,"url":"List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920–1939","recorded":1375055860,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980%E2%80%931999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_2000%E2%80%93present","/wiki/Delegated_legislation","/wiki/Statutory_Rules_and_Orders","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Rules_and_Orders_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Rules_and_Orders_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Statutory_Instrument_(UK)","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1948","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1949","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1950","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1951","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1952","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1953","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1954","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1955","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1956","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1957","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1958","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1959","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1961","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1962","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1963","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1964","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1965","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1966","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1967","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1968","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1969","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instruments_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1970","/wiki/List_of_Statutory_Instr
