{"cursor":"7993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Glycosylation' (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a\ncarbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other\nfunctional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology\n'glycosylation' refers to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to\nproteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces\none of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and\nproteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational\nmodification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in\nmembrane and secreted proteins. {{Cite book\n| edition = 2nd publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press isbn = 978-0-87969-770-\n| 9 others = Ajit Varki (ed.) title = Essentials of Glycobiology year = 2009\n| author = edited by Ajit Varki ...\n}} The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo\nglycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the\nnon-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in\nthe cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Five classes of glycans\nare produced:\n* N-linked glycans attached to a nitrogen of asparagine or arginine side-chains.\n  N-linked glycosylation requires participation of a special lipid called\n  dolichol phosphate.\n* O-linked glycans attached to the hydroxy oxygen of serine, threonine,\n  tyrosine, hydroxylysine, or hydroxyproline side-chains, or to oxygens on\n  lipids such as ceramide\n* phospho-glycans linked through the phosphate of a phospho-serine; *C-linked\n  glycans, a rare form of glycosylation where a sugar is added to a carbon on a\n  tryptophan side-chain\n* glypiation, which is the addition of a GPI anchor that links proteins to\n  lipids through glycan linkages.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Glycosylation","recorded":1362486554,"links":33,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Posttranslational modification","Organic reactions","Carbohydrates","Carbohydrate chemistry"],"headings":["Purpose","Glycoprotein Diversity","Mechanisms","Types of glycosylation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation","transcription"],"related":["Chemical_glycosylation","Carbohydrate","Glycosyl_donor","Glycosyl_acceptor","Glycans","Glycoprotein","Glycolipid","Glycoside","Biopolymers","DNA","RNA","Proteins","Post-translational_modification","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Enzyme","Glycation","Cytoplasm","Nitrogen","Asparagine","Arginine","Side-chain","Hydroxyl","Oxygen","Serine","Threonine","Tyrosine","Hydroxylysine","Hydroxyproline","Ceramide","Tryptophan","Glypiation","Nitrogen","Asparagine","Immune_system","Lectins","Proteome","Glycosidic_bond","Glycation","Nucleotide_sugar","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_apparatus","Glycosidic_bond","Extracellular_matrix","Eukaryotes","Archaea","Bacteria","Eukaryotes","Golgi_apparatus","Archaea","Bacteria","Xylose","Fucose","Mannose","GlcNAc","Mannose","Tryptophan","Thrombospondins","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","GPI_anchor","Prenylation","Glycorandomization","Glycation","Advanced_glycation_endproduct","Chemical_glycosylation","Fucosylation"]}
