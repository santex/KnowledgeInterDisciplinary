{"cursor":"8116","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Batch reactor' is the generic term for a type of vessel widely used in the\nprocess industries. Its name is something of a misnomer since vessels of this\ntype are used for a variety of process operations such as solids dissolution,\nproduct mixing, chemical reactions, batch distillation, crystallization,\nliquid/liquid extraction and polymerization. In some cases, they are not\nreferred to as reactors but have a name which reflects the role they perform\n(such as crystallizer, or bio reactor).\n\nA typical batch reactor consists of a tank with an agitator and integral\nheating/cooling system. These vessels may vary in size from less than 1 litre\nto more than 15,000 litres. They are usually fabricated in steel, stainless\nsteel, glass lined steel, glass or exotic alloy. Liquids and solids are usually\ncharged via connections in the top cover of the reactor. Vapors and gases also\ndischarge through connections in the top. Liquids are usually discharged out of\nthe bottom.\n\nThe advantages of the batch reactor lie with its versatility. A single vessel\ncan carry out a sequence of different operations without the need to break\ncontainment. This is particularly useful when processing toxic or highly potent\ncompounds.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Batch_reactor","recorded":1362500411,"links":17,"instances":["in_vessel","device","chemistry","process_engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactors"],"headings":["Agitation","Heating and cooling systems","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Batch_reactor_STR.svg/80px-Batch_reactor_STR.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Batch_reactor.2.jpg/180px-Batch_reactor.2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG/180px-Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Coflux_jacket.JPG/180px-Coflux_jacket.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissolution","chemistry"],["mixing","process_engineering"],["agitator","device"],["baffle","in_vessel"]],"members":["baffle","agitator","dissolution","mixing"],"related":["Chemical_reactor","Misnomer","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Mixing_(process_engineering)","Chemical_reaction","Batch_distillation","Crystallization","Polymerization","Chemical_reactor","Bio_reactor","Tank","Agitator_(device)","Steel","Stainless_steel","Glass","Alloy","Liquid","Solid","Gases","Toxic","Potent","Chemical_compound","Driveshaft","Impeller","Anchor","Baffle_(in_vessel)","Energy","Ultrasound","Static_mixer","Heat","Temperature","Heat_exchanger","Heat_pipe","Pharmaceutical","Uniformity","Heat_transfer_coefficient","Continuous_flow_reactor","Velocity","Regulated","Heat_transfer","Welding","Plug_flow","Flux","Crystallization","Chemical_reactor"]}
