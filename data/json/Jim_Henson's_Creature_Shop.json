This led Henson to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to create\na company that would maintain a large team on a permanent basis so that the\nexperience (and interpersonal relationships) would not be lost between each\nproduction.\n\nThe original workshop location was at Elstree Studios, but this was a fairly\ntypical \"production-specific\" setup, used for Labyrinth, at the close of\nproduction, it was decided to move the workshop away from the studios. The\nlocation chosen was on Downshire Hill, Hampstead, London, which was, not\ncoincidentally, the same street that Henson lived on.\n\nThis was in many ways a problematic location - Downshire Hill is full of\nvery expensive houses, and some of the processes used at the creature shop\n(most notably the foam latex and mouldmaking) involved foul-smelling\nchemicals, so the group was under a lot of pressure to change locations.\nThere were also commercial incentives to do so, since the Downshire Hill\nproperty was quite valuable.\n\nThe chosen location had previously been used for the construction of large\npuppets for the film Dragonslayer (although Henson did not actually end up\nmaking the film). This was Oval Road, Camden Town - which was at the time a\nfairly run-down area.\n\nThe Los Angeles Creature Shop was created as an offshoot from the workshop\ncreated for the Dinosaurs television series. It is a large workshop that creates\nseveral special puppet and animatronic creatures and characters for a large\nnumber of other films and series. The company is well known for its more\nelaborate creations, like the aliens in [[Farscape]], but it also does lifelike\nreplications of real animals, especially when unusual animal performances are\nrequired. The company was responsible for the talking animals in Eddie Murphy's\n[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]], and won two Academy Awards for the\nlifelike animals in the film [[Babe (film)|Babe]]. They are also responsible for\nbringing the Ninja Turtles to life in the 1990 live-action film [[Teenage Mutant\nNinja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], and its sequel\n[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]] as well as creating\nthe costumes for the hit show [[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]] and making the\n\"Milky\" character in the Blur music video \"Coffee & TV\".\n\nSince The Jim Henson Company sold off the rights to The Muppets brand to Disney\nin 2004, the Muppet Workshop in New York is now credited as Jim Henson's\nCreature Shop.\n\nDespite assumptions to the contrary, Jim Henson's Creature Shop was not\nresponsible for any of the non-human characters in the [[Star Wars]] series. The\nStar Wars creatures were created in-house by Stuart Freeborn in England and at\nIndustrial Light & Magic, George Lucas' special effects shop. Jim Henson and his\nteam, regardless were consultants for the Yoda puppets. Henson and\nLucas did collaborate on the 1980s cult classic [[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]].\n\nThe company is based out of Hollywood, California, United States and previously\nCamden Town in London, United Kingdom where they still maintain some facilities.\n\nIn 2009, the workshop provided the animatronic suits and creature designs for\nthe film ''Where the Wild Things Are''.
