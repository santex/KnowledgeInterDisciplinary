Often, they are solids that contain crystallographic\n point defects, such as interstitial atoms and vacancies, which result in excess\n or deficiency of an element, respectively. Since solids are overall\n electrically neutral, the defect in an ionic compound is compensated by a\n change in the charge of other atoms in the solid, either by changing their\n oxidation state, or by replacing them with atoms of different elements with a\n different charge.\n\nNonstoichiometry is pervasive for transition metal oxides, especially when the\nmetal is not in its highest oxidation state. . pp. 642-644 For\nexample, although wÃ¼stite (ferrous oxide) has an ideal (stoichiometric) formula\nFeO, the actual stoichiometry is closer to Fe 0.95 O. The non-\nstoichiometry occurs because of the ease of oxidation of Fe 2+ to\nFe 3+ effectively replacing a small portion of Fe 2+ with\ntwo thirds their number of Fe 3+ . Thus for every three \"missing\"\nFe 2+ ions, the crystal contains two Fe 3+ ions to balance\nthe charge. The composition of a non-stoichiometric compound usually varies in a\ncontinuous manner over a narrow range. Thus, the formula for wÃ¼stite is written\nas Fe 1-x O, where x is a small number (0.05 in the previous example)\nrepresenting the deviation from the \"ideal\" formula. Nonstoichiometry\nis especially important in solid, three-dimensional polymers that can tolerate\nmistakes. To some extent, entropy drives all solids to be non-stoichiometric.\nBut for practical purposes, the term describes materials where the non-\nstoichiometry is measurable, usually at least 1% of the ideal composition.\n\nNon-stoichiometric compounds are also known as berthollides (as opposed to the\nstoichiometric compounds or daltonides). The names come from Claude Louis\nBerthollet and John Dalton, respectively, who in the 19th century advocated\nrival theories of the composition of substances. Although Dalton \"won\" for the\nmost part, it was later recognized that the law of definite proportions did have\nimportant exceptions.\n\nHowever, transition metal oxides are not the only examples of deviations from\nstoichiometry. It is expected to be a general feature of crystalline compounds.\nSome examples are provided by eighty binary systems which form a single,\nessentially ordered, crystalline compound near fifty atomic percent in which the\ndeviation from stoichiometry(a strict 50 at% composition)are important, clearly\nevident, but, with the exception of SnTe(c), are well below one atomic percent.\nThe temperature-atom fraction phase diagrams of these systems show what appears\nto be a line compound at 50 at% with the normal resolution used on the\ncomposition axis. These are N:(8-N) compounds such as I-VIIs(e.g. NaCl,\nKCl,etc.), the II-VIs(CdSe,CdTe), IIB-VIs(PbS,PbSe,PbTe), and II-\nVs(GaAs,InAs,GaSb). At high temperatures, but below the compound melting point\nthe AB(c) compound is in equilibrium with either an A-rich or B-rich liquid and\na gas phase. In either case, at equilibrium the chemical potential of A must be\nthe same in all three phases and similarly for element B. The difference in the\nchemical potential of say element B for the liquid phase in equilibrium with\nAB(c)at a given temperature would not appear to be remarkable because of the\nsignificant difference in composition of the liquids. It appears striking for\nAB(c) because of the narrow homogeneity range of AB(c). The partial pressures of\ndiatomic selenium and of tellurium have been determined for a number of\nselenides and tellurides by measuring the UV-VIS absorption of the gas phase.\nThe arsenic pressure over a number of arsenides has been measured also. The\nresults are usually shown on a log pressure-reciprocal temperature plot and show\na parabola-like three phase curve ending at the melting point on the high\ntemperature side. Along this curve AB(c), liquid, and gas phase coexist.\nSufficiently below the AB(c) melting point this loop is typically a few decades\nwide in pressure. Many of the compounds from the II-VI, IIB-VI, and II-V\ncompounds are semiconductors whose electrical properties are significantly\naffected by the deviations from stoichiometry. The A-saturated compound is\nusually n-type indicating an excess of element A through the incorporation of\nvacant sites in the B sublattice or A atoms in interstitial sites acting as\ndonors in the electronic energy band structure. Similarly the B saturated AB(c)\nis B rich and p-type through the incorporation of vacant sites in the A\nsublattice or B atoms in interstitial sites acting as acceptors. Control of the\nelectrical properties requires not only control of the concentration of foreign\natoms but also control of the deviation from stoichiometry through equilibration\nwith vapor phase.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Non-stoichiometric_compound","recorded":1362374920,"links":21,"instances":["mineralogy","structure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solid-state chemistry","Inorganic chemistry","Non-stoichiometric compounds"],"headings":["Defects vs non-stoichiometry","Examples","Applications","Non-stoichiometry vs. inhomogeneity","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Defecttypes.png/350px-Defecttypes.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Magnet_4.jpg/220px-Magnet_4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_oxide"],["perovskite","structure"],["endmember","mineralogy"]],"members":["endmember","perovskite"],"related":["Chemical_compound","Chemical_element","Natural_number","Law_of_definite_proportions","Solid","Crystallographic_defect","Ionic_compound","Transition_metal_oxides","Oxidation_state","Wüstite","Iron(II)_oxide","Stoichiometric","Claude_Louis_Berthollet","John_Dalton","Perovskite_(structure)","High-temperature_superconductor","Solid_state_chemistry","Ceramic","Superconductor","Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide","High-temperature_superconductor","Pyrrhotite","Endmember_(mineralogy)","Polytypes","Monoclinic","Hexagonal_crystal_system","Palladium_hydride","Coordination_polymer","Prussian_blue","Caesium","Thallium","Hydrocarbon","Oxygen","Catalysis","Hydrogenation","Hydrodesulfurization","F-Center"]}
