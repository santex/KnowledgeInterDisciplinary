Articles specify\nthe grammatical definiteness of the noun, in some languages extending to volume\nor numerical scope. The articles in the English language are the and a/an, and\n(in some contexts) some. 'An' and 'a' are modern forms of the Old English 'an',\nwhich in Anglian dialects was the number 'one' (compare 'on', in Saxon dialects)\nand survived into Modern Scots as the number 'ane'. Both 'on' (respelled 'one'\nby the Normans) and 'an' survived into Modern English, with 'one' used as the\nnumber and 'an' ('a', before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an\nindefinite article.\n\nTraditionally in English, an article is usually considered to be a type of\nadjective. In some languages, articles are a special part of speech, which\ncannot easily be combined with other parts of speech. It is also possible for\narticles to be part of another part of speech category such as a determiner, an\nEnglish part of speech category that combines articles and demonstratives (such\nas 'this' and 'that').\n\nIn languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is\nexpressed with a certain definiteness (e.g., definite or indefinite), just as\nmany languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number (e.g.,\nsingular or plural). Every noun must be accompanied by the article, if any,\ncorresponding to its definiteness, and the lack of an article (considered a\n[[zero article]]) itself specifies a certain definiteness. This is in contrast\nto other adjectives and determiners, which are typically optional. This\nobligatory nature of articles makes them among the most common words in many\nlanguagesâin English, for example, the most frequent word is the. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm |title=The 500 Most Commonly\nUsed Words in the English Language |author=World English |accessdate=2007-01-14\n| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070113103028/http://www.world-\n| english.org/english500.htm| archivedate= 13 January 2007 |\n| deadurl= no}}\n","linknr":449,"url":"Article_(grammar)","recorded":1362576004,"links":63,"instances":["letter","grammar","grammar","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parts of speech"],"headings":["Types","Variation among languages","Evolution","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/EuropeArticleLanguages.png/300px-EuropeArticleLanguages.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["determiner","linguistics"],["determiner","linguistics"],["determiner","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["thorn","letter"]],"members":["thorn","object","subject","determiner"],"related":["List_of_glossing_abbreviations","Word","Prefix","Suffix","Noun","Definiteness","English_language","Adjective","Determiner_(linguistics)","Common_noun","Definiteness","Grammatical_number","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_number","Grammatical_case","Proper_name","Personal_name","Portuguese_language","Spanish_language","German_language","Brown_Corpus","Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen_Corpus","Mass_noun","French_language","Italian_language","Determiner_(linguistics)","Haida_language","Determiner_(linguistics)","X-bar_theory","Grammatical_number","Mass_noun","Indo-European_languages","Semitic_languages","Indonesian_language","Japanese_language","Hindi","Russian_language","Indo-European_languages","Proto-Indo-European_language","Latin","Sanskrit","Slavic_languages","Bulgarian_language","Macedonian_language","Baltic_languages","Ancient_Greek","Greek_language","Modern_Greek","Homeric_Greek","French_language","Italian_language","Mass_noun","Colognian_language","Macedonian_language","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_number","Grammatical_case","Topic–comment","Arabic_language","Hebrew_language","Greek_language","English_articles","German_articles","Dutch_language","Berber_languages","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","French_articles","Italian_language","Hungarian_Language","Albanian_language","Bengali_language","Romanian_language","Vowel","Icelandic_language","Persian_language","Norwegian_language","Swedish_language","Bulgarian_language","Subject_(grammar)","Object_(grammar)","Macedonian_language","Latvian_language","Joseph_Greenberg","Demonstrative","Romance_languages","Latin","English_language","Middle_English","Old_English_language","Grammatical_gender","That","Ye_Olde","Thorn_(letter)","Macedonian_language","Colognian_language","Romance_languages","Latin","Vulgar_Latin","English_language","Juncture_loss","Persian_language","English_articles","Al-","Definiteness","Definite_description"]}
