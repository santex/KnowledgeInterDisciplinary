{"cursor":"2400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n seminar]] In North American English, 'faculty' is the academic staff of a\n university: senior teachers, lecturers, and/or researchers. The term is most\n commonly used in this context in the United States and Canada, and generally\n includes professors of various rank: assistant professors, associate\n professors, and (full) professors, usually tenured (or tenure-track) in terms\n of their contract of employment.\n\nMembers of university administration (e.g., department chairs, deans, vice\npresidents, presidents, and librarians) are often also faculty members, in many\ncases beginning (and remaining) as professors. In some universities, the\ndistinction between 'academic faculty' and 'administrative faculty' is made\nexplicit by the former being contracted for nine months per year, meaning that\nthey can be absent from the campus during the summer vacation, while the latter\nare contracted for twelve months per year. These two types of faculty status are\nsometimes known as 'nine month faculty' and 'twelve month faculty'.\n\nMost university faculty members hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate degree.\nSome professionals or instructors from other institutions who are associated\nwith a particular university (e.g., by teaching some courses or supervising\ngraduate students) but do not hold professorships may be appointed as\nadjunct faculty.\n\nOther than universities, some community colleges and secondary or primary\nschools use the terms faculty and professor to describe their instructors, but\nthis does not hold the same status as a professor in a university. Other\ninstitutions (e.g., teaching hospitals) may likewise use the term faculty.\n\nIn North America, faculty is a distinct category from staff, although members\nof both groups are employees of the institution in question. This is distinct\nfrom, for example, the British usage, in which all employees of the institution\nare staff either on academic or professional (i.e. non-academic) contracts. In\nother countries, where English is not spoken, the term \"faculty\" may not be\nused at all.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Faculty_(academic_staff)","recorded":1374549104,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Faculty.panel.during.a.fee.seminar.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Faculty.panel.during.a.fee.seminar.jpg/220px-Faculty.panel.during.a.fee.seminar.jpg","/wiki/File:Faculty.panel.during.a.fee.seminar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Foundation_for_Economic_Education","/wiki/Seminar","/wiki/North_American_English","/wiki/Teacher","/wiki/Lecturer","/wiki/Researcher","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Professor","/wiki/Tenure","/wiki/Dean_(education)","/wiki/Librarian","/wiki/Ph.D.","/wiki/Doctorate","/wiki/Academic_degree","/wiki/Professionals","/wiki/Graduate_students","/wiki/Community_college","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Primary_education","/wiki/Hospitals","/wiki/Employee","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&oldid=565354371","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Academia","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Faculty+%28academic+staff%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Faculty+%28academic+staff%29","/wiki/Faculty_(academic_staff)","/wiki/Talk:Faculty_(academic_staff)","#","/wiki/Faculty_(academic_staff)","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Faculty_(academic_staff)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Faculty_(academic_staff)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&oldid=565354371","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5428874","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Faculty_%28academic_staff%29&id=565354371","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Faculty+%28academic+staff%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Faculty+%28academic+staff%29&oldid=565354371&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Faculty_(academic_staff)&printable=yes","//fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%A6%D8%AA_%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5428874#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(academic_staff)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lan
