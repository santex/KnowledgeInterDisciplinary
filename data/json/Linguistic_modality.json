{"cursor":"14002","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn linguistics, 'modality' is what allows speakers to attach expressions of\nbelief, attitude and obligation to statements. In standard formal approaches to\nmodality, an utterance expressing modality can always roughly be paraphrased to\nfit the following template:\n\n:(1) According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] it is [necessary,\n:    possible] that [the main proposition] is the case.\n\nThe set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the 'modal\nbase'. The result of the evaluation is called the 'modal force'. For example the\nutterance in (2) expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it\nis necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income:\n\n:(2) John must be earning a lot of money.\n\nThe modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is\nnecessity. By contrast, (3) could be paraphrased as âGiven his abilities, the\nstrength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with\nhis teethâ. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the\nmodal force is possibility.\n\n:(3) John can open a beer bottle with his teeth.\n\nA more elaborate account of formal semantic approaches to modality is given in\nsection 1.\n\nCross-linguistically, modality can be expressed by a variety of means, such as\nauxiliary verbs as in the examples (2) and (3), verbal morphology (mood) or\nadverbs. An overview of the various modal expressions across languages is given\nbelow in section 2.\n\nTypological approaches to modality usually favour a slightly wider definition of\nmodality and also include meanings which do not fit the template in (1) exactly.\nSection 3 provides an overview over the range of meanings commonly associated\nwith modality.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Linguistic_modality","recorded":1362892427,"links":28,"instances":["grammar","semiotics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semantics","Grammatical moods|{{PAGENAME}}","Modality"],"headings":["Semantic accounts","Ways of expressing modality","Modal Categories","See also","References","External links","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subject","grammar"],["modality","semiotics"]],"members":["subject","modality"],"related":["Linguistics","Auxiliary_verbs","Grammatical_mood","Linguistic_typology","Modal_logic","Grammatical_mood","Subjunctive_mood","Conditional_mood","Indicative_mood","French_language","Grammatical_person","Grammatical_number","Subject_(grammar)","Manam_language","Morpheme","Auxiliary_verb","Germanic_languages","Verb","Lexical","Adverb","Realis_mood","Declarative_mood","Evidential_mood","Irrealis_mood","Conditional_mood","Subjunctive_mood","If_clause","Pluperfect","Deontic_modality","Deontic_logic","Epistemology","Evidentiality","Modality_(semiotics)","Modal_logic","Tense–aspect–mood"]}
