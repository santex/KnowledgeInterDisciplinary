[http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Paracelsus-Dose-\nToxicologyOct01.htm Paracelsus Dose Response in the Handbook of Pesticide\nToxicology WILLIAM C KRIEGER / Academic Press Oct01 ] He is credited with the classic toxicology maxim, \"Alle Dinge sind Gift\nund nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.\"\nwhich translates as, \"All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only\nthe dose makes a thing not a poison.\" This is often condensed to: \"The dose\nmakes the poison\" or in Latin \"Sola dosis facit venenum\".\n\nThe relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high\nsignificance in toxicology. The chief criterion regarding the toxicity of a\nchemical is the dose, i.e. the amount of exposure to the substance. All\nsubstances are toxic under the right conditions. The term refers to the dose of\na toxic substance that kills 50 percent of a test population (typically rats or\nother surrogates when the test concerns human toxicity).\n\nThe conventional relationship (more exposure equals higher risk) has been\nchallenged in the study of endocrine disruptors. Toxicity is species-specific,\nlending cross-species analysis problematic. Newer methods are available to\nbypass animal-testing.  {{Cite web |date = 8 September 2011\n| title = Existing Non-animal Alternatives publisher = url = http://alttox.org/ttrc/existing-\n| alternatives/\n}}\n","linknr":287,"url":"Toxicology","recorded":1362510296,"links":65,"instances":["toxicology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Toxicology|"],"headings":["Basic traditional toxicology","Dose response complexities","Toxicologist duties","Toxicology starting pay","Requirements for a toxicologist","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Mathieu_Joseph_Bonaventure_Orfila.jpg/220px-Mathieu_Joseph_Bonaventure_Orfila.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["automatism","toxicology"]],"members":["automatism"],"related":["Greek_language","Biology","Chemistry","Medicine","Chemical","Poison","Dioscorides","Nero","Ibn_Wahshiya","Mathieu_Orfila","Jean_Stas","Hippolyte_Visart_de_Bocarmé","Nicotine","Drug_Test_Anal","Paracelsus","Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus","Rat","Endocrine_disruptor","Aquatic_toxicology","Automatism_(toxicology)","Certain_safety_factor","Children's_Environmental_Exposure_Research_Study","Ecotoxicology","Entomotoxicology","Environmental_toxicology","Enzyme_inhibitor","Forensic_toxicology","In_vitro_toxicology","Indicative_limit_value","Overdose","Pollution","Toxicity","Toxicogenomics"]}
