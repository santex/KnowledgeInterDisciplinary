The school sponsors 32\nvarsity sports (16 men's, 16 women's), most of which compete in the Division III\nNew England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC). The school's men's and\nwomen's ski teams and men's and women's squash team compete at the Division I\nlevel. The Ephs' nickname (which rhymes with \"chiefs\") is a shortening of the\nname of Ephraim Williams, the college's founder. The Ephs' mascot is a purple\ncow, and their colors are purple and gold. The\nschool's athletic director is Lisa Melendy.\n\nWilliams, along with fellow NESCAC members Amherst and Wesleyan, is part of the\nLittle Three rivalry, one of the oldest continually contested rivalries in\ncollege athletics. The rivalry dates\nto 1899, when the three schools formed the Triangular League of athletic\ncompetition. Today, the three schools contest in each sport the Little Three\nchampionship, in which the program with the best head-to-head record of the\nthree is awarded the Little Three title for its respective sport. Williams's rivalry with Amherst is particularly fierce, dating\nback to 1821, when then-Williams president Zephaniah Swift Moore abandoned\nWilliams to found Amherst College. The football game played between the two is known as the\n\"Biggest Little Game in America\" and hosted College GameDay in 2007.\n\nWilliams has had success in winning the NACDA Director's Cup, an award presented\nannually to the most successful athletic program in each division of the NCAA.\nSince 1996, the year of the award's inception, Williams has won the Directors'\nCup 15 out of 17 years, as of the end of the 2011â12 season (1996, 1997, 1999,\n2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011). For eight consecutive year from 2004â2011,\nthe college held a dual #1 ranking in both athletics and academics, winning the\nDirectors' Cup and placing first in the [[U.S. News and World Report]] liberal\narts college rankings each year. Alumni of the college's\nathletic program have achieved the following individual distinctions: two Nobel\nPrize winners, 20 Olympians, 18 Rhodes Scholars, four Marshall Scholars, and 16\nFulbright Scholars.\n","linknr":1628,"url":"Williams_Ephs","recorded":1363415347,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/New_England_Small_College_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/NCAA","/wiki/Division_III_(NCAA)","/wiki/Williamstown,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/Weston_Field_(Williamstown)","/wiki/Purple_Cow","http://williams.prestosports.com","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/Williamstown,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Division_III_(NCAA)","/wiki/New_England_Small_College_Athletic_Conference","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Ephraim_Williams","/wiki/Purple_cow","/wiki/Purple","/wiki/Gold_(color)","#cite_note-numprograms-1","/wiki/Athletic_director","#cite_note-melendy-2","/wiki/Amherst_Lord_Jeffs","/wiki/Wesleyan_Cardinals","/wiki/Little_Three","#cite_note-csal3-3","#cite_note-acl3-4","#cite_note-will3-5","/wiki/Zephaniah_Swift_Moore","#cite_note-awhist-6","#cite_note-laxrivalry-7","/wiki/College_GameDay_(football)","#cite_note-biggestlittle-8","/wiki/NACDA_Director%27s_Cup","#cite_note-dc1-9","#cite_note-dc2-10","/wiki/U.S._News_and_World_Report","#cite_note-dual1-11","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/Olympic_Games","/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship","/wiki/Marshall_Scholarship","/wiki/Fulbright_Program","#cite_note-distinction-12","#History","#National_championships","#Teams","#Men.27s","#Baseball","#Basketball","#Crew","#Cross_country","#Football","#Golf","#Ice_hockey","#Indoor_track_.26_field","#Lacrosse","#Outdoor_track_.26_field","#Skiing","#Soccer","#Squash","#Swimming_.26_diving","#Tennis","#Wrestling","#Women.27s","#Basketball_2","#Crew_2","#Cross_country_2","#Field_hockey","#Golf_2","#Ice_hockey_2","#Indoor_track_.26_field_2","#Lacrosse_2","#Outdoor_track_.26_field_2","#Skiing_2","#Soccer_2","#Softball","#Squash_2","#Swimming_.26_diving_2","#Tennis_2","#Volleyball","#Facilities","#Weston_Field","#Chandler_Gymnasium","#Lansing_Chapman_Rink","#Cole_Field","#Bobby_Coombs_Field","#Renzie_Lamb_Field","#Williams_Softball_Complex","#Taconic_Golf_Club","#Torrence_M._Hunt_Tennis_Center","#Samuelson-Muir_Pool","#Simon_Squash_Center","#Lasell_Gymnasium","#Tony_Plansky_Track","#Towne_Field_House","#Traditions","#Mascot","#.22Yard_by_Yard.22","#The_Walk","#Notable_alumni","#References","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wahconah_Park","/wiki/Pittsfield,_Massachusetts","#cite_note-firstbaseball-13","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Amherst_College","/wiki/Tufts_University","/wiki/Wesleyan_University","#cite_note-foundingncaa-14","/wiki/Coeducational","#cite_note-womenssports-15","#cite_note-soft-16","#cite_note-wih-17","#cite_note-wgolf-18","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-noncaas-19","#cite_note-noftblplayoff-20","#cite_note-noncaas-19","#cite_note-nescacnatlchamps-21","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Lake_Onota","/wiki/Weston_Field_(Williamstown)","/wiki/Taconic_Golf_Club","/wiki/Jiminy_Peak_(ski_area)","/wiki/Prospect_Mountain_(Vermont)","#cite_note-facildir-22","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-facildir-22","#cite_note-baseballcoach-23","#cite_note-baseballaa-24","#cite_note-bsbvsamh-25","#cite_note-bsbvswes-26","#cite_note-firstbaseball-13","/wiki/Artie_Clarke","/wiki/Edward_M._Lewis","/wiki/Jack_Mills_(baseball)","/wiki/Bill_Otis","/wiki/Iron_Davis","/wiki/Mark_Filley","/wiki/Henry_Clarke_(baseball)","/wiki/Alex_Burr","/wiki/Charlie_Perkins_(baseball)","#cite_note-mlb-27","#cite_note-baseball-28","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-mbskcoach-29","#cite_note-facildir-22","#cite_note-mbskhomestreak-30","#cite_note-mbskaa-31","#cite_note-mbsk-32","#cite_note-mbskvsamh-33","#cite_note-mbskvswes-34","#cite_note-mbsk-32","#cite_note-mbskatt-35","#cite_note-mbsk-32","/w/index.php?title=Williams_Ephs&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-mcrewcoach-36","/wiki/Lake_Onota","/wiki/Pittsfield,_Massachusetts","#cite_note-facildir-22","/wiki/World_War_II","#cite_note-mcrewhist-37","/wiki/Summer_Olympics","#cite_
