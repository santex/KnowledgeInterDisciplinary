The company develops\nhydraulic analysis software specialized for piping system design based mainly on\nthe Darcy-Weisbach equation, and centrifugal pump selection using the pump\naffinity rules. Industries served by these segments includes: aerospace and\ndefense, chemical processing, engineering design and consulting, food and\nbeverage, oil and petrochemical, mining and metals, pharmaceutical, power\ngeneration, pulp and paper, wastewater collection and treatment and education.\nIts business segments are software including SAAS, industrial training,\npublications and technical support.\n\nThe company was one of the leading manufacturers of Windows and Web-based pump\nselection software products, until that division was split in 2002, and now\noperates as the brand PUMP-FLO Solutions.\n\nThe company is best known to the consumer public as the manufacturer of PIPE-FLO\nsoftware. Their PIPE-FLO program has proprietary file extension .pipe and cannot\nbe opened in any other programs including the viewer type program which uses a\n.psv extension.\n\nIn 2008, Engineered Software, Inc. expanded their engineering products to\ninclude training courses and publications, sold under the brand name Fluid\nFundamentals Training.\n\nIn 2006, Engineered Software, Inc. entered a four year agreement with Crane\nValve North America (Now known as the Crane Company) to publish their Technical\nPaper Number 410 (TP410). Crane agreed to allow Engineered Software to provide\nthe Flow of Fluids Premium software in the Crane manual.\n\nCrane Fluid Handling later partnered with Engineered Software on a rewrite of\ntheir Crane TP410 in 2009 and the company still holds the only contract with\nCrane Fluid Handling to market, sell and produce the guide for the Crane Co.\nunder the Flow of Fluids brand.\n\nIn 2007 the company became a member of the educational non-profit, Pump Systems\nMatterâ¢.\n\nEngineered Software's CEO, Ray Hardee, P.E., was recognized in 2008 by the\nHydraulic Institute (HI) for contributions on the Hydraulic Institute/Pump\nSystems Matter committee, which led to publication of âOptimizing Pumping\nSystems Guidebookâ (OPS).\n\nThe company's CEO was also a member of the committee that wrote the standard\nASME EA-2-2009 Energy Assessment for Pumping Systems. He is the author of Piping\nSystem Fundamentals: The Complete Guide to Gaining a Clear Picture of Your\nPiping System.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Engineered_Software_Inc.","recorded":1375065993,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Types_of_business_entity","/wiki/Private_company","/wiki/Computer_software","/wiki/IT_Consulting","/wiki/Publishing","/wiki/Lacey,_Washington","http://www.eng-software.com/","/wiki/Software_publisher","/wiki/Lacey,_Washington","/wiki/Darcy-Weisbach_equation","/wiki/Centrifugal_pump","/wiki/Affinity_laws","/wiki/Software_as_a_service","#cite_note-bare_url-1","#cite_note-bare_url_a-2","/wiki/List_of_chemical_process_simulators","/wiki/File_extension","/wiki/List_of_file_formats_(alphabetical)","#cite_note-bare_url_b-3","#cite_note-tenlinks-4","/wiki/Crane_Company","#cite_note-esmagazine-5","#cite_note-craneenergy-6","#cite_note-plantservices-7","/wiki/Professional_Engineer","#cite_note-tenlinks_a-8","#cite_note-bare_url_c-9","/wiki/ASME","#cite_note-plantengineering-10","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-bare_url_1-0","http://pumpselector.info/magazine/news_en/doc3928x.asp","#cite_ref-bare_url_a_2-0","http://business.highbeam.com/436407/article-1G1-81598217/pumpflo-solutions","#cite_ref-bare_url_b_3-0","http://filext.com/file-extension/PIPE","#cite_ref-tenlinks_4-0","http://www.tenlinks.com/news/PR/engineered_software/072408_pump_training.htm","#cite_ref-esmagazine_5-0","http://www.esmagazine.com/articles/engineered-software-inc-and-crane-valve-north-america-enter-into-four-year-agreement","#cite_ref-craneenergy_6-0","http://www.craneenergy.com/energy/news/crane-fluid-handling-prepares-new-metric-si-units-tp-410","#cite_ref-plantservices_7-0","http://www.plantservices.com/industrynews/2007/054.html","#cite_ref-tenlinks_a_8-0","http://www.tenlinks.com/news/PR/engineered_software/050509_ray_hardee.htm","#cite_ref-bare_url_c_9-0","http://reliabilityweb.com/index.php/maintenance_news/ray_hardee_p.e._ceo_of_engineered_software_recognized_by_the_hydraulic_inst/","#cite_ref-plantengineering_10-0","http://www.plantengineering.com/search/search-single-display/how-not-to-install-a-high-efficiency-motor/af22eb7dc5.html","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=edit&section=2","http://www.eng-software.com","http://www.pumps.org/workarea/platforms/asp/CompanyInfo.asp?ID=795","http://pump-flo.com/","http://www.flowoffluids.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&oldid=529319461","/wiki/Help:Categories","/w/index.php?title=Category:Software_publisher&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Category:Piping","/wiki/Category:Lacey,_Washington","/wiki/Category:Hydraulic_engineering","/wiki/Category:Cloud_computing_providers","/w/index.php?title=Category:CAD&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Category:CAE&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Engineered+Software+Inc.&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Engineered+Software+Inc.","/wiki/Engineered_Software_Inc.","/wiki/Talk:Engineered_Software_Inc.","#","/wiki/Engineered_Software_Inc.","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Engineered_Software_Inc.","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Engineered_Software_Inc.","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&oldid=529319461","/w/index.php?title=Engineered_Software_Inc.&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wi
