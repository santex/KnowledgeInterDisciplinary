He was born in Copenhagen. While very young,\nhe was apprenticed to a pharmacist and worked in Denmark and Germany beginning\nin 1872 until passing his pharmacist's exam in 1879. In 1881, he became\nassistant in the chemistry department at the Carlsberg Laboratory under the\nchemist Johan Kjeldahl. Johannsen studied the metabolism of dormancy and\ngermination in seeds, tubers and buds. He showed that dormancy could be broken\nby various anesthetic compounds, such as diethyl ether and chloroform. In 1892,\nhe was appointed lecturer at Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and\nlater became professor of botany and plant physiology. He taught plant\nphysiology. Warming, Eug. & W.

German edn 1907-09:\nLehrbuch der allgemeinen Botanik (from the 4th edn, by E. P. Meinecke). Berlin,\nBorntraeger. 667 pp. His most well-known research concerned so-called pure\nlines of the self-fertile common bean. He was able to show that even in\npopulations homozygous for all traits, i.e. without genetic variation, seed size\nfollowed a normal distribution. This was attributable to resource provision to\nthe mother plant and to the position of seeds in pods and of pods on the plant.\nThis led him to coin the terms [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]].\n\nHis findings led him to oppose contemporary Darwinists, most notably Francis\nGalton and Karl Pearson, who held the occurrence of normal distributed trait\nvariation in populations as proof of gradual genetic variation on which\nselection could act.

This term was coined in\nopposition to the then common pangene that stemmed from Darwin's theory of\npangenesis. The book became one of the founding texts of genetics. Also in 1905,\nJohannsen was appointed professor of plant physiology at the University of\nCopenhagen, becoming vice-chancellor in 1917. In December 1910, Johannsen was\ninvited to give an address before the American Society of Naturalists. This talk\nwas printed in the American Naturalist.
