These groups have in\ncommon a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other\nedible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is most frequently used to mean the edible bivalves of the\nmarine family Mytilidae, most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal\nzone, attached by means of their strong byssal threads (\"beard\") to a firm\nsubstrate. A few species (in the genus [[Bathymodiolus]]) have colonised\nhydrothermal vents associated with deep ocean ridges.\n\nIn most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped\nor asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish,\nor brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous.\n\nThe word \"mussel\" is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the\nfreshwater pearl mussels. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds,\nrivers, creeks, canals, grouped in a different subclass, despite some very\nsuperficial similarities in appearance.\n\nFreshwater Zebra mussels and their relatives in the family Dreissenidae are\nnot related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many\nMytilus species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces\nin a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the Heterodonta,\nthe taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to\nas \"clams\".\n","linknr":612,"url":"Mussel","recorded":1362511218,"links":53,"instances":["food","mollusc","biology","alcoholic_beverage","zoology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Belgian
