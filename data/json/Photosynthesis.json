Dark blue and green indicate regions of high\n photosynthetic activity in ocean and land respectively.]] 'Photosynthesis' is a\n process used by plants and other organisms to convert the light energy captured\n from the sun into chemical energy that can be used to fuel the organism's\n activities. Carbon dioxide and water are used by plants to synthesize\n carbohydrates such as sugars, hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek [photo-\n ], \"light,\" and [synthesis], \"putting together\". Oxygen is also released,\n mostly as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform\n the process of photosynthesis. These photosynthetic organisms are called\n [[photoautotroph]]s because they can feed themselves on their own\n photosynthetic products. On the other hand, archaea, animals, and fungi do not\n photosynthesize. Photosynthesis is responsible for maintaining normal levels of\n atmospheric oxygen, is the source of carbon within organic compounds in the\n bodies of all organisms and also the source of energy for nearly all life on\n Earth, the exception being chemoautotrophs which\n live near deep sea vents.\n\nAlthough photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the\nprocess always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called\nreaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these\nproteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most abundant\nin leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane. The\nabsorbed light energy triggers sets of cyclic and non-cyclic light-dependant\nreactions. In the non-cyclic (Z-scheme) reactions, some energy is used to strip\nelectrons from suitable substances such as water, producing oxygen and hydrogen\nions through photolysis. These electrons and hydrogen ions are transferred to a\ncompound called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), reducing it\nto NADPH. In both cyclic and non-cyclic reactions, more light energy is\ntransferred to chemical energy in the generation of adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nThe light-independent reactions produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide. These\nreactions require the electrons of NADPH and the chemical energy of ATP, both of\nwhich were produced by the light-dependant reactions. In plants, algae and\ncyanobacteria, the production of sugars is done by a sequence of reactions\ncalled the Calvin cycle, but some bacteria use different sets of reactions, such\nas the reverse Krebs cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is\nincorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose\nbisphosphate (RuBP), through a process called carbon fixation. The resulting compounds are then reduced by NADPH into triose\nphosphate. Of every six triose phosphate molecules produced, one is removed to\nform further carbohydrates, and five are used to regenerate the carbon dioxide\nacceptor, RuBP, thus completing the reaction cycle.\n\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved about , early in the\nevolutionary history of life, when all forms of life on Earth were\nmicroorganisms and the atmosphere contained much higher concentrations of carbon\ndioxide than in the last half billion years or so. The earliest photosynthetic\norgans probably used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as\nsources of electrons, rather than water.\nCyanobacteria appeared later, around ; the excess oxygen that they produced\ndrastically changed life on Earth when its concentration began to dominate the\nchemistry of the atmosphere. This began to happen about .\n\nThis new oxygen-rich atmosphere rendered the evolution of complex life possible,\nbeginning with organisms like protists. Eventually, no later than a billion\nyears ago, some of these protists formed a symbiotic relationship with\ncyanobacteria, producing the ancestor of photosynthetic plants and algae. The chloroplasts in modern plants are the descendants\nof these ancient symbiotic cyanobacteria. Today,\nthe average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately\n130 terawatts, which is\nabout six times larger than the current power consumption of human\ncivilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around\n100â115 thousand million metric tons (i.e., 100â115 petagrams) of carbon\ninto biomass per year.\n","linknr":1278,"url":"Photosynthesis","recorded":1362511750,"links":142,"instances":["scientist","biology","ecology","phylum","plant_biochemist","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agronomy","Biological
