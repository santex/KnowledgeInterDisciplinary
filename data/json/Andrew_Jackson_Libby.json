{"cursor":"3558","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Andrew Jackson \"[[Slide rule|Slipstick]]\" Libby' is a fictional character\nfeatured in the so-called \"Future History\" series of science fiction novels by\nRobert A. Heinlein. He is an enormously talented and intuitive mathematician,\nbut received little formal education. His talent was first appreciated in the\nshort story Misfit, where he helps guide an asteroid into the correct orbit\nafter the guidance computer has failed.\n\nIn [[Methuselah's Children]], it is revealed that later, Libby joins the\nmilitary, and discovers he is part of the Howard Families, an experiment\ndesigned to breed humans with very long lifespans. When the Howards are forced\nto flee Earth by persecution from the short-lived rest of humanity, Libby\nprovides a way of escape by fitting a \"light-pressure\" drive to the New\nFrontiers, the starship they have stolen. When the New Frontiers is later\nhijacked by alien technology and moved at speeds faster than light, Libby\nfigures out how to reproduce the effect.\n\nWhen the Howards return home, Libby and Lazarus Long go into business together\nexploring and colonizing new planets. (Long will later comment that the two of\nthem are single-handedly responsible for the deterioration of Earth, as the\ngalactic diaspora they created caused all the best brains to leave the planet.)\n\nSome time between the events of Methuselah's Children and [[Time Enough for\nLove]], Libby dies. Long places Libby's body in orbit around the last planet\nthey pioneer, intending to return and take it back to Earth for disposal in the\nOzark Mountains, where Libby grew up. When Long returns for the body, however,\nit is not there. This information is revealed by Long in conversations during\nthe first half of Time Enough for Love.\n\nBetween the first and second half of the book, Long experiments with time-\ntravel, and one of his first test runs was to retrieve the coffin from a point\nin the past, thus explaining its disappearance. However, rather than dispose of\nthe body, Long and his family decide to resurrect Libby, extracting his memory\nand personality and injecting it into a host body. However, during the\nresurrection process, they discover that Libby's chromosomes are both male and\nfemale, and they give him the choice of what gender he wished to be. He chooses\nfemale, and becomes \"Elizabeth Andrew Jackson Libby Long.\", or Libby for short.\n\nLibby appears again in [[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of\nthe Beast]].\n","linknr":102,"url":"Andrew_Jackson_Libby","recorded":1375083423,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Slide_rule","/wiki/Fictional_character","/wiki/Future_History","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Novel","/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein","/wiki/Misfit_(short_story)","/wiki/Methuselah%27s_Children","/wiki/Howard_Families","/wiki/Lazarus_Long","/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love","/wiki/Ozark_Mountains","/wiki/Chromosomes","/wiki/Klinefelter%27s_syndrome","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_(novel)","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Variable_Star","/wiki/Spider_Robinson","/wiki/If_This_Goes_On%E2%80%94","/wiki/Delos_D._Harriman","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&oldid=498976391","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Fictional_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:Robert_A._Heinlein_characters","/wiki/Category:Characters_in_written_science_fiction","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Andrew+Jackson+Libby&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Andrew+Jackson+Libby","/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Libby","/wiki/Talk:Andrew_Jackson_Libby","#","/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Libby","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Andrew_Jackson_Libby","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Andrew_Jackson_Libby","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&oldid=498976391","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4757467","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&id=498976391","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Andrew+Jackson+Libby","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Andrew+Jackson+Libby&oldid=498976391&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Jackson_Libby&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4757467#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Libby","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["short_story"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fictional
