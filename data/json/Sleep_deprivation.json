{"cursor":"58288","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sleep deprivation' is the condition of not having enough sleep; it can be\neither chronic or acute. A chronic sleep-restricted state can cause fatigue,\ndaytime sleepiness, clumsiness and weight loss or weight gain. It adversely affects the brain and cognitive\nfunction. Few studies have compared the effects of\nacute total sleep deprivation and chronic partial sleep restriction. Complete absence of sleep over long periods is impossible for\nhumans to achieve (unless they suffer from fatal familial insomnia); brief\nmicrosleeps cannot be avoided. Long-term total sleep deprivation has\ncaused death in lab animals.\n","linknr":915,"url":"Sleep_deprivation","recorded":1362373647,"links":48,"instances":["record_holder","mood","medicine","psychology","medical","sleep_deprivation","medicine","medicine","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.decp.org/pdfs/nystagmus.pdf","http://www.decp.org/pdfs/nystagmus.pdf","http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf","http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf","http://www.sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Drowsy%20Driving-Key%20Messages%20and%20Talking%20Points.pdf","http://www.sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Drowsy%20Driving-Key%20Messages%20and%20Talking%20Points.pdf","http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/Sleep.pdf","http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/Sleep.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/SleepDeprivation.pdf","http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/SleepDeprivation.pdf"],"categories":["Nursing
