Warden is a graduate of the United States Air Force\nAcademy. His Air Force career spanned 30 years, from 1965 to 1995, and included\ntours in Vietnam, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Korea, as well as many assignments\nwithin the continental United States. Warden completed a number of assignments\nin the Pentagon, was a Special Assistant for Policy Studies and National\nSecurity Affairs to the Vice President of the United States, and was Commandant\nof the Air Command and Staff College.\n\nJohn Warden has been called \"the leading air power theorist in the U.S. Air\nForce in the second half of the twentieth century\". He\nhas also been called \"one of the most creative airmen of our times. John Warden\nis not just a creative airman; he is one of America's premier strategic\nthinkers\".\n\n\"Warden's career was marked with brilliance and controversy, and to this day his\nname inspires both warm affection and cold contempt in the defense\nestablishment. He was, and still is a controversial and influential figure in\nthe defense establishment in general, and the U.S. Air Force in particular\".\n\nHis impact on the future of air power in the United States Air Force is still\nbeing assessed, but \"several distinguished military historians, officers, and\nother experts have concluded that Warden defined the very terms of reference for\nthe 1991 Desert Storm military strategy and thereby introduced a new approach to\nthe conduct of war\". {{Citation |author=Gordon, Michael R. |coauthor= General Bernard E.\nTrainor |title=The Generals War: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf\n|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|location=New York\n|year=1995}} {{Citation|journal=U.S. News and World Report\n|title=Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported History of the Persian Gulf Wa\n|publisher= Random House |location=New York |year=1992}}\n","linknr":301,"url":"John_A._Warden_III","recorded":1362476964,"links":17,"instances":["united_states","usaf_officer","united_states","united_states","general","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1943 births","Living people","American military personnel of the Vietnam War","American military personnel of the Gulf War","National War College alumni","People from McKinney, Texas","Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States)","Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)","Recipients of the Legion of Merit","United States Air Force Academy alumni","United States Air Force officers","Recipients of the Air Medal","Recipients of the Defense Superior Service Medal"],"headings":["Personal background","Early military career","The Pentagon","Mid-career","Back at the Pentagon","Checkmate and the First Gulf War","Late career","Legacy","Books and articles by John Warden","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/John_Warden_Commandant_ASCS_1994.jpg/220px-John_Warden_Commandant_ASCS_1994.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/USAF_F-16A_F-15C_F-15E_Desert_Storm_edit2.jpg/220px-USAF_F-16A_F-15C_F-15E_Desert_Storm_edit2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/John_Warden_and_Gulf_War_I_Checkmate_Planning_Group.jpg/220px-John_Warden_and_Gulf_War_I_Checkmate_Planning_Group.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Seal_of_the_US_Air_Force.svg/28px-Seal_of_the_US_Air_Force.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colonel","united_states"],["distinguished_flying_cross","united_states"],["uss_pueblo","ager-2"],["billy_mitchell","general"],["michael_dugan","usaf_officer"],["air_staff","united_states"],["national_security_advisor","united_states"],["billy_mitchell","general"]],"members":["national_security_advisor","michael_dugan","uss_pueblo","distinguished_flying_cross","air_staff","billy_mitchell","colonel"],"related":["McKinney,_TX","United_States","United_States_Air_Force","Colonel_(United_States)","Air_Command_and_Staff_College","36th_Wing","Vietnam_War","Operation_Desert_Storm","Air_Force_Distinguished_Service_Medal","Defense_Superior_Service_Medal","Legion_of_Merit","Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)","Air_Medal","Montgomery,_Alabama","United_States_Air_Force","United_States_Air_Force_Academy","The_Pentagon","Air_Command_and_Staff_College","Gulf_War","Strategy","McKinney,_Texas","Bachelor_of_Science","Texas_Tech_University","Grand_Strategy","United_States_Military_Academy","J.F.C._Fuller","F4_Phantom_II","South_Korea","USS_Pueblo_(AGER-2)","Vietnam_War","South_Vietnam","OV-10_Bronco","Forward_Air_Control","Rules_of_engagement","Colin_Powell","Powell_Doctrine","National_Clandestine_Service","Middle_East","Gulf_War","Billy_Mitchell_(general)","General_Officer","Eglin_Air_Force_Base","Moody_Air_Force_Base","525th_Fighter_Squadron","36th_Wing","AirLand_Battle","Donald_Rice","Michael_Dugan_(USAF_officer)","AirLand_Battle","Persian_Gulf","Operation_El_Dorado_Canyon","Libya","Muammar_al-Gaddafi","Kuwait","Air_Staff_(United_States)","Colin_Powell","Gulf_War","Norman_Schwarzkopf,_Jr","David_Halberstam","Operation_Instant_Thunder","World_War_II","Donald_B._Rice","National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)","Vice_President_of_the_United_States","Dan_Quayle","Six_Sigma","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Muir_S._Fairchild","Gulf_War_Air_Power_Survey","Robert_A._Pape","Edward_N._Luttwak","Giulio_Douhet","Hugh_Trenchard,_1st_Viscount_Trenchard","Billy_Mitchell_(general)","Warden's_Five_Rings","McKinney,_TX"]}
