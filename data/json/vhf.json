These names were standardized\nby the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and extended to higher\nfrequency ranges.\n\nCommon uses for VHF are FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, land\nmobile stations (emergency, business, private use and military), long range data\ncommunication up to several tens of kilometres with radio modems, amateur radio\nand marine communications.
