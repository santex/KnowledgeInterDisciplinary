The thick,\ntransparent exudate varies in color from light gold to dark brown, depending\non the ratio of resin to essential oil. Copaiba is used in making varnishes\nand lacquers.\n\nThe hydrocarbons in copaiba are terpenes, which are made by plants from\nisoprene, a \"five-carbon-atom building block, so they always contain carbon\natoms in multiples of five. Pinene is one of several useful 10-carbon terpenes.\nIt is commonly known as turpentine. Heated up, terpenes break down into methanol\n(CH 3OH) and other simple compounds useful for fuel and as raw\nmaterials in the chemical industry.\" {{cite web\n | url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF3/358.html publisher=Science\n | Forum author=Don Button title=Diesel Trees accessdate=2006-10-14\n}}\n\nCopaiba is also a common name for several species of trees of the legume family\nnative to Tropical Africa and North and South America.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Copaiba","recorded":1362481514,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vegetable oils","Biodiesel feedstock sources"],"headings":["Uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Copaicaaclimacao.JPG/220px-Copaicaaclimacao.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/CopaibaOleoresin.png/220px-CopaibaOleoresin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/CopaibaEssentialOil.png/220px-CopaibaEssentialOil.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Sunflowerseed_oil.jpg/33px-Sunflowerseed_oil.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Brazil","Oleoresin","Genus","Exudate","Resin","Essential_oil","Lacquer","Hydrocarbon","Terpene","Isoprene","Pinene","Turpentine","Methanol","Biodiesel","Sydney_Morning_Herald","Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation","Medicinal_properties","Kiln"]}
