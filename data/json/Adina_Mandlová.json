{"cursor":"4972","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Adina MandlovÃ¡' (28 January 1910, MladÃ¡ Boleslav â 16 June 1991 PÅÃ­bram,\nCzechoslovakia) was a Czech actress, sex-symbol of the 1930s and European\nmovie star.\n\nThe most controversial, dominating a lot of scandals, drinking alcohol,\nundertaking love affairs and then almost lynched... Adina MandlovÃ¡ is a legend.\nAccording to one source, her true first name was Jarmila, but she had more\nfront names and later she chose Adina, probably because it was chosen by her\nfather for his favorit child. She was born in MladÃ¡ Boleslav and after her\nfather died when adina was only 7 years old, grew in an unstable family with.\nAfter changing several schools and she eventually became a model girl. Her film\ncareer started in 1932 thanks to a second-rate movie DÄvÄÃ¡tko, neÅÃ­kej ne!\n(Girl, don't say no!), where she performed...a model girl. Later she attracted\nHugo Haas, who began to keep close company with her and (later moved together\nas partners) and recommended her to respected directors like VÃ¡vra or FriÄ. By\nthe way, at that time she refused a role in MachatÃ½'s scandalous movie ExtÃ¡ze\n(Extasis, 1933), which was probably her life's fault, because the performer of\nthe title role, [Hedy Kiesler, later succeeded in Hollywood as Hedy Lamarre.\nHowever, during a short time MandlovÃ¡ became an unofficial Number One among\nCzech actresses. The top of her career was [[KristiÃ¡n]] (1939). I can also name\nPanenstvÃ­ (Virginhood, 1937), [[Mravnost nade vÅ¡e]] (Morality Above All, 1937),\nPÅÃ­telkynÄ pana ministra (A girlfriend of the minister, 1940), TÄÅ¾kÃ½ Å¾ivot\ndobrodruha (A hard life of an adventurer, 1941), NoÄnÃ­ motÃ½l (The Night\nButterfly, 1941) etc. During the WW II MandlovÃ¡ led a wild life and rumours\nabout her scandals caused a growing aversion against her. For example, there\nwas a rumour that she was a mistress of the German protector K. H. Frank (which\nwas not true, and Frank disliked her because of it.). She was also invited to\nGermany, where Goebbels promised her big career, under condition that she chose\na better pseudonym. Indeed, in 1943 MandlovÃ¡ co-starred with German actor Heinz\nRÃ¼hmann in the movie, \"Ich vertraue dir meine Frau an,\" using the screen name\nof Lil Adina. However, her stay in Berlin soon ended due to Frank's intrigues.\nAfter the end of the war it showed that popular \"rumours\" concerning her\nalleged contacts with Nazis were malicious fabrications and she actually helped\nher former boyfriend, who had escaped from a concentration camp. However, the\npublic demand for her punishment was stronger than facts. In May 1945 she was\narrested and according to her own memoirs, one warder, who was her big fan,\nsaved her from lynching in the front of the prison. (That she can really thank\nhim a lot can be illustrated by the fact that director Jan SvitÃ¡k, an alleged\nNazi quisling, was then lynched and subsequently shot death in a Prague\nstreet.) Then she was strongly persecuted and eventually married British pilot\nJoe Knight, which enabled her to emigrate to the Great Britain (1947). Here she\ntried to continue in her film career, but with changeable success. In 1948 she\nacted in a movie The Fool And The Princess, but that was practically\neverything, because soon after she was taken ill with tuberculosis and healed\nin Switzerland. Her marriage crashed and MandlovÃ¡ was forced to earn money by\ndifferent ways, among other things as a collaborator of a costume designer Ben\nPearson, whom she later married. In the end, she lived in Malta together with\nher husband. Here she also wrote a bitter biography Dnes se tomu smÄju (Today I\nAm Laughing Over It, 1976). In 1991, she returned home after 45 years. Here the\n\"old, sick and impatient lady\" came to die. Despite the negative picture\nsurrounding her figure, she was an excellent actress.\n\nMost important roles\n\n* Å½ivot je pes â Eva DurdysovÃ¡\n* Holka nebo kluk? â Ada BÃ¡rtÅ¯\n* Cech panen KutnohorskÃ½ch â Rozina\n* Kristian â Zuzana RendlovÃ¡\n* KouzelnÃ½ dÅ¯m â Marie UngrovÃ¡\n* PÅÃ­telkynÄ pana ministra â Julie SvobodovÃ¡\n* Pacientka dr.
