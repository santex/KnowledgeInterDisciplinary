{"cursor":"139346","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Apartheid' (; from Afrikaans \"the status of being apart\") was a\nsystem of racial segregation enforced through legislation by the National Party\ngovernments, who were the ruling party from 1948 to 1994, of South Africa, under\nwhich the rights of the majority black inhabitants of South Africa were\ncurtailed and white supremacy and Afrikaner minority rule was maintained.\nApartheid was developed after World War II by the Afrikaner-dominated National\nParty and Broederbond organisations and was practised also in South West Africa,\nwhich was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate\n(revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145 ), until it gained\nindependence as Namibia in 1990.\n\nRacial segregation in South Africa began in colonial times under Dutch and British\nrule. However, apartheid as an official policy was introduced following the\ngeneral election of 1948. New legislation classified inhabitants into four\nracial groups (\"native\", \"white\", \"coloured\", and \"Asian\"), Baldwin-Ragaven,\nLaurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999).

Non-white political representation was completely\nabolished in 1970, and starting in that year black people were deprived of their\ncitizenship, legally becoming citizens of one of ten tribally based self-\ngoverning homelands called [[bantustan]]s, four of which became nominally\nindependent states. The government segregated education, medical care, beaches,\nand other public services, and provided black people with services inferior to\nthose of white people.\n\nApartheid sparked significant internal resistance and violence as well as a long\narms and trade embargo against South Africa. Since\nthe 1950s, a series of popular uprisings and protests were met with the banning\nof opposition and imprisoning of anti-apartheid leaders. As unrest spread and\nbecame more effective and militarised, state organisations responded with\nrepression and violence.\n\nReforms to apartheid in the 1980s failed to quell the mounting opposition, and\nin 1990 President Frederik Willem de Klerk began negotiations to end\napartheid, {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/storie-\ns/february/2/newsid_2524000/2524997.stm |title=De Klerk dismantles apartheid in\nSouth Africa |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 February 2009\n| date=2 February 1990| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090215004142/h-\n| ttp://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/2/newsid_2524000/252-\n| 4997.stm| archivedate= 15 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}\n| culminating in multi-racial democratic elections in 1994, which were won by\n| the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela.
