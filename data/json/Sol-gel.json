{"cursor":"35771","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'sol-gel' process is a wet-chemical technique widely used in the fields of\nmaterials science and ceramic engineering. Such methods are used primarily for\nthe fabrication of materials (typically metal oxides) starting from a colloidal\nsolution (sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of\neither discrete particles or network polymers. Typical precursors are metal\nalkoxides and metal salts (such as chlorides, nitrates and acetates), which\nundergo various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions.\n","linknr":558,"url":"Sol-gel","recorded":1362509924,"links":33,"instances":["materials_science","colloid","chemistry","chemistry","physics","optics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Industrial processes","Gels","Thin film deposition","Glass chemistry","Glass coating and surface modification","Transparent materials","Ceramic engineering","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Introduction","Particles and polymers","Polymerization","Sono-Ormosil","Nanomaterials","Applications","Mechanics of gelation","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Sol-gel_silicate_bonds.svg/300px-Sol-gel_silicate_bonds.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precursor","chemistry"],["substrate","materials_science"],["sol","colloid"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["critical_point","chemistry"],["lens","optics"],["elasticity","physics"]],"members":["substrate","sol","critical_point","precursor","elasticity","lens","precipitation"],"related":["Materials_science","Ceramic_engineering","Manufacturing","Materials","Metal_oxide","Colloid","Polymer","Precursor_(chemistry)","Metal","Alkoxide","Chloride","Nitrate","Acetate","Hydrolysis","Step-growth_polymerization","Liquid","Solid","Colloid","Sedimentation","Centrifugation","Phase_separation","Shrinkage","Porosity","Microstructure","Sintering","Grain_growth","Precursor","Substrate_(materials_science)","Dip_coating","Spin_coating","Casting","Ceramic","Glass","Mineral_wool","Artificial_membrane","Aerogel","Microsphere","Nanoparticle","Rare_earth_element","Ceramics_processing","Investment_casting","Thin_film","Oxide","Optics","Electronics","Energy","Space","Sensors","Medicine","Sustained_release_dosage_forms","Reactive_material","Chromatography","Tetraethyl_orthosilicate","Silicon_dioxide","Albert_Einstein","Dissertation","Brownian_motion","Opal","Flocculation","Sol_(colloid)","Gel","Amorphous","Fiberglass","Thermal_insulation","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Hydroxyl","Acetic_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Siloxane","Polymerization","Macromolecule","Monomer","Ligand","Ormosil","Density","Van_der_Waals_forces","Solvent","Crack_propagation","Journal_of_Materials_Science","Monodisperse","Colloidal_crystal","Polycrystalline","Toughness","Electrophoresis","Inkjet","Viscosity","Optical_fiber","Refractory_ceramic","Glass","Biomedical","Agrochemical","Herbicide","Abrasives","Zeolite","Biomolecule","Biosensor","Protein","Small_molecule","Glycerol","Polyethylene_glycol","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Nanofiltration","Pervaporation","Reverse_osmosis","Critical_point_(chemistry)","Radioactive","Uranium_dioxide","Thorium_dioxide","Nuclear_fuel","Optical","Hot_mirror","Cold_mirror","Lens_(optics)","Beam_splitter","Light_scattering","Transparent_material","Dynamic_Light_Scattering","Gel","Phase_transition","Polymer","Liquid","Osmotic_pressure","Hydrogen_ions","Elasticity_(physics)","Solvent","Cambridge_University"]}
