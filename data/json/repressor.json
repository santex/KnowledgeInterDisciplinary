''Top''': The gene is\nessentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the\nrepressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding\nto the promoter and making lactase. 'Bottom': The gene is turned on. Lactose is\ninhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter,\nand express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will\ndigest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The\nrepressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.]]\n\n\n\nIn molecular genetics, a 'repressor' is a DNA- or RNA-binding protein that\ninhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator. A DNA-\nbinding repressor blocks the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus\npreventing transcription of the genes into messenger RNA. An RNA-binding\nrepressor binds to the mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA into protein.\nThis blocking of expression is called 'repression'.\n",
