{"cursor":"31520","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n fighting the English navy at the Battle of Gravelines in 1588]] A 'navy' (or\n 'maritime force') is a fleet of waterborne military vessels (watercraft). It is\n the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and\n amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne\n combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by\n surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as\n ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields; recent\n developments have included space-related operations. The strategic offensive\n role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for\n example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or\n shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate\n seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also\n may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of nuclear missiles. Naval operations\n can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water\n navy) and open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), although the distinction\n is more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division.\n","linknr":568,"url":"Navy","recorded":1362484718,"links":102,"instances":["attack","military","rank","upper_half","rank","ship","naval","ship","naval","armed_forces","ship","1860","1906"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Navies|*"],"headings":["Etymology
