Sinks generally have taps (faucets) that supply\nhot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster\nrinsing. They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself\ninclude a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device.\nSinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser.\n\nWhen a sink becomes stopped-up or clogged, a person will often resort to use a\nchemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will\nattack the clog with a drain auger (often called a \"plumber's snake\").\n","title":"sink","headings":["History","Materials of the sink","Styles","Ceramic basin construction","Accessories","Gallery","See also","References","Bibliography"]},"micro-relation":["2: Plumbing_fixture","2: Terrazzo","2: Wood","2: Welding","1: Kitchen","1: Hands","1: Dishwashing","1: Soap","1: Drain_cleaner","1: Plunger","1: Plumber's_snake","1: Washstand","1: Zinc","1: Stainless_steel","1: Vitreous_enamel_","1: Steel","1: Cast_iron","1: Ceramic","1: Marble","1: Plastic","1: Soapstone","1: Concrete","1: Copper","1: Glass","1: Granite","1: Nickel","1: Trade-off","1: Sheet_metal","1: Noise","1: Spall","1: Thermoplastic","1: Acrylic_glass","1: Frying_pan","1: Countertop","1: Sandpaper","1: Teak","1: Aesthetics","1: Flower","1: Silicone","1: Ergonomics","1: Grinding_machine","1: Weir","1: Public_restroom","1: Drainboard","1: Public_toilet","1: Edinburgh","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Red-figure_pottery","1: Krater","1: Boeotia","1: Dipper_well","1: Domestic_water_system","1: Floor_plan","1: Garbage_disposal","1: Plumbing","1: Proverbial_kitchen_sink"]}
