{"cursor":"17071","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Latin honors' are Latin phrases used to indicate the level of distinction with\nwhich an academic degree was earned. This system is primarily used in the United\nStates, Canada, Philippines, Indonesia and in many countries of continental\nEurope, although some institutions use the English translation of these phrases\nrather than the Latin originals.\n\nGenerally, a college or university's regulations set out definite criteria to be\nmet in order for a student to obtain a given honors distinction. For example the\nstudent might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, to submit\nan honors thesis for evaluation, to be part of an honors program, or to graduate\nearly. Each university sets its own standards, and since these standards may\nvary widely it is possible for the same level of Latin honors conferred by\ndifferent institutions to represent contrasting levels of academic achievement.\n\nThese honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to undergraduates\nearning their bachelor's, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much\nmore rarely to graduate students taking their master's or doctorate degree. The\nhonor is typically indicated on the diploma. Latin honors are often conferred\nupon law school graduates receiving a Juris Doctor or J.D., where they are\ngenerally based upon class rank or grade point average.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Latin_honors","recorded":1362581920,"links":31,"instances":["country"],"pdf":["http://www-docs.tu-cottbus.de/fakultaet2/public/ordnungen/promotionsordnung_02.pdf"],"categories":["Academic honours","Qualifications"],"headings":["Types","Use of Latin honors around the world","History of usage in the United States","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["education_in_georgia","country"]],"members":["education_in_georgia"],"related":["Latin","Academic_degree","Undergraduate","Doctorate","Diploma","Juris_Doctor","Class_rank","Grade_point_average","Latin","Education_in_the_United_States","Education_in_Indonesia","Education_in_the_Dominican_Republic","Education_in_Puerto_Rico","Education_in_the_Philippines","British_undergraduate_degree_classification","Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","Tertiary_education_in_Australia","Education_in_Bangladesh","Education_in_Barbados","Education_in_Canada","Education_in_Georgia_(country)","Higher_education_in_Hong_Kong","Education_in_India","Education_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","Education_in_Jamaica","Education_in_Kenya","Education_in_New_Zealand","Education_in_Nigeria","Education_in_Pakistan","Education_in_Singapore","Education_in_Sri_Lanka","Education_in_South_Africa","Education_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago","Malta","Education_in_Austria","Education_in_Belgium","Education_in_Brazil","Instituto_Tecnológico_de_Aeronáutica","Federal_University_of_Rio_de_Janeiro","Education_in_Finland","Matriculation_Examination","Lukio","High_school","Education_in_France","Sciences_Po_Paris","Institut_d'Études_Politiques_de_Paris","Education_in_Germany","Education_in_Hungary","Education_in_Italy","Italian_language","Education_in_the_Netherlands","Education_in_Russia","Education_in_Switzerland","Education_in_the_UK","University_of_Edinburgh","Education_in_Singapore","Harvard_College","Final_honors","Amherst_College","William_Seymour_Tyler","Julius_Hawley_Seelye","Class_rank","Valedictorian","Salutatorian"]}
