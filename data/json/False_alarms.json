{"cursor":"7064","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'false [[alarm]]', also called a 'nuisance alarm', is the fake report of an\nemergency, causing unnecessary panic and/or bringing resources (such as\nemergency services) to a place where they are not needed. False alarms may occur\nwith residential burglary alarms, smoke detectors, industrial alarms, and in\nsignal detection theory. False alarms have the potential to divert emergency\nresponders away from legitimate emergencies, which could ultimately lead to loss\nof life. In some cases, repeated false alarms in a certain area may cause\noccupants to start to ignore all alarms, knowing that each time it will probably\nbe false. The concept of this can be traced at least as far back as Aesop's\nstory of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, where many episodes of a boy falsely yelling\n\"wolf\" caused the townspeople to ignore his cries when a real wolf came.\n","linknr":164,"url":"False_alarms","recorded":1362501648,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf","http://isc.temple.edu/economics/wkpapers/Pubs/FalsePolicy.pdf","http://www.transalt.org/files/newsroom/reports/caralarms/report.pdf","http://www.transalt.org/files/newsroom/reports/caralarms/report.pdf"],"categories":["Change detection","Social psychology"],"headings":["Overview","Types of False Alarms","Examples","Semantics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Aesop","The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf","Industry","Alarm_management","Information","Detection_theory","Constant_false_alarm_rate","Boland_Hall_Fire","Burglar_alarm","Bomb_threat","Culture_of_fear","Emergency_evacuation","False_positive","Fire_alarm","Battle_of_Los_Angeles"]}
