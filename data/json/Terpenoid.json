{"cursor":"6036","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] The 'terpenoids' ( ), sometimes called 'isoprenoids', are a large and diverse\nclass of naturally occurring organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from\nfive-carbon isoprene units assembled and modified in thousands of ways. Most are\nmulticyclic structures that differ from one another not only in functional\ngroups but also in their basic carbon skeletons. These lipids can be found in\nall classes of living things, and are the largest group of natural products.\n\nPlant terpenoids are used extensively for their aromatic qualities. They play a\nrole in traditional herbal remedies and are under investigation for\nantibacterial, antineoplastic, and other pharmaceutical functions. Terpenoids\ncontribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and\nginger, the yellow color in sunflowers, and the red color in\ntomatoes. Well-known terpenoids include citral, menthol, camphor,\nsalvinorin A in the plant [[Salvia divinorum]], the cannabinoids found in\n[[Cannabis]], Ginkgolide and Bilobalide found in [[Ginkgo Biloba]], and the\nCurcuminoids found in tumeric and mustard seed.\n\nThe steroids and sterols in animals are biologically produced from terpenoid\nprecursors. Sometimes terpenoids are added to proteins, e.g., to enhance their\nattachment to the cell membrane; this is known as isoprenylation.\n","linknr":248,"url":"Terpenoid","recorded":1362476995,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Terpenes and terpenoids|"],"headings":["Structure and classification","Biosynthesis","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Isopentenyl_pyrophosphate.svg/250px-Isopentenyl_pyrophosphate.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Sterol_synthesis.svg/350px-Sterol_synthesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compound","Terpene","Isoprene","Functional_group","Lipid","Antibacterial","Antineoplastic","Pharmaceutical","Eucalyptus","Cinnamon","Cloves","Ginger","Sunflowers","Tomatoes","Citral","Menthol","Camphor","Salvinorin_A","Cannabinoid","Ginkgolide","Bilobalide","Curcuminoid","Tumeric","Mustard_seed","Steroid","Sterol","Protein","Cell_membrane","Isoprenylation","Terpene","Hydrocarbon","Isoprene","Methyl_group","Oxygen","Ginkgolide","Triterpenoid","Sterol","Tetraterpenoid","Carotenoid","Polyterpenoid","Dimethylallyl_pyrophosphate","Geranyl_pyrophosphate","Squalene","Metabolic_pathway","HMG-CoA_reductase_pathway","Cholesterol","Cytosol","MEP/DOXP_pathway","Mevalonic_acid","Plastid","Apicomplexa","Bacteria","Pyruvate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","HMB-PP","Isopentenyl_pyrophosphate","Dimethylallyl_pyrophosphate","Isoprene","Carotenoid","Chlorophyll","Plastoquinone","Geranyl_pyrophosphate","Farnesyl_pyrophosphate","Geranylgeranyl_pyrophosphate","Plants","Bacteria","Bacteria","Archaea","Algae","Plant","Animal","Fungi"]}
