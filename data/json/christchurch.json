Zealand, and\nthe country's third-most populous urban area. It lies one third of the way down\nthe South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula which itself, since\n2006, lies within the formal limits of Christchurch.\n\nThe city was named by the Canterbury Association, which settled the surrounding\nprovince of Canterbury. The name of Christchurch was agreed on at the first\nmeeting of the association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by John Robert\nGodley, who had attended Christ Church, Oxford. Some early writers called the\ntown Christ Church, but it was recorded as Christchurch in the minutes of the\nmanagement committee of the association.<ref name=\"HIGHT\">A History of\nCanterbury, Vol. 1 – Sir James Hight & Straubel, C.R.; Canterbury Centennial\nAssociation and Whitcombe and Tombs, Christchurch 1957, Page 121</ref>\nChristchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it\nofficially the oldest established city in New Zealand.\n\nThe river that flows through the centre of the city (its banks now largely\nforming an urban park) was named Avon at the request of the pioneering Deans\nbrothers to commemorate the Scottish Avon, which rises in the Ayrshire hills\nnear what was their grandfathers' farm and flows into the Clyde.<ref\nname=\"HIGHT\"/>\n\nThe usual Māori name for Christchurch is 'Ōtautahi' (\"the place of Tautahi\").\nThis was originally the name of a specific site by the Avon River near present-\nday Kilmore Street and the Christchurch Central Fire Station. The site was a\nseasonal dwelling of Ngāi Tahu chief Te Potiki Tautahi, whose main home was Port\nLevy on Banks Peninsula. The Ōtautahi name was adopted in the 1930s. Prior to\nthat the Ngāi Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as\nKaraitiana,<ref>[http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/tikoukawhenua/otautahi/\nŌtautahi] (from the Christchurch City Library website)</ref> a transliteration\nof the English word Christian. The city's name is often abbreviated by New\nZealanders to 'Chch'.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/business/6890145/Chch-\nready-to-welcome-tourists \"Chch ready...\"], The Southland Times</ref><ref>[http://www.starcanterbury.co.nz/news/students-injured-chch-\nbus-crash/1397446/ \"...injured in Chch bus crash\"], The Star</ref> In New\nZealand Sign Language, the city's name is the fingerspelled letter C (made by\nforming the hand into a C shape) signed twice, with the second to the right of\nthe first, while mouthing \"Christchurch\".<ref></ref>\n","title":"christchurch","headings":["History","Geography","Demographics","Economy","Government","Education","Transport","Culture and entertainment","Sport","Sister
