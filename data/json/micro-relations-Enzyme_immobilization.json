{"cursor":"3341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'immobilized enzyme' is an enzyme that is attached to an inert, insoluble\nmaterial such as calcium alginate (produced by reacting a mixture of sodium\nalginate solution and enzyme solution with calcium chloride). This can provide\nincreased resistance to changes in conditions such as pH or temperature. It also\nallows enzymes to be held in place throughout the reaction, following which they\nare easily separated from the products and may be used again - a far more\nefficient process and so is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed\nreactions. An alternative to enzyme immobilization is whole cell immobilization.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Enzyme_immobilization","recorded":1362673253,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.chiralvision.com/pdf/carrier-bound_enzymes_chiralvision.pdf"],"categories":["Enzymes","Organic chemistry","Stereochemistry"],"headings":["Commercial use","Immobilization of an Enzyme","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Sodium_alginate","PH","Temperature","Enzyme","Catalysed","Whole_cell_immobilization","Protein","Solvation","Solvent","Biocatalyst","Thermal_stability","Chemical_stability","Enzyme","Chemical_reaction","Insoluble","Calcium_alginate","Covalently","Chemical_reaction","Active_site","Ethylene_glycol","Protein_tags"]}
