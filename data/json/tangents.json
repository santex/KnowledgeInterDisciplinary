A similar definition applies to\nspace curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet,\ncalled the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\"\nas the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at\nthat point.\n\nSimilarly, the 'tangent plane' to a surface at a given point is the plane that\n\"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the\nmost fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively\ngeneralized; see Tangent space.\n\nThe word tangent comes from the Latin\n[[wiktionary:en:tangere#Latin|tangere]], to touch.\n","title":"Tangent","headings":["History","Tangent line to a curve","Tangent circles","Surfaces and higher-dimensional manifolds","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Secant_line","2: Infinitesimal","2: Derivative","2: Euclidean_space","2: Surface","2: Tangent_space","2: Singular_point_of_a_curve","2: Distance#Geometry","1: Geometry","1: Curve","1: Straight_line","1: Space_curve","1: Differential_geometry","1: Latin","1: Inflection_point","1: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","1: Pierre_de_Fermat","1: Adequality","1: Circle","1: Parabola","1: Hyperbola","1: Ellipse","1: Cubic_function","1: Triangle","1: Convex_geometry","1: Supporting_hyperplane","1: Calculus","1: René_Descartes","1: Slope","1: Difference_quotient","1: Cauchy","1: Limit_of_a_function","1: Derivative#Definition_via_difference_quotients","1: Power_function","1: Trigonometric_functions","1: Exponential_function","1: Logarithm","1: Algebraic_geometry","1: Absolute_value","1: Contraposition","1: Linear_equation#Point–slope_form","1: Polynomial_division","1: Implicit_and_explicit_functions#Implicit_differentiation","1: Algebraic_curve","1: Homogeneous_coordinate","1: Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity","1: Parametric_equation","1: Limaçon_trisectrix","1: Circles","1: Radii","1: Manifold","1: Newton's_method","1: Osculating_circle","1: Osculating_curve","1: Perpendicular","1: Subtangent","1: Supporting_line","1: Tangent_cone","1: Tangential_angle","1: Tangential_and_normal_components","1: Tangent_lines_to_circles"]}
