{"cursor":"3815","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In physics and philosophy, a relational theory is a framework to understand\nreality or a physical system in such a way that the positions and other\nproperties of objects are only meaningful relative to other objects. In a\nrelational spacetime theory, space does not exist unless there are objects in\nit; nor does time exist without events. The relational view proposes that space\nis contained in objects and that an object represents within itself\nrelationships to other objects. Space can be defined through the relations among\nthe objects that it contains considering their variations through time. The\nalternative spatial theory is an absolute theory in which the space exists\nindependently of any objects that can be immersed in it. . Someone who has\nconstructed a relational theory or promotes relational theorising is called a\n'relationist'.\n\nThe relational point of view was advocated by in physics by Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, Ernst Mach (in his Mach's principle), and it was rejected by Isaac\nNewton in his successful description of classical physics. Although Albert\nEinstein was impressed by Mach's principle, he did not fully incorporate it into\nhis theory of general relativity. Several attempts have been made to formulate a\nfull Machian theory, but most physicists think that none have so far succeeded.\nFor example, see Brans-Dicke theory.\n\nRelational quantum mechanics and a relational approach to quantum physics have\nbeen independently developed, in analogy with Einstein's special relativity of\nspace and time. Relationist physicists such as John Baez and Carlo Rovelli have\ncriticised the leading unified theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, string\ntheory, as retaining absolute space. Some prefer a developing theory of gravity,\nloop quantum gravity for its 'backgroundlessness'.\n\nA recent synthesis of relational theory, called R-theory, Kineman, J. 2011.\n\"Relational Science: A Synthesis\". Axiomathes 21 (3):393-437. continuing\nthe work of the mathematical biologist Robert Rosen [who developed \"Relational\nBiology\" and \"Relational Complexity\" as theories of life ( Rosen, R. 1991.\n\"Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into The Nature, Origin, And Fabrication\nOf Life\". Columbia University Press. New York. ] takes a position between\nthe above views. Rosen's theory differed from other relational views in defining\nfundamental relations in nature (as opposed to merely epistemic relations we\nmight discuss) as information transfers between natural systems and their\norganization (as expressed in models). R-theory extends the idea of\norganizational models to nature generally. As interpreted by R-theory, such\n\"modeling relations\" describe reality in terms of information relations\n(encoding and decoding) between measurable existence (expressed as material\nstates and established by efficient behavior) and implicate organization or\nidentity (expressed as formal potential and established by final exemplar), thus\ncapturing all four of Aristotle's causalities within nature (Aristotle defined\nfinal cause as immanent from outside of nature). Applied to space-time physics,\nit claims that space-time is real but established only in relation to existing\nevents, as a formal cause or model for the location of events relative to each\nother; and in reverse a system of space-time events establishes a template for\nspace-time. R-theory is thus a form of model-dependent realism. It claims to\nmore closely follow the views of Mach, Liebniz, Wheeler and Bohm, suggesting\nthat natural law itself is system-dependent.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Relational_theory","recorded":1363392991,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","/wiki/Ernst_Mach","/wiki/Mach%27s_principle","/wiki/Isaac_Newton","/wiki/Classical_physics","/wiki/Albert_Einstein","/wiki/Theory_of_general_relativity","/wiki/Brans-Dicke_theory","/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics","/wiki/Relational_approach_to_quantum_physics","/wiki/Special_relativity","/wiki/John_Baez","/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli","/wiki/Unified_theory","/wiki/Gravity","/wiki/Quantum_mechanics","/wiki/String_theory","/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Relationism","/wiki/Relationalism","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/File:Science.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","/wiki/Physics","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Physics-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Physics-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Physics-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg/30px-Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg.png","/wiki/Philosophy","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Philo-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Philo-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Philo-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&oldid=540069571","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Philosophy_of_physics","/wiki/Category:Physics_stubs","/wiki/Category:Philosophy_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relational+theory&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relational+theory","/wiki/Relational_theory","/wiki/Talk:Relational_theory","#","/wiki/Relational_theory","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Relational_theory","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Relational_theory","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&oldid=540069571","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Relational_theory&id=540069571","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Relational+theory","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Relational+theory&oldid=540069571&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Relational_theory&printable=yes","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rel%C3%A1ci%C3%B3s_elm%C3%A9let","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Relational
