{"cursor":"6254","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'North Carolina Global TransPark'' (GTP)is a 2,500 acre, multi-modal\nindustrial/airport site in Eastern North Carolina. As an agency of the State of\nNorth Carolina, the GTP is considered a key engine for driving the economy of\nEastern North Carolina. The park offers access to multi-modal transportation\noptions: air, rail, highways, and North Carolina's two international ports. The\nGTP is part of an economic development initiative in eastern North Carolina\nintended to spur transition in the region from an agricultural base to one of\nskilled labor and industrial manufacturing. Industries targeted by the GTP are\naerospace, defense and logistics sectors.\n\nIt is located approximately 30 minutes south of Greenville, North Carolina at\nthe Kinston Regional Jetport (ISO) in Kinston, North Carolina. The airport\nrunway has been extended to 11,500 feet (3,500 m), making it one of the longest\ncommercial runways in the state. The park is centrally located on the mid-\natlantic seaboard and amongst North Carolina's 6 military installments. In May\n1996, the Global TransPark was designated as Foreign Trade Zone 214. The\ndesignation means companies can export and import products through the TransPark\nwithout many of the usual customs restrictions and tariffs. Inspired by the\n1950s Research Triangle Park to the west, GTP's growth has been similarly slow,\nalthough proponents maintain that in time the concept will prove successful.\n\nDesigned to attract industry and bring increased economic opportunities to the\ncitizens of Eastern North Carolina and beyond, the GTP features more than\navailable for shovel ready sites. The park also features an on-site Education &\nTraining Center, now known as the [http://www.nccompositecenter.com/ Spirit\nAerosystems Composite Center of Excellence]. This on-site training facility\noffers classrooms, meeting rooms and composite labs for beginning or advance\ntraining. Workforce development programs are designed by Lenoir Community\nCollege based on each company's specific needs.\n\nSupporters of the Global TransPark point to recent success, such as the decision\nby Spirit AeroSystems of Wichita, Kansas, to locate a manufacturing plant there\nthat will eventually employ more than 1,000 people. In 2008, Spirit said it will\ninvest $570 million in the GTP project over the next six years. Spirit\nmanufactures the center portion of the fuselage of the Airbus A350 Xtra WideBody\nairplane, will became operational in July 2010. State grants totaling about $125\nmillion include a $5 million grant and more than $20 million, payable over 12\nyears, tied to the job creation attracted Spirit to North Carolina and the GTP.\nThe Golden LEAF Foundation, which oversees North Carolina's share of tobacco-\nsettlement money, also approved spending $100 million for Spirit's new building\n500,000 square-foot facility. [http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/-\nstories/2008/05/15/transpark.html A triumph for TransPark ]\n\nIn 2011, Spirit Aerosystems announced that it would be expanding its\noperations at the Global TransPark. The aerospace supplier will establish\nproduction for the Gulfstream 280 wing at its North Carolina facility. The\ncompany anticipates that 150-200 additional jobs will be created at the\nGlobal Transpark over the next 5 years as part of this work package. http://www.news-\nrecord.com/content/2011/07/20/article/aviation_company_to_expand_kinston_p-\nlant\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation has committed to building a rail\nspur, plus several road improvements within the Global TransPark to allow Spirit\nand other tenants to receive, build and ship out aircraft and other industrial\ncomponents. The rail spur will connect Spirit's manufacturing facilities, as\nwell as other sites within the Global TransPark, to the North Carolina\nRailroad's east-west line that runs through the center of Kinston to the Port of\nMorehead City 75 miles east of the GTP. The rail spur is currently being\nconstructed, with final completion expected by January 2012. http://www.kinston.com/articles/north-62788-city-\nrail.html\n\nThe Global TransPark is also home to emergency services. The North Carolina\nForestry Service, Highway Patrol and Emergency Management have established\nfacilities at the TransPark. The GTP is the regional coordinating center\nactivated to counter the destruction of natural disasters such as Hurricane\nFloyd in 1999 and Hurricane Irene in 2011. http://www.enctoday.com/news/perdue-75962-kfpress-state-\nefforts.html\n\nOn several occasions, the Global TransPark has been noted as an up-and-coming\nsite for business development and site selection. [http://www.sb-\nd.com/Features/Winter2009TenTop10sEdition/TenOutstandingLogisticsParksintheSout-\nh/tabid/241/Default.aspx Southern Business & Development] named the GTP one of\nits 10 outstanding logistics parks in the South. Site Selection magazine has\nconsistently chosen North Carolina as the most business friendly state in the\ncountry, and has highlighted the Global TransPark's success in business recruiting.

years\ninclude Mountain Air Cargo, Henley Aviation, Commerce Overseas Corp.,\nLongistics, MJE Telestructure, Delta Private Jets, DB Schenker and Spatial\nIntegrated Systems.
