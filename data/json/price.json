(For commodities, they are expressed as currency per unit weight of\nthe commodity, e.g. euros per kilogram.) Although prices could be quoted as\nquantities of other goods or services this sort of barter exchange is rarely\nseen. Prices are sometimes quoted in terms of vouchers such as trading stamps\nand air miles. In some circumstances, cigarettes have been used as currency, for\nexample in prisons, in times of hyperinflation, and in some places during World\nWar 2. In the black economy, barter is also relatively common.\n\nIn many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices in other ways.\nThe most obvious example is in pricing a loan, when the cost will be expressed\nas the percentage rate of interest. The total amount of interest payable\ndepends upon the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other examples can be\nfound in pricing financial derivatives and other financial assets. For instance\nthe price of inflation-linked government securities in several countries is\nquoted as the actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since the\nsecurity was issued.\n\nPrice sometimes refers to the quantity of payment requested by a seller of goods\nor services, rather than the eventual payment amount. This requested amount is\noften called the asking price or 'selling price', while the actual payment may\nbe called the 'transaction price' or 'traded price'. Likewise, the bid price or\n'buying price' is the quantity of payment offered by a buyer of goods or\nservices, although this meaning is more common in asset or financial markets\nthan in consumer markets.\n\nEconomists sometimes define price more generally as the ratio of the quantities\nof goods that are exchanged for each other.\n","linknr":247,"url":"price","recorded":1362560667,"links":68,"instances":["economics","marketing","economics","economics","logic","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Basic financial concepts","Marketing","Pricing"],"headings":["Price theory","Price and value","Austrian School theory","Price as productive human labour time","Confusion between prices and costs of production","Price point","Other price terms","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["tautology","logic"],["theory_of_value","economics"],["geo","marketing"],["value","economics"]],"members":["good","geo","value","theory_of_value","tautology","service"],"related":["Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Currency","Ask_price","Bid_price","Supply_and_demand","Commodity","Law_of_one_price","Paradox_of_value","Classical_economics","Adam_Smith","Use_value","Marginal_benefit","Marginal_utility","Exchange_value","Relative_price","Carl_Menger","Austrian_School","Oskar_Lange","Capital_controversy","Piero_Sraffa","Tautology_(logic)","Michal_Kalecki","Theory_of_value_(economics)","Socially_necessary","Labour_time","Transformation_problem","Price_point","Dollar_General","General_store","Five_and_dime","Dollar","Dollar_store","Pound_sterling","Euro","Yen","Common_law_of_business_balance","Cost","Factor_price","Free_price_system","Geo_(marketing)","Law_of_value","Marketing","Marketing_mix","Microeconomics","Production,_costs,_and_pricing","Price_system","Price_fixing","Price_trend","Pricing","Real_prices_and_ideal_prices","Resale_price_maintenance","Reservation_price","Suggested_retail_price","Time_based_pricing","Unit_of_account","Variable_pricing","Value_(economics)","Wholesale","Yield_management","Milton_Friedman","George_Stigler","Fernando_Vianello"]}
