{"cursor":"88942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:For alternative meanings, see [[ultraviolet (disambiguation)]]\n\n image of the Sun's corona as seen in extreme ultraviolet (at 17.1 nm) by the\n Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]]\n\n'Ultraviolet' (UV) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength\nshorter than that of visible light, but longer than X-rays, that is, in the\nrange 10 nm to 400 nm, corresponding to photon energies from 3 eV to\n124 eV. It is so-named because the spectrum consists of electromagnetic\nwaves with frequencies higher than those that humans identify as the colour\nviolet. These frequencies are invisible to humans, but visible to a number of\ninsects and birds.\n\nUV light is found in sunlight (where it constitutes about 10% of the energy in\nvacuum) and is emitted by electric arcs and specialized lights such as mercury\nlamps and black lights. It can cause chemical reactions, and causes many\nsubstances to glow or fluoresce. Most ultraviolet is classified as non-ionizing\nradiation. The higher energies of the ultraviolet spectrum from wavelengths\nabout 10 nm to 120 nm ('extreme' ultraviolet) are ionizing, but these\nwavelengths are absorbed by dioxygen and other gases in the air, and thus have\nan extremely short path length through air. However, the entire\nspectrum of ultraviolet radiation has some of the biological features of\nionizing radiation, in doing far more damage to many molecules in biological\nsystems than is accounted for by simple heating effects (an example is sunburn).\nThese properties derive from the ultraviolet photon's power to alter chemical\nbonds in molecules, even without having enough energy to ionize atoms.\n\ns produce UV light, and arc welders must wear eye protection to prevent\nwelder's flash.]]\n\nAlthough ultraviolet radiation is invisible to the human eye, most people are\naware of the effects of UV on the skin, called suntan and sunburn. In addition\nto short wave UV blocked by oxygen, a great deal (>97%) of mid-range ultraviolet\n(almost all UV above 280 nm and most up to 315 nm) is blocked by the\nozone layer, and like ionizing short wave UV, would cause much damage to living\norganisms if it penetrated the atmosphere. Indeed, the existence of the ozone\nlayer is what allows life to exist on land, outside of the deep oceans. After\natmospheric filtering, only about 3% of the total energy of sunlight at the\nzenith is ultraviolet, and this fraction decreases at other sun\nangles. Much of it is near-ultraviolet that does not cause sunburn, but is still\ncapable of causing long term skin damage and cancer. An even smaller fraction of\nultraviolet that reaches the ground is responsible for sunburn and also the\nformation of vitamin D (peak production occurring between 295 and 297 nm)\nin all organisms that make this vitamin (including humans). The UV spectrum thus\nhas many effects, both beneficial and damaging, to human health.\n","linknr":1311,"url":"Ultraviolet_radiation","recorded":1362505568,"links":242,"instances":["chemistry","microbiology","document","anatomy","chemistry","chemistry","optics","element","united_states","element","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ISO_PRF_21348_e.pdf","http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ISO_PRF_21348_e.pdf","http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter3/Ency_Atmos/Radiation_Solar.pdf","http://www.insect-o-cutor.com/ioclibrary/blacklight.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/SP250-3.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/Calibrations/upload/SP250-3.pdf","http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=68291&ProduktNr=224219&Ausgabe=228903&filename=68291.pdf","http://www.euroderm.org/edf/images/stories/guidelines/guideline_Photoaggravated_dermatoses.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227143624/http://www.epa.gov/nerl/news/forum2003/water/ware_poster.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/nerl/news/forum2003/water/ware_poster.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227143624/http://www.epa.gov/nerl/news/forum2003/water/ware_poster.pdf","http://www.bioone.org/archive/0031-8655/76/6/pdf/i0031-8655-76-6-561.pdf","http://www.bioone.org/archive/0031-8655/76/6/pdf/i0031-8655-76-6-561.pdf"],"categories":["Electromagnetic
