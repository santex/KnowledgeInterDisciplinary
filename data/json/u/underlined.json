Single, and occasionally double (\"double-underscore\"),\nunderlining was originally used in hand-written or typewritten documents to\nemphasise text. In a manuscript to be typeset, various forms of underlining were\nconventionally used to indicate that text should be set in a special typeface\nsuch as italics to show emphasis, part of a procedure known as markup. With the\nadvent of word processing, different typefaces can be used in the manuscript\ndirectly, so that underlining is no longer needed for markup; but underlining is\nsometimes used in documents in its own right.\n\nUnderlines are sometimes used as a diacritic, to indicate that a letter has a\ndifferent pronunciation to its non-underlined form.\n","title":"Underline","headings":["Use with computers","Underlines in non-Latin scripts","Manuscripts","See also","Notes"]},"micro-relation":["3: Underscore","2: Typeface","2: Italic_type","2: CSS","2: Pinyin","1: The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language","1: Writing","1: Typewriter","1: Document","1: Manuscript","1: Typeset","1: Markup_language#History","1: Word_processor","1: Diacritic","1: Web_browser","1: Hyperlink","1: HTML_element#Special_inline_elements","1: HTML_element#Presentational_markup","1: Deprecated","1: Markup_language","1: MediaWiki","1: Text_Encoding_Initiative","1: Mediawiki","1: Wikipedia","1: HTML","1: Unicode","1: Combining_diacritic","1: Combining_macron_below","1: Plain-text","1: ASCII","1: E-mail","1: Spell_checker","1: Grammar_checker","1: Chinese_language","1: Proper_name_mark","1: Book_title_mark","1: Small_caps","1: Capital_letters","1: Boldface","1: Overline","1: Strikethrough"]}
