Professional diving (commercial diving, diving for scientific\nresearch purposes or diving for financial gain) takes a range of diving\nactivities to the underwater work site.\n\nTraining, types of equipment used and breathing gases used depend on the type\nof diving.\n\nUnderwater diving includes Free-diving, Scuba diving, Surface-supplied diving,\nSaturation diving, and diving in Atmospheric diving suits.\n\n Image:Apnea monofin.jpg|Freediver with monofin, ascending.\nFile:Buzo.jpg|Recreational scuba diver File:Scuba platform.jpg|Surface supplied\ndiver riding a stage to the underwater workplace.
