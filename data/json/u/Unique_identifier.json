There are\nthree main types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different\ngeneration strategy:\n* serial numbers, assigned incrementally\n* random numbers, selected from a number space much larger than the maximum (or\n  expected) number of objects to be identified. Although not really unique,\n  some identifiers of this type may be appropriate for identifying objects in\n  many practical applications and are, with abuse of language, still referred\n  to as \"unique\"\n* names or codes allocated by choice which are forced to be unique by keeping a\n  central registry such as the EPC Information Services.\n\nThe above methods can be combined, hierarchically or singly, to create other\ngeneration schemes which guarantee uniqueness.\n\nIn many cases, a single object may have more than one unique identifier, each of\nwhich identifies it for a different purpose.\n\nIn relational databases, certain attributes of an entity that serve as unique\nidentifiers are called primary keys.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Unique_identifier","recorded":1362567413,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Names","Universal identifiers"],"headings":["Examples"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Identifier","Serial_number","Random_number_generator","Metadata_registry","EPC_Information_Services","Relational_database","Entity-relationship_model","Primary_key","Electronic_Product_Code","Part_number","Universally_Unique_Identifier","Numbering_scheme","Track_&_Trace","IUPAC_nomenclature","CAS_registry_number","Organizationally_unique_identifier","Globally_unique_identifier","Universally_unique_identifier","Identity_correlation","World_Wide_Port_Name","MAC_address","Harmonized_System","Request_for_Comments","Internet_Standard","Best_Current_Practice","Internet_Draft","Internet_Experiment_Note","Réseaux_Associés_pour_la_Recherche_Européenne","Bates_numbering","Mathematical_Reviews","Zentralblatt_MATH","Systematic_name","Airport_code","Maritime_Mobile_Service_Identity","ISO_6346","UIC_wagon_numbers","Reporting_marks"]}
