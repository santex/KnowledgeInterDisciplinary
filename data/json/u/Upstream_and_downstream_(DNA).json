Each strand of DNA or RNA has a 5' end and a 3'\nend, so named for the carbons on the deoxyribose (or ribose) ring. Relative to\nthe position on the strand, downstream is the region towards the 3' end of the\nstrand. Since DNA strands run in opposite directions, downstream on one strand\nis upstream on the other strand.\n","linknr":84,"url":"Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","recorded":1362538228,"links":13,"instances":["transduction","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology"],"headings":["Examples","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Upstream_and_downstream.svg/600px-Upstream_and_downstream.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["upstream_and_downstream","transduction"]],"members":["upstream_and_downstream","translation","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Genetics","DNA","RNA","5'_end","3'_end","Deoxyribose","Ribose","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Upstream_and_downstream_(transduction)"]}
