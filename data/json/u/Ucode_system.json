Digital\ninformation can be associated with objects and places, and the associated\ninformation can be retrieved by using ucode.\n\nUnique identification system for real world objects is considered an\nessential enabler for the realisation of Internet of Things and therefore ucode\nsystem is seen as a building block for Internet of Things\n\nThe ucode system uses 128 bit code for unique naming of things so there are\n340282366920938463463374607431768211455 or 3,4 x 10^38 different codes. If more\ncodes are needed, they can be added in chunks of 128 bits. Ucode is application\nand technology agnostic. Uniqueness means that each ucode is unique, there can â\nor at least should - not be another ucode with exactly same number. Ucode is not\ntied to any specific application or business domain, neither is it committed to\nany specific technology for containing the ucode number, e.g. RFID, barcode or\nmatrix code. ucode is supported by the uID center, which is a non-profit\norganisation based in Tokyo, Japan. The Chairman of the uID Center is Professor\nKen Sakamura who is also the person behind ucode.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Ucode_system","recorded":1362567414,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/doc/1272985908_internet_things_kk3110323enc.pdf","http://www.eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/doc/1272985908_internet_things_kk3110323enc.pdf"],"categories":["Information systems","Digital technology"],"headings":["Structure and Resolution mechanism","ucode tags","Example","Other identification systems","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Ucode_icon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["IoT","Tokyo","Japan","Sakamura","Domain_Name_System","QR","Near_field_communication","EPCGlobal","RFID","MIT","Universal_Product_Code"]}
