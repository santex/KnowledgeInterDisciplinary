Catheterization allows the patient's urine to drain freely from the\nbladder for collection. It may be used to inject liquids used for treatment or\ndiagnosis of bladder conditions. A clinician, often a nurse, usually performs\nthe procedure, but self-catheterization is also possible. The catheter may be a\npermanent one (indwelling catheter), or an intermittent catheter removed after\neach catheterization.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Urinary_catheterization","recorded":1362511536,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Catheters","Medical treatments","American inventions"],"headings":["Catheter types","Sex differences","Catheter maintenance","Effects of long term use","Combating infection","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Urinary_catheterization_with_a_doll.jpg/230px-Urinary_catheterization_with_a_doll.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Latex","Polyurethane","Silicone","Catheter","Urinary_bladder","Urethra","Urine","Clinician","Nurse","Indwelling_urinary_catheter","Hydrophilic","External_urine_collection_devices","French_catheter_scale","Sediment","Penis","Condom","Urinary_meatus","Povidone-iodine","Genitalia","Obesity","Female_genital_cutting","Childbirth","Anatomy","Urinary_tract_infection","Bladder_spasm","Prostate","Penis","Butylscopolamine","Urinary_retention","Intensive_care_medicine","Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia","Topical_anesthetic","Medical_procedure","Paraphimosis","Vesicoureteral_reflux","Elastomer","Surgery","Urinary_incontinence","Urinary_tract_infection","Sepsis","Urethral_injury","Bladder_stones","Hematuria","Bladder_cancer","Urethra","Prostatic_stent","The_Journal_of_Urology"]}
