{"cursor":"4121","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'United States Munitions List' ('USML') is a list of articles, services, and\nrelated technology designated as defense- and space-related by the United States\nfederal government. This designation is pursuant to sections 38 and 47(7) of the\nArms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2794(7)). These articles fall under\nthe export and temporary import jurisdiction of the Department of State.\n\nThe USML is found in Part 121 of Title 22, Foreign Relations, of the Code of\nFederal Regulations (CFR). The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC)\nadministers the regulations. The USML is amended by rules published in the\n[[Federal Register]]. Further information and clarification whether specific\narticles or services fall under the USML are periodically discussed in\nDefense Trade News published by the State Department's Bureau of Political-\nMilitary Affairs.\n\nAny article, service, or related data found to be on the USML requires an export\nlicense issued by the United States State Department to be exported (given to a\nnon-U.S. person). A \"U.S. person\" is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who\ndoes not work for a foreign company, government, or NGO. Some license exceptions\nare available under specific circumstances.\n\nExports of products not covered by the USML are most likely subject the export\njurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and\nSecurity (BIS). Numerous other Federal Agencies have their own niche export\ncontrol regulations, e.g. DOE, FDA, NNSA, NRC, USDA/APHIS, USFWS, etc.. The\nfirst step in exporting a Commerce Control List (CCL) item under the BIS\nregulations is to identify the Export Control Classification Number\n([http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/do_i_needaneccn.html#qtwo ECCN]).\n","linknr":126,"url":"United_States_Munitions_List","recorded":1362581690,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/documents/official_itar/ITAR_Part_121.pdf"],"categories":["United States Department of Commerce","Military technology","Identifiers","Export and import control","United States federal firearms legislation","United States foreign relations legislation"],"headings":["Categories","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Military","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","Arms_Export_Control_Act","United_States_Code","United_States_Department_of_State","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Bureau_of_Political-Military_Affairs","Export","United_States_nationality_law","United_States_Permanent_Resident_Card","Non-governmental_organization","United_States_Department_of_Commerce","Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security","Export_Control_Classification_Number","Firearm","Shotgun","Gun","Weapon","Ammunition","Launch_vehicle","Guided_missile","Ballistic_missile","Rocket","Torpedo","Bomb","Land_mine","Explosive_material","Energetic_material","Propellant","Incendiary_device","Warship","Tank","List_of_military_vehicles","Aircraft","Military_education_and_training","Electronics","Fire_control","Rangefinder","Toxicology","Chemical_warfare","Biological_agent","Spacecraft","Nuclear_weapon","Nuclear_weapon_design","Nuclear_testing","Classified_information","Directed-energy_weapon","Submersible"]}
