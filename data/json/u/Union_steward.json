Rank-and-file members\nof the union hold this position voluntarily (through democratic election by\nfellow workers or sometimes by appointment of a higher union body) while\nmaintaining their role as an employee of the firm. As a result, the union\nsteward becomes a significant link and conduit of information between the union\nleadership and rank-and-file workers.\n\nThe duties of a union steward vary according to each labor union's\nconstitutional mandate for the position. In general, most union stewards perform\nthe following functions:\n\n*Monitor and enforce the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement\n(labor contract) to ensure both the firm and union worker are not violating the\nterms of the agreement. *Ensure that the firm is in compliance with all federal,\nstate and local laws and regulations. *Represent and defend fellow workers whom\nthe firm believes violated company policy or the terms and conditions of the\ncollective bargaining agreement, often through the grievance process.\n*Communicate and disseminate official union policy, memos and directives to\nworkers in the shop. *Popularize and promote union consciousness and values in\nthe workplace.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Union_steward","recorded":1362669471,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.seiu767.org/WINDEMERE.pdf"],"categories":["Labour relations","Trade unionists","Activists by type"],"headings":["Collective bargaining agreement sample steward clause","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg/28px-Syndicalism.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Trade_union","Rank-and-file","Democracy","Election","Employee","Constitution","Collective_bargaining","Law","Regulation","Grievance"]}
