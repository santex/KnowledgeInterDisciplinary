In other words, there\nexists a real number M such that\n:<math>|f(x)|\\le M</math>\nfor all x in X.\n\nSometimes, if f(x) ≤ A for all x in X, then the function is said to be 'bounded\nabove' by A. On the other hand, if f(x) ≥ B for all x in X, then the function is\nsaid to be 'bounded below' by B.\n\nThe concept should not be confused with that of a bounded operator.\n\nAn important special case is a 'bounded sequence', where X is taken to be the\nset 'N' of natural numbers. Thus a sequence f = (a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>,\na<sub>2</sub>, ...) is bounded if there exists a real number M such that\n:<math>|a_n|\\le M</math>\nfor every natural number n. The set of all bounded sequences, equipped with a\nvector space structure, forms a sequence space.\n\nThis definition can be extended to functions taking values in a metric space Y.\nSuch a function f defined on some set X is called bounded if for some a in Y\nthere exists a real number M such that its distance function d (\"distance\") is\nless than M, i.e.\n\n:<math>d(f(x), a)\\le M</math>\n\nfor all x in X.\n\nIf this is the case, there is also such an M for each other a, by the triangle\ninequality.\n","title":"bounded%20function","headings":["Examples"]},"micro-relation":["2: Continuous_function","1: Mathematics","1: Real_number","1: Complex_number","1: Bounded_set","1: There_exists","1: For_all","1: Bounded_operator","1: Natural_number","1: Sequence","1: Vector_space","1: Sequence_space","1: Metric_space","1: Sine","1: Compact_space","1: Rational_number","1: Irrational_number"]}
