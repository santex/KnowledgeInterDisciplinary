The United Nations projected that half of the world's population\nwould live in urban areas at the end of 2008. By 2050 it is predicted\nthat 64.1% and 85.9% of the developing and developed world respectively will be\nurbanised. http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21564998-cities-are-\nturning-vast-data-factories-open-air-computers\n\nUrbanization is closely linked to modernisation, industrialisation, and the\nsociological process of rationalisation. Urbanisation can describe a specific\ncondition at a set time, i.e. the proportion of total population or area in\ncities or towns, or the term can describe the increase of this proportion over\ntime. So the term urbanisation can represent the level of urban relative to\noverall population, or it can represent the rate at which the urban proportion\nis increasing.\n\nUrbanization is not merely a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and historic\ntransformation of human social roots on a global scale, whereby predominantly\nvillage culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly urban culture. The\nlast major change in settlement patterns was the accumulation of hunter-\ngatherers into villages many thousand years ago. Village culture is\ncharacterised by common bloodlines, intimate relationships, and communal\nbehavior whereas urban culture is characterised by distant bloodlines,\nunfamiliar relations, and competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of\npeople is forecast to continue and intensify in the next few decades,\nmushrooming cities to sizes incomprehensible only a century ago. Indeed, today,\nin Asia the urban agglomerations of Dhaka, Karachi, Mumbai, Delhi, Manila, Seoul\nand Beijing are each already home to over 20 million people, while the Pearl\nRiver Delta, Shanghai-Suzhou and Tokyo are forecast to approach or exceed 40\nmillion people each within the coming decade. Outside Asia, Mexico City, Sao\nPaulo, New York City, Lagos and Cairo are fast approaching or home to over 20\nmillion people already.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Urbanisation","recorded":1362372043,"links":74,"instances":["landscape","city_type","sociology"],"pdf":["http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi-publications/briefing-papers/44-urban-labour-markets-exploitation.pdf","http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi-publications/briefing-papers/44-urban-labour-markets-exploitation.pdf"],"categories":["Urban
