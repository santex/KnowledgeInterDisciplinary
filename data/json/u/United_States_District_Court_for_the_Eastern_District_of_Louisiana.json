La.') is a federal trial court based in New Orleans. Like all\nU.S. district courts, the court has original jurisdiction over civil actions\narising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United\nStates; [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html 28 U.S.C. Â§\n1331] certain civil actions between citizens of different\nstates; [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html 28 U.S.C.

Under\n[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html 28 U.S.C. Â§ 158(a)(1)], for\nexample, the U.S. district courts are authorized to hear appeals from final\njudgments, orders, and decrees of U.S. bankruptcy judges.\n\nAppeals from the Eastern District of Louisiana are taken to the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims\nagainst the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the\nFederal Circuit).\n","linknr":476,"url":"United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana","recorded":1375090220,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:EDLA_map.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/EDLA_map.PNG/160px-EDLA_map.PNG","/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit","/wiki/Sarah_S._Vance","http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/","/wiki/Case_citation","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/United_States_District_Court#Jurisdiction","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit","/wiki/Patent","/wiki/Tucker_Act","/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit","#Jurisdiction","#History","#Current_judges","#Former_judges","#Succession_of_seats","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Assumption_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Jefferson_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Lafourche_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Orleans_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Plaquemines_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/St._Bernard_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/St._Charles_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/St._James_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/St._John_the_Baptist_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/St._Tammany_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Tangipahoa_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Terrebonne_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Washington_Parish,_Louisiana","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Territory_of_Orleans","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Orleans","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Louisiana","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=0738","#cite_note-fjcla-8","#cite_note-S392-9","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Western_District_of_Louisiana","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=003/llsl003.db&recNum=0815","#cite_note-fjcla-8","#cite_note-S392-9","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=005/llsl005.db&recNum=0759","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=009/llsl009.db&recNum=0428","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=0331","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://books.google.com/books?id=ijA3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA507","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Middle_District_of_Louisiana","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/STATUTE-85/STATUTE-85-Pg741/content-detail.html","#cite_note-fjcla-8","/w/index.php?title=United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Louisiana&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Sarah_Vance","/wiki/Senior_status","/wiki/Magistrate#Federal_judicial_system","/wiki/Jim_Letten","/wiki/United_States_Attorney","/wiki/Senior_status","/wiki/Sarah_Vance","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Martin_Leach-Cross_Feldman","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Helen_Berrigan","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Eldon_Fallon","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Ivan_Lemelle","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Carl_Barbier","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Kurt_Engelhardt","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_W._Bush","/wiki/Jay_Zainey","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_W._Bu
