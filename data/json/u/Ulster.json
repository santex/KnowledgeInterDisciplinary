In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths () ruled by a\n[[RÃ­#R.C3.AD_ruirech|rÃ­ ruirech]], or \"king of over-kings\".\n\nThe definition of the province was fluid from early to medieval times. It took\na definitive shape in the reign of King James I of England when all the\ncounties of Ireland were eventually shired. This process of evolving conquest\nthat had been underway since the Norman invasion of Ireland, particularly as\nadvanced by the Cambro-Norman magnates Hugh de Lacy and John de Courcy. Ulster\nwas a central topic role in the treaty in the parliamentary debates that\neventually resulted in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Under the terms of\nthe Act, Ireland was divided into two territories, Southern Ireland and\nNorthern Ireland with the border passing through the province. \"Southern\nIreland\" was to be all of Ireland except for \"the parliamentary counties of\nAntrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary\nboroughs of Belfast and Londonderry\" which were to constitute \"Northern\nIreland\". The area of Northern Ireland was seen as the maximum area within\nwhich Unionists could be expected to have a safe majority. This was in spite of\nthe fact that counties Fermanagh and Tyrone had Catholic Nationalist\nmajorities. While these six counties and two parliamentary boroughs were all in\nthe province of Ulster, three other counties of the province - Donegal, Cavan\nand Monaghan - were assigned to the Irish Free State.\n\nUlster has no official function for local government purposes in either\njurisdiction. However, for the purposes of ISO-3166-2, Ulster is used to refer\nto the three counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan only, which are given\ncountry sub-division code \"IE-U\".
