intelligence","Signals intelligence of World War II"],"text":"\n\n\n\n'Ultra' was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June\n1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted\nenemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher\nSchool (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. Ultra eventually became the standard\ndesignation among the western Allies for all such intelligence. The name arose\nbecause the intelligence thus obtained was considered more important than that\ndesignated by the highest British security classification then used (Most\nSecret) and so was regarded as being Ultra secret. Several other cryptonyms had\nbeen used for such intelligence. British intelligence first designated it\n\"Boniface\"—presumably to imply that it was the result of human intelligence. The\nU.S. used the codename \"Magic\" for its decrypts from Japanese sources.\n\nMuch of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine. Used\nproperly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in\npractice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. The term \"Ultra\"\nhas often been used almost synonymously with \"Enigma decrypts\". However, Ultra\nalso encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used\nby the German High Command, and the Hagelin machine<ref>The Hagelin C-38m (a\ndevelopment of the C-36) was the model used by the Italian Navy, see: [http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-\ndemo/mobile/sms_stories_xml.py?phoneno=555&id=226&concepts=(HAGELIN) October\n1941: British intelligence in the Mediterranean theatre.]</ref> and other\nItalian and Japanese ciphers and codes such as PURPLE and JN-25.\n\nMany observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to\nthe Allies. Winston Churchill told King George VI: \"It was thanks to Ultra that\nwe won the war.\"<ref>Cited in the Imperial War Museum's 2003 exhibit \"Secret\nWar\".</ref> F. W. Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander,\nDwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end describing Ultra as having been \"decisive\" to\nAllied victory. Sir Harry Hinsley, official historian of British Intelligence in\nWorld War II, made a similar assessment about Ultra, saying that it shortened\nthe war \"by not less than two years and probably by four years\"; and that, in\nthe absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.\n","title":"ultra","headings":["Sources of intelligence","Distribution","Use of intelligence","Safeguarding of sources","Postwar disclosures","Holocaust intelligence","Postwar consequences","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["5: Bletchley_Park","2: Military_intelligence","2: Signals_intelligence","2: Teleprinter","2: Lorenz_cipher","2: Harry_Hinsley","2: Rotor_machine","2: Luftwaffe","2: Gordon_Welchman","2: Hut_6","2: Hut_8","2: MI6","2: RAF_Fighter_Command","2: MI5","2: Battle_of_France","2: Alan_Turing","2: GCHQ","1: United_Kingdom","1: Encrypt","1: Radio","1: Allies_of_World_War_II","1: Classified_information","1: Cryptonym","1: Nazi_Germany","1: Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma","1: PURPLE","1: JN-25","1: Winston_Churchill","1: George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Imperial_War_Museum","1: F._W._Winterbotham","1: Dwight_D._Eisenhower","1: Traffic_analysis","1: Direction_finding","1: Phoney_War","1: Landline","1: Radio_network","1: Enigma_machine","1: Polyalphabetic_cipher","1: German_Army","1: Kriegsmarine","1: Nazi_party","1: Alfred_Dillwyn_Knox","1: Biuro_SzyfrÃ³w","1: Polish_Enigma_doubles","1: Stream_cipher","1: Geheimfernschreiber","1: Siemens_and_Halske_T52","1: Colossus_computer","1: M-209","1: Pacific_Ocean","1: Purple_code","1: Signal_Intelligence_Service","1: Admiralty","1: War_Office","1: Air_Ministry","1: John_Vereker,_6th_Viscount_Gort","1: RAF_Advanced_Air_Striking_Force","1: Meaux","1: Patrick_Playfair","1: St_Albans","1: Richard_Gambier-Parry","1: Buckinghamshire","1: National_HRO","1: Packard","1: MI8","1: Typex","1: One-time_pad","1: Lucy_spy_ring","1: Switzerland","1: Rudolf_Roessler","1: Cryptanalysis","1: John_Cairncross","1: Alexander_RadÃ³","1: Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","1: PC_Bruno","1: Allied_campaign_in_Norway","1: Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Early_indicator_procedures","1: Bombe","1: Battle_of_the_Mediterranean","1: Low_Countries","1: Reginald_Victor_Jones","1: Battle_of_the_Beams","1: Battle_of_Britain","1: Hugh_Dowding,_1st_Baron_Dowding","1: RAF_Bentley_Priory","1: Operation_Sea_Lion","1: Coventry_Blitz","1: Ditchley","1: 10_Downing_Street","1: Operation_Compass","1: Libya","1: Battle_of_Cape_Matapan","1: Battle_of_Crete","1: Operation_Barbarossa","1: Joseph_Stalin","1: U-boat","1: Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#German_Navy_4-rotor_Enigma","1: Western_Desert_Campaign","1: Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell","1: Claude_Auchinleck","1: Erwin_Rommel","1: Double_agents","1: Double_Cross_System","1: Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea","1: Battle_of_Midway","1: PeenemÃ¼nde","1: V-1_and_V-2_Intelligence","1: Bernard_Montgomery,_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein","1: Battle_of_Alam_el_Halfa","1: Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein","1: Operation_Torch","1: Isoroku_Yamamoto","1: Balalae_Island","1: Allied_invasion_of_Sicily","1: Battle_of_North_Cape","1: German_battleship_Scharnhorst","1: Operation_Bodyguard","1: Operation_Overlord","1: Normandy_landings","1: Operation_Cobra","1: Falaise_pocket","1: Bomber_Harris","1: RAF_Bomber_Command","1: Delhi","1: Malta","1: Naples","1: Karl_DÃ¶nitz","1: Caribbean_Sea","1: V-E_Day","1: Gustave_Bertrand","1: WÅadysÅaw_Kozaczuk","1: German_submarine_U-505","1: Ladislas_Farago","1: National_Security_Agency","1: KL-7","1: Centenary","1: Force_multiplier","1: USSR","1: Jan_Karski","1: Einsatz_Reinhard","1: Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Jr.","1: Office_of_Strategic_Services","1: Christopher_Kasparek","1: Michael_Alfred_Peszke","1: Triumphalism","1: Max_Hastings","1: C-SPAN2","1: Toby_Harnden","1: Phillip_Knightley","1: Cold_War","1: Kim_Philby","1: Anthony_Blunt","1: U-869","1: New_Jersey","1: Richie_Kohler","1: John_Chatterton","1: Signals_intelligence_in_modern_history","1: Marian_Rejewski","1: Jerzy_RÃ³Å¼ycki","1: Henryk_Zygalski"]}
