{"cursor":"6396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\n'Udi Hrant Kenkulian' (1901–August 29, 1978), often referred to as 'Udi\nHrant' (\"oud-player Hrant\") or as 'Hrant Emre' (\"Hrant of the soul\") was an oud\nplayer of Turkish classical music, and a key transitional figure in its\ntransformation into a contemporary popular music. He was an ethnic Armenian\ncitizen of Turkey who spent most of his life in Turkey and wrote most of his\nlyrics in Turkish. He went to the United States of America to have his blindness\ntreated, and performed while in America.\n\nAs an oud player, he was a major innovator, introducing left-hand pizzicato,\nbidirectional picking (the tradition had been to use the pick only on the\ndownstroke), double stops, and novel tunings (sometimes using open tunings or\ntuning the paired strings in octaves instead of to a single note). According to\nHarold G. Hagopian, he was most respected for his improvisational\n[[Taqsim|taksim]].\n\nBorn near Istanbul, declared blind four days after his birth, Hrant as a child\nsang in the choir of an Armenian Apostolic Church. His family fled to Konya in\n1915 to escape the Armenian Genocide; there Hrant first studied the oud, with a\nteacher named Garabed. In 1918 the family returned west, first to AdapazarÄ± and\nthen to Istanbul, where Hrant continued his musical studies under some of the\nleading teachers of the time, including Kemani Agopos Ayvazyan, Dikran\nKatsakhian, and Udi Krikor Berberian. Somewhere along the way he also learned to\nspeak French, and was actually accepted at age 16 to a Paris-based school for\nthe blind, but he contracted typhoid fever and was unable to travel.\n\nSeveral attempts (including by doctors in Vienna) failed to restore his\neyesight, which prevented him from playing in ensembles. He made a modest living\nplaying in cafes, giving music lessons, and selling instruments. There is some\nquestion about when he first recorded; he claimed to have made a record as early\nas age 19, but his earliest known recordings would appear to be from no earlier\nthan 1927, since they used an electronic microphone.\n\nIn 1928, he fell in love with AÄavini, the sister of one of his students, but\nher parents would not let her marry a musician; they met again by accident in\n1937 and married ten years later. In the meantime, he had written numerous songs\nabout his desire for an absent love.\n\nHe slowly, but steadily, gained more fame as a musician. Some of his Turkish\nrecordings were released internationally as early as the 1930s, first on RCA\nVictor, and later on such labels as Balkan (New York), Perfectaphone and Yildiz\n(probably, according to Hagopian, a single company, address unknown), and\nIstanbul (Los Angeles). Composer Åeirf IÃ§li introduced him to Kanuni Ismail\nÅenÃ§alar, in whose group he played for a while, leading to opportunities to\nperform on Ankara Radio. In 1950, a wealthy Greek American brought him to\nAmerica for another (unsuccessful) attempt at restoring his eyesight. The trip,\nhowever, led to a series of concerts in New York City, Boston, Detroit, Los\nAngeles, and Fresno, California, playing both Turkish classical music and his\nown compositions. This tour apparently increased his prestige at home: he began\nto perform frequently on Istanbul Radio, first as a soloist and later with a\nchorus he formed. It also recorded in U.S. recording sessions for Smyrnaphon and\nOriental Moods. The former, according to Hagopian, are marred by his being\n\"paired... with inferior musicians\". The latter were a deluxe set, believed to\nbe the first ever inclusion of an oud with a violin and piano in a chamber music\nsetting, issued in an elaborately packaged set with English language titles\ngiven to the songs. The recording included both Hrant's originals and classic\nsongs by Kanuni Artaki, Bimen Åen, and others. During his trips to the U.S., he\nconducted master classes with young Armenian-American oud players such as\nRichard Hagopian, and Harry Minassian.\n\nHis recordings for Balkan, (with ÅÃ¼krÃ¼ Tunar on clarinet, Ahmet Yatman on\nkanun and Ali Kocadine on drum, are notable for the fact that although they\nwere recorded in Turkey, with a mix of Turkish and Armenian musicians, they\ninclude lyrics in Armenian; he also did other records with Turkish lyrics with\nthe same line-up. His original songs written in Armenian include \"Parov Yegar\nSiroon Yar,\" \"Siroon Aghchig,\" \"Anoosh Yaren Heratsa,\" \"Khrjit,\" and \"Srdis\nVra Kar Me Ga.\"\n\nHe toured internationally again in 1963, playing in Paris, Beirut, Greece, the\nUnited States, and Yerevan, then the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist\nRepublic. He recorded again in the U.S. at this time, but according to Hagopian\nthe recordings are \"inferior... for small labels and record producers eager to\ncapitalize on the 'belly-dance craze'\".\n\nHis last performance was in Istanbul in April 1978, at which time he was already\nsuffering from the cancer that would kill him that August.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","recorded":1375058539,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Udi_Hrant_CD_jacket.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Udi_Hrant_CD_jacket.jpg","/wiki/File:Udi_Hrant_CD_jacket.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Oud","/wiki/Oud","/wiki/Oud","/wiki/Turkish_classical_music","/wiki/Armenians","/wiki/Turkey","/wiki/Turkish_language","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Pizzicato","/wiki/Double_stop","/wiki/Open_tuning","/wiki/Octave","/wiki/Taqsim","/wiki/Istanbul","/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church","/wiki/Konya","/wiki/Armenian_Genocide","/wiki/Adapazar%C4%B1","/w/index.php?title=Kemani_Agopos_Ayvazyan&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dikran_Katsakhian&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Krikor_Berberian&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/France","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Typhoid_fever","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Microphone","/wiki/RCA_Victor","/w/index.php?title=%C5%9Eeirf_I%C3%A7li&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Kanuni_Ismail_%C5%9Een%C3%A7alar&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ankara_Radio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Greek_American","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Boston","/wiki/Detroit","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Fresno,_California","/w/index.php?title=Istanbul_Radio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chamber_music","/wiki/English_language","/w/index.php?title=Kanuni_Artaki&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bimen_%C5%9Een&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Richard_Hagopian","/w/index.php?title=Harry_Minassian&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC_Tunar&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ahmet_Yatman&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ali_Kocadine&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Turkish_people","/wiki/Armenian_language","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Beirut","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Yerevan","/wiki/Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","/wiki/Belly_dance","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Kalan_M%C3%BCzik","http://www.kalan.com/english/scripts/album/dispalbum.asp?id=127","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&oldid=484636054","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1901_births","/wiki/Category:1978_deaths","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_cancer","/wiki/Category:Ottoman_Armenians","/wiki/Category:Armenian_oud_players","/wiki/Category:Turkish_Armenians","/wiki/Category:Turkish_musicians","/wiki/Category:Blind_musicians","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Udi+Hrant+Kenkulian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Udi+Hrant+Kenkulian","/wiki/Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","/wiki/Talk:Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","#","/wiki/Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian&oldid=484636054","/w/index.php?title
