{"cursor":"19359","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene' ('UHMWPE', 'UHMW') is a subset of the\nthermoplastic polyethylene. Also known as 'high-modulus polyethylene', ('HMPE'),\nor 'high-performance polyethylene' ('HPPE'), it has extremely long chains, with\na molecular weight usually between 2 and 6 million. The longer chain serves to\ntransfer load more effectively to the polymer backbone by strengthening\nintermolecular interactions. This results in a very tough material, with the\nhighest impact strength of any thermoplastic presently made. Stein, H. L.\n(1998). Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes (uhmwpe).

Its coefficient of friction is significantly lower than that of nylon and\nacetal, and is comparable to that of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon), but\nUHMWPE has better abrasion resistance than PTFE.\n","linknr":390,"url":"Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene","recorded":1362552016,"links":31,"instances":["mechanical","climbing_equipment","weapon","polymers","metallurgy","company"],"pdf":["http://msc.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/BrinkeGten/1986/PolymBullPennings/1986PolymBullPennings.pdf","http://msc.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/BrinkeGten/1986/PolymBullPennings/1986PolymBullPennings.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060927232646/http://www-lgm2b.iut.u-bordeaux1.fr/publi/PE+fibre.pdf","http://www.xmission.com/~tmoyer/testing/High_Strength_Cord.pdf","http://www.xmission.com/~tmoyer/testing/High_Strength_Cord.pdf","http://www.xmission.com/~tmoyer/testing/High_Strength_Cord.pdf","http://www.xmission.com/~tmoyer/testing/High_Strength_Cord.pdf"],"categories":["Brand name materials","Personal armour","Polyolefins","Plastics","Synthetic fibers"],"headings":["Development","Structure and properties","Production","Applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Polyethylene-repeat-2D-flat.png/125px-Polyethylene-repeat-2D-flat.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Hanfstengel.jpg/140px-Hanfstengel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dsm","company"],["annealing","metallurgy"],["spinning","polymers#gel_spinning"],["spinneret","polymers"],["spinneret","polymers"],["bow","weapon"],["sling","climbing_equipment"],["abrasion","mechanical"]],"members":["abrasion","sling","bow","spinneret","spinning","annealing","dsm"],"related":["Thermoplastic","Polyethylene","Molecular_weight","Impact_force","Oxidizing_acid","Coefficient_of_friction","Carbon_steel","Nylon","Polyoxymethylene","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Ticona","Braskem","Mitsui","Arthroplasty","Orthopedic","Vertebral_column","DSM_(company)","Polyolefin","Van_der_Waals_bonding","Tensile_stress","Crystallinity","Kevlar","Melting_point","Brittle","Polar_molecule","Wetting","Aromatic","Aromatic_stacking_interaction","Aliphatic","Ester","Amide","Hydroxyl","Annealing_(metallurgy)","Silicone_oil","Glycerine","Chemical_synthesis","Monomers","Ethylene","Orders_of_magnitude","High-density_polyethylene","Metallocene","Kaminsky_catalyst","Compression_molding","Extrusion","Sintering","Extruder","Spinneret_(polymers)","Tensile_strength","Reptation","Spinneret_(polymers)","Yield_strength","GPa","Pounds_per_square_inch","Specific_gravity","Aramid","Armor","Personal_armor","Vehicle_armor","Bow_(weapon)","Sling_(climbing_equipment)","Fishing_line","Spearfishing","Sail","Parachute","Paraglider","Yachting","Wakeboard","Composite_material","Interceptor_body_armor","Puncture_resistance","Fencing","Abrasion_(mechanical)","Monofilament_line","Climbing","Webbing","Yarns","Toughness","Triple_fisherman's_knot","Double_fisherman's_knot","Hawser","Cables","Carbon_fiber","Fiberglass","Backstay","Sailing","Parasailing","Young_Engineers'_Satellite_2","John_Charnley","Total_hip_replacement","Arthroplasty","PVC","Cross-linked_polyethylene","High-density_polyethylene","Linear_low-density_polyethylene","Low-density_polyethylene","Medium-density_polyethylene","Stretch_wrap","Olefin","Twaron","Zylon","Vectran"]}
