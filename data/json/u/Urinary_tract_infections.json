When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a simple\ncystitis (a bladder infection) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is\nknown as pyelonephritis (a kidney infection).\nSymptoms from a lower urinary tract include painful urination and either\nfrequent urination or urge to urinate (or both), while those of pyelonephritis\ninclude fever and flank pain in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. In the\nelderly and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non specific. The main\ncausal agent of both types is [[Escherichia coli]], however other bacteria,\nviruses or fungi may rarely be the cause.\n\nUrinary tract infections occur more commonly in women than men, with half of\nwomen having at least one infection at some point in their lives. Recurrences\nare common. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse and family\nhistory. Pyelonephritis, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but\nmay also result from a blood borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women\ncan be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be\ndifficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In\ncomplicated cases or if treatment has failed, a urine culture may be useful. In\nthose with frequent infections, low dose antibiotics may be taken as a\npreventative measure.\n\nIn uncomplicated cases, urinary tract infections are easily treated with a short\ncourse of antibiotics, although resistance to many of the antibiotics used to\ntreat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, longer course or\nintravenous antibiotics may be needed, and if symptoms have not improved in two\nor three days, further diagnostic testing is needed. In women, urinary tract\ninfections are the most common form of bacterial infection with 10% developing\nurinary tract infections yearly.\n","linknr":1102,"url":"Urinary_tract_infections","recorded":1362511537,"links":44,"instances":["contraceptive"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Infectious diseases","Urological conditions"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Pathogenesis","Prevention","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","Society and culture","History","In pregnancy","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Pyuria.JPG/230px-Pyuria.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Pyuria2011.JPG/220px-Pyuria2011.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Bacteriuria_pyuria_4.jpg/220px-Bacteriuria_pyuria_4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diaphragm","contraceptive"]],"members":["diaphragm"],"related":["White_blood_cell","Infection","Urinary_system","Cystitis","Pyelonephritis","Urination","Fever","Abdominal_pain","Virus","Fungi","Bacteremia","Urine_culture","Antibiotic","Antibiotic_resistance","Sepsis","Dysuria","Vaginal_discharge","Pubic_bone","Lower_back_pain","Pyelonephritis","Abdominal_pain","Fever","Vomiting","Pyuria","Jaundice","Urinary_incontinence","Old_age","Altered_level_of_consciousness","Sepsis","Dementia","Virus","Fungal","Urinary_catheterization","Menopause","Spermicide","Urethra","Anus","Menopause","Vaginal_flora","Catheter","Bacteriuria","Aseptic_technique","Diabetes_mellitus","Circumcise","Benign_prostatic_hypertrophy","Vesicoureteral_reflux","Urine","Urinary_bladder","Ureter","Kidney","Constipation","Spinal_cord_injury","Urination","Cranberry_juice","Bacteria","Lymph","Biofilm","Defecating","Tampon","Spermicide","Diaphragm_(contraceptive)","Spermicide","Birth_control_pills","Nitrofurantoin","Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole","Methenamine","Formaldehyde","Topical","Estrogen","Pessary","Vaccine","Prophylactic","Chronic_kidney_disease","Cranberry","Cochrane_Review","Probiotics","Urinalysis","Urinary_nitrite","White_blood_cells","Leukocyte_esterase","Urine_microscopy","Red_blood_cells","Microbiological_culture","Colony-forming_unit","Diabetes_mellitus","Immunocompromised","Premenopausal","Suprapubic_aspiration","World_Health_Organization","American_Academy_of_Pediatrics","Renal_ultrasound","Voiding_cystourethrogram","National_Institute_for_Clinical_Excellence","Cervicitis","Cervix","Vaginitis","Vagina","Candidal_vulvovaginitis","Interstitial_cystitis","Prostatitis","Prostate","Antibiotic","Phenazopyridine","Methemoglobinemia","Methemoglobin","Acetaminophen","Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole","Cephalosporin","Nitrofurantoin","Quinolone","Infectious_Diseases_Society_of_America","Antibiotic_resistance","Amoxicillin-clavulanate","Trimethoprim","Intravenous","Ciprofloxacin","Ceftriaxone","Amoxicillin/clavulanate","Urinary_obstruction","Kidney_stone","Nosocomial_infection","Ebers_Papyrus","Bloodletting","Pregnancy","Progesterone","Cephalexin","Nitrofurantoin","Premature_birth","Pre-eclampsia","Hypertension","Seizures"]}
