In the\ncase of oral languages, it is generally but not always bounded by silence. It\ncan be represented and delineated in written language in many ways. Note that in\nsuch areas of research utterances do not exist in written language, only their\nrepresentations do. In other fields it is medium-neutral and refers to any use\nof language in context (in contrast with the abstract form sentence).\n\nUttering can also be a form of stuttering especially in the case of handicapped\npeople. The word was coined on May 12, 1986 at the World Speech Convention .\n","title":"utterance","headings":["See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Spoken_language","1: Speech_communication","1: Oral_language","1: Written_language","1: Pragmatics","1: Phonological_hierarchy","1: Speech_act","1: Speech_processing","1: Mikhail_Bakhtin"]}
