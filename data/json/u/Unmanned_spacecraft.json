Unmanned spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human\ninput, they may be remote controlled, remote guided or even autonomous\n(\"robotic\"). Many habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic\nfeatures. For example the space stations Salyut 7 and Mir, and the ISS module\nZarya were capable of unmanned remote guided station keeping, and docking\nmaneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. The most common unmanned\nspacecraft categories are robotic spacecraft, unmanned resupply spacecraft,\nspace probes and space observatories. Not every unmanned spacecraft is a robotic\nspacecraft, for example a reflector ball is a non-robotic unmanned spacecraft.\n","linknr":249,"url":"Unmanned_spacecraft","recorded":1362268042,"links":19,"instances":["planet","dwarf_planet","spacecraft","spacecraft","moon","spacecraft","moon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Unmanned spacecraft|"],"headings":["Examples","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/ATV-2_approaching_the_ISS.jpg/220px-ATV-2_approaching_the_ISS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/1989_s34_Galileo_Deploy_5.jpg/220px-1989_s34_Galileo_Deploy_5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Buran_on_An-225_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29_%28cropped%29.JPEG/220px-Buran_on_An-225_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29_%28cropped%29.JPEG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Progress_M-06M.jpg/220px-Progress_M-06M.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/HRIV_Impact.gif/220px-HRIV_Impact.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phobos","moon"],["titan","moon"],["deep_impact","spacecraft"],["ceres","dwarf_planet"],["ulysses","spacecraft"],["genesis","spacecraft"],["mercury","planet"]],"members":["mercury","ceres","deep_impact","genesis","titan","ulysses","phobos"],"related":["International_Space_Station","Spacecraft","People","Unmanned_spaceflight","Salyut_7","Mir","International_Space_Station","Zarya","Robotic_spacecraft","Unmanned_resupply_spacecraft","Space_probe","Space_observatory","Luna_program","Ranger_program","Zond_program","Surveyor_program","Lunar_Orbiter_program","Lunokhod_program","Lunar_Rover","Muses-A_mission","Zond_program","Mars_probe_program","Viking_program","NASA","Phobos_program","Phobos_(moon)","Mars_Surveyor_'98_program","Mars_Global_Surveyor","Mars_Odyssey","Mars_Observer","Mars_Express","Mars_Exploration_Rover","Venera_program","Venus","Pioneer_Venus_project","Venus","Vega_program","Venus","Comet_Halley","Magellan_probe","Venus_Express","MESSENGER","Pioneer_program","Jupiter","Saturn","Voyager_program","Uranus","Neptune","Interstellar_medium","Galileo_probe","Titan_(moon)","International_Cometary_Explorer","21P/Giacobini-Zinner","Giotto_mission","1P/Halley","Vega_program","USSR","1P/Halley","Sakigake","1P/Halley","Suisei_probe","1P/Halley","433_Eros","19P/Borrelly","Stardust_probe","81P/Wild","2P/Encke","73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann","6P/d'Arrest","Solid_rocket_motor","67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko","Philae_lander","Deep_Impact_(spacecraft)","9P/Tempel","EPOXI","103P/Hartley","9P/Tempel","4_Vesta","Ceres_(dwarf_planet)","Ulysses_(spacecraft)","Genesis_(spacecraft)","Advanced_Composition_Explorer","STEREO","SOHO","Zond_program","Moon","Venus","Mars","Mariner_program","Mercury_(planet)","Mars","MESSENGER","Pluto","List_of_unmanned_spacecraft_by_program"]}
