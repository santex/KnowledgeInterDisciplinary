{"cursor":"7347","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Underwater' is a term describing the realm below the surface of water where the\nwater exists in a natural feature (called a body of water) such as an ocean,\nsea, lake, pond, or river. Three quarters of the planet Earth is covered by\nwater. A majority of the planet's solid surface is abyssal plain, at depths\nbetween below the surface of the oceans. The solid surface location on the\nplanet closest to the centre of the orb is the Challenger Deep, located in the\nMariana Trench at a depth of . Although a number of human activities are\nconducted underwater—such as research, scuba diving for work or\nrecreation, or even underwater warfare with submarines, this very extensive\nenvironment on planet Earth is hostile to humans in many ways and therefore\nlittle explored. But it can be explored by sonar, or more directly via manned or\nautonomous submersibles. The ocean floors have been surveyed via sonar to at\nleast a coarse resolution; particularly-strategic areas have been mapped in\ndetail, in the name of detecting enemy submarines, or aiding friendly ones,\nthough the resulting maps may still be classified.\n\nAn immediate obstacle to human activity under water is the fact that human lungs\ncannot naturally function in this environment. Unlike the gills of fish, human\nlungs are adapted to the exchange of gases at atmospheric pressure, not liquids.\nAside from simply having insufficient musculature to rapidly move water in and\nout of the lungs, a more significant problem for all air-breathing animals, such\nas mammals and birds, is that water contains so little dissolved oxygen compared\nwith atmospheric air. Air is around 21% O 2; water typically is less\nthan 0.001% dissolved oxygen.\n\nThe density of water also causes problems that increase dramatically with depth.\nThe atmospheric pressure at the surface is 14.7 pounds per square inch or around\n100 kPa. A comparable water pressure occurs at a depth of only ( for sea water).\nThus, at about 10 m below the surface, the water exerts twice the pressure (2\natmospheres or 200 kPa) on the body as air at surface level.\n\nFor solid objects like human bones and muscles, this added pressure is not much\nof a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth,\nears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces\nreduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with\nsupport from the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of underwater, an\ninability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure\ncan cause pain, and the tympanic membrane can rupture at depths under 10 ft\n(3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the\nrate of pressure change is greatest at the surface of the water. For example the\npressure increase between the surface and 10 m (33 ft) is 100% (100\nkPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30 m (100 ft) to\n40 m (130 ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).\n\nAny object immersed in water is provided with a buoyant force that counters the\nforce of gravity, appearing to make the object less heavy. If the overall\ndensity of the object exceeds the density of water, the object sinks. If the\noverall density is less than the density of water, the object rises until it\nfloats on the surface. (NOAA).]]\n\nWith increasing depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and the amount of\nvisible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths\n(red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the\nvisible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth.\nWhite objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear\ndark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is turbid, in\nthe very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light\nreaches a depth of 10 m (33 feet). At 100 m (330 ft) the light\npresent from the sun is normally about 0.5% of that at the surface.\n\nThe euphotic depth is the depth at which light intensity falls to 1% of the\nvalue at the surface. This depth is dependent upon water clarity, being only a\nfew metres underwater in a turbid estuary, but may reach up to 200 metres in the\nopen ocean. At the euphotic depth, plants (such as phytoplankton) have no net\nenergy gain from photosynthesis and thus cannot grow.\n\nAt depths greater than a few hundred metres, the sun has little effect on water\ntemperature, because the sun's energy has been absorbed by water at the surface.\nIn the great depths of the ocean the water temperature is very low. In fact, 75%\nof the water in the world ocean (the great depths) has a temperature between 0\nÂ°C and 2 Â°C.\n\nWater conducts heat around twenty five times more efficiently than air.\nHypothermia, a potentially fatal condition, occurs when the human body's core\ntemperature falls below 35 Â°C. Insulating the body's warmth from water is the\nmain purpose of diving suits and exposure suits when used in water temperatures\nbelow 25 Â°C.\n\nSound is transmitted about 4.3 times faster in water (1,484 m/s in fresh water)\nas it is in air (343 m/s). The human brain can determine the direction of sound\nin air by detecting small differences in the time it takes for sound waves in\nair to reach each of the two ears. For these reasons divers find it difficult to\ndetermine the direction of sound underwater. However, some animals have adapted\nto this difference and many use sound to navigate underwater.\n\n\n - composite of 8 photos from snorkeling on a flat coral reef off the islet\n   Klein
