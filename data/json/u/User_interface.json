{"cursor":"24794","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Interface}} The 'user interface', in the industrial design field of\nhumanâmachine interaction, is the space where interaction between humans and\nmachines occurs. The goal of this interaction is effective operation and control\nof the machine on the user's end, and feedback from the machine, which aids the\noperator in making operational decisions. Examples of this broad concept of user\ninterfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand\ntools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design\nconsiderations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or\ninvolve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology.\n\nA user interface is the system by which people (users) interact with a machine.\nThe user interface includes hardware (physical) and software (logical)\ncomponents. User interfaces exist for various systems, and provide a means of:\n* Input, allowing the users to manipulate a system\n* Output, allowing the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation\n\nGenerally, the goal of human-machine interaction engineering is to produce a\nuser interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable to operate a\nmachine in the way which produces the desired result. This generally means that\nthe operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and\nalso that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.\n\nWith the increased use of personal computers and the relative decline in\nsocietal awareness of heavy machinery, the term user interface is generally\nassumed to mean the graphical user interface, while industrial control panel and\nmachinery control design discussions more commonly refer to human-machine\ninterfaces.\n\nOther terms for user interface include 'humanâcomputer interface' ('HCI') and\n'manâmachine interface' ('MMI').\n","linknr":386,"url":"User_interface","recorded":1362667815,"links":71,"instances":["computing","computing","programming_language","programming","computing","computer_science","computing"],"pdf":["http://www.iem-inc.com/TMI.pdf","http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Acrobat/8.0/Professional/gs.pdf","http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Faro/DNCOCO/DNCOCO-25.pdf","http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2010/Faro/DNCOCO/DNCOCO-25.pdf"],"categories":["User interfaces|","User interface techniques","Virtual reality"],"headings":["Introduction","Terminology","Usability","User interfaces in computing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/00-bma-automation-operator-panel-with-pushbuttons.JPG/220px-00-bma-automation-operator-panel-with-pushbuttons.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["user","computing"],["java","programming_language"],["ajax","programming"],["command","computing"],["stylus","computing"],["wimp","computing"],["ribbon","computing"],["ribbon","computing#reaction"],["interface","computer_science"]],"members":["wimp","stylus","java","ajax","user","interface","command","ribbon"],"related":["Industrial_design","Human–computer_interaction","Operating_system","Tools","Heavy_machinery","Unit_operation","Ergonomics","Psychology","User_(computing)","Interaction","Machine","System","Personal_computer","Heavy_machinery","Graphical_user_interface","Automobile","Vehicle","Speedometer","List_of_vehicle_instruments","Electronics","Computerized","Library","Database","Machine","Industry","Human-computer_interaction","Science_fiction","Direct_neural_interface","Prostheses","Cochlear_implants","Immersive_digital_environment","Mental_model","Human_action_cycle","Usability_testing","Ergonomics","List_of_human-computer_interaction_topics","Computer_user_satisfaction","Interaction_design","Usability","Psychology","Physiology","Computer_science","Human–computer_interaction","Computer_keyboard","Computer_mouse","Touchscreen","Graphical","Computer_monitor","Object-oriented_user_interface","Application_software","Web_application","Web_page","Internet","Web_browser","Java_(programming_language)","Ajax_(programming)","Adobe_Flex","Microsoft_.NET","Web_hosting_control_panel","Stylus","Mobile_device","Point_of_sale","Desktop_computer","Command_(computing)","Touchpad","Haptic_communication","Attention","Batch_processing","Gesture","Mouse_gesture","Stylus_(computing)","Object-oriented_programming","Direct_manipulation","Command_verb","Information_overload","Desktop_metaphor","Command-line_interface","WIMP_(computing)","Archy","Modeless","Jef_Raskin","Programming","History_of_the_GUI","Cognitive_dimensions","Principle_of_least_astonishment","Adobe_Acrobat","Microsoft_Office","Ribbon_(computing)","Toolbar","Digitizing_tablet","Loudspeaker","Caps_lock","Accessibility","Computer_accessibility","Adaptive_user_interfaces","Brain-computer_interface","Computer_user_satisfaction","Distinguishable_interfaces","Ergonomics","Human_factors","Framebuffer","Icon_design","Information_architecture","Information_visualization","Interaction_design","Interaction_technique","Interface_(computer_science)","Kinetic_user_interface","Knowledge_visualization","List_of_user_interface_literature","Natural_user_interface","Ncurses","Organic_user_interface","Post-WIMP","Tangible_user_interface","Unified_Code_for_Units_of_Measure","User_Assistance","User_experience","User_experience_design","User_interface_design","Virtual_artifact","Virtual_user_interface"]}
