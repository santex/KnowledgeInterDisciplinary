{"cursor":"7800","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'right to use force' is a right of an individual or authority to settle\nconflicts or prevent certain actions by using force to either: a) dissuade\nanother party from a particular course of action, or b) physically intervene to\nstop them. In nations of the developed world and the developing world,\ngovernments allow police, citizen, corrections, or other security personnel to\nemploy force to actively prevent imminent commission of crime, or even for\ndeterrence. It may also be exercised by the executive branch (i.e., through the\npresident, prime minister, premier, governor, or mayor) of a political\njurisdiction, deploying the police or military to maintain public order. The use\nof force is governed by statute and is usually authorized in a progressive\nseries of actions, referred to as a \"use of force continuum. The use of\nforce is derived from English Common Law in English-speaking countries [http://-\n72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:0WLTs_v5QroJ:www.sussex.police.uk/foi/UploadFolder-\n/ConflictResolution.doc+%22use+of+force%22+%22common+law%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&-\nclient=safari]. It is a tradition of other legal systems, such as the French\nCivil Code [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0268-\n0556(1991)6%3A3%3C297%3AFMAIOP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6] and is enshrined in international\nlaw [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/i2bpuff.htm]\n\nWhen a conflict is between parties having the same standing, observers often\nrecommend the use of negotiation or other \"conflict resolution\" techniques. When\na conflict is between a lawbreaker and a law enforcer, or an opponent and an\nofficer of the state, force is used when the lawbreaker or dissident refuses to\ndesist, or attempts to flee. The continuum of force progresses from verbal\norders, through physical restraint, up to, in some cases, lethal force. Where\nthe rule of law holds, the general rule for application of force is that only\nnecessary force may be used. When force is applied by an individual (for\nexample, to protect life, or property), the force permissible is only that which\nis reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. Commonwealth of\nAustralia [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s3zqi.html\nReasonable and necessary force]. Commonwealth Consolidated Acts. CRIMES ACT 1914\n- SECT 3ZQI. Retrieved on: October 8, 2007.\n\nWhen a level of force beyond verbal commands is used, the individual or\nauthority authorizing the force is accountable for the degree of force applied.\nIn the case of lethal force, other levels of force must have been attempted\nfirst unless lethal force is the only way to minimize loss of life. When the use\nof military force is employed by the state towards another political entity for\ndefensive purposes, international law requires that the principle of\nproportionality be applied. {{cite web\n  | last = O'Connell first = Mary Ellen title = Proportionality and the Use of\n  | Force in the Middle East Conflict work = Jurist: Legal News and Research\n  | publisher = Bernard J.
