It had begun life\nas the International Motor Company in 1908 in an attempt to create the first\nmajor consolidation within the industry with Maxwell-Briscoe and Buick, which\ndid not succeed. International Motor was renamed USMC in December 1909. By the\nend of 1910 there were 11 constituent companies, each still headed by the\nindividual who had built each company originally. During 1910, rumors surfaced\nthat United States Motor Company was going to merge with General Motors, but\nBriscoe scotched the rumors by stating that any attempt to integrate General\nMotors into USMC would create chaos.\n\nThis was an effort to try to save several independent automotive manufacturing\ncompanies who were having great difficulty in getting the necessary financial\nbacking. Those companies included: Maxwell, Stoddard-Dayton, Courier Car Co,\nColumbia Automobile Company, Brush Motor Car Company, Alden Sampson Trucks, Gray\nMarine, and Providence Engineering Works, with the Thomas and other lines coming\naboard later.\n\n1910 production announced in mid-year included 15,000 Maxwells, 10,000 Brush\nRunabouts, and 10,000 of the Stoddard-Dayton, Columbia, and Alden Sampson\nTrucks. Later in 1910, Briscoe formed United Motors International, Ltd. to\nhandle international sales of the United States Motor Company, focused mainly\non England.\n\nAnnouncing some price reductions for 1911 models, the company stated that it had\n18 plants with combined floorspace of with 14,000 employees capable of producing\n52,000 vehicles. There were 52 models offered in 1911. It was claimed that there\nwas no left over stock of unsold cars from the 1910 model year and that business\nwas up fifty-seven percent from the year earlier period.\n\nBriscoe several times complained that the antipathy of bankers to the automobile\nindustry was hampering growth. In early 1912, the company suspended dividend\npayments on its preferred stock and in September 1912 year went into\nreceivership. The bankers attributed the failure to bad management. A conflict\nbetween two of its backers, who also had a financial interest in General Motors,\nled to the downfall. Briscoe retired in late 1912 and was replaced by Walter E.\nFlanders as manager for the receivers committee. The assets of the United States\nMotor Company and constituent companies were sold for $7,080,000 at a public\nforeclosure sale in January 1913.\n\nThe USMC assets were purchased by Walter Flanders, who reorganized the company\nas the Maxwell Motor Company, Inc. This was the only surviving member of the\ngroup. In the early 1920s this company was reorganized and became Chrysler.\n","linknr":87,"url":"United_States_Motor_Company","recorded":1375057960,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:U_S_Motor_Car_emblem.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/U_S_Motor_Car_emblem.png/220px-U_S_Motor_Car_emblem.png","/wiki/File:U_S_Motor_Car_emblem.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Benjamin_Briscoe","/wiki/Maxwell_automobile","/wiki/Stoddard-Dayton","/wiki/Courier_Car_Co","/wiki/Columbia_Automobile_Company","/wiki/Brush_Motor_Car_Company","/wiki/Bankruptcy","/wiki/General_Motors_Corporation","/wiki/Walter_Flanders","/wiki/Chrysler_Corporation","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=edit&section=2","http://classiccarbug.web.aplus.net/featurecar1003.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&oldid=543718936","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_motor_vehicle_manufacturers_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Companies_established_in_1910","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=United+States+Motor+Company&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=United+States+Motor+Company","/wiki/United_States_Motor_Company","/wiki/Talk:United_States_Motor_Company","#","/wiki/United_States_Motor_Company","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/United_States_Motor_Company","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/United_States_Motor_Company","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&oldid=543718936","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4700960","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=United_States_Motor_Company&id=543718936","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=United+States+Motor+Company","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=United+States+Motor+Company&oldid=543718936&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Motor_Company&printable=yes","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Motor_Company","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4700960#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Motor_Company","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct
