The Union of Students in\nIreland (USI) is the sole national representative body for students in Ireland\nbut does not represent students from three of the seven Irish Universities,\nnamely University College Dublin, Dublin City University and University of\nLimerick. Founded in 1959, USI now represents more than 250,000 students in over\nforty colleges across the island of Ireland. [http://www.usi.ie/pages/about-\nusi.php Union of Students in Ireland - About USI ] The goal of the USI is to work for rights of students and a fair and\nequal third level education system in Ireland.\n\nThe Union's sovereign body is its Annual Congress, and its executive authority\nis its National Council, comprising representatives from each member\norganisation. Members of the Officer Board of USI serve a one year term\nbeginning on July 1. The current President is John Logue.\n\nMany past officers of USI have gone on to prominent positions within Irish\nsociety. Past USI presidents include Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore, former Chief\nJustice John L. Murray (1966/67), and broadcaster Joe Duffy (1983â84).\n\nIn Northern Ireland, USI jointly operates NUS-USI with the National Union\nof Students of the United Kingdom, with students being members of both\nnational unions.\n\nUSI is a member of European Students' Union, was formerly a member of EURODOC\nand has provided officer-holders in both organisations.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Union_of_Students_in_Ireland","recorded":1375075216,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:USI_Logo_2008_Onwards.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/USI_Logo_2008_Onwards.jpeg/190px-USI_Logo_2008_Onwards.jpeg","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/European_Students%27_Union","http://www.usi.ie","/wiki/Irish_language","/wiki/Tertiary_education","/wiki/Students%27_union","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/University_College_Dublin","/wiki/Dublin_City_University","/wiki/University_of_Limerick","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Tanaiste","/wiki/Eamon_Gilmore","/wiki/John_L._Murray","/wiki/Joe_Duffy","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/NUS-USI","/wiki/National_Union_of_Students_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/European_Students%27_Union","/wiki/EURODOC","#Structure","#Officer_Board","#National_Council","#Regional_Conferences","#Standing_Conferences","#Annual_Congress","#Notable_Past_Officers","#Presidents_of_USI","#Deputy_Presidents_of_USI","#Officer_Board_2","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:USI-logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/USI-logo.jpg","/wiki/File:USI-logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/John_L._Murray","/wiki/Joe_Duffy","/wiki/Labour_Party_(Ireland)","/wiki/Pat_Rabbitte","/wiki/T%C3%A1naiste","/wiki/Eamon_Gilmore","/wiki/Colm_Keaveney","/wiki/Frank_Flannery","/wiki/Cambridge_University","/wiki/Yale","/wiki/Denys_Turner","/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party","/wiki/Mark_Durkan","/wiki/Alex_White_(politician)","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins","/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Galway","/wiki/Adrian_Hardiman","/wiki/University_College_Dublin","/wiki/Alex_Attwood","/wiki/Queens_University_Belfast","/wiki/Seamus_Brennan","/wiki/Ivana_Bacik","/wiki/Ronan_Mullen","/wiki/Clare_Daly","/wiki/Dublin_City_University","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Jim_Allister","/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il","/wiki/Charlie_McConalogue","/wiki/Averil_Power","/wiki/Lucinda_Creighton","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Paul_Murphy_(Irish_politician)","/wiki/Patrick_Nulty","/wiki/Derek_Nolan","/wiki/Ciara_Conway_(politician)","/wiki/James_Carroll_(Louth_politician)","/w/index.php?title=Lord_High_Sheriff_of_Belfast&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Belfast_City_Council","/wiki/Queens_University_Belfast","/wiki/Sallins_Train_Robbery","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Malaysia","/wiki/UCC","/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Ireland","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Cathy_Grieve","/wiki/Vincent_Browne","/wiki/Joe_Brolly","/wiki/Nick_Ross","/wiki/Ryan_Tubridy","/wiki/Morning_Ireland","/wiki/Aine_Lawlor","/wiki/RT%C3%89","/wiki/Mark_Little","/wiki/Mary_Raftery","/wiki/UCD_Students%27_Union","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Today_Tonight","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Union_of_Students_in_Ireland&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Galway_Mayo_Institute_of_Technology_Students%27_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_College_Dublin_Students%27_Union","/wiki/University_College_Dublin_Students%27_Union","/wiki/University_College_Dublin_Students%27_Union","/wiki/National_University_of_Ireland,_Galway","/wiki/Waterford_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/University_College_Cork","/wiki/Dublin_Institute_of_Technology","/wi
