      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn 'unidentified flying object', or 'UFO', in its most general definition, is\nany apparent anomaly in the sky (or near or on the ground, but observed\nhovering, landing, or departing into the sky) that is not readily identifiable\nas any known object or phenomenon by visual observation and/or use of associated\ninstrumentation such as radar. These anomalies were referred to popularly as\n\"flying saucers\" or \"flying discs\" during the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nThe term \"UFO\" (or \"UFOB\") was officially created in 1953 by the U.S. Air Force\n(USAF) to replace the more popular terms because of the variety of shapes\ndescribed other than \"discs\" or \"saucers\". It was stated that a \"UFOB\" was \"any\nairborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual\nfeatures, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or\nwhich cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\" As originally\ndefined, the term was restricted to those fraction of cases which remained\nunidentified after investigation, with USAF interest being for potential\nnational security reasons and/or \"technical aspects\". (See ) The term UFO became\nmore widespread during the 1950s, at first in professional literature, but later\nin popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the Cold War, an era\nassociated with a heightened concern for national security.\n\nVarious studies, both governmental and civilian, have reached widely varying\nconclusions, some concluding that the phenomenon does not represent a threat to\nnational security nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit\n(see, e.g., 1953 CIA Robertson Panel, USAF Project Blue Book, Condon Committee),\nwhile others have reached the exact opposite conclusions (see, e.g., 1999 French\nCOMETA study, 1948 USAF Estimate of the Situation, Sturrock Panel). A number of\nmilitary personnel and others have given statements about having witnessed UFOs\nthemselves or having been privy to information about them.<!--See \"Claims by\nmilitary personnel and other qualified persons\" further down.--> Culturally, the\nphenomenon has often been associated with extraterrestrial life or government-\nrelated conspiracy theories, and thus has become a popular theme in fiction.\n",
