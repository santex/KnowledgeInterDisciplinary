The\nLaw of the Sea Convention defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in\ntheir use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the\nenvironment, and the management of marine natural resources. The Convention,\nconcluded in 1982, replaced four 1958 treaties. UNCLOS came into force in 1994,\na year after Guyana became the 60th nation to sign the treaty. As of October 2012, 164 countries and the European Union have\njoined in the Convention. However, it is uncertain as to what extent the\nConvention codifies customary international law.\n\nWhile the Secretary General of the United Nations receives instruments of\nratification and accession and the UN provides support for meetings of states\nparty to the Convention, the UN has no direct operational role in the\nimplementation of the Convention. There is, however, a role played by\norganizations such as the International Maritime Organization, the International\nWhaling Commission, and the International Seabed Authority (the latter being\nestablished by the UN Convention).\n","linknr":431,"url":"United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea","recorded":1362372179,"links":58,"instances":["sea"],"pdf":["http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/table_summary_of_claims.pdf","http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/table_summary_of_claims.pdf","http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/adv_op_010211.pdf","http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2003/RufeTestimony031021.pdf","http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/CB/C-51_Ed4-EN.pdf"],"categories":["Law of the sea|","United Nations conventions and covenants","Treaties concluded in 1982","Treaties entered into force in 1994","Maritime boundaries","Boundary treaties"],"headings":["Historical background","UNCLOS I","UNCLOS II","UNCLOS III","Part XI and the 1994 Agreement","Signature and ratification","Lectures","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/UNCLOS_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/16px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/125px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Zonmar-en.svg/300px-Zonmar-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea.png/500px-United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["baseline","sea"],["baseline","sea"],["baseline","sea"]],"members":["baseline"],"related":["Montego_Bay","Jamaica","United_Nations","Natural_resource","Treaties","Guyana","European_Union","Customary_international_law","Ratification","International_Maritime_Organization","International_Whaling_Commission","International_Seabed_Authority","Freedom_of_the_seas","Coastline","Three-mile_limit","Cannon","Netherlands","Cornelius_van_Bynkershoek","International_waters","Grotius","Mineral","Fish_stocks","League_of_Nations","The_Hague","Harry_S._Truman","Continental_shelf","Chile","Peru","Ecuador","Humboldt_Current","Jordan","Palau","Belize","Strait","Papua_New_Guinea","British_Overseas_Territories","Anguilla","Geneva","Convention_on_the_Territorial_Sea_and_Contiguous_Zone","Convention_on_the_Continental_Shelf","Convention_on_the_High_Seas","Convention_on_Fishing_and_Conservation_of_Living_Resources_of_the_High_Seas","Arvid_Pardo","Malta","Guyana","Exclusive_economic_zones","Baseline_(sea)","Internal_waters","Territorial_waters","Innocent_passage","Transit_passage","Contiguous_zone","Baseline_(sea)","Customs","Taxation","Immigration","Pollution","Hot_pursuit","Exclusive_economic_zone","Baseline_(sea)","Fishing","Petroleum","Oil_platform","Gulf_of_Mexico","Continental_shelf","Natural_prolongation","Continental_margin","International_Seabed_Authority","Common_heritage_of_mankind","Landlocked_country","International_Seabed_Authority","Cook_Islands","Niue","European_Union","Cambodia","Colombia","El_Salvador","Iran","Democratic_People's_Republic_of_Korea","Libya","United_Arab_Emirates","Afghanistan","Bhutan","Burundi","Central_African_Republic","Ethiopia","Liechtenstein","Niger","Rwanda","Eritrea","Israel","Peru","Syria","Turkey","Venezuela","Andorra","Azerbaijan","Kazakhstan","Kyrgyzstan","San_Marino","South_Sudan","Tajikistan","Turkmenistan","Uzbekistan","Vatican_City","State_of_Palestine","Republic_of_China","Republic_of_Kosovo","List_of_states_with_limited_recognition","Aruba","Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands","Donald_Rumsfeld","Outer_space","Helmut_TÃ¼rk","Tommy_Koh","Admiralty_law","Fisheries_management","International_Tribunal_for_the_Law_of_the_Sea","Law_of_salvage","Legal_assessments_of_the_Gaza_flotilla_raid","Maritime_Security_Regimes","Montreux_Convention_Regarding_the_Regime_of_the_Turkish_Straits","Operation_Sharp_Guard","Territorial_waters","United_States_non-ratification_of_the_UNCLOS","USA/USSR_Joint_Statement_on_Uniform_Acceptance_of_Rules_of_International_Law_Governing_Innocent_Passage","VLIZ"]}
