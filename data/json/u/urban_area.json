Urban areas may be cities, towns\nor conurbations, but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such\nas villages and hamlets.\n\nUrban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization.\nMeasuring the extent of an urban area helps in analyzing population density and\nurban sprawl, and in determining urban and rural populations.\n\nUnlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but\nalso satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically\nconnected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through\ncommuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.\n\nIn the US, Metropolitan areas tend to be defined using counties or county sized\npolitical units as building blocks of much larger, albeit more condensed\npopulation units. Counties tend to be stable political boundaries; economists\nprefer to work with economic and social statistics based on metropolitan areas.\nUrbanized areas are a more relevant statistic for determining per capita land\nusage and densities.\n",
