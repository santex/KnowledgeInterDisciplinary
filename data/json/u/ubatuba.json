The population in 2010 was 78,801, its density was 110.87 hab/kmÂ²\nwith an area of 712 kmÂ².\n\nUbatuba is linked with the Rodovia Longitudinal or the BR-101 and is also\nlocated east of SÃ£o Paulo and east/north/east of Santos and west of Rio de\nJaneiro. The city lies on the Tropic of Capricorn.\n\nThe urban area is mainly concentrated in the Atlantic and valley areas. The city\nfrequently receives rain, hence the nickname Uba Chuva (chuva being Portuguese\nfor \"rain\"). Much of the land to the north is forested and mountainous, forming\na part of the Serra do Mar mountains. Serra do Mar State Park covers 83% of the\ncity and has few connector roads through the mountain range. A marine park was\ncreated under Projeto TAMAR (Project Tamar) to protect sea turtles. In addition,\nthe Oceanographic Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo runs the Clarimundo\nde Jesus research base in Ubatuba.\n\nUbatuba is an important tourist city, receiving tourists from many parts of\nBrazil. Ubatuba features over 100 beaches. Among these are Maranduba, LÃ¡zaro,\nItamambuca, Vermelha, Grande, Enseada, PerequÃª, and Saco da Ribeira. Ubatuba\nalso features an island named Anchieta after JosÃ© de Anchieta. It has been a\nnature preserve since March 22, 1977.\n\nUbatuba is considered, by law, as \"The Surf Capital of SÃ£o Paulo State\". The\ncity has received this honour because more than ten important surf contests are\nheld off its beaches every year, including two world qualifying series, two\nSuper Surf Pro series, and other competitions supported by such well-established\nbrands as Billabong, Quiksilver and Dunkelvolk (which sponsored the 2009 edition\nof Ubatuba Surf Contest with more than 120 athletes).\n\nLately, the city is also known by its biodiversity, specially related to birds.\nThere are more than 565 different birds species already identified (as of April\n2012), what has each day attracted more and more birdwatchers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"ubatuba","recorded":1372154873,"links":[],"instances":["clothing","são_paulo","brazil","state"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Populated coastal places in São Paulo (state)","Populated places established in 1637"],"headings":["History","Population history in numbers","Climate","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["são_paulo","state"],["são_paulo","state"],["workers'_party","brazil"],["são_paulo","state"],["santos","são_paulo"],["billabong","clothing"]],"members":["billabong","santos","são_paulo"],"related":["São_Paulo_(state)","Brazil","List_of_countries","Brazil","Regions_of_Brazil","Southeast_Region,_Brazil","States_of_Brazil","São_Paulo_(state)","Mayor","Workers'_Party_(Brazil)","List_of_municipalities_in_the_state_of_São_Paulo_by_population","UTC-3","UTC-2","Brazil","São_Paulo_(state)","São_Paulo","Santos_(São_Paulo)","Rio_de_Janeiro","Tropic_of_Capricorn","Portuguese_language","Serra_do_Mar","Serra_do_Mar_State_Park","Projeto_TAMAR","Sea_turtles","Oceanographic_Institute_of_the_University_of_São_Paulo","Anchieta_Island","José_de_Anchieta","Billabong_(clothing)","Quiksilver","Dunkelvolk","Tupi_language","Tupinambá","Catholicism","André_Thévet","Tamoio_Confederation","France_Antarctique","Rio_de_Janeiro","Jesuit","Manuel_da_Nóbrega","Cunhambebe","Green_ubatuba","Cunha,_São_Paulo","Parati","Parati","Atlantic_Ocean","Caraguatatuba","Caraguatatuba","Natividade_da_Serra","São_Luís_do_Paraitinga"]}
