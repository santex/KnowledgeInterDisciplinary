Modern uniforms are most often\nworn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency\nservices, security guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in\nprisons. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their\nduties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public\nHealth Service or the French prefects. For some public groups, such as police,\nit is illegal for non members to wear the uniform. Other uniforms are trade\ndresses (such as the brown uniforms of UPS).\n","title":"uniform","headings":["Service and work uniforms","Schools","Sports","Security and armed forces","Prison","Civilian officials","Domestic workers","Uniform hygiene","Scouting","Uniform buttons","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Australia","2: United_Kingdom","2: Necktie","2: Trousers","2: Mess_dress","2: Industrial_laundry","1: Organization","1: Armed_forces","1: Paramilitary","1: Police","1: Security_guard","1: School","1: Prison","1: Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps","1: United_States_Public_Health_Service","1: France","1: Préfet","1: Trade_dress","1: United_Parcel_Service","1: Corporate","1: Retailer","1: Bank","1: Post_office","1: Public_security","1: Health_care","1: Blue_collar","1: Personal_trainer","1: Summer_camp","1: Lifeguard","1: Janitor","1: Public_transit","1: Towing","1: Truck","1: Airline","1: Restaurant","1: Hotel","1: Brand","1: Corporate_image","1: Symbols_and_artifacts_in_organizations","1: Japanese_school_uniform","1: Korean_school_uniform","1: Thailand","1: India","1: U.A.E","1: Singapore","1: China","1: New_Zealand","1: Blouse","1: Skirt","1: Culottes","1: Coat_of_arms","1: Motto","1: Emblem","1: Name_tag","1: Professional_sports","1: Football_kit","1: General_officer","1: Nathan_Farragut_Twining","1: Battledress","1: Dress_uniform","1: Ribbon_bars","1: Officer_of_arms","1: Domestic_worker","1: Employer","1: UK","1: Hong_Kong","1: Clothing","1: Income_tax","1: Scouting","1: Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell","1: Shirt","1: Campaign_hat","1: Manufactured","1: Antiques","1: Collectable","1: Court_dress","1: Court_uniform_and_dress_in_the_United_Kingdom","1: Dress_code","1: Political_uniform","1: Uniforms_and_equipment_of_the_British_police","1: Uniform_and_insignia_of_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America","1: Windsor_uniform"]}
