According to the 2002 census, it has an area of\n9,012&nbsp;km² with a population of 180,000.\n\nHistorically, Uchturpan is known for the anti-Qing uprising of the local Turkic\n(later \"Uyghur\") people there in 1776. During the turmoil, many fled, and the\nthousands who remained were killed by Sino-Manchu forces. Later, the area was\nrepopulated by migrants from what is now Southern Xinjiang.<ref>Laura J.
