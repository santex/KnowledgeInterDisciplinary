{"cursor":"2204","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn predicate logic 'universal instantiation' Copi and\nCohen Hurley Moore and Parker ('UI', also called\n'universal specification', and sometimes confused with Dictum de omni) is a\nvalid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals\nto the truth about a particular individual of that class. It is generally given\nas a quantification rule for the universal quantifier but it can also be encoded\nin an axiom. It is one of the basic principles used in quantification theory.\n\nExample: \"All dogs are mammals. Fido is a dog. Therefore Fido is a mammal.\"\n\nIn symbols the rule as an axiom schema is\n\n: \\forall x \\, A(x) \\Rightarrow A(a/x),\n\nfor some term a and where A(a/x) is the result of substituting a\nfor all occurrences of x in A.\n\nAnd as a rule of inference it is\n\nfrom â¢ âx A infer â¢ A(a/x),\n\nwith A(a/x) the same as above.\n\nIrving Copi noted that universal instantiation \"...follows from variants\nof rules for 'natural deduction', which were devised independently by\nGerhard Gentzen and Stanislaw Jaskowski in 1934.\" pg. 71.
