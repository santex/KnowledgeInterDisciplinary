{"cursor":"58182","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the field of computer networking, a 'URI scheme' is the top level of the\nuniform resource identifier (URI) naming structure. All URIs and absolute URI\nreferences are formed with a scheme name, followed by a colon character (\":\"),\nand the remainder of the URI called (in the outdated RFCs 1738 and 2396, but not\nthe current STD 66/RFC 3986) the scheme-specific part. The syntax and semantics\nof the scheme-specific part are left largely to the specifications governing\nindividual schemes, subject to certain constraints such as reserved characters\nand how to \"escape\" them.\n\nURI schemes are frequently and incorrectly referred to as \"protocols\", or\nspecifically as 'URI protocols' or '[[URL]] protocols', since most were\noriginally designed to be used with a particular protocol, and often have the\nsame name. The http scheme, for instance, is generally used for\ninteracting with web resources using HyperText Transfer Protocol. Today, URIs\nwith that scheme are also used for other purposes, such as RDF resource\nidentifiers and XML namespaces, that are not related to the protocol.\nFurthermore, some URI schemes are not associated with any specific protocol\n(e.g. \" file \") and many others do not use the name of a protocol as\ntheir prefix (e.g. \" news \").\n\nURI schemes should be registered with IANA, although non-registered schemes\nare used in practice. RFC 4395 describes the procedures for registering new\nURI schemes.\n","linknr":739,"url":"URI_scheme","recorded":1362540521,"links":17,"instances":["protocol","computing","operating_system","operating_system","web_browser","file_systems","software","software","application","organization","software","protocol","software","punctuation","file_format","application","web_browser","protocol"],"pdf":[],"categories":["URI
