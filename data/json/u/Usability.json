The\nobject of use can be a software application, website, book, tool, machine,\nprocess, or anything a human interacts with. A usability study may be conducted\nas a primary job function by a usability analyst or as a secondary job function\nby designers, technical writers, marketing personnel, and others. It is widely\nused in consumer electronics, communication, and knowledge transfer objects\n(such as a cookbook, a document or online help) and mechanical objects such as a\ndoor handle or a hammer.\n\nUsability includes methods of measuring usability, such as needs\nanalysis Karwowski W, Soares M M, Stanton, N A.

In human-computer\ninteraction and computer science, usability studies the elegance and clarity\nwith which the interaction with a computer program or a web site (web usability)\nis designed. Usability differs from user satisfaction and user experience\nbecause usability also considers usefulness.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Usability","recorded":1362575091,"links":52,"instances":["knowledge","interface_design","inclusion","marketing","computer_science","disambiguation","information_architecture","usability_consultant"],"pdf":["http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~saul/wiki/uploads/HCIPapers/gould-howto-2-pageperside-ocr.pdf"],"categories":["Usability|","Human–computer interaction","Behavioral and social facets of systemic risk","Technical communication"],"headings":["Introduction","Definition","Investigation","ISO standards","Usability considerations","Designing for usability","Evaluation methods","Evaluating with tests and metrics","Prototypes","Benefits of usability","Conclusion","Professional development","See also","References","Further reading","External links","",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/HumanProcessorModel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["jakob_nielsen","usability_consultant"],["jakob_nielsen","usability_consultant"],["intuition","knowledge"],["tree_testing","information_architecture"],["persona","marketing"],["performance","disambiguation"],["robustness","computer_science"],["design_for_all","inclusion"],["natural_mapping","interface_design"],["jakob_nielsen","usability_consultant"],["jakob_nielsen","usability_consultant"]],"members":["intuition","natural_mapping","design_for_all","persona","robustness","performance","tree_testing","jakob_nielsen"],"related":["Software_application","Tool","Machine","Designer","Technical_writer","Consumer_electronics","Communication","Knowledge_transfer","Online_help","Machine","Measurement","Needs_analysis","Human-computer_interaction","Computer_science","Interaction","Web_usability","Computer_user_satisfaction","User_Experience","Psychology","Physiology","Brand","Technology","Interaction","Market_research","User-centered_design","Paradigm","Participatory_design","De_facto","Accessibility","Ergonomic","Human_factors","Computer_software","Web_usability","Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)","Ben_Shneiderman","Learnability","International_Organization_for_Standardization","User_interface","Usability_testing","Usability_engineering","Non-functional_requirement","Intuition_(knowledge)","Learnability","Jef_Raskin","Bruce_Tognazzini","Iterative_design","User_experience","Ergonomics","Project_manager","ISO_9241","Task_analysis","Error_message","Accessibility","Usability_testing","Accessibility","Keyboard_shortcut","Undocumented_feature","Consistency","KISS_principle","Persona","Iterative_design","Comparison_of_usability_evaluation_methods","Aptitude","Keystroke_level_model","Card_sorting","Tree_testing_(information_architecture)","Findability","Visual_design","Ethnographic","Heuristic_evaluation","Usability_inspection","Focus_Groups","Statistical_survey","Paper_prototyping","Think_aloud_protocol","RITE_Method","Component-Based_Usability_Testing","Cognitive_walkthrough","Benchmarking","Meta-Analysis","Numerical_data","Persona_(marketing)","Alan_Cooper","Archetypes","Marketing","Web_analytics","Simulation","Performance_(disambiguation)","Robustness_(computer_science)","Information_technology_consulting","Kinesiology","Human–computer_interaction","Usability_Professionals'_Association","World_Usability_Day","Human_Factors_and_Ergonomics_Society","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","SIGCHI","ACM_SIGGRAPH","Society_for_Technical_Communication","Accessibility","Chief_Experience_Officer","CXO","Design_for_All_(inclusion)","Experience_design","User_experience_design","Fitts's_law","Form_follows_function","Gemba","Human_factors","GOMS","GUI","List_of_human-computer_interaction_topics","List_of_system_quality_attributes","Information_architecture","Interaction_design","Interactive_systems_engineering","Internationalization","Learnability","Natural_mapping_(interface_design)","Needs_analysis","System_Usability_Scale","Universal_usability","Usability_goals","Usability_testing","Usability_engineering","User_experience","RITE_method","Web_usability","World_Usability_Day","Donald_A._Norman","Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)","Jakob_Nielsen_(usability_consultant)","Ben_Shneiderman","Alan_Cooper"]}
