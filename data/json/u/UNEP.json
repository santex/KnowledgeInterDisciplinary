UNEP also\nhas six regional offices and various country offices.\n\nIts activities cover a wide range of issues regarding the atmosphere, marine\nand terrestrial ecosystems, environmental governance and green economy. It has\nplayed a significant role in developing international environmental\nconventions, promoting environmental science and information and illustrating\nthe way those can be implemented in conjunction with policy, working on the\ndevelopment and implementation of policy with national governments, regional\ninstitutions in conjunction with environmental Non-Governmental Organizations\n(NGOs). UNEP has also been active in funding and implementing environment\nrelated development projects.\n\nUNEP has aided in the formulation of guidelines and treaties on issues such as\nthe international trade in potentially harmful chemicals, transboundary air\npollution, and contamination of international waterways.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization and UNEP established the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988.
