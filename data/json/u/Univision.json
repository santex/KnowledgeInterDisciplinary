Randy Falco, (CEO as of June 29, 2011) COO, has\nbeen in charge of the company since the departure of Univision Communications\npresident and CEO Joe Uva in April 2010. In recent\nyears the network has reached parity with the U.S.'s five major English-language\ntelevision networks, and is often a strong fifth, outranking The CW, with some\nfourth-place weekly placings, and as of 2012, even first place rankings for\nindividual programs over all five English networks due to the network's\nconsistent schedule of new telenovelas all 52 weeks of the year.\n\nUnivisiÃ³n is headquartered in New York, [http://www.miamiherald.com/103/story/109381.html Miami\nHerald] and has its major studios, production facilities, and operations\nin Doral, Florida, a suburb of Miami. In 2009, another television studio was\nannounced, Univision Studios, to be built in Doral. [http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-\nnews/story/1369893.html Miami Herald] Univision is available on cable and\nsatellite in most of the country, with local stations in over 50 markets with\nlarge Hispanic and Latino populations and a national cable network feed\ndistributed in markets without either the availability or the demand for a locally-\nbased station. Most of these stations air full local news and other local\nprogramming in addition to network shows, and in major markets such as Los\nAngeles, New York, and Miami the local newscasts carried by the network's owned-and-\noperated station (O&O) stations are equally competitive with their English-\nlanguage counterparts ratings-wise.\n\nUnivisiÃ³n was acquired on March 29, 2007 by a consortium led by Haim Saban's\nSaban Capital Group (who had previously owned the entity Saban Entertainment),\nTPG Capital, L.P., Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners, and\nThomas H. Lee Partners for $13.7 billion or $36.25 per share plus $1.4 billion\nin acquired debt. [http://www.univision.net/corp/en/pr/Los_Angeles_27062006-\n0.html Univision] The buyout left the company with a debt level of twelve\ntimes its annual cash flow, which was twice the norm in buyouts done over the\nprevious two years.\n","linknr":1045,"url":"Univision","recorded":1362477651,"links":47,"instances":["news_anchor","usa","television_host"],"pdf":["http://i2.esmas.com/documents/2010/10/25/1193/televisa-y-univision-ampliaran-relacion-estrategica-en-eua.pdf"],"categories":["Spanish-language
