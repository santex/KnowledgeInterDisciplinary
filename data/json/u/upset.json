The\nunderdog then becomes a '[[Goliath|giant-killer]]'.\n\nThe meaning of the word has sometimes been erroneously attributed to the\nsurprising defeat of the horse Man o' War by the horse Upset (the loss was the\nonly one in Man o' War's career); in fact, the term pre-dates that 1919 race by\nat least several decades. In its sports coverage immediately following Upset's\nvictory, the Washington Post wrote, “One might make all sorts of puns about it\nbeing an upset.”\n",
