{"cursor":"30293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'United States customary units' are a system of measurements commonly used in\nthe United States. Many U.S. units are virtually identical to their imperial\ncounterparts, but the U.S. customary system developed from English units used in\nthe British Empire before the system of imperial units was standardized in 1824.\nSeveral numerical differences from the imperial system are present.\n\nThe vast majority of U.S. customary units have been defined in terms of the\nmeter and the kilogram since the Mendenhall Order of 1893 (and, in practice, for\nmany years before that date). T. C. Mendenhall,\nSuperintendent of Standard Weights and Measures,\n[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf Order of April 5, 1893], published\nas Appendix 6 to the Report for 1893 of the Coast and Geodetic\nSurvey. These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound\nagreement of 1959. Astin, A.V., Karo, H. A. and Mueller, F.\nH. (June 25, 1959). Doc 59-5442, \"[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-\n5442.pdf Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound].\" [[Federal\nRegister]]. When reading the document it helps to bear in mind that 999,998 =\n3937 Ã 254.\n\nAccording to the CIA Factbook, the United States is one of three countries (the\nothers being Liberia and Burma/Myanmar) that has not adopted the International\nSystem of Units (SI) metric system as their official system of weights and\nmeasures. The U.S. does not primarily use SI units in its commercial activities,\nalthough they are standard in science, medicine, and government (including the\nU.S. Armed Forces), as well as many sectors of industry.\n","linknr":443,"url":"United_States_customary_units","recorded":1362584704,"links":35,"instances":["unit","container","volume","unit","mass","unit","length","unit","mass","mass","unit","unit","unit","volume","unit","physics","unit","insulation","unit","typography","typography","unit","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app3.pdf","http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app9.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/sp447.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/HB44-09-Combined.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/stlaw.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/AppendC-09-HB44-FINAL.pdf","http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/SAE%20Metric%20Users%20Guide.pdf","http://www.sae.org/exdomains/standardsdev/global_resources/SAE%20Metric%20Users%20Guide.pdf"],"categories":["Customary
