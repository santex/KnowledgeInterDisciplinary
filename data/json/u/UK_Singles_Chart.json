{"cursor":"60769","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'UK Singles Chart', full name the Official Singles Chart, is compiled by The\nOfficial Charts Company on behalf of the British record industry. The full chart\ncontains the weekly top-selling 200 single recordings in the United Kingdom,\nbased upon combined record sales and download numbers. However, some media\noutlets only list the Top 40 (such as the BBC) or the Top 75 (such as [[Music\nWeek]] magazine) of this list. Around 6,500 British retail outlets contribute\nsales data, as well as most UK online digital-download stores. Unlike charts in\nthe United States, no airplay statistics are used for the official UK Singles\nChart. The chart week runs from 00:01 Sunday to midnight Saturday,\nwith most UK digital singles being released on Sundays (followed by CD releases\non Monday).\n\nThe Top 40 chart is first released on Sunday afternoons by BBC Radio 1 before\nthe full Official Singles Chart Top 100 is posted on the\n[http://www.officialcharts.com Official Charts Company's website],\nwith the top 75 being printed in [[Music Week]] magazine the following Monday\nand the top 200 appearing in the independent newsletter UKChartsPlus on\nWednesdays. It is also published online. Radio 1 broadcasts [[The Official\nChart]] on Sundays from 16:00 to 19:00. The show had various presenters over the\nyears, including Tommy Vance, Mark Goodier, Bruno Brookes and Alan Freeman whose\nPick Of The Pops was the chart show from the 1960s into the early 1970s. From\nOctober 2007 to December 2012, Reggie Yates presented the chart show (until\nSeptember 2009 with Fearne Cotton). Cotton was the first permanent female\npresenter of the Official Chart Show. Since January 2013, Jameela\nJamil has presented the show. A rival chart show, The Big Top 40 Show, is based\non downloads and commercial radio airplay and is broadcast on 140 commercial\nlocal radio stations.\n\nAccording to the Official Charts Company, the official British singles chart was\nthe [[New Musical Express]] chart from 1952 to 1960, the [[Record Retailer]]\nchart from 1960 to 1969 and the Official UK Singles Chart since 1969.\n\nAccording to the Official Charts Company's statistics, as of 1 July 2012 1,200\nsingles have topped the UK singles chart. The precise number of chart-\ntoppers is debatable due to the profusion of competing charts from the 1950s to\nthe 1980s, but the usual list used is that endorsed by the Guinness Book of\nBritish Hit Singles and subsequently adopted by the Official UK Charts Company.\nThere was no \"official\" chart before Tuesday, 11 February 1969. Prior to this\nthe BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the\ntime; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and [[Top\nof the Pops]] prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the\nabove criteria.\n","linknr":1274,"url":"UK_Singles_Chart","recorded":1362477664,"links":67,"instances":["disc_jockey","song","band","entertainer","broadcaster_and_actor","nelly_furtado_song","band","band","rihanna_song","band","uk","song","broadcaster","leonard_cohen_song","uk","christina_aguilera_song","gnarls_barkley_song","song","song","snow_patrol_song","song","song","song","song","song","dj","uk","disc_jockey","music","marketing","band","the_troggs_song","song","1953_song","magazine","song","uk"],"pdf":["http://www.zobbel.de/bdc/BDC1.pdf","http://www.zobbel.de/bdc/BDC1.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1989/UK%20Charts%201989.05.06.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1989/UK%20Charts%201989.05.06.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1991/UK%20Charts%201991.04.06.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1991/UK%20Charts%201991.04.06.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1991/UK%20Charts%201991.04.13.pdf","http://scans.chartarchive.org/UK/1991/UK%20Charts%201991.04.13.pdf","http://support.medusabusiness.com/documents/bpi-filesharing.pdf","http://support.medusabusiness.com/documents/bpi-filesharing.pdf","http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/Official%20UK%20Singles%20Chart%20Rules%20August%202009.pdf","http://www.zobbel.de/bdc/BDC1.pdf"],"categories":["BBC
