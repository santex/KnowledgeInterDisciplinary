The organization enjoyed its greatest strength in the 1920s,\nprior to Garvey's deportation from the United States of America, after which its\nprestige and influence declined. Since a in 1949, there have been two\norganizations claiming the name.\n\nAccording to the preamble of the 1929 constitution as amended, the UNIA is a\n\"social, friendly, humanitarian, charitable, educational, institutional,\nconstructive and expansive society, and is founded by persons desiring to do the\nutmost to work for the general uplift of the people of African ancestry of the\nworld. And the members pledge themselves to do all in their power to conserve\nthe rights of their noble race and to respect the rights of all mankind,\nbelieving always in the Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God. The motto\nof the organization is 'One God! One Aim! One Destiny!' Therefore, let justice\nbe done to all mankind, realizing that if the strong oppresses the weak,\nconfusion and discontent will ever mark the path of man but with love, faith and\ncharity towards all the reign of peace and plenty will be heralded into the\nworld and the generations of men shall be called Blessed.\"\n\nThe broad mission of the UNIA-ACL led to the establishment of numerous auxiliary\ncomponents, among them the Universal African Legion, a paramilitary group; the\nAfrican Black Cross Nurses; African Black Cross Society; the Universal African\nMotor Corps; the Black Eagle Flying Corps; the Black Star Steamship Line; the\nBlack Cross Trading and Navigation Corporation; as well as the Negro Factories\nCorporation.\n","linknr":485,"url":"Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League","recorded":1362551710,"links":32,"instances":["1890","member_of_unia","harlem","bruce_grit","1899"],"pdf":["http://www.galegroup.com/pdf/scguides/universalnegro1/uniawrintro.pdf"],"categories":["African
