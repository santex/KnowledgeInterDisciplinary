The word was coined\nby Reuben Louis Goodstein, from tetra- (four) and iteration. Tetration is used\nfor the notation of very large numbers. Shown here are examples of the first\nfour hyper operators, with tetration as the fourth (and succession, the unary\noperation denoted <math>a' = a + 1</math> taking <math>a</math> and yielding the\nnumber after <math>a</math>, as the 0th): #Addition\n#:<math>a + n = a\\!\\underbrace{''{}^{\\cdots}{}'}_n</math> :a succeeded n times.\n#Multiplication\n#:<math>a \\times n = \\underbrace{a + a + \\cdots + a}_n</math> :a added to\n#:itself, n times.\n#Exponentiation\n#:<math>a^n = \\underbrace{a \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times a}_n</math> :a\n#:multiplied by itself, n times.\n#Tetration\n#:<math>{^{n}a} = \\underbrace{a^{a^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{a}}}}}_n</math> :a\n#:exponentiated by itself, n times.\n\nwhere each operation is defined by iterating the previous one (the next\noperation in the sequence is pentation). The peculiarity of the tetration among\nthese operations is that the first three (addition, multiplication and\nexponentiation) are generalized for complex values of n, while for tetration, no\nsuch regular generalization is yet established; and tetration is not considered\nan elementary function.\n\nAddition (<math>a + n</math>) is the most basic operation, multiplication\n(<math>an</math>) is also a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can\nbe thought of as a chained addition involving n numbers a, and exponentiation\n(<math>a^n</math>) can be thought of as a chained multiplication involving n\nnumbers a. Analogously, tetration (<math>^{n}a</math>) can be thought of as a\nchained power involving n numbers a. The parameter a may be called the base-\nparameter in the following, while the parameter n in the following may be called\nthe height-parameter (which is integral in the first approach but may be\ngeneralized to fractional, real and complex heights, see below).\n","title":"Tetration","headings":["Definition","Iterated powers vs. iterated bases/exponentiation","Terminology","Notation","Examples","Extensions","Open questions","Inverse relations","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Exponentiation","3: Iterated_function","3: Hyper_operator","3: Complex_number","2: Hyperoperation","2: Elementary_function","2: Real_number","2: Ackermann_function","2: Infinity","2: Nth_root","1: Mathematics","1: Reuben_Louis_Goodstein","1: Tetra-","1: Large_numbers#Standardized_system_of_writing_very_large_numbers","1: Successor_function","1: Addition","1: Multiplication","1: Pentation","1: Integer","1: Associative","1: Right-associative","1: Coprime","1: Euler's_theorem","1: Goodstein's_theorem","1: Ultra_exponential_function","1: Exponential_function","1: Rudy_Rucker","1: Knuth's_up-arrow_notation","1: Conway_chained_arrow_notation","1: Integral_Transforms_and_Special_Functions","1: Hyper_operation","1: ASCII","1: Large_numbers","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Principal_branch","1: Euler's_formula","1: Complex_plane","1: Euler","1: Leonhard_Euler","1: Lambert's_W_function","1: Convex_function","1: Inflection_point","1: Tetration#Iterated_powers","1: Functional_equation","1: Conjecture","1: Mathematics_of_Computation","1: Holomorphic","1: Entire_function","1: Holomorphism","1: Real-analytic","1: Pi","1: Logarithms","1: Inverse_function","1: Lambert_W_function","1: PostScript","1: Square_root","1: Data_cluster","1: Tetration#Linear_approximation_for_the_extension_to_real_heights","1: Tetration#Extension_to_infinite_heights","1: Gelfondâ€“Schneider_theorem","1: Transcendental_number","1: Double_exponential_function","1: Iterated_logarithm","1: Symmetric_level-index_arithmetic"]}
