Located in Beltsville, Maryland, it is one of four national\nlibraries of the United States (along with the Library of Congress, the National\nLibrary of Medicine, and the National Library of Education). It is also the\ncoordinator for the Agriculture Network Information Center, a national network\nof state land-grant institutions and coordinator for the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (USDA) field libraries.\n\nNAL was established on May 15, 1862, by the signing of the Organic Act by\nAbraham Lincoln. It served as a departmental library until 1962, when the\nSecretary of Agriculture officially designated it as the National Agricultural\nLibrary. The first librarian, appointed in 1867, was Aaron B. Grosh, one of the\nfounders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry.\n","linknr":284,"url":"United_States_National_Agricultural_Library","recorded":1362540305,"links":26,"instances":["librarian"],"pdf":["http://nal.usda.gov/about/Learn_about_NAL.pdf","http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/bitstream/2142/7672/1/librarytrendsv38i3c_opt.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/pdfs/2010director.pdf","http://agricola.nal.usda.gov/help/AGRICOLADoc2006.pdf"],"categories":["National libraries","Research libraries","Agriculture in the United States|National Agricultural Library","United States Department of Agriculture facilities|National Agricultural Library","Library buildings completed in 1969","Buildings and structures in Prince George's County, Maryland","Libraries in Maryland","1862 establishments in Maryland","Libraries established in 1862"],"headings":["History","Facilities","Services","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/US-NationalAgriculturalLibrary-Logo.svg/100px-US-NationalAgriculturalLibrary-Logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/United_States_National_Agricultural_Library.jpg/200px-United_States_National_Agricultural_Library.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/National_Agricultural_Library_by_Matthew_Bisanz.jpg/220px-National_Agricultural_Library_by_Matthew_Bisanz.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/US-DeptOfAgriculture-Seal2.svg/140px-US-DeptOfAgriculture-Seal2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/24px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/US-DeptOfAgriculture-Seal2.svg/30px-US-DeptOfAgriculture-Seal2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg/30px-Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/US-DeptOfTransportation-Seal.svg/30px-US-DeptOfTransportation-Seal.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/US-DeptOfHHS-Seal.svg/30px-US-DeptOfHHS-Seal.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/US-DeptOfEducation-Seal.svg/30px-US-DeptOfEducation-Seal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ralph_r._shaw","librarian"],["ralph_r._shaw","librarian"]],"members":[],"related":["National_library","Beltsville,_Maryland","Washington_D.C.","United_States","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Beltsville,_Maryland","Library_of_Congress","National_Library_of_Medicine","National_Library_of_Education","Agriculture_Network_Information_Center","Land-grant_university","Abraham_Lincoln","Aaron_B._Grosh","National_Grange","Abraham_Lincoln","Library_classification","American_Documentation_Institute","World_War_II","Ralph_R._Shaw_(Librarian)","Orville_Freeman","National_library","Dan_Glickman","Aaron_B._Grosh","Ralph_R._Shaw_(Librarian)","Foster_E._Mohrhardt","Henry_A._Wallace_Beltsville_Agricultural_Research_Center","Washington,_D.C.","Bibliographic_database","International_Bibliographic_Information_on_Dietary_Supplements"]}
