{"cursor":"3641","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In parliamentary procedure, 'unanimous consent', also known as 'general\nconsent', or in the case of the parliaments under the Westminster system, 'leave\nof the house', is a situation in which no one present objects to a proposal. The\nchair may state, for instance: \"If there is no objection, the motion will be\nadopted. [pause] Since there is no objection, the motion is adopted\" or in\nWestminster parliaments, \"There being no objection, leave is granted.\" On the\nmost routine matters, such as inserting an article into the [[Congressional\nRecord]], the chair may shorten this statement to four words: \"Without\nobjection, so ordered\" or even to two words: \"Without objection\" (Latin: 'nemine\ncontradicente') If no member objects the motion is adopted, but if any member\ndoes declare his opposition the motion is not adopted and cannot be agreed to\nwithout a vote.\n\nUnanimous consent can greatly expedite business by eliminating the need\nfor formal votes on routine procedural questions in which the existence of\na consensus is likely. The principle behind it is that procedural\nsafeguards designed to protect a minority can be waived when there is no\nminority to protect.\n\nThat a bill, treaty or nomination passes by unanimous consent does not\nnecessarily indicate that every member of the body would have voted in favor of\nthe proposal. Chapter 2, Section 4  It is sometimes used simply as a\ntime-saving device, especially at the end of the session. Sometimes members do\nnot want a formal recorded vote on the issue, or know that they would lose such\na vote and not feel a need to take the time. Conversely, raising an objection\ndoes not necessarily imply that the objector disagrees with the proposal itself;\nhe may simply believe it would be better to take a formal vote.\n\nIn non-legislative deliberative bodies operating under [[Robert's Rules of\nOrder]], the unanimous consent device is often used to expedite the procedural\nconsideration of uncontroversial secondary motions.\n\nSometimes unanimous consent can be assumed if the chair perceives that no one\nwould raise an objection if he formally asked. For instance, if it is obvious\nthat the members of an assembly are absorbed in listening to a speaker who has\nexceeded the time limits on debate, but is about to conclude his remarks, the\nchair may allow him to continue without interruption. > Another\nexample of this practice in the House of Representatives is when a series of\nvotes has been interrupted by a speaker or other business. The chair will state,\n\"Without objection, five minute voting will continue.\"\n\nCertain rights of the minority can only be waived by unanimous consent. For\nexample, in disciplinary procedures, \"a single member can require the vote on\nthe imposition of a penalty to be taken by ballot.\"\n","linknr":95,"url":"Unanimous_consent","recorded":1374543684,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure","/wiki/Westminster_system","/wiki/Chairman","/wiki/Congressional_Record","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order","/wiki/Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Disciplinary_procedures","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Nelson_Mandela","/wiki/Thembu","/wiki/Quaker#Decision_making_among_Friends","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Silence_procedure","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nemine_contradicente","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Long_Walk_to_Freedom_(book)","/wiki/Little,_Brown_and_Company","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&oldid=556327765","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Parliamentary_procedure","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Unanimous+consent&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Unanimous+consent","/wiki/Unanimous_consent","/wiki/Talk:Unanimous_consent","#","/wiki/Unanimous_consent","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Unanimous_consent","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Unanimous_consent","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&oldid=556327765","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7882284","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Unanimous_consent&id=556327765","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Unanimous+consent","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Unanimous+consent&oldid=556327765&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Unanimous_consent&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7882284#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_consent","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["parliamentary_procedure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parliamentary
