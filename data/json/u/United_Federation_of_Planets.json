In those episodes and\nfilms, the Federation is described as an interstellar federal polity with, as of\nthe year 2373, more than 150 member planets and thousands of colonies spread\nacross 8,000 light years of the Milky Way Galaxy and taking the form of a post-\ncapitalist liberal democracy and constitutional republic. [[Star Trek: First\nContact]] It has also been described as a utopian socialist society. The\nFederation is described as stressing, at least nominally, the values of\nuniversal liberty, equality, justice, peace and cooperation. Picard's\nstatement to the Borg Collective immediately after being captured in the 1990\nthird season finale of [[Star Trek: The Next Generation]], \"The Best Of Both\nWorlds, Part I,\" indicated freedom and self-determination as central tenets of\nthe Federation. The 1991 fourth season NextGen episode \"The Drumhead\"\nestablished the Federation Constitution's Seventh Guarantee, a principle similar\nto the United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment, that protects citizens\nagainst self-incrimination. The 1994 second season [[Star Trek: Deep Space\nNine|Deep Space Nine]] episode \"The Maquis, Part I\" established the Federation\nCode of Justice, which insures that defendants are innocent until proven guilty,\nand that if innocent, will be set free. The 1996 fourth season Deep Space Nine\nepisode \"Accession\" indicated that the Federation refused membership to planets\nthat practiced caste systems. The 1996 second season [[Star Trek: Voyager]]\nepisode \"Meld\" establishes Directive 101, allowing an individual accused of a\ncrime to remain silent, much like the United States Miranda law. All of this is\ncorroborated in Michael and Denise Okuda's [[Star Trek Encyclopedia]], Second\nEdition; 1997. The Federation also maintains its own quasi-militaristic\nand scientific exploratory agency, known as Starfleet (also written as \"Star\nFleet\" in some texts). Starfleet is seen handling many other governmental\nprocesses, sometimes with no other agency's influence, such as border defense,\ndiplomatic envoy and has seen extensive use as an offensive military force just\nto name a few instances.\n\nThe legislature of the Federation Council is located at the Presidio of San\nFrancisco. This is established in [[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] and\ncorroborated in the [[Star Trek: Enterprise]] installment [[In a Mirror, Darkly\n(Enterprise episode)|In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II]].\" Several other\nbodies of the Federation have been depicted. There is an [[Executive\n(government)|executive branch]] headed by a Federation President,\nwho keeps offices in the [[Place de la Concorde|Palais de la Concorde]] in\n[[Paris, France|Paris]]. There is a [[judiciary]] branch as well, the highest\ncourt of which is the Federation Supreme Court. This is referred to in\n\"[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]\" in.'' The Federation's scientific,\ndiplomatic and defensive/military arm is Starfleet, depicted as being\nheadquartered at Fort Baker, just north of San Francisco across the Golden Gate\nBridge. The Federation comes into military conflict with other major powers in\nthe galaxy such as the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, the Cardassian\nUnion, the Borg, and the Dominion.\n\nThe United Federation of Planets has existed as part of the Star Trek universe\nsince the first season of the and is the primary focus of all the Star Trek\nseries, with the exception of [[Star Trek: Enterprise]], which is set before the\nFederation comes into existence.\n","linknr":643,"url":"United_Federation_of_Planets","recorded":1362534896,"links":51,"instances":["moon","star_trek","voyager_episode","last_unicorn","star_trek","enterprise_episode","enterprise_episode","enterprise_episode","star_trek","star_trek","ds9_episode","enterprise_episode","voyager_episode","tng_episode","ds9_episode","ds9_episode","star_trek","star_trek"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Star
