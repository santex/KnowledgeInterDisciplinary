(Source: [[United States\nGeological Survey]].)]]\n\nThe 'vadose zone', also (but somewhat incorrectly) termed the unsaturated\nzone, is the part of Earth between the land surface and the top of the\nphreatic zone i.e. the position at which the groundwater (the water in the\nsoil's pores) is at atmospheric pressure (\"vadose\" is from the Latin for\n\"shallow\"). Hence the vadose zone extends from the top of the ground surface\nto the water table. Water in the vadose zone has a pressure head less than\natmospheric pressure, and is retained by a combination of adhesion (funiculary\ngroundwater), and capillary action (capillary groundwater). If the vadose zone\nenvelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine\ngrained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully\nsaturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. In such\nsoils, therefore, the unsaturated zone is the upper section of the vadose zone\nand not identical to it.\n\nMovement of water within the vadose zone is studied within soil physics and\nhydrology, particularly hydrogeology, and is of importance to agriculture,\ncontaminant transport, and flood control. The Richards equation is often used to\nmathematically describe the flow of water, which is based partially on Darcy's\nlaw. Groundwater recharge, which is an important process that refills aquifers,\ngenerally occurs through the vadose zone from precipitation.\n\nIn speleology, cave passages formed in the vadose zone tend to be canyon-like in\nshape, as the water dissolves bedrock on the floor of the\npassage.
