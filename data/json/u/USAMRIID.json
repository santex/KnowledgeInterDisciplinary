It is\nlocated on Fort Detrick, Maryland and is a subordinate lab of the U. S. Army\nMedical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), headquartered on the same\ninstallation.\n\nUSAMRIID is the only U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory equipped to\nstudy highly hazardous viruses at Biosafety Level 4 within positive pressure\npersonnel suits.\n\nUSAMRIID employs both military and civilian scientists as well as highly\nspecialized support personnel, in all about 800 people. In the 1950s and '60s,\nUSAMRIID and its predecessor unit pioneered unique, state-of-the-art\nbiocontainment facilities which it continues to maintain and upgrade.\nInvestigators at its facilities frequently collaborate with the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and major\nbiomedical and academic centers worldwide.\n\nUSAMRIID was the first bio-facility of its type to research the Ames strain of\nanthrax, determined through genetic analysis to be the bacterium used in the\n2001 anthrax attacks.
