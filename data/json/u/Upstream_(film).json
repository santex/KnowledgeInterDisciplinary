A \"backstage\ndrama\", the film is about a Shakespearean actor and a\nwoman from a knife-throwing act. The film was considered to be a lost film, but in 2009 it was discovered in the New Zealand Film\nArchive.\n\nIt is considered to be the first Ford film to show some influence of German\ndirector F. W. Murnau, who began working at Fox Studios in 1926. From Murnau,\nFord learned how to use forced perspectives and chiaroscuro lighting, which the\nAmerican director then integrated into his own more naturalistic and direct\nfilmmaking style.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Upstream_(film)","recorded":1362676192,"links":15,"instances":["actor","actor"],"pdf":["http://www.cinetecadelfriuli.org/gcm/allegati/GCM10_07R&R.pdf"],"categories":["1927 films","American films","American silent feature films","Black-and-white films","1920s comedy films","Films directed by John Ford","20th Century Fox films"],"headings":["Recovery","Cast","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["raymond_hitchcock","actor"],["francis_ford","actor"]],"members":["raymond_hitchcock","francis_ford"],"related":["John_Ford","Randall_Faye","Earle_Foxe","Charles_G._Clarke","Fox_Film_Corporation","Silent_film","Comedy_film","John_Ford","Lost_film","New_Zealand_Film_Archive","F._W._Murnau","Chiaroscuro","New_Zealand_Film_Archive","National_Film_Preservation_Foundation","Nitrate_film","John_Ford","New_Zealand_Film_Archive","20th_Century_Fox","National_Film_Preservation_Foundation","Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","Earle_Foxe","Grant_Withers","Lydia_Yeamans_Titus","Raymond_Hitchcock_(actor)","Emile_Chautard","Jane_Winton","Francis_Ford_(actor)","List_of_rediscovered_films"]}
