{"cursor":"1869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer networking, 'upstream' refers to the direction in which data can be\ntransferred from the client to the server (uploading). This differs greatly from\ndownstream not only in theory and usage, but also in that upstream speeds are\nusually at a premium. Whereas downstream speed is important to the average home\nuser for purposes of downloading content, uploads are used mainly for web server\napplications and similar processes where the sending of data is critical.\nUpstream speeds are also important to users of peer-to-peer software.\n\n\nADSL and cable modems are asymmetric, with the upstream data rate much lower\nthan that of its downstream. Symmetric connections such as Symmetric Digital\nSubscriber Line (SDSL) and T1, however, offer identical upstream and\ndownstream rates.\n\nIf a node A on the Internet is closer (fewer hops away) to the Internet backbone\nthan a node B, then A is said to be upstream of B or conversely, B is downstream\nof A. Related to this is the idea of 'upstream providers'. An upstream provider\nis usually a large ISP that provides Internet access to a local ISP. Hence, the\nword upstream also refers to the data connection between two ISPs.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Upstream_(networking)","recorded":1362676192,"links":14,"instances":["computing","networking","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data transmission"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Upstream-downstream.svg/260px-Upstream-downstream.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Crystal_Clear_app_network.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_app_network.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["client","computing"],["server","computing"],["downstream","computer_science"],["downstream","networking"]],"members":["client","downstream","server"],"related":["Computer_networking","Client_(computing)","Server_(computing)","Uploading_and_downloading","Downstream_(computer_science)","Uploading_and_downloading","Web_server","Peer-to-peer","Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line","Cable_modem","Symmetry","Symmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line","T-carrier","Internet_backbone","Internet_service_provider","Downstream_(networking)","Upstream_server","Return_channel"]}
