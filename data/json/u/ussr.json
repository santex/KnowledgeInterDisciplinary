continent that existed\nbetween 1922 and 1991, governed as a single-party state by the Communist Party\nwith Moscow as its capital.<ref>Bridget O'Laughlin (1975) Marxist Approaches in\nAnthropology Annual Review of Anthropology Vol. 4: pp. 341–70 (October 1975)\n.<br />William Roseberry (1997) Marx and Anthropology Annual Review of\nAnthropology, Vol. 26: pp. 25–46 (October 1997) </ref> A union of multiple\nsubnational Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly\ncentralized.\n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the Russian Revolution of 1917, which deposed\nthe imperial autocracy. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, then overthrew\nthe Provisional Government. The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was\nestablished and the Russian Civil War began. The Red Army entered several\nterritories of the former Russian Empire and helped local communists seize\npower. In 1922, the Bolsheviks were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with\nthe unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian\nrepublics. Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika collective leadership and a\nbrief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin\ncommitted the state ideology to Marxism–Leninism and initiated a centrally\nplanned economy. As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid\nindustrialisation and collectivisation which laid the basis for its later war\neffort and dominance after World War II.<ref name=\"StalinRobertService\"></ref>\nHowever, Stalin repressed both Communist Party members and elements of the\npopulation through his authoritarian rule.\n\nIn the beginning of World War II, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact\nwith Nazi Germany, initially avoiding confrontation, but the treaty was\ndisregarded in 1941 when the Nazis invaded, opening the largest and bloodiest\ntheatre of combat in history. Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest\nproportion of the conflict, in the cost to acquire the upper hand over Axis\nforces at intense battles such as Stalingrad, eventually driving through Eastern\nEurope and capturing Berlin in 1945, inflicting the vast majority of German\nlosses.<ref>Norman Davies: \"Since 75%–80% of all German losses were inflicted on\nthe eastern front it follows that the efforts of the Western allies accounted\nfor only 20%–25%\". Source: Sunday Times, 05/11/2006.</ref> Soviet occupied\nterritory conquered from Axis forces in Central and Eastern Europe became\nsatellite states of the Eastern Bloc. Ideological and political differences with\nWestern Bloc counterparts directed by the United States led to the forming of\neconomic and military pacts, culminating in the prolonged Cold War.\n\nA de-Stalinization period followed Stalin's death, reducing the harshest aspects\nof society. The Soviet Union then went on to initiate significant technological\nachievements of the 20th century, including launching the first ever satellite\nand world's first human spaceflight, which led it into the Space Race. The 1962\nCuban Missile Crisis marked a period of extreme tension between the two\nsuperpowers, considered the closest to a mutual nuclear confrontation. In the\n1970s, a relaxation of relations followed, but tensions resumed with Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The occupation drained economic resources and\ndragged on without achieving meaningful political results.<ref></ref><ref\nname=\"turner23\"></ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform\nthe Union, introducing the policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] in an\nattempt to end the period of economic stagnation and democratize the government.\nHowever, this led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements.\nCentral authorities initiated a referendum, boycotted by the Baltic republics\nand Georgia, which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in\nfavour of preserving the Union as a renewed federation. In August 1991, a coup\nd'état was attempted by hardliners against Gorbachev, with the intention of\nreversing his policies. The coup failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin\nplaying a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of\nthe Communist Party. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining\n12 constituent republics emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as\nindependent post-Soviet states.<ref name = \"Byrd\"></ref> The Russian Federation,\nthe successor state of the Russian SFSR, assumed the Soviet Union's rights and\nobligations and is recognised as its continued legal personality.<ref>\"Russia is\nnow a party to any Treaties to which the former Soviet Union was a party, and\nenjoys the same rights and obligations as the former Soviet Union, except\ninsofar as adjustments are necessarily required, e.g. to take account of the\nchange in territorial extent. [...] The Russian federation continues the legal\npersonality of the former Soviet Union and is thus not a successor State in the\nsense just mentioned. The other former Soviet Republics are successor States.\",\nUnited Kingdom Materials on International Law 1993, BYIL 1993, pp. 579\n(636).</ref>\n","title":"Soviet%20Union","headings":["Geography,
