This\n        includes campus funded tutoring, freshman seminar courses, and\n        intramural sports among many other things. These programs are important\n        when it comes to campus life because it has been shown that student\n        involvement is directly related to student success. Astin, Alexander\n        W.. Achieving educational excellence. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass,1985.\n        Print. When a student participates, he or she forms both social\n        and emotional ties to the university that both encourage the student to\n        do well academically and reduce the chance that the student will drop\n        out of school entirely or leave for another university.\n\n        The economy also has a noticeable effect on retention rates. In general,\n        tuition has been steadily climbing at universities since the mid 1980âs.\n        The cost of public and private institutions in the 1999-2000 school\n        year, which includes tuition and on campus housing, averaged $7,302 and\n        $20,277, respectively. After adjusting for inflation, this represented a\n        22% cost increase at public institutions and a 27% increase at private\n        institutions for the 10-year period between the 1989-1990 and 1999-2000\n        academic years.

Washington DC: U.S.Government\n        Printing Office. This rise in cost has made it difficult for many\n        students and their families to pay for college. According to the\n        National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, tuition at a 4-\n        year college represented 12% of the total income for families that fell\n        into the lowest income bracket in 1980, and rose drastically to\n        encompass 25% of their income by 2000.

San Jose, CA.\n        Print. This has created an influx of part-time students and\n        working students. In the undergraduate population, 50% of students\n        describe themselves as working primarily to pay for their education at\n        an average of 25 hours per week.

Print. \n        This leaves working students little time to become involved on campus\n        and actively participate in university life. Indeed, working-class\n        students, who spend more time in paid employment, are significantly less\n        integrated into university life than middle-class students.\n        In spite of all of the programs and services to help retain students,\n        according to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for\n        Educational Statistics, only 50% of those who enter higher education\n        actually earn a bachelor's degree.

Though research is still needed in this\n        area, it is becoming clear that there may be a link between the\n        increased amount of working students and declining retention rates.\n\nAdditional counseling is often available for financial issues. Private\ncounseling and private tutoring are other options for students.\n\nPrivate corporations are looking into the business of student retention as a\npotential new field of revenue. This has led to problematic outsourcing\nstrategies, such as the case of the University of Texas' system $ 10 million\ninvestment into the private company Myedu. http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/11/02/ut-systems-10-million-\ninvestment-myedu-sparks-controversy Data on the amount of corporate\nlobbying addressed to the Board of Regents of State Universities is not\navailable.\n\nAt the same time, there is a great deal that administrators at the school and\ncollege level as well as faculty at the course level can do to improve student\nretention. For instance, in online courses where attrition has been reported\neven higher than in traditional face-to-face courses, faculty can strive to make\nconnections and meed the needs of individual students Dunlap, J.
