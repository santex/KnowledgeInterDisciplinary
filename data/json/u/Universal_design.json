{"cursor":"18810","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Universal design' refers to broad-spectrum ideas meant to produce buildings,\nproducts and environments that are inherently accessible to both people without\ndisabilities and people with disabilities.\n\nThe term \"universal design\" was coined by the architect Ronald L. Mace to\ndescribe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be\naesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of\ntheir age, ability, or status in life. [http://design.ncsu.edu/alumni-friends/alumni-profiles/ronald-\nmace Ronald L. Mace on NC State University, College of Design] However, it\nwas the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963),\nwho really pioneered the concept of free access for disabled people. His most\nsignificant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb - now a standard\nfeature of the built environment.\n\nUniversal design emerged from slightly earlier 'barrier-free' concepts, the\nbroader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also\nseeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy\nrises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant\ninjuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal\ndesign. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong\nmarket penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been\nadopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the\ndesign of technology, instruction, services, and other products and\nenvironments.\n\nCurb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used\nby all, are a common example. Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that\nassists those with visual or dexterity problems are another. There are also\ncabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to\naccommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's\npublic transit systems, low-floor buses that \"kneel\" (bring their front end to\nground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-\nboard lifts.\n","linknr":500,"url":"Universal_design","recorded":1362575088,"links":36,"instances":["knowledge","engineering","vision"],"pdf":["http://www.accessibletourism.org/resources/uk_museumsand-galleries_disability_directory_pdf_6877.pdf"],"categories":["Accessible building","Architectural design","Architecture","Architectural theory","Design","Accessibility"],"headings":["The Principles of Universal Design","Examples","Design standards","Design For All (DfA)","The \"Barrier-Free\" concept","National legislation","Regional legislation","Funding Agencies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg/16px-Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["contrast","vision"],["flexibility","engineering"],["intuition","knowledge"]],"members":["intuition","flexibility","contrast"],"related":["Disabled","Architect","Ronald_L._Mace","Accessibility","Adaptive_technology","Assistive_technology","Aesthetics","Life_expectancy","Modern_medicine","Contrast_(vision)","Public_transit","Bus","Wheelchair_ramp","Social_equality","Flexibility_(engineering)","Simplicity","Intuition_(knowledge)","Perception","Fault_tolerance","Accessible_design","Captioning","International_Code_Council","American_Institute_of_Architects","China","Japan","South_Korea","Beijing,_China","2008_Summer_Olympics","International_Organization_for_Standardization","European_Committee_for_Electrotechnical_Standardization","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","CEN/CENELEC_Guide_6","European_Commission","Elderly","Disabilities","Accessibility","Velcro","Electric_Toothbrush","Tactile_paving","Automatic_door","Low-floor_bus","Google","Audiobook","Information_society","Information_and_Communication_Technologies","Social_network","Building","Disabled","Wheelchair_ramp","Wheelchair","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990","Ireland","Disability_Act_2005","Italy","Australia","Disability_Discrimination_Act_1992","France","U.S.A","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act","Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973","United_Kingdom","Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995","Disability_Discrimination_Act_2005","Equality_Act_2010","Ontario,_Canada","Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_Act,_2005","National_Institute_on_Disability_and_Rehabilitation_Research","Rehabilitation_Engineering_Research_Center","Center_for_Inclusive_Design_and_Environmental_Access","University_at_Buffalo"]}
