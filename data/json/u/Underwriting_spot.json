These spots usually\nmention the name of the sponsor, and can resemble traditional television\nadvertisements in commercial broadcasting. However, there are legal\nrestrictions, such as a prohibition of making product claims, announcing prices,\nor providing an incentive to buy a product or service. In the U.S., these\nrestrictions apply to all non-commercial educational (NCE) stations, and even\nfor non-sponsoring companies and products.\n\nDonors who contribute funding can include corporations, small businesses,\nphilanthropic organizations, charitable trusts, and individuals.\n\nCriticisms include inhibiting influences on public affairs programs (even self-\ncensorship) where investigative journalism is featured and tendencies toward the\nuse of non-artistic criteria in determining the selection of programs, such as\nsymphony broadcasts on radio and theatrical productions on television.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Underwriting_spot","recorded":1362566182,"links":14,"instances":["broadcasting","commercial"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Broadcasting","Promotion and marketing communications","Public broadcasting"],"headings":["PBS policy","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sponsor","commercial"],["public_affairs","broadcasting"]],"members":["public_affairs","sponsor"],"related":["Public_broadcasting","Sponsor_(commercial)","Television_advertisement","Commercial_broadcasting","Non-commercial_educational","Corporation","Small_business","Philanthropy","Charitable_trust","Public_affairs_(broadcasting)","Investigative_journalism","Symphony","Public_Broadcasting_Service","PBS_Redbook","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Underwriting","Public_affairs_programming","Corporation_for_Public_Broadcasting","Voiceover","Sponsorship","Non-profit","Cable_television","Subscription_business_model","Must-carry","Public,_educational,_and_government_access"]}
