In humans it includes two kidneys, two ureters,\nthe bladder and the urethra. The female and male urinary system are very\nsimilar, differing only in the length of the urethra.\n\nUrine is formed in the kidneys trough a filtration of blood. The urine is then\npassed trough the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored. During urination\n(peeing) the urine is passed from the bladder trough the urethra to the outside\nof the body.\n\nAbout 1-2 litres of urine are produced every day in a healthy human. Although\nthis amount may vary according to circumstances such as fluid intake.\n","linknr":409,"url":"Urinary_system","recorded":1362684974,"links":62,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://refworks.springer.com/mrw/fileadmin/pdf/Neurochemistry/0387303480C25.PDF","http://refworks.springer.com/mrw/fileadmin/pdf/Neurochemistry/0387303480C25.PDF"],"categories":["Urinary system|"],"headings":["Function","Urine formation","Urine movement","Urination","Urologic disease","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Urinary_system.svg/300px-Urinary_system.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["water_retention","medicine"]],"members":["water_retention"],"related":["Kidney","Renal_pelvis","Ureter","Urinary_bladder","Urethra","Adrenal_gland","Renal_artery","Renal_vein","Inferior_vena_cava","Abdominal_aorta","Common_iliac_artery","Common_iliac_vein","Liver","Large_intestine","Pelvis","Kidney","Ureters","Bladder","Urethra","Organ_system","Urine","Kidney","Ureter","Urinary_bladder","Urethra","Blood","Urination","Urea","Electrolyte","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Acid-base_homeostasis","Blood_volume","Blood_pressure","Polyuria","Oliguria","Anuria","Cardiac_output","Nephron","Concentration","Water","Sodium_salt","Blood","Urine","Renal_corpuscle","Circulatory_system","Proteins","Blood_cell","Glomerular_filtration_rate","Endocrine_system","Hormone","Antidiuretic_hormone","Aldosterone","Parathyroid_hormone","Nervous_system","Endocrine_system","Neurohypophysial_hormone","Mammals","Water_retention_(medicine)","Collecting_duct_system","Minor_calyx","Major_calyx","Renal_pelvis","Ureter","Urination","Urine","Urinary_bladder","Urethra","Involuntary","Reflex","Central_nervous_system","Autonomic_nervous_system","Somatic_nervous_system","Pontine_micturition_center","Periaqueductal_gray","Cerebral_cortex","Placental_mammals","Penis","Vulva","Urologic_disease","Nephrologist","Urology","Gynecology","Protein","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Diabetes","Urination","Peripheral_neuropathy","Urothelium","Major_systems_of_the_human_body"]}
