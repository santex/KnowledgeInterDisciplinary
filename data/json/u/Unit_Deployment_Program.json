{"cursor":"8722","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Unit Deployment Program' (UDP) is a system for assigning deployments of the\nUnited States Marine Corps. To reduce the number of unaccompanied tours and\nimprove unit continuity, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, (CMC) established\nit to provide for the deployment of units to the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) for\nperiods of approximately six months. The initial program was a six-phased\nevolution that sequenced infantry battalions and aircraft squadrons/detachments\ninto WESTPAC deployments, thus eliminating the 12-month permanent change of\nstation assignments for personnel assigned to these units. The program commenced\nin October 1977 and has proceeded through the six phases. In August 1985, tank\ncompanies began phasing into the program but following Southwest Asia, were\ndiscontinued. In Fiscal Year 1987 (FY87) and FY88, Amphibious Assault Vehicle\n(AAV) companies and direct support artillery batteries were phased in and later,\nLight Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) companies were also included in the program.\nThe Marine Corpsâ objective is to adhere as closely as possible to a six-month\nperiod of deployment away from a unitâs Continental United States (CONUS) home\nbase. In the case of Hawaii-based infantry battalions, which employ a three-\nbattalion rotation base, a seven-month period of deployment is executed to\nsupport the Unit Cohesion Program and efficient staffing of first term Marines.\nIt must be understood, however, that shipping or airlift schedule variations,\nand exercise or contingency operations will occasionally necessitate longer or\nshorter deployments for participating units. It is imperative that all personnel\ninvolved in these deployments be kept fully informed of planned deployment\nduration and subsequent deployment schedule changes.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Unit_Deployment_Program","recorded":1362896865,"links":20,"instances":["oqr"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070915113609/http://www.usmc.mil/directiv.nsf/55fdafde3f044b0585256bd40066708b/5b3f8f0cc934931985256b51006863cd/$FILE/MCO+P3000.15B.pdf","http://www.usmc.mil/directiv.nsf/55fdafde3f044b0585256bd40066708b/5b3f8f0cc934931985256b51006863cd/$FILE/MCO%20P3000.15B.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070915113609/http://www.usmc.mil/directiv.nsf/55fdafde3f044b0585256bd40066708b/5b3f8f0cc934931985256b51006863cd/$FILE/MCO+P3000.15B.pdf"],"categories":["United States Marine Corps"],"headings":["Assignment and distribution","Pay entitlements while on UDP","Navy personnel","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/USMC_logo.svg/28px-USMC_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Marine_corps_flag.svg/22px-Marine_corps_flag.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/USMC_logo.svg/80px-USMC_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["officer_qualification_record","oqr"]],"members":["officer_qualification_record"],"related":["United_States_Marine_Corps","Commandant_of_the_Marine_Corps","Pacific_Ocean","Fiscal_Year","Amphibious_Assault_Vehicle","Light_Armored_Reconnaissance","Continental_United_States","Deputy_Commandant_for_Manpower_and_Reserve_Affairs","Monitored_command_code","U.S._Department_of_Defense","Headquarters_Marine_Corps","Expiration_of_active_service","Permanent_Change_of_Station","Estimated_date_of_arrival","Marine_Corps_Total_Force_System","Deployment_Staffing_Reports","Unit_cohesion","Career_sea_pay","Corporal","Sea_duty","Department_of_Defense_Financial_Management_Regulation","Joint_Federal_Travel_Regulation","Deployed_per_diem","Secretary_of_the_Navy","Chaplain","End_of_active_obligated_service","Officer_Qualification_Record_(OQR)","Unit_cohesion"]}
