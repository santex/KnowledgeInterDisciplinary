Its main campus is at Frenchay in Bristol, about five miles (8&nbsp;km)\nnorth of the city centre. UWE also has campuses at St Matthias and Glenside in\nnorth-east Bristol and Bower Ashton, near Ashton Court in south-west Bristol.\n\nThere are regional centres in Bath and Swindon, and an associate faculty\nspecialising in animal behaviour and welfare, agricultural and sports related\ncourses in Hartpury, Gloucestershire. This satellite college has staged the\nEuropean Young Rider Championship, a horse riding competition.\n\nWith around 30,000 students and 3,000 academic staff, UWE is the larger of the\ntwo universities in Bristol (the longer established University of Bristol has\napproximately 18,000 students<ref name=\"UoBFigures\"></ref>).
