{"cursor":"17644","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{Infobox Unit\n| bgcolour = #0000FF name = Mole image = caption = standard = SI base unit\n| quantity = Amount of substance symbol = mol namedafter = units1 = inunits1 =\n| units2 = inunits2 =\n}}\n\nThe 'mole' is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a\nchemical substance, defined as the amount of any substance that contains as many\nelementary entities (e.g., atoms, molecules, ions, electrons) as there are atoms\nin 12 grams of pure carbon-12 ( 12 C), the isotope of carbon with\natomic weight 12. This corresponds to \"Avogadro constant\" which has a value of\nelementary entities of the substance. It is one of the base units in the\nInternational System of Units, and has the unit symbol 'mol'.\n\nThe mole is widely used in chemistry instead of units of mass or volume as a\nconvenient way to express amounts of reactants or of products of chemical\nreactions. For example, the chemical equation 2 H 2 + O 2 â\n2 H 2O implies that 2 mol of dihydrogen (H 2) and\n1 mol of dioxygen (O 2) react to form 2 mol of water\n(H 2O). The mole may also be used to express the number of atoms,\nions, or other elementary entities in a given sample of any substance. The\nconcentration of a solution is commonly expressed by its molarity, defined as\nthe number of moles of the dissolved substance per litre of solution.\n\nThe number of molecules in a mole (known as Avogadro's number) is defined such\nthat the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams, is exactly equal\nto the substance's mean molecular mass. For example, the mean molecular mass of\nnatural water is about 18.015, so one mole of water is about 18.015 grams.\nMaking use of this equation considerably simplifies many chemical and physical\ncomputations.\n\nThe term 'gram-molecule' was formerly used for essentially the same concept. The term 'gram-atom' (abbreviated 'gat.') has been used for a\nrelated but distinct concept, namely a quantity of a substance that contains\nAvogadro's number of atoms, whether isolated or combined in molecules. Thus, for\nexample, 1 mole of MgB 2 is 1 gram-molecule of MgB 2\nbut 3 gram-atoms of MgB 2. {{cite journal\n| doi=10.1088/0953-8984/15/6/315 last=Wang | first=Yuxing et al. last2=Bouquet\n| first2=Fr d ric last3=Sheikin first3=Ilya last4=Toulemonde first4=Pierre\n| last5=Revaz first5=Bernard last6=Eisterer first6=Michael last7=Weber\n| first7=Harald W last8=Hinderer first8=Joerg last9=Junod first9=Alain\n| title=Specific heat of MgB2 after irradiation journal=Journal of Physics:\n| Condensed Matter | year=2003 volume=15 issue=6 | pages=883â893|arxiv = cond-\n| mat/0208169 |bibcode = 2003JPCM...15..883W }} {{cite journal\n| doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.72.024547 last=Lortz | first=R. et al. last2=Wang\n| first2=Y. last3=Abe first3=S. last4=Meingast first4=C. last5=Paderno\n| first5=Yu. last6=Filippov first6=V. last7=Junod first7=A. title=Specific heat,\n| magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and thermal expansion of the\n| superconductor ZrB12 journal=Phys.
