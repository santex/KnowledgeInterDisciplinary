A\ndefensive back and halfback, he played college football at Springfield College,\nand played professionally in the American Football League for the Denver Broncos\nin 1969 and in the Canadian Football League for the Montreal Alouettes in 1970.\nAlflen returned to the AFL to play with the New England Patriots in 1971 but\nunfortunately suffered a knee injury returning a kickoff in the pre-season vs.\nMinnesota Vikings. Subsequently, nine weeks later he was released and retired\ndue to numerous injuries.\n\nHe held Springfield College's record for most points scored in a game (36) vs.\nTufts in 1968, which stood until 2006 (a 38-year old record).\n\nAlflen's moment in the limelight came during his short stint with Montreal.\nAlouettes coach Sam Etcheverry had suspended running back Dennis Duncan and\nreceiver Bob McCarthy for curfew violations. Alflen, who had been playing for\nthe Long Island Bulldogs, was brought in just in time for the playoffs, and\nplayed only three games in his brief but noteworthy career as a Lark. During the\nfirst quarter of the 1970 Grey Cup game, the Alouettes were third-and-one at the\nCalgary Stampeders' ten yard line. Alflen was sent in as a play courier with\ninstructions for a hand-off up the middle to running back Moses Denson for the\nthird-down gamble. But Denson was forced wide to the right by Calgary's Terry\nWilson. Wilson was flat on the ground but had Denson's ankle in his grip. Denson\ncaught site of Alflen open downfield and launched a perfect strike. \"I was\nblocking and saw Moses was in trouble. I headed for the end zone, he saw me and\nlofted a perfect pass to me. It was a magical sort of play; something\ninstantaneous. It was an amazing moment for me.\" Montreal Gazette, November\n5, 1986, p. C-6\n\nAfter his football career, Alflen worked in sales for a chemical company, was an\nassistant football coach at Edison High School in Miami, Florida for two years,\nthen worked as director of sales and development for a sun-care products\ncompany.
