In 1917, the Russian Empire purchased Spray and the trawlers Foam\nand Ripple from the Bay State Fishing Company of Boston, Massachusetts,\nintending to place them in Imperial Russian Navy service during World War I, but\nthe outbreak of the Russian Revolution that year prevented the three ships from\nleaving the United States.\n\nOn 29 May 1918, the U.S. Navy chartered all three ships from the Russian\nGovernment for World War I use. Spray was assigned Identification Number (Id.\nNo.) 2491, placed under the control of the Commandant, 3rd Naval District, and\ncommissioned on 1 June 1918 as USS Spray (ID-2491).\n\nSpray operated in the 3rd Naval District for the remainder of World War I and\ninto the months immediately following the end of the war, engaged in\nminesweeping duties off of New York City.\n\nSpray was decommissioned in 1919 and returned to the Russian government on 4\nMarch 1919.\n\nSpray should not be confused with USS ''Spray II'' (SP-308), a motorboat ordered\ndelivered to the U.S. Navy in 1917 for use as a patrol vessel but which the Navy\nnever took over.\n","linknr":128,"url":"USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","recorded":1374862477,"links":["/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/USS_Spray","/wiki/File:Trawler_Spray.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Trawler_Spray.jpg/300px-Trawler_Spray.jpg","/wiki/U.S._Navy","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/US_flag_48_stars.svg/67px-US_flag_48_stars.svg.png","/wiki/Fore_River_Shipbuilding_Company","/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/Civilian","/wiki/Fishing_trawler","/wiki/Naval_trawler","/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)","/wiki/Gross_ton","/wiki/Ton","/wiki/Steam_engine","/wiki/Knot_(unit)","/wiki/Machine_gun","/wiki/United_States_Navy","/wiki/Naval_trawler","/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)","/wiki/File:Trawlers_Foam,_Ripple,_and_Spray.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Trawlers_Foam%2C_Ripple%2C_and_Spray.jpg/300px-Trawlers_Foam%2C_Ripple%2C_and_Spray.jpg","/wiki/File:Trawlers_Foam,_Ripple,_and_Spray.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Fishing_trawler","/wiki/U.S._Navy","/wiki/Naval_trawler","/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)","/wiki/USS_Foam_(ID-2496)","/wiki/USS_Ripple_(ID-2439)","/wiki/Civilian","/wiki/Fishing_trawler","/wiki/Fore_River_Shipbuilding_Company","/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/Russian_Empire","/w/index.php?title=Bay_State_Fishing_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Navy","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Russian_Revolution_(1917)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Russian_Government","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Commandant","/wiki/3rd_Naval_District","/wiki/Ship_commissioning","/wiki/Minesweeping","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/USS_Spray_II_(SP-308)","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Dictionary_of_American_Naval_Fighting_Ships","http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s16/spray.htm","http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-civil/civsh-s/spray.htm","http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/172491.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&oldid=445896405","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Minesweepers_of_the_United_States_Navy","/wiki/Category:World_War_I_minesweepers_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Ships_built_in_Massachusetts","/wiki/Category:1905_ships","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_Dictionary_of_American_Naval_Fighting_Ships","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=USS+Spray+%28ID-2491%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=USS+Spray+%28ID-2491%29","/wiki/USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","/wiki/Talk:USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","#","/wiki/USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/USS_Spray_(ID-2491)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&oldid=445896405","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7874311","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=USS_Spray_%28ID-2491%29&id=445896405","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=USS+Spray+%28ID-2491%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=USS+Spray+%28ID-2491%29&oldid=445896405&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=USS_Spray_(ID-2491)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.
