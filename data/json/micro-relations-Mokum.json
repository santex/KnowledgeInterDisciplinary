[http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/m Yiddish\nDictionary Online] It is similar to the Hebrew word makom (××§××, \"place\"),\nfrom which it is derived. [http://www.milon.co.il/general/general.php?term=-\n%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9D Milon] In Yiddish the names of some cities in the\nNetherlands and Germany were shortened to Mokum and had the first letter of the\nname of the city, transliterated into the Hebrew alphabet, added to them. Cities\nnamed this way were Amsterdam, Berlin, Delft, and Rotterdam. {{cite web\n  | last = Martens first = Hadewych title = Jiddisch, ontstaan en etymologie\n  | work = [http://www.ety.nl/ www.ety.nl] date = 2006-09-26 url =\n  | http://www.ety.nl/jiddisch.html accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}\n\nMokum, without [[Aleph]], is still used as a nickname for Amsterdam. The\nnickname was first considered to be Bargoens, a form of Dutch slang, but in the\n20th century it lost its negative sound and is now used as a nickname for\nAmsterdam in a sentimental context. {{cite book\n  | last = Berns first = Jan coauthors = Daan, Jo title = Hij zeit wat.
