In\nmany countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically\nmembers of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title, such\nas [[senate]], and thus also have different titles for its members, such as\n[[senator]].\n\nMembers of parliament tend to form parliamentary groups (also called\nparliamentary parties) with members of the same political party. In everyday\nuse, the term Member of Parliament is almost always shortened to the initialism\n\"'MP'\", and this is also common in the
