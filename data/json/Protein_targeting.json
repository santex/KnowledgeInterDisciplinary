{"cursor":"16917","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":This article deals with protein targeting in [[eukaryote]]s except where noted.\n'Protein targeting' or 'protein sorting' is the biological mechanism by which\nproteins are transported to the appropriate destinations in the cell or outside\nof it. Proteins can be targeted to the inner space of an organelle, different\nintracellular membranes, plasma membrane, or to exterior of the cell via\nsecretion. This delivery process is carried out based on information contained\nin the protein itself. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors can lead\nto diseases.\n","linknr":479,"url":"Protein_targeting","recorded":1362486523,"links":17,"instances":["biochemistry","protein","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein targeting|","Posttranslational modification","Membrane proteins"],"headings":["Targeting signals","Protein translocation","Sorting of proteins to mitochondria","Sorting of proteins to chloroplasts","Sorting of proteins to both chloroplasts and mitochondria","Sorting of proteins to peroxisomes","Receptor-mediated endocytosis","Protein destruction","Protein targeting in bacteria and archaea","Secretory pathways","Identifying protein targeting motifs in proteins","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["chaperone","protein"],["chaperone","protein"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["chaperone","protein"],["matrix","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["virus","biology"]],"members":["receptor","chaperone","translation","virus","matrix"],"related":["Protein","Organelle","Biological_membrane","Cell_membrane","Secretion","Carboxypeptidase_E","Primary_structure","Amino_acid","Signal_peptide","Targeting_peptide","Signal_patches","Primary_sequence","Protein_folding","Posttranslational_modification","Günter_Blobel","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Signal_peptide","Amino_acid","Postal_code","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Ribosome","Cytosol","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi","Endosome","Signal_sequence","Signal_recognition_particle","SRP_receptor","Eukaryotes","Prokaryotes","Sec61","SecYEG","Transmembrane_proteins","Signal_peptidase","Chaperone_(protein)","Protein_folding","Glycosylation","ER_retention","Transmembrane_proteins","Transmembrane_receptors","Opsin","Cytosol","SecA","SecB","Sec62","Sec63","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Peroxisomes","Nuclear_envelope","Nuclear_pore","Mitochondrion","Protein","Cytosolic","Peptide_signal","Cytosolic","Chaperone_(protein)","Preprotein","Mitochondrial_membrane","Preprotein","Mitochondria","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Outer_mitochondrial_membrane","Intermembrane_space","Chaperone_(protein)","Inner_membrane","Matrix_(biology)","Targeting_sequence","Mitochondrial","Receptor_(biochemistry)","TOM40","Cation","Molecular_weight","KDa","Diameter","Inner_membrane","N-terminal","Mitochondrial_matrix","Intermembrane_space","Chloroplast","Thylakoid","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Proteins","Hydrophobic","Amino_acids","Amino_acids","Peroxisome","Peroxisomal_targeting_signal","Serine","Lysine","Leucine","Zellweger_syndrome","Adrenoleukodystrophy","Clathrin","Coated_pit","Endocytosis","Plasma_membrane","Endosomes","Low-density_lipoprotein","Hormone","Growth_factor","Epidermal_growth_factor","Nerve_growth_factor","Antigen","Phagocytosis","Macrophage","Virus_(biology)","Semliki_forest_virus","Cholera","Diphtheria","Anthrax_toxin","Tetanus","Botulinum","Oxidation","Half_life","Ubiquitin","Gram-positive_bacteria","Periplasm","Gram-negative_bacteria","Sortase","Exosortase","Extracellular_polymeric_substance","Archaea","S-layer","Secretory_pathway","Secretory_protein","Golgi_apparatus","Cisternal_progression","Minimotif_Miner","Bulk_flow","COPI","COPII","Clathrin","LocDB"]}
