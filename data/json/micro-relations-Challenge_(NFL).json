{"cursor":"14764","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In American and Canadian football, 'instant replay' is a method of reviewing a\nplay using cameras at various angles to determine the accuracy of the initial\ncall of the officials. An instant replay can take place in the event of a close\nor otherwise controversial call, either at the request of a team's head coach\n(with limitations) or the officials themselves.\n\nThere are restrictions on what types of plays can be reviewed. In general, most\npenalty calls or lack thereof cannot be reviewed, nor can a play that is\nwhistled dead by the officials before the play could come to its rightful end.\nExamples of plays that cannot be reviewed â even if replays would show an\nincorrect call was made â include a quarterback fumble recovered by the\ndefensive team that is ruled an incomplete pass and thus whistled dead, or a\nplayer ruled downed or out of bounds when in fact he was not.\n\nAmerican and Canadian football leagues vary in their application and use of\ninstant replay review.\n","linknr":358,"url":"Challenge_(NFL)","recorded":1362569645,"links":11,"instances":["football","sport","sports","american_football"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American football terminology","Canadian football"],"headings":["By league","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Bill_Cowher_challenge.jpg/350px-Bill_Cowher_challenge.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/StanfordOfficialReview2007.jpg/220px-StanfordOfficialReview2007.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["official","american_football"],["time-out","sport"],["overtime","sports"],["three-minute_warning","football"]],"members":["overtime","official"],"related":["American_football","Canadian_football","Official_(American_football)","Instant_replay","Quarterback","Fumble","Incomplete_pass","Head_coach","Pittsburgh_Steelers","National_Football_League","1999_NFL_season","United_States_Football_League","2004_NFL_season","Two_minute_warning","Sport_time-out","Pager","Vibrating_alert","Pete_Rozelle","Pittsburgh_Steelers","Dan_Rooney","NCAA","2001_Michigan_vs._Michigan_State_football_game","Big_Ten_Conference","Atlantic_Coast_Conference","Big_East_Conference","Big_Ten_Conference","Big_12_Conference","Conference_USA","Mid-American_Conference","Mountain_West_Conference","Pacific-10_Conference","Southeastern_Conference","Sun_Belt_Conference","Western_Athletic_Conference","Digital_video_recorder","Bowl_game","Canadian_Football_League","Board_of_governors","2006_CFL_season","Comparison_of_Canadian_and_American_football","2009_CFL_season","Mark_Cohon","Time-out_(sport)","Overtime_(sports)","Three-minute_warning_(football)"]}
