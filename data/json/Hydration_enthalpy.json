{"cursor":"1169","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Hydration energy' (also 'hydration enthalpy') is a term for energy released\nupon attachment of water molecules to ions. It is a special case of dissolution\nenergy, with the solvent being water.\n\nFor example, upon solving a salt in water, the outermost ions (those at the edge\nof the lattice) move away from the lattice and become covered with the\nneighboring water molecules. If the hydration energy is equal to or greater than\nthe lattice energy, then the salt is water soluble. For the salts, for which the\nhydration energy exceeds the lattice energy, the solution happens with a release\nof energy (thus heat). For instance, CaCl 2 (anhydrous calcium\nchloride) heats the water when dissolving. However, the hexahydrate,\nCaCl 2Â·6H 2O cools the water upon dissolution. The latter\nhappens because the hydration energy does not completely cover the lattice\nenergy, and the remainder has to be taken from the water in order to compensate\nthe energy loss.\n","linknr":84,"url":"Hydration_enthalpy","recorded":1362675315,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical chemistry"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Properties_of_water","Lattice_energy","Hydrate","Hydrational_fluid"]}
