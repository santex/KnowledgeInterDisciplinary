{"cursor":"7449","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the United States and Canada, an 'academic major' or 'major concentration'\n(informally, 'major' or 'concentration') is the academic discipline to which an\nundergraduate student formally commits. A student who successfully completes the\ncourses prescribed in an academic major qualifies for an undergraduate degree.\n\nAbbott Lawrence Lowell introduced the academic major system to Harvard\nUniversity in 1910, during his presidency there. It required students to\ncomplete courses not only in a specialized discipline, but also in other\nsubjects. Variations of this system are now definitive\namong tertiary education institutions in the United States and Canada.\n\nToday, an academic major typically consists of a core curriculum, prescribed\ncourses, a liberal arts curriculum, and several elective courses. The amount of\nlatitude a student has in choosing courses varies from program to program. Typically, the courses of an academic major are portioned in\nseveral academic terms.\n\nA major is administered by select faculty in an academic department. A major\nadministered by more than one academic department is called an\n'interdisciplinary major'. In addition, some students earn individually designed\nmajors.\n\nWhereas some students choose a major when first enrolling as an undergraduate at\na school, others choose one after beginning their studies. Some schools forbid\nstudents from declaring a major until the end of their second academic year.\n\nA student who declares two academic majors is said to have a 'double major'. A\n'coordinate major' is an ancillary major designed to complement the primary one.\nA coordinate major requires fewer course credits to complete. (Compare with\nacademic minor and joint honours.)\n","linknr":132,"url":"Academic_major","recorded":1374544332,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Academic_discipline","/wiki/Undergraduate_student","/wiki/Undergraduate_degree","/wiki/Abbott_Lawrence_Lowell","/wiki/Harvard_University","#cite_note-McGrath-1","/wiki/Tertiary_education","/wiki/Educational_institution","/wiki/Core_curriculum","/wiki/Course_(education)","/wiki/Liberal_arts","/wiki/Elective_course","#cite_note-McGrath-1","/wiki/Academic_term","/wiki/Academic_department","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Academic_year","/wiki/Course_credit","/wiki/Academic_minor","/wiki/Joint_honours","#Choosing_a_Major","#Most_Valuable_Majors","#Least_Valuable_Majors","#Changing_Majors","#Most_Popular_Majors","#References","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-McGrath_1-0","#cite_ref-McGrath_1-1","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/08/education/edlife/harvard.html?emc=eta1","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Company","#cite_ref-2","http://www.denison.edu/academics/catalog/majors.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/05/15/best-top-most-valuable-college-majors-degrees/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/10/11/the-10-worst-college-majors/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.campusgrotto.com/most-popular-college-majors.html","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Minor_(academic)","/wiki/Academia","/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification","/wiki/Course_catalog","/wiki/Curriculum","/wiki/Double_degree","/wiki/Higher_education","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit&section=8","http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/majors/majorSearch.asp","/wiki/The_Princeton_Review","https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors-careers","/wiki/The_College_Board","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&oldid=560227646","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Higher_education_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Higher_education_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:School_terminology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Academic+major&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Academic+major","/wiki/Academic_major","/wiki/Talk:Academic_major","#","/wiki/Academic_major","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Academic_major","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Academic_major","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&oldid=560227646","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Academic_major&id=560227646","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Academic+major","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Academic+major&oldid=560227646&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Academic_major&printable=yes","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A4%C3%A4aine","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4671286#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundatio
