{"cursor":"9156","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Carbohydrate conformation' refers to the overall three-dimensional structure\nadopted by a carbohydrate (saccharide) molecule as a result of the through-bond\nand through-space physical forces it experiences arising from its molecular\nstructure. The physical forces that dictate the three-dimensional shapes of all\nmoleculesâhere, of all monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, and polysaccharide\nmoleculesâare sometimes summarily captured by such terms as \"steric\ninteractions\" and \"stereoelectronic effects\" (see below).\n\nSaccharide and other chemical conformations can be reasonably shown using two-\ndimensional structure representations that follow set conventions; these capture\nfor a trained viewer an understanding of the three-dimensional structure via\nstructure drawings (see organic chemistry article, and \"3D Representations\"\nsection in molecular geometry article); they are also represented by stereograms\non the two dimensional page, and increasingly using 3D display technologies on\ncomputer monitors.\n\nFormally and quantitatively, conformation is captured by description of a\nmolecule's anglesâe.g., sets of three sequential atoms (bond angles) and four\nsequential atoms (torsion angles, dihedral angles), where the locations and\nangular directions of nonbonding electrons (\"lone pair electrons\") must\nsometimes also be taken into account.\n\nConformations adopted by saccharide molecules in response to the physical forces\narising from their bonding and nonbonding electrons, modified by the molecule's\ninteractions with its aqueous or other solvent milieu, strongly influence their\nreactivity with and recognition by other molecules (processes which in turn can\nalter conformation). Chemical transformations and biological signalling mediated\nby conformation-dependent molecular recognition between molecules underlie all\nessential processes in living organisms.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Carbohydrate_conformation","recorded":1362890002,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/pac/1995/pdf/6705x0719.pdf"],"categories":["Carbohydrates","Carbohydrate chemistry"],"headings":["Conformations of Carbohydrates","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Torsion_angles.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Carbohydrate","Saccharide","Molecular_structure","Monosaccharide","Oligosaccharide","Polysaccharide","Steric","Stereoelectronic","Organic_chemistry","Molecular_geometry","Stereogram","3D_display","Bond_angles","Torsion_angle","Dihedral","Nonbonding_electron","Lone_pair","Electron","Saccharide","Aqueous","Solvent","Molecular_recognition","Organisms","Pyranose","Furanose","Atom","Clockwise","Prefix","Superscript","Suffix","Subscript","Dihedral_angle","Steric","Stereoelectronic_effect","Anomeric_effect","Dipole","Hydrogen_bonding","Chemical_equilibrium","Torsional_strain","Anomer","Diastereoisomer","Glycoside","Hemiacetal","Sugars","Stereochemistry","Stereogenic_center","Mutarotation","Anomeric_effect","Heteroatom","Thermodynamic","Raymond_Lemieux","Electropositive","Molecular_orbital","Monosaccharide","Chemical_equilibrium","Pyranose","Furanose","Anomeric_effect","Carbohydrate","Pyranose","Furanose","Monosaccharide","Polysaccharide"]}
