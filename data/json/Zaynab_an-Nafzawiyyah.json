{"cursor":"4992","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Zaynab an-NafzÄwiyyah' () (fl. 11th century), was a Berber woman of influence\nin the early Almoravid movement which gained control of Morocco, Algeria and\nparts of Spain.\n\nThe earliest reference to her is in the anonymous 12th-century text Kitab al-\nIstibsar, where it says \"In her time there was none more beautiful or\nintelligent or witty ... she was married by Yusuf, who built Marrakech for\nher\". ref. Corpus below. The latter statement is probably an\nexaggeration This work names her father as IbrÄhÄ«m an-NafzÄwi, a merchant\noriginally from Kairouan. As also Al-bayan al-mughrib. The [[Rawd al-\nQirtas]] gives her father's name as IshÄq al-Huwwari, but is notoriously\ninaccurate regarding the Almoravids\n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun, she first became the concubine of Yusuf ibn Ali, chief\nof the Wurika and Aylana Berber tribes about Aghmat in Morocco. She then married\nLuqÅ«t al-MaghrÄwi, amir of Aghmat. LuqÅ«t was killed in a battle against the\ninvading Almoravids and his wealth was inherited by Zaynab.\n\nThe most detailed information appears to be in the (unfortunately incomplete)\nearly 14th-century text [[al-Bayan al-Mughrib|Al-bayan al-mughrib]]. She is said\nto have had many offers of marriage from tribal chiefs from all over Morocco,\nbut always declined by saying she would marry no-one who did not wish to become\nruler of the whole country. It is said she had supernatural powers, and\nconversed with genies.\n\nShe married the Almoravid leader, Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar in September 1068 and\noffered to put her immense wealth at his disposal. It is said she blindfolded\nAbu Bakr, then led him to a secret underground cavern. When she removed the\nblindfold, he saw around him an immense treasure of gold and silver, pearls and\nrubies. \"All this is yours\" she said before leading him out - again blindfolded.\n\nAbu Bakr began the construction of Marrakech in May 1070. Work had not\nprogressed very far when a messager arrived pleading for his help in suppressing\na revolt against the Almoravids deep in the Sahara Desert. Abu Bakr knew that\nhis wife was not suited to the rigours of a desert life, and divorced Zaynab,\nadvising her to marry Yusuf ibn Tashfin, whom he was leaving as his deputy. He\ndeparted for the Sahara in January 1071, and after the legal period of 3 months'\nseparation had ended, Zaynab duly married Yusuf in May of that year. the\n[[Rawd al-Qirtas]] gives the date as 10 years earlier which is not supported by\nindependent sources such as al-Bakri\n\nIn 1072, Abu Bakr signalled his intention to return from the Sahara to take up\nhis former position. Yusuf was understandably reluctant to yield, but did not\nknow how to keep his position without triggering an internecine war with Abu\nBakr. It is said that Zaynab, knowing of Abu Bakr's fondness for the desert life\nand his own reluctance to cause unwarranted bloodshed, advised Yusuf to confront\nAbu Bakr in a firm but courteous manner, and mollify him with luxurious\npresents. This Yusuf did, and the meeting passed without incident. Abu Bakr\nreturned to the Sahara, but in a continuing homage his name remained on\nAlmoravid coinage until his death some years later.\n\nZaynab is known to have had at least two sons by Yusuf: *al-Mu'izz Billah, born\nin 1072 *Fadl, born in 1075\n\nThe [[Rawd al-Qirtas]] gives the date of her death as 1071, which does not fit\nwith more accurate sources. It says that Yusuf owed the conquest of the Maghreb\n(Morocco, Algeria and Spain) to her advice, and that she was so expert in\nconducting negotiations that she was nicknamed \"The Magician\".\n","linknr":128,"url":"Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","recorded":1374540133,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Floruit","/wiki/Berber_people","/wiki/Almoravid","/wiki/Morocco","/wiki/Algeria","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Yusuf_ibn_Tashfin","/wiki/Marrakech","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Kairouan","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun","/wiki/Berber_people","/wiki/Aghmat","/wiki/Morocco","/wiki/Amir","/wiki/Aghmat","/wiki/Almoravid","/wiki/Al-Bayan_al-Mughrib","/wiki/Morocco","/wiki/Genie","/wiki/Almoravid","/wiki/Abu-Bakr_Ibn-Umar","/wiki/Marrakech","/wiki/Almoravid","/wiki/Sahara_Desert","/wiki/Yusuf_ibn_Tashfin","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Almoravid","/wiki/Rawd_al-Qirtas","/wiki/Maghreb","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Al-Bayan_al-Mughrib","/wiki/Rawd_al-Qirtas","/wiki/Almoravid","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Rawd_al-Qirtas","/wiki/Al-Bakri","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Ibn_Idhari","/wiki/Al-Bayan_al-Mughrib","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0521224225","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1558762418","/wiki/Almoravids","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&oldid=544806589","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Berber_people","/wiki/Category:History_of_Morocco","/wiki/Category:Medieval_women","/wiki/Category:11th-century_Moroccan_people","/wiki/Category:Almoravid_dynasty","/wiki/Category:People_from_Marrakech","/wiki/Category:Concubines","/wiki/Category:Moroccan_women_in_politics","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Arabic-language_text","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zaynab+an-Nafzawiyyah&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zaynab+an-Nafzawiyyah","/wiki/Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","/wiki/Talk:Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","#","/wiki/Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&oldid=544806589","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4165292","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&id=544806589","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Zaynab+an-Nafzawiyyah","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Zaynab+an-Nafzawiyyah&oldid=544806589&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Zaynab_an-Nafzawiyyah&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A8_%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AA_%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%82_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B1_%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%8F","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4165292#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:
