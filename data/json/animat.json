      "text" : "\n'Animats' are artificial animals, a contraction of animal-materials. The term\nincludes physical robots and virtual simulations. Animat research, a subset of\nArtificial Life studies, has become rather popular since Rodney Brooks' seminal\npaper \"Intelligence without representation\". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson\nin 1985, in \"Knowledge growth in an artificial animal\", published in the first\nProceedings of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their\nApplications.\n\nAn example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some\nlength in chapter 9 of Stan Franklin's book, Artificial Minds. In this\nimplementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its\nenvironment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules\ncalled \"taxons\".\n\nIn 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on 'Neurally controlled animat'. Every\ntwo years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on\nthis topic. They also have a journal, Adaptive Behavior.\n\nAlan H Goldstein has proposed that, because nanobiotechnology is in the process\nof creating real anima-materials, speculative use of this term should be\ndiscouraged and its application become purely phenomenological. Based on the\nAnimat Test (contained in the reference \"I, Nanobot.\") any nonbiological\nmaterial or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life\nform is, de facto, an Animat. Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of\nnanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular\nengineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum\nlevel of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive\nphenomena. Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between\nthe fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in\nscientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology\n(jargon) these two fields have produced. Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular\nengineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are\ngenerally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building\nmolecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices. A-\nLife researchers mainly take a systems-level approach. The enormous\ntransformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create\nAnimats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would\nnot fit into most standard A-Life paradigms. As a result, Goldstein argues, the\nfirst Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific\ncommunity.\n",
