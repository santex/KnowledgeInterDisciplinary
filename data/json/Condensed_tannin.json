{"cursor":"7005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (with 4â6 bounds - dotted line).]] 'Condensed tannins' ('proanthocyanidins',\n 'polyflavonoid tannins', 'catechol-type tannins', 'pyrocatecollic type\n tannins', 'non-hydrolyzable tannins' or 'flavolans') are polymers formed by the\n condensation of flavans. They do not contain sugar residues.\n\nDifferent types of condensed tannins exist such as the procyanidins,\npropelargonidins, prodelphinidins, profisetinidins, proguibourtinidins or\nprorobinetidins. They are called proanthocyanidins as they yield anthocyanidins\nwhen depolymerized under oxidative conditions.\n\nTannins of tropical woods tend to be of a catechin nature rather than of the\ngallic type present in temperate woods.

These are not susceptible to being cleaved by hydrolysis.\n\nWhile hydrolyzable tannins and most condensed tannins are water soluble, some\nvery large condensed tannins are insoluble.\n\nCondensed tannins from [[Lithocarpus glaber]] leaves have a potent free radical\nscavenging activity. Condensed tannins can be found in\n[[Prunus]] sp.\n\nCondensed tannins can be characterised by a number of techniques including\ndepolymerisation, asymmetric flow field flow fractionation or small-angle X-ray\nscattering.\n","linknr":287,"url":"Condensed_tannin","recorded":1362507930,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://bft.cirad.fr/cd/BFT_182_37-54.pdf","http://www.users.muohio.edu/hagermae/Acid%20Butanol%20Assay%20for%20Proanthocyanidins.pdf"],"categories":["Condensed tannins| Condensed tannins"],"headings":["Depolymerisation","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Schematic_condensed_tannins.PNG/220px-Schematic_condensed_tannins.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biopolymer","Condensation_reaction","Flavan","Procyanidin","Propelargonidin","Prodelphinidin","Profisetinidin","Proguibourtinidin","Prorobinetidin","Anthocyanidin","Tropical_wood","Temperate_wood","Procyanidin","Flavan-3ol","Hydrolysis","Asymmetric_flow_field_flow_fractionation","Small-angle_X-ray_scattering","Anthocyanidin","Nucleophile","Phloroglucinol","Benzyl_mercaptan","Thiolysis","Thioglycolic_acid","Cysteamine","Depolymerisation","Average_degree_of_polymerisation","SN1_reaction","Carbocation","Protic_solvent","Methanol","Methanol","Epimerisation","Lignin","Quantitation","Douglas_fir","Epicatechin","Catechin","Thioglycolate","Cysteamine"]}
