{"cursor":"1015","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'degree of frost' is a non-standard unit of measure for air temperature\nmeaning degrees below melting point (also known as \"freezing point\") of water\n(32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius). \"Degree\" in this case can refer to\ndegree Celsius  or Fahrenheit.\n\nWhen based on Celsius, 0 degrees of frost is the same as 0Â°C, and any other\nvalue is simply the negative of the Celsius temperature. When based on\nFahrenheit, the conversion is a bit more complicated, as 0 degrees of frost is\nequal to 32Â°F. Conversion formulas:\n* T [degrees of frost] = 32Â°F - T [Â°F]\n* T [Â°F] = 32Â°F - T (degrees of frost)\n\nThe term 'degrees of frost' was widely used in Apsley Cherry-Garrard's account\nof his Antarctic adventures in \"The Worst Journey in the World\". He recorded\n109.5 (Fahrenheit) degrees of frost (-77.5 Â°F or -60.8 Â°C).\n","linknr":77,"url":"Degree_of_frost","recorded":1362565418,"links":10,"instances":["temperature"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Units of temperature"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degree","temperature"]],"members":["degree"],"related":["Units_of_measurement","Air","Temperature","Degree_(temperature)","Melting_point","Fahrenheit","Celsius","Degree_Celsius","Fahrenheit","Apsley_Cherry-Garrard"]}
