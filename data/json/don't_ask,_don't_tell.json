{"cursor":"123188","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\"'Don't ask, don't tell'\" ('DADT') was the official United States policy on gays\nserving in the military from December 21, 1993, to September 20, 2011. The\npolicy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing\ncloseted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring\nopenly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service. The restrictions\nwere mandated by United States federal law (). The policy prohibited people who\n\"demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts\" from serving\nin the armed forces of the United States, because their presence \"would create\nan unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline,\nand unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability\". The\nact prohibited any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her\nsexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships,\nincluding marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United\nStates armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that\nthey are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated\n(discharged) except when a service member's conduct was \"for the purpose of\navoiding or terminating military service\" or when it \"would not be in the best\ninterest of the armed forces\". Since DADT ended in 2011, open gays\nand lesbians have been able to serve.\n\nThe \"don't ask\" part of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not\ninitiate investigation of a servicemember's orientation without witnessing\ndisallowed behaviors, though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be\nused to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of\nsuspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to \"don't ask,\ndon't tell, don't pursue, don't harass\".\n\nA congressional bill to repeal DADT was enacted in December 2010, specifying\nthat the policy would remain in place until the President, the Secretary of\nDefense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that repeal\nwould not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period. A July 6, 2011, ruling from a federal appeals court\nbarred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service\nmembers. President Barack Obama, Secretary of\nDefense Leon Panetta, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike\nMullen sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end\nof DADT for September 20, 2011.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"don't_ask,_don't_tell","recorded":1372154713,"links":[],"instances":["united_states","production_company","writer","politician","organization","pennsylvania_politician","pseudonym","military","activist","journalist","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Don't
