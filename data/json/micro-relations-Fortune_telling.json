{"cursor":"17395","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, Iran, 19th century]] (1895)]] 'Fortune-telling' is the practice of predicting\ninformation about a person's life. The scope of fortune-telling is in principle\nidentical with the practice of divination. The difference is that divination is\nthe term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking\ndeities or spirits, while the term fortune-telling implies a less serious or\nformal setting, even one of popular culture, where belief in occult workings\nbehind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of suggestion,\nspiritual or practical advisory or affirmation.\n\nHistorically, fortune-telling grows out of folkloristic reception of Renaissance\nmagic, specifically associated with Gypsies.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th century, methods of divination from non-Western\ncultures, such as the I Ching, An example of divination or fortune-telling as\npurely an item of pop culture, with little or no vestiges of belief in the\noccult, would be the [[Magic 8-Ball]] sold as a toy by Mattel, or Paul II, a\ncephalopod of the Sea Life Aquarium at Oberhausen used to predict the outcome of\nmatches played by the German national football team. Associated\nPress[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggx_QnW1NjU 6 July 2010]\n\nThere is opposition against fortune-telling in Christianity and Judaism based on\nbiblical prohibitions against divination. This sometimes causes discord in the\nJewish community due to their views on\nmysticism.
