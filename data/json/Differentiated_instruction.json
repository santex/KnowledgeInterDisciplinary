{"cursor":"23918","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Differentiated instruction and assessment' (also known as 'differentiated\nlearning' or, in education, simply, 'differentiation') is a framework or\nphilosophy for effective teaching that involves providing students with\ndifferent avenues to acquiring content; to processing, constructing, or making\nsense of ideas; and to developing teaching materials and assessment measures so\nthat all students within a classroom can learn effectively, regardless of\ndifferences in ability. Students vary in culture,\nsocioeconomic status, language, gender, motivation, ability/disability, personal\ninterests and more, and teachers need to be aware of these varieties as they are\nplanning their curriculum. By considering varied learning needs, teachers can\ndevelop personalized instruction so that all children in the classroom can learn\neffectively. Differentiated classrooms have also been described as\nones that are responsive to student variety in readiness levels, interests and\nlearning profiles. It is a classroom where all students are included and can be\nsuccessful. To do this a teacher sets different expectations for task completion\nfor students based upon their individual needs.\n\nDifferentiated instruction, according to Carol Ann Tomlinson (as cited by Ellis,\nGable, Greg, & Rock, 2008, p. 32), is the process of âensuring that what a\nstudent learns, how he or she learns it, and how the student demonstrates what\nhe or she has learned is a match for that studentâs readiness level, interests,\nand preferred mode of learning.â Teachers can differentiate through four ways:\n1) through content, 2) process, 3) product, and 4) learning environment based on\nthe individual learner. Ministry of Education.\n(2007). Differentiated instruction teacherâs guide: Getting to the core of\nteaching and learning. Toronto: Queenâs Printer for Ontario.\nDifferentiation stems from beliefs about differences among learners, how they\nlearn, learning preferences and individual interests (Anderson, 2007).\nTherefore, differentiation is an organized, yet flexible way of proactively\nadjusting teaching and learning methods to accommodate each child's learning\nneeds and preferences in order to achieve his or her maximum growth as a\nlearner. Tomlinson, C. A. (1999). The differentiated\nclassroom: Responding to the needs of all learners. New Jersey: Pearson\nEducation. In order to understand how our students learn and what they\nknow, pre-assessment and ongoing assessment are essential. This provides\nfeedback for both the teacher and the student with the ultimate goal of\nimproving student learning. Delivery of\ninstruction in the past often followed a \"one size fits all\" approach. In\ncontrast, differentiation is individually student centered, with a focus on\nutilizing appropriate instructional and assessment tools that are fair,\nflexible, challenging, and engage students in the curriculum in meaningful ways.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Differentiated_instruction","recorded":1374546048,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Student","/wiki/Idea","/wiki/Teaching","/wiki/Textbook","/wiki/Classroom","/wiki/Learn","#cite_note-Tomlinson-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Carol_Ann_Tomlinson","#cite_note-Ministry_of_Education-4","#cite_note-Tomlinson9-5","#cite_note-Ministry_of_Education-4","#Brain-Based_Learning","#Pre-assessment","#Ongoing_Assessment","#Content","#Process","#Product","#Learning_Environment","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-Willis-6","#cite_note-Willis-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-Gardner-8","#cite_note-Gardner-8","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-Hume-9","#cite_note-Strickland-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-TVDSB-12","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-TVDSB-12","#cite_note-Hume-9","#cite_note-Strickland-10","#cite_note-Hume-9","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-Strickland-10","#cite_note-TVDSB-12","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Bloom%27s_Taxonomy","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Child_development","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Curriculum","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Tic-tac-toe","/wiki/Writing","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-Ministry_of_Education-4","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-Tomlinson_1-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0871205122","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-Ministry_of_Education_4-0","#cite_ref-Ministry_of_Education_4-1","#cite_ref-Ministry_of_Education_4-2","#cite_ref-Tomlinson9_5-0","#cite_ref-Willis_6-0","#cite_ref-Willis_6-1","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-Gardner_8-0","#cite_ref-Gardner_8-1","#cite_ref-Hume_9-0","#cite_ref-Hume_9-1","#cite_ref-Hume_9-2","#cite_ref-Strickland_10-0","#cite_ref-Strickland_10-1","#cite_ref-Strickland_10-2","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-TVDSB_12-0","#cite_ref-TVDSB_12-1","#cite_ref-TVDSB_12-2","http://www.tvdsb.ca/programs.cfm?subpage=91423","#cite_ref-13","#cite_ref-14","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&action=edit&section=10","http://www.ascd.org/research-a-topic/differentiated-instruction-resources.aspx","http://www.petalslearning.com","http://www.saskschools.ca/curr_content/bestpractice/","http://www.saskschools.ca/curr_content/adhs/ddlintro.html","http://www.saskschools.ca/curr_content/adhs/ddlintro2.html","http://www.bsu.edu/web/jfmarron/tlpcauses.html","http://ced.ncsu.edu/2/adventure/haywood/tictac.html","http://www.learnnc.org/lessons/bowen022006eng1","http://www.brunswick.k12.me.us/lon/brunswickhistory/teacher/image/matrix.PDF","http://www.caroltomlinson.com","http://www.nagc.org/index2.aspx?id=978","http://www.readingrockets.org/atoz/differentiated_instruction","http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/elementary-science/differentiating-for-high-ability-students","http://www.trabzonbilsem.net/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Differentiated_instruction&oldid=564613739","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Teaching","/wiki/Category:Pedagogy","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Differentiated+instruction&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Differentiated+instruction","/wiki/Differentiated_instruction","/wiki/Ta
