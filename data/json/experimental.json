Experiments provide\ninsight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a\nparticular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and\nscale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the\nresults. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand the nature of\ngravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to\nadvance the understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments can vary from personal\nand informal (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly\ncontrolled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists\nthat hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of\nexperiments vary considerably between the natural and social sciences.\n","title":"Experiment","headings":["Overview","History","Types of experiment","Contrast with observational study","Ethics","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Scientific_method","3: Confounding","2: Hypothesis","2: Hypotheses","2: Randomized_experiment","2: Average_treatment_effect","2: Laboratory","2: Oscar_Kempthorne","2: Design_of_experiments","2: David_A._Freedman","1: Causality","1: Natural_science","1: Social_science","1: Empirical_method","1: Scientific_models","1: Theories","1: Philosophy_of_science","1: Counterexample","1: Scientific_control","1: Random_assignment","1: Engineering","1: Social_sciences","1: Clinical_trial","1: Test_statistic","1: Systematic_review","1: Meta-analysis","1: Branches_of_science","1: Agriculture","1: Experimental_economics","1: Francis_Bacon","1: Philosophy","1: Scientist","1: Deductive_reasoning","1: Galileo_Galilei","1: Antoine_Lavoisier","1: Combustion","1: Biochemistry","1: Conservation_of_mass","1: Louis_Pasteur","1: Spontaneous_generation","1: Germ_theory_of_disease","1: Ronald_Fisher","1: Jerzy_Neyman","1: Gertrude_Mary_Cox","1: William_Gemmell_Cochran","1: Rubin_causal_model","1: Psychology","1: Political_Science","1: Independent_variable","1: Dependent_variable","1: Dependent_and_independent_variables","1: Treatment_group","1: Placebo","1: Control_group","1: Replicate","1: Scientific_control#Positive","1: Scientific_control#Negative","1: Standard_curve","1: Protein","1: Assay","1: Spectrophotometer","1: Statistics","1: Number","1: Microbiology","1: Chemistry","1: Solution","1: Human_experimentation","1: Research_subject","1: Stimulation","1: Measurement","1: Test_method","1: Response_variable","1: Null_hypothesis","1: System","1: Correlation","1: Explanatory_variables","1: Science","1: Economics","1: Political_science","1: Geology","1: Paleontology","1: Ecology","1: Meteorology","1: Astronomy","1: External_validity","1: Observational_study","1: Selection_bias","1: Central_limit_theorem","1: Markov's_inequality","1: Food_and_Drug_Administration","1: Propensity_score_matching","1: Human_subject_research","1: Informed_consent","1: Manhattan_Project","1: Experimental_physics","1: List_of_experiments","1: Long-term_experiment","1: Concept_development_and_experimentation","1: Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
