The first open-\nair museums were established in Scandinavia towards the end of the nineteenth\ncentury, and the concept soon spread throughout Europe and North America. Open-\nair museums are variously known as 'skansen', 'museums of buildings' and 'folk\nmuseums'. A more recent form is the Ecomuseum, which originated in France. A\ncomprehensive history of the open-air museum as idea and institution can be\nfound in Swedish museologist Sten Rentzhog's 2007 book Open Air Museums: The\nHistory and Future of a Visionary Idea.\n\n'Living museums', also known as 'living farm museums' and 'living history\nmuseums', are a special type of open-air museum where costumed interpreters\nportray period life in an earlier era. The interpreters act as if they are\nreally living in a different time and place, such as the Colonial era, and\nperform everyday household tasks, crafts and businesses. The goal is to\ndemonstrate older lifestyles to modern audiences. Household tasks might include\ncooking on an open hearth, churning butter, spinning wool and weaving, and\nfarming without modern equipment. Many living museums feature traditional\ncraftsmen at work, such as a blacksmith, cooper, potter, miller, sawmill worker,\nprinter, doctor and general store keeper.\n","linknr":817,"url":"Living_history_museum","recorded":1362560872,"links":49,"instances":["county","schwarzwaldbahn","aller","fort_george","netherlands","butter","kongens_lyngby","sagnlandet_lejre","textiles","netherlands","profession","lolland"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Architectural
