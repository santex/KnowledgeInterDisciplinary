A solver takes problem descriptions in\nsome sort of generic form and calculate their solution. In a solver, the\nemphasis is on creating a program or library that can easily be applied to other\nproblems of similar type.\n\nTypes of problems with existing dedicated solvers include:\n\n* Linear and non-linear equations. In the case of a single equation, the\n  \"solver\" is more appropriately called a root-finding algorithm.\n* Systems of linear equations.\n* Nonlinear systems.\n* Systems of polynomial equations, which are a special case of non linear\n  systems, better solved by specific solvers.\n* Linear and non-linear optimisation problems\n* Systems of ordinary differential equations\n* Systems of differential algebraic equations\n* Logic/satisfiability problems\n* Constraint satisfaction problems\n* Shortest path problems\n* Minimum spanning tree problems\n* Search algorithms\n\nThe General Problem Solver (GPS) is a particular computer program created in\n1957 by Herbert Simon, J.C. Shaw, and Allen Newell intended to work as a\nuniversal problem solver, that theoretically can be used to solve every possible\nproblem that can be formalized in a symbolic system, given the right input\nconfiguration. It was the first computer program which separated its knowledge\nof problems (in the form of domain rules) from its strategy of how to solve\nproblems (as a general search engine).\n\nGeneral solvers typically use an architecture similar to the GPS to decouple a\nproblem's definition from the strategy used to solve it. While the strategy\nutilized by GPS was a general algorithm with the only goal of completeness,\nmodern solvers tend to use a more specialized approach tailored to the\nspecific problem class which the solver aims for. The advantage in this\ndecoupling is that the solver doesn't depend on the details of any particular\nproblem instance.\n\nFor problems of a particular class (e.g., systems of non-linear equations) there\nare usually a wide range of different algorithms available; sometimes a solver\nimplements multiple algorithms, but sometimes just one.\n","title":"solver","headings":["See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Mathematical_software","2: Non-linear_equation","1: Computer_program","1: Linear_equation","1: Root-finding_algorithm","1: System_of_linear_equations","1: Nonlinear_system","1: Systems_of_polynomial_equations","1: Ordinary_differential_equation","1: Differential_algebraic_equation","1: Boolean_satisfiability_problem","1: Constraint_satisfaction_problem","1: Shortest_path_problem","1: Minimum_spanning_tree","1: Search_algorithm","1: General_Problem_Solver","1: Problem_domain","1: Software_engine","1: Problem_Solving_Environment","1: Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories"]}
