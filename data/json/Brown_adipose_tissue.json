Its primary function is to generate body heat in\nanimals or newborns that do not shiver. In contrast to white adipocytes (fat\ncells), which contain a single lipid droplet, brown adipocytes contain numerous\nsmaller droplets and a much higher number of (iron containing) mitochondria,\nwhich make it brown. Brown fat also contains\nmore capillaries than white fat, since it has a greater need for oxygen than\nmost tissues.\n","linknr":312,"url":"Brown_adipose_tissue","recorded":1362485062,"links":31,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Connective tissue"],"headings":["Biochemistry","Function in infants","Presence in adults","Embryology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Brownfat_PETCT.jpg/250px-Brownfat_PETCT.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Hibernoma2.jpg/220px-Hibernoma2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Adipose_tissue","White_adipose_tissue","Hibernation","Adipocytes","Iron","Mitochondria","Capillaries","Eukaryote","Cell_(biology)","Energy","Adenosine_triphosphate","Proton","Proton_motive_force","ATP_synthase","Chemiosmosis","Warm-blooded","Uncoupling_protein","Uncoupling_protein_1","Electron_transport_chain","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Thermogenesis","Neonate","Hypothermia","Shiver","Vasoconstriction","Hibernoma","Tumour","H&E_stain","Positron_Emission_Tomography","Beta_blocker","Weight_loss","Tumour","Hibernoma","Orexin","PRDM16","BMP7","Irisin"]}
