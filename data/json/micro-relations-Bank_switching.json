D. Aspinall (ed), The\nMicroprocessor and its application: an advanced course, CUP Archive, 1978, ISBN\n0-521-22241-9 pp.47-50  It can be used to configure a system differently\nat different times; for example, a ROM required to start a system from diskette\ncould be switched out when no longer needed. In video game systems, bank\nswitching allowed larger games to be developed for play on existing consoles.\n\nBank switching originated in minicomputer systems.  C. Gordon Bell, Allen\nNewell Computer structures: readings and examples,Mc Graw Hill, 1971 page\n156 Many modern microcontrollers and microprocessors use bank switching to\nmanage random-access memory, non-volatile memory, input-output devices and\nsystem management registers in small embedded systems. The technique was common\nin 8-bit microcomputer systems. Bank-switching may also be used to work around\nlimitations in address bus width, where some hardware constraint prevents\nstraightforward addition of more address lines. Some control-oriented\nmicroprocessors use a bank-switching technique to access internal I/O and\ncontrol registers, which limits the number of register address bits that must be\nused in every instruction.\n\nUnlike memory management by \"paging\", data is not exchanged with a mass storage\ndevice like disk memory. Data remains in quiescent storage in a memory area that\nis not currently accessible to the processor, (although it may be accessible to\nthe video display, DMA controller, or other subsystems of the computer).\n","linknr":228,"url":"Bank_switching","recorded":1362551510,"links":19,"instances":["computer","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer memory","Memory management"],"headings":["Technique","Microcomputer use","The IBM PC","Video game consoles","Alternative and successor techniques","Video processing","See also","Computers using bank switching","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Bankswitch_memory_map.svg/220px-Bankswitch_memory_map.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Expanded_memory.svg/220px-Expanded_memory.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["latch","electronics"],["enterprise","computer"],["trs-80_color_computer#color_computer_3","1986–1991"]],"members":["enterprise","latch"],"related":["Microprocessor","Read-only_memory","Booting","Minicomputer","Microcontroller","Microprocessor","Random-access_memory","Embedded_system","8-bit","Microcomputer","Paging","Direct_memory_access","Latch_(electronics)","Port-mapped_I/O_","Program_counter","Interrupt","Virtual_memory","16-bit","Z80","6502","6809","Video_game_console","Home_computer","Kilobyte","Subroutine","Interrupt","Call_stack","Direct_memory_access","Input/output","CP/M","Address_bus","Commodore_64","Memory-mapped_I/O","Atari_8-bit_family","ANTIC","80C85","80C51","Lotus_Software","Intel","Expanded_Memory","IBM_PC_compatible","MS-DOS","Microsoft","Upper_Memory_Area","Computer_game","Emulate","Microsoft_Windows","Operating_system","EXtended_Memory_Specification","Extended_memory","Real_Mode","X86","Microsoft_Windows","Video_game_console","Atari_2600","Game_cartridge","Nintendo_Entertainment_System","MOS_Technology_6502","Megabit","Multi-Memory_Controller","Game_Boy","Mega_Drive","GP2X","Memory_segment","Paging","Memory_management_unit","Sideways_address_space","BBC_Micro","Amstrad_CPC","Amstrad_PCW","Apollo_Guidance_Computer","Apple_II_series","Apple_III","Atari_130XE","Commodore_64","Commodore_128","Enterprise_(computer)","MSX","PIC_microcontroller","SAM_Coupé","TRS-80_Model_4"]}
