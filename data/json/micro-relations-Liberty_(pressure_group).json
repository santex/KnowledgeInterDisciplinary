They do this through a\ncombination of public campaigning, test case litigation, parliamentary lobbying,\npolicy analysis and the provision of free advice and information. The aim is to\nnot only protect civil liberties but also to engender a 'rights culture' within\nBritish society.\n\nCurrent director of Liberty is Shami Chakrabarti who took the role in September\n2003. In 2009, the organisation celebrated 75 years since Ronald Kidd first\nfounded the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL).
