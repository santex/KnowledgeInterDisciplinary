An onnagata wearing a\n purple headscarf combs the hair of a wakashÅ«-gata (identifiable by his\n forelocks and partially shaved head).]]\n\n'Onnagata' or 'oyama' (Japanese: å¥³å½¢ã»å¥³æ¹, \"woman-role\"), are male actors who\nimpersonate women in Japanese kabuki theatre. The modern all-male kabuki was\noriginally known as yarÅ kabuki (man kabuki) to distinguish it from earlier\nforms. In the early 17th century, shortly after the emergence of the genre, many\nkabuki theaters had an all-female cast (onna kabuki), with women playing men's\nroles as necessary. WakashÅ« kabuki (adolescent-boy kabuki), with a cast composed\nentirely of attractive young men playing both male and female roles, and\nfrequently dealing in erotic themes, originated circa 1612.\n\nBoth onnagata and '[[wakashÅ«]]' (or wakashÅ«-gata), actors specializing in\nadolescent male roles (and usually adolescents themselves), were the subject of\nmuch appreciation by both male and female patrons, and were often prostitutes.\nAll-male casts became the norm after 1629, when women were banned from appearing\nin kabuki due to the prevalent prostitution of actresses and violent quarrels\namong patrons for the actresses' favors. This ban failed to\nstop the problems, however, since the young male (wakashÅ«) actors were also\nfervently pursued by patrons.\n\nIn 1642, onnagata roles were forbidden, resulting in plays that featured only\nmale characters. These plays continued to have erotic content and generally\nfeatured many wakashÅ« roles, often dealing in themes of\n[[LGBT_in_Japan#Ancient_Japan|nanshoku]] (male homosexuality); officials\nresponded by banning wakashÅ« roles as well. The ban on\nonnagata was lifted in 1644, and on wakashÅ« in 1652, on the condition that all\nactors, regardless of role, adopted the adult male hairstyle with shaved pate.\nOnnagata and wakashÅ« actors soon began wearing a small purple headscarf\n(murasaki bÅshi or katsura) to cover the shaved portion, which became iconic\nsignifiers of their roles and eventually became invested with erotic\nsignificance as a result. After authorities rescinded a ban\non wig-wearing by onnagata and wakashÅ« actors, the murasaki bÅshi was replaced\nby a wig and now survives in a few older plays and as a ceremonial\naccessory.\n\nAfter film was introduced in Japan at the end of the 19th century, the oyama\ncontinued to portray females in movies until the early 1920s. At that time,\nhowever, using real female actresses was coming into fashion with the\nintroduction of realist [[shingeki]] films. The oyama staged a protest at\nNikkatsu in 1922 in backlash against the lack of work because of this. Kabuki,\nhowever, remains all-male even today. Though there are all-female troupes,\nthey represent a separate tradition, performing at separate theatres and for the\nmost part not really playing a part in the 'core' kabuki world.\n\nOyama continue to appear in Kabuki today, though the term onnagata has come to\nbe used much more commonly.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Oyama_(Japanese_theatre)","recorded":1364149710,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Onnagata","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Oyama_(Japanese_theatre)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Oyama_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Hishikawa_Morofusa_Two_Actors_Combing_Hair_c1700.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5d/Hishikawa_Morofusa_Two_Actors_Combing_Hair_c1700.jpg/220px-Hishikawa_Morofusa_Two_Actors_Combing_Hair_c1700.jpg","/wiki/File:Hishikawa_Morofusa_Two_Actors_Combing_Hair_c1700.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Ukiyo-e","/wiki/Japanese_language","/wiki/Kabuki","#cite_note-Leupp-1","/wiki/Wakash%C5%AB","/wiki/Prostitution","#cite_note-Leupp-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/LGBT_in_Japan#Ancient_Japan","#cite_note-Leupp-1","#cite_note-Leupp-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Shingeki","/wiki/Nikkatsu","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bando_Tamasaburo","/wiki/Nakamura_Utaemon_VI","/wiki/Yoshizawa_Ayame","/wiki/Taichi_Saotome","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Japanese_Theatre","/wiki/Kagema","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-Leupp_1-0","#cite_ref-Leupp_1-1","#cite_ref-Leupp_1-2","#cite_ref-Leupp_1-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-520-20900-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-8108-5527-5","#cite_ref-3","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&oldid=540654498","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Cross-dressing","/wiki/Category:Kabuki","/wiki/Category:LGBT_history_in_Japan","/wiki/Category:LGBT_history_prior_to_the_19th_century","/wiki/Category:Theatre_in_Japan","/wiki/Category:Transgender_in_non-western_cultures","/wiki/Category:Androgyny","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Onnagata&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Onnagata","/wiki/Onnagata","/wiki/Talk:Onnagata","#","/wiki/Onnagata","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Onnagata","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Onnagata","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&oldid=540654498","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Onnagata&id=540654498","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Onnagata","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Onnagata&oldid=540654498&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Onnagata&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyama_(toneel)","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%B3%E5%BD%A2","//oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Onnagata","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onnagata","//wikimed
