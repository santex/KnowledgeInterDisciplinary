He served as the head coach at the State College of\nWashington, now Washington State University, from 1926 to 1942, compiling a\nrecord of 93–53–14. Hollingbery's 93 wins are the most by any coach\nin the history of the Washington State Cougars football program. He was inducted\ninto the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nHollingbery coached at Washington State during what is generally agreed as its\ngreatest football era. The Cougars did not lose a home game from 1926 to 1935,\nand the 1930 teams advanced to the 1931 Rose Bowl game against Alabama. He\ncoached some of the geatest names in Washington State history, including Turk\nEdwards, Mel Hein, Mel Dressel, Dale Gentry, Ed Goddard, Harold Ahlskog, Elmer\nSchwartz, Bob Kennedy, Nick Suseoff, Bill Sewell, John Bley and Herbert \"Butch\"\nMeeker. Hollingbery also was the creator of the EastâWest Shrine Game and the\nhead coach of the West team in the first EastâWest Shrine Game in 1925 and\ncoached in a total of 18 Shrine games. In the Shrine Game he coached players\nsuch as Harold Muller, Rags Matthews, and George Sauer.\n\nHollingbery Fieldhouse at Washington State University, a facility serving\nmany different sports, was built in 1929 and renamed for the coach in 1963.\nWhen the football program at Washington State was suspended during World\nWar II, Hollingbery moved to Yakima, Wash., and started a lucrative hop-\ngrowing business.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Babe_Hollingbery","recorded":1375081015,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Babe_Hollingbery.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Babe_Hollingbery.jpg/220px-Babe_Hollingbery.jpg","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Hollister,_California","/wiki/Yakima,_Washington","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Washington_State_University","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=1092","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=30078","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Washington_State_University","/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Turk_Edwards","/wiki/Mel_Hein","/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Shrine_Game","/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Shrine_Game","/wiki/Harold_Muller","/wiki/Rags_Matthews","/wiki/George_Sauer","/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference","/wiki/1926_college_football_season","/wiki/1927_college_football_season","/wiki/1928_college_football_season","/wiki/1929_college_football_season","/wiki/1930_college_football_season","/wiki/1931_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/1931_college_football_season","/wiki/1932_college_football_season","/wiki/1933_college_football_season","/wiki/1934_college_football_season","/wiki/1935_college_football_season","/wiki/1936_college_football_season","/wiki/1937_college_football_season","/wiki/1938_college_football_season","/wiki/1939_college_football_season","/wiki/1940_college_football_season","/wiki/1941_college_football_season","/wiki/1942_college_football_season","/wiki/AP_Poll","/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit&section=3","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=30078","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=1092","/wiki/College_Football_Data_Warehouse","/wiki/Template:Washington_State_Cougars_football_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:Washington_State_Cougars_football_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Washington_State_Cougars_football_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football","/wiki/William_Goodyear","/wiki/Fred_Waite_(American_football)","/wiki/David_A._Brodie","/wiki/Robert_Gailey","/wiki/Frank_Shively","/wiki/William_L._Allen","/wiki/William_Namack","/wiki/William_L._Allen","/wiki/James_N._Ashmore","/wiki/Everett_Sweeley","/wiki/John_R._Bender","/wiki/Walter_Rheinschild","/wiki/Willis_Kienholz","/wiki/Oscar_Osthoff","/wiki/John_R._Bender","/wiki/William_Henry_Dietz","/wiki/Gus_Welch","/wiki/Albert_Exendine","/wiki/Phil_Sarboe","/wiki/Forest_Evashevski","/wiki/Al_Kircher","/wiki/Jim_Sutherland","/wiki/Bert_Clark","/wiki/Jim_Sweeney_(coach)","/wiki/Jackie_Sherrill","/wiki/Warren_Powers","/wiki/Jim_Walden","/wiki/Dennis_Erickson","/wiki/Mike_Price","/wiki/Bill_Doba","/wiki/Paul_Wulff","/wiki/Mike_Leach_(coach)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Hollister,_California","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Yakima,_Washington","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/File:American_Football_ball.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/American_Football_ball.svg/20px-American_Football_ball.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&action=edit","/wiki/Template:1920s-collegefootball-coach-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:1920s-collegefootball-coach-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1920s-collegefootball-coach-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babe_Hollingbery&oldid=536307606","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1893_births","/wiki/Category:1974_deaths","/wiki/Category:Washington_State_Cougars_football_coaches","/wiki/Category:College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_inducte
