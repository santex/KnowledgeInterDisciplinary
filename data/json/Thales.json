Many, most notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the\nGreek tradition. Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18. According to\nBertrand Russell, \"Western philosophy begins with Thales.\" Thales\nattempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to mythology and was\ntremendously influential in this respect. Almost all of the other pre-Socratic\nphilosophers follow him in attempting to provide an explanation of ultimate\nsubstance, change, and the existence of the worldâwithout reference to\nmythology. Those philosophers were also influential, and eventually Thales'\nrejection of mythological explanations became an essential idea for the\nscientific revolution. He was also the first to define general principles and\nset forth hypotheses, and as a result has been dubbed the \"Father of Science\",\nthough it is argued that Democritus is actually more deserving of this\ntitle.\n\nIn mathematics, Thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the\nheight of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with\nthe first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four\ncorollaries to Thales' Theorem. As a result, he has been hailed as the first\ntrue mathematician and is the first known individual to whom a mathematical\ndiscovery has been attributed.\n","linknr":1101,"url":"Thales","recorded":1362552266,"links":114,"instances":["585_bce","mathematics","metaphysics","aristotle","biology","philosophy","spirit","philosophy","philosophy","cappadocia","measurement","geometry","matter","finance","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["624
