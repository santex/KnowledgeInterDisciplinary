It\nhas a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and\nproduction of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for\nsurvival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver\nfunction in the long term, although new liver dialysis techniques can be used in\nthe short term.\n\nThis organ plays a major role in metabolism and has a number of functions in the\nbody, including glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma\nprotein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. It lies below the\ndiaphragm in the abdominal-pelvic region of the abdomen. It produces bile, an\nalkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. The\nliver's highly specialized tissues regulate a wide variety of high-volume\nbiochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and\ncomplex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital\nfunctions.<ref></ref>\n\nTerminology related to the liver often starts in hepar- or hepat- from the Greek\nword for liver, hēpar (ἧπαρ, root hepat-, ἡπατ-).\n",
