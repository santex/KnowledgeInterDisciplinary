As can be seen, the trees are used to create a\nfruit border or low hedge.]] 'Espalier' ( or ) is the horticultural and ancient\nagricultural practice of controlling woody plant growth originally for the\nproduction of fruit, by pruning and tying branches to a frame so that they grow\ninto a flat plane, frequently in formal patterns, against a structure such as a\nwall, fence, or trellis, and also plants which have been shaped in this way.\n\nEspaliers, trained into flat two-dimensional forms, are ideal not only for\ndecorative purposes, but also for gardens in which space is limited. In a\ntemperate climate, they may be planted next to a wall that can reflect more\nsunlight and retain heat overnight or planted so that they absorb maximum\nsunlight by training them parallel to the equator. These two facts allow the\nseason to be extended so that fruit matures over a longer period.\n\nA restricted form of training consists of a central stem and a number of paired\nhorizontal branches all trained in the same plane. The most important advantage\nis that of being able to increase the growth of a branch by training it\nvertically. Later, one can decrease growth while increasing fruit production by\ntraining it horizontally.\n\nA Belgian fence is created by cutting back an unbranched, slender tree to\nbetween fifteen and eighteen inches above the ground. The topmost three buds are\nallowed to form; one in the middle is trained vertically while two others are\ntrained into a V shape. Any other buds are rubbed away. Removing the vertical\nstem completes the individual V-shaped espalier. By placing many similarly\ntrained trees in a line two feet apart with their branches trained to the same\nplane, a Belgian fence is created.\n\nThe Belgian fence is an intermediary form that can then be used to train onward\nto many other forms of espalier, including: Step-over where the branches are\nlowered down to the horizontal in autumn while still flexible enough and tied to\na trellis, Fan where the branches are lowered and cut back then trained further,\nHorizontal T where the branches are trained to horizontal as with step-over but\nthe vertical stem is trained up to another level and cut usually in spring of\nthe second year, where another V shape is created and the resulting branches\nfinally being lowered to another wire in autumn of the second year. Multiple\nlevels of horizontal branching can be trained in this way.\n\nIn each case, branches are first trained vertically so they will grow vigorously\nand then later, after the desired growth is achieved, they are lowered to the\nhorizontal to reduce their vigor while optimizing spur formation.\n\nEspalier training can be used on full-sized trees in order to force them to\npresent their fruit within reach. As such, it probably predates grafting of\ntrees onto dwarfing root stock. Using dwarf or semi-dwarf plants is still a good\nidea as it reduces the amount of pruning that is necessary.\n","linknr":364,"url":"Espalier","recorded":1362373105,"links":33,"instances":["plant","architecture","barrier"],"pdf":["http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG27300.pdf","http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG27300.pdf","http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG27300.pdf"],"categories":["Horticulture and gardening"],"headings":["History","Species choices","Design options","Plant selection, installation, and maintenance","Related tree shaping practices","See also","Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Horizontal_espalier.JPG/200px-Horizontal_espalier.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Espalier_fruit_tree_at_Standen%2C_West_Sussex%2C_England_May_2006.JPG/220px-Espalier_fruit_tree_at_Standen%2C_West_Sussex%2C_England_May_2006.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/DSCN3598_espalieredpeartree_e.JPG/200px-DSCN3598_espalieredpeartree_e.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/SshapedEspalier.JPG/220px-SshapedEspalier.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/01002stepoverbig.jpg/220px-01002stepoverbig.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/01212belgianfenceinice.JPG/220px-01212belgianfenceinice.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Fan_fruittreeform.JPG/120px-Fan_fruittreeform.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/FanEspalier.JPG/107px-FanEspalier.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/SpecialCordon_fruittreeform.JPG/73px-SpecialCordon_fruittreeform.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Biodegradable_binding_tube.JPG/120px-Biodegradable_binding_tube.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Espalier_-_Belgian_fence.jpg/120px-Espalier_-_Belgian_fence.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hedge","barrier"],["trellis","architecture"],["cordon","plant"]],"members":["cordon","trellis","hedge"],"related":["West_Sussex","England","Hedge_(barrier)","Horticulture","Agriculture","Season_extension","Trellis_(architecture)","Middle_Ages","Europe","The_Cloisters","Manhattan","Acer_palmatum","Cercis_canadensis","Citrus_×_limon","Citrus_×_sinensis","Citrus_×_tangerina","Coccoloba_uvifera","Loquat","Euonymus_alata","Ficus_carica","Forsythia_intermedia","Holly","Ilex_cornuta","Crape_myrtle","Southern_magnolia","Magnolia_stellata","Apple","Crabapple","Olive","Peach","Nectarine","Plum","Almond","Pear","Taxus","Camellia","Natal_plum","Chaenomeles","Cotoneaster","Gardenia","Juniper","Juniperus_chinensis","Privet","Photinia_glabra","Photinia_serrulata","Podocarpus","Pyracantha","Pyracantha_coccinea","Stewartia","Viburnum","Allamanda","Ficus_pumila","Jasminum_nudiflorum","Pyrostegia_venusta","Confederate_jasmine","Palmette","Cordon_(plant)","U-bolt","Bonsai","Grafting","Pleaching","Topiary","Tree_shaping","Fruit_tree_forms","Biodegradable"]}
