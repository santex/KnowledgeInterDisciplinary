Waves of a massive medium itself, such as water\nwaves or sound waves, are usually not considered to be forms of \"radiation\" in\nthis sense.\n\nTwo energies of radiation are commonly differentiated by the way they interact\nwith normal chemical matter: ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. The word\nradiation is often colloquially used in reference to ionizing radiation (i.e.,\nradiation having sufficient energy to ionize an atom), but the term radiation\nmay correctly also refer to non-ionizing radiation (e.g., radio waves, heat or\nvisible light). The particles or waves radiate (i.e., travel outward in all\ndirections) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and\nphysical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because radiation\nradiates through space and its energy is conserved in vacuum, the power of all\ntypes of radiation follows an inverse-square law of power with regard to\ndistance from its source.\n\nBoth ionizing and non-ionizing radiation can be harmful to organisms and can\nresult in changes to the natural environment. In general, however, ionizing\nradiation is far more harmful to living organisms per unit of energy deposited\nthan non-ionizing radiation, since the ions that are produced by ionizing\nradiation, even at low radiation powers, have the potential to cause DNA damage.\nBy contrast, most non-ionizing radiation is harmful to organisms only in\nproportion to the thermal energy deposited, and is conventionally considered\nharmless at low powers which do not produce significant temperature rise.\nUltraviolet radiation in some aspects occupies a middle ground, in having some\nfeatures of both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Although nearly all of the\nultraviolet spectrum of radiation is non-ionizing, at the same time ultraviolet\nradiation does far more damage to many molecules in biological systems than is\naccounted for by heating effects (an example is sunburn). These properties\nderive from ultraviolet's power to alter chemical bonds, even without having\nquite enough energy to ionize atoms.\n\nThe question of harm to biological systems due to low-power ionizing and non-\nionizing radiation is not settled. Controversy continues about possible non-\nheating effects of low-power non-ionizing radiation, such as non-heating\nmicrowave and radio wave exposure. Non-ionizing radiation is usually considered\nto have a safe lower limit, especially as thermal radiation is unavoidable and\nubiquitous. By contrast, ionizing radiation is conventionally considered to have\nno completely safe lower limit, although at some energy levels, new exposures do\nnot add appreciably to background radiation. The evidence that small amounts of\nsome types of ionizing radiation might confer a net health benefit in some\nsituations, is called radiation hormesis.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Radiation","recorded":1362506084,"links":80,"instances":["optics","radiation_safety","biology","chemical_process"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/archive/en/keynote3ng.pdf","http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/archive/en/keynote3ng.pdf","http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Documents/bulletins/oet56/oet56e4.pdf"],"categories":["Radiation|","Concepts in physics"],"headings":["Ionizing radiation","Non-ionizing radiation","Discovery","Uses of radiation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation_penetration.svg/320px-Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation_penetration.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg/300px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png/220px-Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["orders_of_magnitude","numbers#1012"],["effective_dose","radiation_safety"],["browning","chemical_process"],["browning","chemical_process"],["triangular_prism","optics"]],"members":["triangular_prism","orders_of_magnitude","effective_dose","cell","browning"],"related":["Inverse-square_law","Electromagnetic_radiation","Near_and_far_field","Electromagnetic_field","Physics","Energy","Ionizing_radiation","Non-ionizing_radiation","Radio_waves","Infrared_radiation","Light","Radiometry","Inverse-square_law","Organisms","Natural_environment","Ultraviolet","Sunburn","Non-ionizing_radiation","Thermal_radiation","Ionizing_radiation","Background_radiation","Radiation_hormesis","Energy","Ionize","Atom","Cell_(biology)","Cancer","Electromagnetic_radiation","Absorbed_dose","Equivalent_dose","Effective_dose_(radiation_safety)","Photons","Electron_volts","Alpha_particles","Beta_particles","Cosmic_ray","Gamma_rays","X-ray","Neutron","Geiger_counter","Cherenkov_radiation","Radiation_sickness","Spectrum","Ultraviolet","Pyrimidine_dimer","Alpha_particle","Helium-4","Atomic_nucleus","Geiger_counter","Alpha_decay","Cosmic_ray","Radioisotope","Relative_biological_effectiveness","Radium","Radon","Polonium","Electron","Radioactive_decay","Antineutrino","Linac","Radiotherapy","Positron","Antimatter","Electron","Positron","Free_neutron","Nuclear_fission","Nuclear_fusion","Neutron_activation","Thermal_neutron","Kinetic_energy","Neutron_activation","Chemical_bond","Free_radical","Billiard_ball","Nuclear_reactor","Nanometers","Energy","Planck_constant","Speed_of_light","Wavelength","Photon","Photon","Atomic_nucleus","Depleted_uranium","Browning_(chemical_process)","Photon","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Myriameter","Black_body_radiation","Infrared","Thermal_energy","Black_body","Wien's_displacement_law","Stefan–Boltzmann_law","Temperature","Photosphere","Nuclear_weapon","Browning_(chemical_process)","Black_body","Planck's_law","Black_body","Wien's_displacement_law","William_Herschel","Astronomer","Royal_Society_of_London","Triangular_prism_(optics)","Refract","Sun","Red","Thermometer","Johann_Wilhelm_Ritter","Silver_chloride","Heinrich_Hertz","James_Clerk_Maxwell","Wilhelm_Röntgen","X-rays","Henri_Becquerel","Uranium","Marie_Curie","Radioactivity","Marie_Curie","Pierre_Curie","Radium","Pitchblende","Alpha_particle","Beta_particle","Ernest_Rutherford","Henri_Becquerel","Paul_Villard","Gamma_ray","Cosmic_ray","Victor_Hess","Electrometer","Neutron","Positron","Muon","Pion","Particle_accelerators","Radiocarbon_dating","Radioactive_tracer","Neutron_activation_analysis","Neutrons","Background_radiation","Čerenkov_radiation","Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","Kelvin","Blackbody_radiation","Universe","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Hawking_radiation","Ionizing_radiation","Banana_equivalent_dose","Non-ionizing_radiation","Radiant_energy","Radiation_damage","Radiation_hardening","Radiation_hormesis","Radiation_poisoning","Radiation_properties","Radioactive_contamination","Radioactive_decay","Radiation_Protection_Convention,_1960","International_Labour_Organization"]}
