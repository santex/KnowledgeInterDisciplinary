The word was coined\nfrom the Latin controversia, as a composite of controversus â \"turned in an\nopposite direction,\" from contra â \"against\" â and vertere â to turn, or versus\n(see ), hence, \"to turn against.\"\n\nThe most applicable or well known controversial subjects, topics or areas are\npolitics, religion and sex.
