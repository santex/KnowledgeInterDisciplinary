In this context, the verb 'operate' means to perform surgery.\nThe adjective 'surgical' means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments\nor surgical nurse. The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can\nbe a person or an animal. A surgeon is a person who practises surgery. Persons\ndescribed as surgeons are commonly physicians, but the term is also applied to\npodiatrists, dentists (known as oral and maxillofacial surgeons) and\nveterinarians. A surgery can last from minutes to hours, but is typically not an\nongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term surgery can also refer to the\nplace where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist,\nor veterinarian.\n\nElective surgery generally refers to a surgical procedure that can be scheduled\nin advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Plastic, or cosmetic\nsurgeries are common elective procedures.\n",
