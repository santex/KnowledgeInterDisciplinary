The EEC was also known as the 'Common Market' in\nthe English-speaking world and sometimes referred to as the 'European Community'\neven before it was officially renamed as such in 1993.\n\nIt gained a common set of institutions along with the European Coal and Steel\nCommunity (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of\nthe European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels).\n\nUpon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the EEC was renamed\nthe European Community (EC) to reflect that it covered a wider range of policy.\nThis was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were\ncollectively made to constitute the first of the three pillars of the European\nUnion (EU), which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it\nwas abolished by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, which merged the EU's former pillars\nand provided that the EU would \"replace and succeed the European Community.\"\n","title":"European%20Economic%20Community","headings":["History","Aims and achievements","Members","Institutions","Policy areas","See also","Notes and references","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["8: Treaty_of_Rome","7: European_Parliament","5: Council_of_the_European_Union","4: Merger_Treaty","4: European_Union","4: European_Court_of_Justice","4: European_Commission","3: President_of_the_European_Commission","3: Maastricht_Treaty","3: Treaty_of_Lisbon","3: European_Communities","3: Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union","3: Customs_union","3: Charles_de_Gaulle","3: Common_Agricultural_Policy","3: European_Parliament_election,_1979","3: European_Council","3: Single_European_Act","2: Inner_Six","2: Belgium","2: France","2: Italy","2: Luxembourg","2: Netherlands","2: West_Germany","2: European_Coal_and_Steel_Community","2: Economy_of_the_European_Union","2: Paul_Henri_Spaak","2: Castle_of_the_Valley_of_the_Duchess","2: Hallstein_Commission","2: French_President","2: Enlargement_of_the_European_Union","2: Denmark","2: Republic_of_Ireland","2: Budgetary_treaties_of_the_European_Communities","2: Greece","2: Spain","2: Portugal","2: Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters","2: Codecision_procedure","2: Right_of_asylum","2: Treaty_of_Nice","2: East_Germany","2: Dutch_language","2: European_Union_legislative_procedure","2: Law_of_the_European_Union","2: Budget_of_the_European_Union","1: Treaty_of_Maastricht","1: Brussels","1: Strasbourg","1: European_anthem","1: International_organization","1: Common_market","1: Institutions_of_the_European_Union","1: European_Atomic_Energy_Community","1: Supranationalism","1: European_integration","1: Member_state_of_the_European_Union","1: Federal_Europe","1: European_Defence_Community","1: European_Political_Community","1: French_Parliament","1: Jean_Monnet","1: Messina_Conference","1: Spaak_Report","1: Spaak_Committee","1: Ohlin_Report","1: Intergovernmental_Conference_on_the_Common_Market_and_Euratom","1: Euratom","1: Sovereignty","1: Nuclear_power","1: Luxembourg_compromise","1: Gentlemen's_agreement","1: Mikhail_Gorbachev","1: Norway","1: Trojan_horse","1: Georges_Pompidou","1: Edward_Heath","1: Commonwealth_of_Nations","1: Norway_and_the_European_Union","1: Referendum","1: Treaties_of_Rome","1: Roy_Jenkins","1: Flag_of_Europe","1: Symbols_of_Europe","1: Turkey","1: Hague","1: Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy","1: European_Community","1: Supranational","1: Intergovernmental_organization","1: Qualified_Majority_Voting","1: Federalism","1: Treaty_of_Amsterdam","1: Illegal_immigration","1: Legal_person","1: Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe","1: Common_external_tariff","1: Common_Transport_Policy","1: Algerian_War","1: European_Free_Trade_Association","1: Benelux","1: Member_State_of_the_European_Union","1: List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_accession","1: Belgian_franc","1: Danish_language","1: Danish_krone","1: French_franc","1: German_reunification","1: Deutsche_Mark","1: Greek_language","1: Greek_drachma","1: Irish_pound","1: Italian_lira","1: Luxembourgish_language","1: Luxembourgish_franc","1: Dutch_guilder","1: Portuguese_language","1: Portuguese_escudo","1: Aranese_language","1: Galician_language","1: Basque_language","1: Catalan_language","1: Spanish_peseta","1: United_Kingdom","1: Pound_sterling","1: European_Commissioner","1: Apportionment_in_the_European_Parliament","1: European_Coal_and_Steel_Community#Institutions","1: High_Authority_of_the_European_Coal_and_Steel_Community","1: Jacques_Delors","1: Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union","1: European_Union_member_state","1: Treaties_of_the_European_Union","1: Consultation_procedure","1: Assent_procedure","1: Cooperation_procedure","1: Supreme_court","1: Taxpayer","1: Audit_report","1: Border_control","1: Common_Fisheries_Policy","1: European_Community_competition_law","1: Consumer_protection","1: Customs_Union","1: Single_market","1: Economic_and_monetary_union","1: Environmental_law","1: Citizenship_of_the_European_Union","1: Immigration_policy","1: Schengen_treaty","1: Social_policy","1: International_trade","1: Trans-European_Networks","1: Brussels_and_the_European_Union","1: Delors_Commission","1: European_Institutions_in_Strasbourg","1: Location_of_European_Union_institutions"]}
