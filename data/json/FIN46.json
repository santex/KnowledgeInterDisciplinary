{"cursor":"4487","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'FIN 46', revised and replaced in its entirety by 'FIN 46R', is a statement for\nthe purposes of United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\npublished by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) which requires\na reporting enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE) if it is\nthe primary beneficiary of the VIE based on variable interests. One of the main\nreasons FIN46 was issued as an interpretation instead of an accounting standard\nwas to issue the standard in a relatively short period of time in response to\nthe Enron scandal.\n\nFIN 46R is an interpretation of ARB 51 relating to consolidation. Consolidation\nof assets and liabilities is required whenever one entity has a controlling\nfinancial interest in another entity. The traditional ARB 51 approach assumed\nthat equity - usually common stock - would receive the residual economic\ninterest generated by a business, which is why ARB 51 focuses on equity-based\nmajority voting interests. The traditional criterion for a controlling\nfinancial interest under ARB 51 is a majority voting interest. In the 1980s and\n1990s it became common for many companies to control assets in certain\nbusinesses without maintaining a majority voting interest in those businesses.\nThis was more often done with securitizations rather than traditional limited\nliability corporations, because the securitization's common stock or other\nvoting interests could be paid defined, limited amounts and all other cash\nflows could be directed to other securityholders. Before FIN 46, this enabled\ncompanies to avoid consolidation, which permitted them to keep the liabilities\nand losses of their controlled special purpose entities off of their financial\nstatements. In such cases, consolidation based on equity did not serve the\npurpose of effective reporting because it does not reflect the true nature of\nrelationships among entities.\n\nFIN 46R closed this loophole by defining tests to identify a controlling\nfinancial interest beyond just equity ownership and voting rights. This is\nimportant in cases where the legal equity is insignificant or at least somewhat\nirrelevant from the viewpoint of risk/rewards. The new rules emphasize the\nsubstance of relationships among entities, rather than emphasizing the form of\nrelationships among entities (such as a majority voting interest), which can be\nmore easily manipulated.\n\nUnder FIN 46R, the first step is to determine if a company has a variable\ninterest in another entity. In general terms, a variable interest is an interest\nin an entity that increases and decreases in value (i.e., is variable) according\nto increases and decreases in the expected cash flows from the entity's assets\nand liabilities. Once a variable interest is established, the second step is to\ndetermine who is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity (or\n\"VIE\"). The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that holds the majority\nof the risks and rewards associated with the VIE. Once a primary beneficiary is\nidentified, it is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and\nmust consolidate the VIE onto its financial statements, whether or not it holds\na majority voting interest.\n\nNote that when the FASB first began working on FIN 46, it focused on special\npurpose entities, like the entities Enron used. The FASB then quickly recognized\nthat the principles of FIN 46 should apply to all entities where a variable\ninterest exists, so the final interpretation is broader than the original\nobjective.\n\nFinally, note that where, as in a securitization, a party selling assets to a\nVIE and maintaining an ongoing involvement with those assets (for example as a\nswap counter-party to the VIE with respect to asset cashflows) then Financial\nAccounting Standard 140 (FAS140), which deals with de-recognition of assets upon\ntransfer to a special purpose entity) will also be relevant.\n","linknr":100,"url":"FIN46","recorded":1375069997,"links":["/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/FIN_46","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=FIN46&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Business","/wiki/Wikipedia:P","/wiki/United_States_Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles","/wiki/Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board","/wiki/Enron_scandal","/wiki/Consolidation_(business)","/wiki/Special_purpose_entity","/wiki/Special_purpose_entity","/w/index.php?title=Financial_Accounting_Standards&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=FAS140&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/US_GAAP","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit&section=3","http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&cid=1176156316498(codification","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&oldid=394436439","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:United_States_Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_expert_attention_with_no_reason_or_talk_parameter","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_expert_attention_from_February_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_expert_attention","/wiki/Category:Business_articles_needing_expert_attention","/wiki/Category:Miscellaneous_articles_needing_expert_attention","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FIN+46&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FIN+46","/wiki/FIN_46","/wiki/Talk:FIN_46","#","/wiki/FIN_46","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/FIN_46","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/FIN_46","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&oldid=394436439","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5425838","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=FIN_46&id=394436439","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=FIN+46","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=FIN+46&oldid=394436439&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=FIN_46&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5425838#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIN_46","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["United
