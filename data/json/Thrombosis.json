When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelets\n(thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss. Even when\na blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain\nconditions. A clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is\nknown as an embolus.\n\nWhen a thrombus occupies more than 75% of cross-sectional area of the lumen of\nan artery, blood flow to the tissue supplied is reduced enough to cause symptoms\nbecause of decreased oxygen (hypoxia) and accumulation of metabolic products\nlike lactic acid. More than 90% obstruction can result in anoxia, the complete\ndeprivation of oxygen, and infarction, a mode of cell death.\n\nThromboembolism is the combination of thrombosis and its main\ncomplication, embolism.\n","linknr":623,"url":"Thrombosis","recorded":1362565491,"links":51,"instances":["united_kingdom","medical","medical","anatomy","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/146/4/278.pdf","http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/146/4/278.pdf"],"categories":["Hematology"],"headings":["Causes","Classification","Embolization","Prevention","Treatment","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Aterialthrombosis.jpg/230px-Aterialthrombosis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"],["tissue","anatomy"],["hypoxia","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["cell","biology"],["swelling","medical"],["chief_medical_officer","united_kingdom"]],"members":["chief_medical_officer","swelling","hypoxia","tissue","cell","lumen"],"related":["Thrombus","Blood_vessel","Blood","Circulatory_system","Platelets","Thrombocytes","Fibrin","Blood_clot","Embolus","Lumen_(anatomy)","Tissue_(anatomy)","Oxygen","Hypoxia_(medical)","Lactic_acid","Hypoxia_(medical)","Infarction","Cell_(biology)","Embolism","Virchow's_triad","Hypercoagulability","Endothelial_cell_injury","Tissue_factor","Venous_stasis","Heart_failure","Atrial_fibrillation","Left_atrial_appendage","Cancers","Malignancies","Vein","Deep_vein","Femoral_vein","Swelling_(medical)","Hepatic_portal_vein","Hypertension","Pancreatitis","Cirrhosis","Diverticulitis","Cholangiocarcinoma","Renal_vein","Anticoagulation","Sepsis","Pulmonary_embolism","Papilledema","Hepatic_vein","Inferior_vena_cava","Abdominal_pain","Ascites","Hepatomegaly","Shunt","Upper_extremity","Axillary_vein","Subclavian_vein","Stroke","Dural_venous_sinuses","Headache","Seizures","Computed_Tomography","Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","Mortality_rate","Artery","Atheroma","Atrial_fibrillation","Cardioversion","Anticoagulant_therapy","Arterial_embolism","Infarction","Ischemia","Embolus","Hemorrhage","Atherosclerotic","Internal_carotid","Vertebral_artery","Circle_of_Willis","Infarct","Coronary_artery","Thrombolysis","Liver_transplantation","Circulatory_system","Pyemia","Septic_embolus","Embolism","Infarction","Fibrinolysis","Heparin","Pulmonary_embolism","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Stroke","Atrial_fibrillation","Stroke","Hypertension","Warfarin","Health_Select_Committee","Compression_stockings","Orthopedic_surgery","Clinical_practice_guideline","Low_molecular_weight_heparin","Inferior_vena_cava_filter","United_Kingdom","Chief_Medical_Officer_(United_Kingdom)","Vitamin_K_antagonist","Anticoagulant","Bleeding","International_normalized_ratio","National_Blood_Clot_Alliance","Blood_clotting_tests"]}
