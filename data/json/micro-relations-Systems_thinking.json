{"cursor":"16813","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Systems thinking' is the process of understanding how things, regarded as\nsystems, influence one another within a whole. In nature, systems thinking\nexamples include ecosystems in which various elements such as air, water,\nmovement, plants, and animals work together to survive or perish. In\norganizations, systems consist of people, structures, and processes that work\ntogether to make an organization \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy\".\n\nSystems thinking has been defined as an approach to problem solving, by viewing\n\"problems\" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to specific part,\noutcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of\nunintended consequences. Systems thinking is not one thing but a set of habits\nor practices http://www.watersfoundation.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=materials-\n.main within a framework that is based on the belief that the parts of a\nsystem can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other\nand with other systems, rather than in isolation. Systems thinking focuses on\ncyclical rather than linear cause and effect.\n\nIn science systems, it is argued that the only way to fully understand why a\nproblem or element occurs and persists is to understand the parts in relation to\nthe whole. Capra, F. (1996) The web of life: a new scientific understanding\nof living systems (1st Anchor Books ed). New York: Anchor Books. p. 30\nStanding in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism and philosophical\nanalysis, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with\nsystems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by\nexamining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the\nentirety of the system.\n\nScience systems thinking attempts to illustrate how small catalytic events that\nare separated by distance and time can be the cause of significant changes in\ncomplex systems. Acknowledging that an improvement in one area of a system can\nadversely affect another area of the system, it promotes organizational\ncommunication at all levels in order to avoid the silo effect. Systems thinking\ntechniques may be used to study any kind of system â natural, scientific,\nengineered, human, or conceptual.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Systems_thinking","recorded":1362476953,"links":33,"instances":["sociology","systems_scientist","systems_theory","systems_scientist","automatic_control","fuller","author"],"pdf":["http://www.system-denken.ch/Furrer_what_is_systems_thinking.pdf"],"categories":["Anticipatory
