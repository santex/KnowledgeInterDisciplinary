Born in the\nthen-British colony of New Brunswick to a family of Loyalists who had fled the\nAmerican Revolution, he entered politics in 1846, serving in the colony's\nLegislative Assembly and House of Assembly.\n\nOn August 5, 1835, he married Anne Fisher, sister of Lewis P. Fisher. They had\nseven children, one of whom died young. She died on October 5, 1895 and is\nburied in the Old Methodist Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His son George\nHeber went on to serve in the House of Commons.\n\nIn 1858, Connell was appointed Postmaster General of the colony, at a time when\nincreasing trade with the United States was forcing the British colonies to\nreconsider their currencies and institute a decimal system that would be more\nfamiliar to their American neighbors. New Brunswick adopted a decimal currency\nin 1859, and in the following year, Connell issued the first series of postage\nstamps in the new denomination. While few people had problems with the new\ncurrency, they were outraged that Connell chose to depict himself on the 5-cent\nstamp, instead of Queen Victoria. In an effort to stem the criticism and charges\nof extreme arrogance, he offered to buy up all the stamps and burned them\npublicly on the front lawn of his house. He also resigned his office as\npostmaster general. It is unknown how many stamps survived, but they\nnumber no more than a few dozen and are now extremely\nrare.

A member of the Executive Council of New Brunswick, he served as\nSurveyor General from July 10, 1866 to July 17, 1867.\n\nAn ardent supporter of Canadian Confederation, Connell was elected as a Member\nof Parliament representing the New Brunswick electoral district of Carleton in\nthe first two Canadian parliaments.\n\nFrom 1865 to 1866, he published his own newspaper, The Union. http://archiv-\nes.gnb.ca/APPS/NewspaperDirectory/Directory.aspx?culture=en-\nCA&Key=690&Tab=5\n\nHe died at his house on June 28, 1873. {{cite news|date=19 July\n1873|publisher=Carleton Sentinel|accessdate=2009-10-\n01|volume=34|issue=1459|quote=Died at his residence 28th June, Hon.
