{"cursor":"12373","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn human sexuality, 'top', 'bottom', and 'versatile' are terms that describe\nroles during sexual intercourse, particularly between two men. A 'top' is a\nperson who penetrates, a 'bottom' is one who receives penetration, and a\n'versatile' engages in both activities. These terms may be elements of self-\nidentity that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe\nbroader social, psychological, and/or sexual identities.\n\nTop, bottom, and versatile are also used in BDSM to describe similarâbut\ndistinctâBDSM identities and practices.\n","linknr":486,"url":"Bottom_(sex)","recorded":1362667837,"links":25,"instances":["sex_position","philosophy","linguistics","sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anal eroticism","Gay slang","Male homosexuality","Sexual roles","Sexology"],"headings":["Top","Bottom","Versatile","Role vs. position","Prevalence","In BDSM","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Wiki-anal_missionary.png/250px-Wiki-anal_missionary.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg/32px-Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg/32px-Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifestyle","sociology"],["self-determination","philosophy"],["woman_on_top","sex_position"],["derivation","linguistics"]],"members":["woman_on_top","derivation","lifestyle"],"related":["Human_sexuality","Sexual_intercourse","Homosexuality","Self-identity","BDSM","Penis","Anal_sex","Oral_sex","Self-identity","Dominance_and_submission","Romantic_relationship","Sexual_relationship","Trevor_Hart","Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Oral_sex","Sex_toy","Anus","Anal_sex","Dominance_and_submission","Romantic_relationship","Sexual_relationship","Fellatio","Irrumatio","Domination_and_submission","Domination_and_submission","Anal_sex","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Oral_sex","Anal_penetration","Intimate_relationship","Labels","Stereotype","Generalization","Self-determination_(philosophy)","Gay_pornography","Porn_industry","Career","Human_penis_size","Erotic_artist","Tom_of_Finland","Woman_on_top_(sex_position)","Gay.com","United_States","BDSM","Derivation_(linguistics)","Loan_words","Gay_culture","Anal_sex","List_of_sexual_positions","Seme_and_uke","Japan","Anime","Manga","Fandom"]}
