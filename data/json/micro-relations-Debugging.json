Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are\ntightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another. Many\nbooks have been written about debugging (see below: Further reading), as it\ninvolves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow,\nintegration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps,\nprofiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve\ndetection while simplifying changes.\n","linknr":303,"url":"Debugging","recorded":1362485835,"links":43,"instances":["computing","programming_language","software","computers","programming_language","computing","computer_programming"],"pdf":["http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/ctss/CTSS_ProgrammersGuide.pdf","http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~mgagnon/software_protection_through_anti_debugging.pdf","http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/EmbeddedDebugger.pdf"],"categories":["Debuggers|*","Debugging|*"],"headings":["Origin","Scope","Tools","Typical debugging process","Techniques","Debugging for embedded systems","Anti-debugging","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg/220px-Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Xbox-Debug-Console-Set.jpg/250px-Xbox-Debug-Console-Set.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/32px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["profiling","computer_programming"],["execution","computers"],["java","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["crash","computing"],["tracing","software"],["crash","computing"],["assertion","computing"],["magic_number","programming#magic_debug_values"]],"members":["assertion","c","tracing","execution","java","magic_number","crash","profiling"],"related":["Computer_bug","Computer_program","Electronic_hardware","Low-Coupling_/_High-Cohesion_pattern","Interactive","Control_flow","Integration_testing","Log_file","Application_monitoring","System_Monitoring","Memory_dump","Profiling_(computer_programming)","Statistical_Process_Control","Admiral_Grace_Hopper","Thomas_Edison","Software_bug","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Computer_bug","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","Systems_of_linear_inequalities","Compatible_Time-Sharing_System","Software_patch","Impact_assessment","Life-critical","Mission-critical","Programming_language","Programmer","Execution_(computers)","Breakpoint","High-level_programming_language","Java_(programming_language)","Exception_handling","C_(programming_language)","Assembly_language","Memory_corruption","Memory_debugging","Computer_hardware","BIOS","Device_driver","Firmware","Oscilloscope","Logic_analyzer","In-circuit_emulator","Software","Firmware","Parallel_processing","Unusual_software_bugs","Crash_(computing)","Divide_and_conquer_algorithm","Graphical_user_interface","Debugger","Call_stack","Tracing_(software)","Printf","Crash_(computing)","Memory_dump","Core_dump","Reverse_engineering","Copy_protection","Malware","Assertion_(computing)","Debugger","Software_bug","Software_testing","Shotgun_debugging","IBM"]}
