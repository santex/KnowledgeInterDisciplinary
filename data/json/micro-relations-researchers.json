It is used to establish or confirm\n facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems,\n support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an\n expansion on past work in the field. To test the validity of instruments,\n procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects,\n or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed\n to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the\n research and development of methods and systems for the advancement of human\n knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary\n considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several\n forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social,\n business, practitioner research,
