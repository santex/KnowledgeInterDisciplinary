{"cursor":"6205","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'German family names' were introduced during the late Middle Ages in the German\nlanguage area. Usually, such family names are derived from nicknames. In\netymology, they are generally classified into four groups, based on the origin\nof a nickname: given names, job designations, bodily attributes, and\ngeographical references (including references to named buildings). Also, many\nfamily names display characteristic features of the dialect of the region they\noriginated in.\n\n* 'Given names' often turned into family names when people were identified by\n  their father's name. For example, the first name [[Ahrend]] developed into the\n  family name Ahrends by adding a genitive s-ending, as in Ahrend's son. \n  Examples: [[Ahrends]]/[[Ahrens (disambiguation)|Ahrens]], [[Burchard\n  (disambiguation)|Burkhard]], [[Wulff (disambiguation)|Wulff]], [[Friedrich\n  (surname)|Friedrich]], [[Benz (disambiguation)|Benz]], [[Fritz\n  (disambiguation)|Fritz]]. With many of the early city records written in\n  Latin, occasionally the Latin genitive singular -i was used such as in Jakobi\n  or Alberti or (written as -'y') in Mendelssohn Bartholdy.\n\n* 'Job designations' are the most common form of family names; anybody who had\n  an unusual job would have been bound to be identified by it. Examples:\n  [[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]] (smith), [[MÃ¼ller (surname)|MÃ¼ller]] (miller),\n  [[Meier]] (farm administrator; akin to Mayor), [[Schulz]]e (constable),\n  [[Fischer]] (fisherman), [[Schneider (surname)|Schneider]] (tailor), [[Maurer\n  (disambiguation)|Maurer]] (mason), [[Bauer (surname)|Bauer]] (farmer), Metzger\n  or Fleischer (butcher), TÃ¶pfer, Toepfer (potter) or Klingemann (weapons\n  smith). Also, names referring to nobility such as [[Kaiser]] (emperor),\n  [[KÃ¶nig (disambiguation)|KÃ¶nig]] (king), [[Graf]] (count) are common, with the\n  name bearers probably only a minor functionary of a monarch.\n\n* 'Bodily attribute names' are family names such as [[Krause]] (curly),\n  [[Schwarzkopf]] (black head), [[Klein (surname)|Klein]] (small), GroÃ (big).\n* 'Geographical names' are derived from the name of a city or village, or the\n  location of someone's home. They often have the '-er' postfix that signifies\n  origin (as in English New Yorker). Examples: Kissinger (from Kissingen),\n  [[Schwarzenegger]] (from Schwarzenegg [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&h-\n  l=en&geocode=&q=Schwarzenegg&sll=37.0625,-\n  95.677068&sspn=36.863178,61.787109&ie=UTF8&ll=46.795667,7.715535&spn=0.007786-\n  ,0.015085&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr] or Schwarzeneck), [[Bayer]] (from\n  Bavaria, German Bayern). BÃ¶hm indicates that a family originated in Bohemia.\n\n* A special case of geographical names were those derived from a building or\n  landmark, e.g. a [[Busch (disambiguation)|Busch]] (bush) or [[Springborn\n  (surname)|Springborn]] (spring/well). Before the advent of street names and\n  numbers, even for long times afterwards, many important buildings like inns,\n  mills and farmsteads were given names (see also Der Lachs zu Danzig). Such a\n  place was often better known than the people living in it; the people would\n  get their 'family' name from the building. This name could be combined with a\n  profession: Rosenbauer (rose-farmer, from a farmstead called 'the rose');\n  KindlmÃ¼ller (child's miller, from a mill named 'the Christmas child', 'the\n  prodigal child' or 'the king's child'). The name of the building could also be\n  used as is: BÃ¤r (Bear); [[Engels]] (from Engel, angel).\n\n* Immigration, often sponsored by local authorities, also brought foreign family\n  names into the German speaking regions. Depending on regional history,\n  geography and economics, many family names have French, Dutch, Italian,\n  Hungarian or Slavic (e.g. Polish) origins. Sometimes they survived in their\n  original form; in other cases, the spelling would be adapted to German (the\n  Slavic ending ic becoming the German -itz or -itsch or Baltic \"-kis\" becoming\n  \"-ke\"). Over time, the spelling often changed to reflect native German\n  pronunciation (Sloothaak for the Dutch Sloothaag); but some names, such as\n  those of French Huguenots settling in Prussia, retained their spelling but\n  with the pronunciation that would come naturally to a German reading the name:\n  [[Marquard]], pronounced marcar in French, ended up being pronounced Markuart\n  much like the German Markwart from which it was originally derived.\n\nThe preposition [[von]] (\"of\") was used to distinguish Nobility; for example, if\nsomeone was baron of the village of Veltheim, his family name would be von\nVeltheim. In modern times, people who were elevated to nobility often had a\n'von' added to their name. For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe had his name\nchanged to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. This practice ended with the abolition of\nthe monarchy in Germany and Austria in 1919. Some times von is also used in\ngeographical names that are not noble, as in von DÃ¤niken.\n\nWith family names originating locally, many names display particular\ncharacteristics of the local dialects, such as the south German, Austrian and\nSwiss diminutive endings -l -el, '-erl,-leor-lias inKleibl,SchÃ¤ubleorNÃ¤geli''\n(from 'Nagel', nail).\n","linknr":155,"url":"German_surname","recorded":1363835028,"links":["/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/German_family_names","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=German_surname&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/German_language","/wiki/Family_name","/wiki/Nickname","/wiki/Family_name_etymology","/wiki/Given_name","/wiki/Employment","/wiki/Geography","/wiki/Dialect","/wiki/Patronymic","/w/index.php?title=Ahrend&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ahrends&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ahrens_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Burchard_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wulff_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Friedrich_(surname)","/wiki/Benz_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Fritz_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Latin","/wiki/Mendelssohn_Bartholdy","/wiki/Schmidt_(surname)","/wiki/Smith_(metalwork)","/wiki/M%C3%BCller_(surname)","/wiki/Miller","/wiki/Meier","/wiki/Farm","/wiki/Mayor","/wiki/Schulz","/wiki/Constable","/wiki/Fischer","/wiki/Fisherman","/wiki/Schneider_(surname)","/wiki/Tailor","/wiki/Maurer_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Bauer_(surname)","/wiki/Farmer","/wiki/Metzger_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Fleischer","/wiki/T%C3%B6pfer","/wiki/Toepfer","/wiki/Klingemann_(surname)","/wiki/Kaiser","/wiki/K%C3%B6nig_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Graf","/wiki/Krause","/wiki/Schwarzkopf","/wiki/Klein_(surname)","/wiki/Gro%C3%9F","/wiki/Kissingen","/wiki/Schwarzenegger","/w/index.php?title=Schwarzenegg&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Schwarzeneck&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bayer","/wiki/Bavaria","/wiki/B%C3%B6hm","/wiki/Bohemia","/wiki/Busch_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Springborn_(surname)","/wiki/Der_Lachs_zu_Danzig","/wiki/Engels","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Dutch_language","/wiki/Italian_language","/wiki/Hungarian_language","/wiki/Slavic_languages","/wiki/Polish_language","/wiki/Slavic_language","/wiki/Baltic_language","/wiki/Huguenots","/wiki/Prussia","/wiki/Marquard","/wiki/Von","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","/wiki/Diminutive","/wiki/Sch%C3%A4uble","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/German_name","/wiki/Germanic_names","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Schwarzenegg&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.863178,61.787109&ie=UTF8&ll=46.795667,7.715535&spn=0.007786,0.015085&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr","/wiki/Duden","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3411708514","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&oldid=534141922","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:German-language_surnames","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=German+family+names&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=German+family+names","/wiki/German_family_names","/wiki/Talk:German_family_names","#","/wiki/German_family_names","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/German_family_names","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/German_family_names","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&oldid=534141922","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=German_family_names&id=534141922","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=German+family+names","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=German+family+names&oldid=534141922&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=German_family_names&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Familiennamen","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen_y
