{"cursor":"5780","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nConservatism in the United Kingdom is related to its counterparts in other\nWestern nations, but has a distinct tradition. Edmund Burke is often considered\nthe father of conservatism in the English-speaking world. Burke was a Whig,\nwhile the term [[Tory]] is given to the later Conservative Party. One Australian\nscholar argues, \"For Edmund Burke and Australians of a like mind, the essence of\nconservatism lies not in a body of theory, but in the disposition to maintain\nthose institutions seen as central to the beliefs and practices of society.\" Worthington, Glen, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060913184447/http://-\nwww.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02RN29.htm Conservatism in Australian\nNational Politics], Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 19 February\n2002\n\n and Ronald Reagan in 1981.]] The old established form of English and, after the\n Act of Union, British conservatism, was the Tory Party. It reflected the\n attitudes of a rural land owning class, and championed the institutions of the\n monarchy, the Anglican Church, the family, and property as the best defence of\n the social order. In the early stages of the industrial revolution, it seemed\n to be totally opposed to a process that seemed to undermine some of these\n bulwarks. The new industrial elite were seen by many as enemies to the social\n order. Robert Peel was able to reconcile the new industrial class to the Tory\n landed class by persuading the latter to accept the repeal of the Corn Laws in\n 1846. He created a new political group that sought to preserve the old status\n quo while accepting the basics of laissez-faire and free trade. The new\n coalition of traditional landowners and sympathetic industrialists constituted\n the new Conservative Party.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli gave the new party a political ideology. As a young man, he\nwas influenced by the romantic movement and medievalism, and developed a\ndevastating critique of industrialism. In his novels, he outlined an England\ndivided into two nations, each living in perfect ignorance of each other. He\nforesaw, like Karl Marx, the phenomenon of an alienated industrial proletariat.\nHis solution involved a return to an idealised view of a corporate or organic\nsociety, in which everyone had duties and responsibilities towards other people\nor groups. This \"one nation\" conservatism is still a significant tradition in\nBritish politics. It has animated a great deal of social reform undertaken by\nsuccessive Conservative governments.\n\nAlthough nominally a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the\ndemands of the Chartists and argued for an alliance between the landed\naristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the middle\nclass, helping to found the Young England group in 1842 to promote the view that\nthe rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the\nmiddle class. The conversion of the Conservative Party into a modern mass\norganisation was accelerated by the concept of Tory Democracy attributed to Lord\nRandolph Churchill, father of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston\nChurchill.\n\n is the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the\n Conservative Party.]] A Liberal-Conservative coalition during World War I,\n coupled with the ascent of the Labour Party, hastened the collapse of the\n Liberals in the 1920s. After World War II, the Conservative Party made\n concessions to the socialist policies of the Left. This compromise was a\n pragmatic measure to regain power, but also the result of the early successes\n of central planning and state ownership forming a cross-party consensus. This\n was known as Butskellism, after the almost identical Keynesian policies of Rab\n Butler on behalf of the Conservatives, and Hugh Gaitskell for Labour.\n\nHowever, in the 1980s, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, and the\ninfluence of Keith Joseph, there was a dramatic shift in the ideological\ndirection of British conservatism, with a movement towards free-market economic\npolicies. As one commentator explains, \"The privatization of state owned\nindustries, unthinkable before, became commonplace [during Thatcher's\ngovernment] and has now been imitated all over the world.\" Davies,\nStephen, [http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v1n2/davies.html Margaret\nThatcher and the Rebirth of Conservatism], Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs,\nJuly 1993 Some commentators have questioned whether Thatcherism was\nconsistent with the traditional concept of conservatism in the United Kingdom,\nand saw her views as more consistent with radical classical liberalism. Thatcher\nwas described as \"a radical in a conservative party\", and her\nideology has been seen as confronting \"established institutions\" and the\n\"accepted beliefs of the elite\", both concepts incompatible with\nthe traditional conception of conservatism as signifying support for the\nestablished order and existing social convention.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Conservatism_in_the_United_Kingdom","recorded":1374543706,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Conservatism_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Conservatism_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Conservatism","/wiki/Conservatism","/wiki/File:DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg/70px-DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg.png","/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism","/wiki/Cultural_conservatism","/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism","/wiki/Green_conservatism","/wiki/Liberal_conservatism","/wiki/Libertarian_conservatism","/wiki/National_conservatism","/wiki/New_Right","/wiki/One-nation_conservatism","/wiki/Progressive_conservatism","/wiki/Religious_conservatism","/wiki/Social_conservatism","/wiki/Southern_Agrarians","/wiki/Traditionalist_conservatism","/wiki/Tradition","/wiki/Norm_(social)","/wiki/Natural_law","/wiki/Family_values","/wiki/Social_order","/wiki/Social_stratification","/wiki/Private_property","/wiki/Edmund_Burke","/wiki/Joseph_de_Maistre","/wiki/Louis_Gabriel_Ambroise_de_Bonald","/wiki/Adam_M%C3%BCller","/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand","/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke","/wiki/Nikolay_Karamzin","/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","/wiki/Juan_Donoso_Cort%C3%A9s","/wiki/Jaime_Balmes","/wiki/John_C._Calhoun","/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli","/wiki/Hippolyte_Taine","/wiki/Orestes_Brownson","/wiki/Louis_Veuillot","/wiki/Pierre_Guillaume_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_le_Play","/wiki/Arthur_de_Gobineau","/wiki/Heinrich_von_Treitschke","/wiki/Konstantin_Leontiev","/wiki/Maurice_Barr%C3%A8s","/wiki/Marcelino_Men%C3%A9ndez_y_Pelayo","/wiki/Gustave_Le_Bon","/wiki/George_Santayana","/wiki/Othmar_Spann","/wiki/Charles_Maurras","/wiki/Ivan_Ilyin","/wiki/Edgar_Julius_Jung","/wiki/Oswald_Spengler","/wiki/Henri_Massis","/wiki/Carl_Schmitt","/wiki/Julius_Evola","/wiki/Ramiro_de_Maeztu","/wiki/Michael_Oakeshott","/wiki/Arnold_Gehlen","/wiki/Leo_Strauss","/wiki/Peter_Viereck","/wiki/Russell_Kirk","/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_G%C3%B3mez_D%C3%A1vila","/wiki/Robert_Nisbet","/wiki/Erik_von_Kuehnelt-Leddihn","/wiki/Roger_Scruton","/wiki/Olavo_de_Carvalho","/wiki/International_Democrat_Union","/wiki/International_Young_Democrat_Union","/wiki/Asia_Pacific_Democrat_Union","/wiki/European_People%27s_Party","/wiki/European_Democrats","/wiki/Alliance_of_European_Conservatives_and_Reformists","/wiki/List_of_conservative_parties","/wiki/Conservative_Christianity_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholics","/wiki/Christian_right","/wiki/Low_Church","/wiki/Jewish_right","/wiki/Islamism","/wiki/Hindu_nationalism","/wiki/Agrarianism","/wiki/Aristocracy","/wiki/Capitalism","/wiki/Carlism","/wiki/Center-right","/wiki/Corporatism","/wiki/Conservative_Revolution","/wiki/Counter-revolutionary","/wiki/Monarchism","/wiki/Neo-liberalism","/wiki/New_Right","/wiki/Radical_center_(politics)","/wiki/Reactionary","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/Tory","/wiki/Portal:Conservatism","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Conservatism_sidebar","/wiki/Template_talk:Conservatism_sidebar","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Conservatism_sidebar&action=edit","/wiki/Conservatism","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Edmund_Burke","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Tory","/wiki/Australia","#cite_note-gw-1","/wiki/File:Thatcher_-_Reagan_c872-9.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Thatcher_-_Reagan_c872-9.jpg/220px-Thatcher_-_Reagan_c872-9.jpg","/wiki/File:Thatcher_-_Reagan_c872-9.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Anglican_Communion","/wiki/Industrial_revolution","/wiki/Robert_Peel","/wiki/Corn_Laws","/wiki/Laissez-faire","/wiki/Free_trade","/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli,_1st_Earl_of_Beaconsfield","/wiki/Romantic_movement","/wiki/Medievalism","/wiki/Karl_Marx","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Chartists","/wiki/Landed_nobility","/wiki/Young_England","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Tory_Democracy","/wiki/Lord_Randolph_Churchill","/wiki/Winston_Churchill","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"
