{"cursor":"2065","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Osmoprotectants' or 'compatible solutes' are small molecules that act as\nosmolytes and help organisms survive extreme osmotic stress. Examples include betaines, amino acids, and the sugar\ntrehalose. These molecules accumulate in cells and balance the osmotic\ndifference between the cell's surroundings and the cytosol. In extreme cases,\nsuch as in bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades, brine shrimp and nematodes, these\nmolecules can allow cells to survive being completely dried out and let them\nenter a state of suspended animation called cryptobiosis. In this\nstate the cytosol and osmoprotectants become a glass-like solid that helps\nstabilize proteins and cell membranes from the damaging effects of\ndesiccation.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Osmoprotectant","recorded":1362481959,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Osmolyte","Osmotic_stress","Betaine","Amino_acid","Trehalose","Cytosol","Bdelloid_rotifers","Tardigrades","Brine_shrimp","Nematodes","Cryptobiosis","Protein","Cell_membrane","Osmoregulation","Proline","Ectoine"]}
