{"cursor":"3550","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Nehemiah Donnellan' (1649 – 25 December 1705) was an Irish lawyer\nand judge.\n\nHe was the son of Sir James Donnellan, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas\nand grandson of Nehemiah Donnellan, Archbishop of Tuam. His mother was Sarah\nWheeler, daughter of Jonah Wheeler, Bishop of Ossory. He graduated from Trinity\nCollege Dublin in 1666. Though he seems to have originally intended to be a\nsoldier, he resolved on a legal career instead, and entered Middle Temple in\n1669. He was an exceptionally unruly student, being fined for breaking doors and\ngambling at Christmas. He was called to the Irish Barabout 1672 and became\nCommissioner of Revenue Appeals in 1677. After the Revolution of 1688 he lived\nfor a time in England.\n\nHe was appointed Prime Serjeant on 29 December 1692 and represented the borough\nof Galway in the Irish House of Commons from 1692 to 1693. In 1693 he was also\nmade Recorder of Dublin.\n\nHe was raised to the bench as a Puisne Baron of the Irish Court of Exchequer in\n1695, and on 31 December 1696 was one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal of\nIreland until the appointment of John Methuen as Lord Chancellor of Ireland in\n1697. He became Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 27 December 1703, holding the\noffice until his death. His elevation was part of an effort to remove judges\nsuspected of Tory or pro-Catholic views; but it was a little surprising that\nDonnellan, descendant of an Old Irish, Gaelic speaking family with Roman\nCatholic members, was not suspected of such sympathies himself.\n\nIn 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher John Dunton, on a visit to Dublin,\ngave a favourable verdict on the Irish judiciary, including Donnellan: \"men\nwhose reputation is such that no one complains of them\".\n\nHe married twice; little is known of his first wife, who died before 1688,\nleaving a surviving son, James. He remarried Martha Ussher, daughter of\nChristopher Ussher, who outlived him by many years, and married secondly Phillip\nPerceval, brother of the 1st Earl of Egmont. They had two sons, Nehemiah and\nChristopher and two daughters, Martha and Anne. Anne is remembered as the friend\nof most of the leading Irish writers of her time, and for founding the Donnellan\nLectures at Trinity College Dublin.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649–1705)","recorded":1375066024,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(disambiguation)","/wiki/James_Donnellan","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Irish_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Nehemiah_Donnellan","/wiki/Archbishop_of_Tuam","/wiki/Bishop_of_Ossory","/wiki/Trinity_College_Dublin","/wiki/Soldier","/wiki/Middle_Temple","/wiki/Christmas","/wiki/Irish_Bar","/wiki/Glorious_Revolution","/wiki/Serjeant-at-law_(Ireland)","/wiki/Galway_Borough_(Parliament_of_Ireland_constituency)","/wiki/Irish_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Recorder_of_Dublin","/wiki/Exchequer_of_Ireland","/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm","/wiki/John_Methuen_(diplomat)","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer_(Ireland)","/wiki/Tory","/wiki/Goidelic_languages","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/John_Dunton","/wiki/Earl_of_Egmont","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/irelandcommons.htm","http://www.ballyd.com/history/baron.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649–1705)&oldid=566143659","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1649_births","/wiki/Category:1705_deaths","/wiki/Category:Irish_MPs_1692%E2%80%931693","/wiki/Category:Irish_lawyers","/wiki/Category:17th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Dublin","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Galway","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Middle_Temple","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nehemiah+Donnellan+%281649%E2%80%931705%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nehemiah+Donnellan+%281649%E2%80%931705%29","/wiki/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&oldid=566143659","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6987808","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nehemiah_Donnellan_%281649%E2%80%931705%29&id=566143659","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nehemiah+Donnellan+%281649%E2%80%931705%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nehemiah+Donnellan+%281649%E2%80%931705%29&oldid=566143659&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6987808#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah_Donnellan_(1649%E2%80%931705)","//wikim
