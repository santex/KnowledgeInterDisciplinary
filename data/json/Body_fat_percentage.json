{"cursor":"24869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'body fat percentage' of a person or animal is the total weight of fat\ndivided by total weight; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body\nfat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive\nfunctions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that\nfor men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. The\npercentage of essential fat is 3â5% in men, and 10-16% in women.\nStorage body fat consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which\nprotects internal organs in the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended\ntotal body fat percentage exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported\nabove. A number of methods are available for determining body fat percentage,\nsuch as measurement with calipers or through the use of bioelectrical\nimpedance analysis.\n\nThe body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only body\nmeasurement which directly calculates a person's relative body composition\nwithout regard to height or weight. The widely used body mass index (BMI)\nprovides a measure that allows the comparison of the adiposity of individuals of\ndifferent heights and weights. While BMI largely increases as adiposity\nincreases, due to differences in body composition it is not necessarily an\naccurate indicator of body fat; for example, individuals with greater muscle\nmass will have higher BMIs. The thresholds between \"normal\" and \"overweight\" and\nbetween \"overweight\" and \"obese\" are sometimes disputed for this reason.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Body_fat_percentage","recorded":1362485118,"links":26,"instances":["action"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical signs","Health","Nutrition","Dietetics"],"headings":["Typical body fat amounts","Measurement techniques","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Body_Fat_Caliper.png/220px-Body_Fat_Caliper.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pinch","action"]],"members":["pinch"],"related":["Body_fat","Childbearing","Calipers","Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis","Body_mass_index","Epidemiology","Sportsperson","Infra-red","Biceps","Body_water","Plethysmography","In-vivo","Adipose","Skin_fold","Pinch_(action)","Caliper","Subcutaneous","Measurement","Body_mass_index","U.S._Army","U.S._Marine_Corps","Body_mass_index","Peer-review","Body_adiposity_index","Adipose_tissue","Body_fat_meter","Body_volume_index","Body_water","Lizzie_Velazquez"]}
