{"cursor":"1570","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Construx' are a brand of plastic building toys introduced by Fisher-Price in\n1983. Unlike other building toys such as Lego, Construx feature beam-like pieces\nof varying lengths that snapped on to cubical connector knots in order to build\nlarge shapes. These are relatively secure even though no nuts or bolts were\nused. Panels allowed assembly of flat surfaces. Hinges, motors, wheels, and\nother movable parts expand the number of different shapes that can be built, and\nmake moving creations possible. Construx was discontinued in 1988, briefly\nrevived by Mattel in 1997, and then discontinued again.\n\nFor a short time near the end of the Fisher Price run, a version targeted at\nyounger children was released called Basix Construx. It used bright primary\ncolors and did not contain the more complex pieces such as axles and pulleys.\nThis version as well as the other boxes released in the 1997 revival included\nseveral new pieces.\n","linknr":87,"url":"Construx","recorded":1362676321,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Construction toys","1980s toys","Fisher-Price"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Child_holding_construx_creations.jpg/250px-Child_holding_construx_creations.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fisher-Price","Lego","Mattel"]}
