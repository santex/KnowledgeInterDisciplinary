Very small currents can be imperceptible. Larger current\npassing through the body may make it impossible for a shock victim to let go of\nan energized object. Still larger currents can cause fibrillation of the heart\nand damage to tissues. Death caused by an electric shock is called\nelectrocution.\n","linknr":526,"url":"Electric_shock","recorded":1362485536,"links":56,"instances":["torture"],"pdf":["http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13BH/w2012/electrical_safety.pdf","http://www.ncis.org.au/web_pages/Feb%202012%20FACT-SHEET%20-%20Electrocution%20related%20deaths.pdf","http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf","http://www.electrical-installation.org/w/images/5/53/F-Protection-against-electric-shocks.pdf","http://electricshock.thruhere.net/files/electricalshockstandards.pdf"],"categories":["Physical punishments","Electrical safety","Medical emergencies","Torture","Injuries|Electrical injuries","Causes of death","Occupational safety and health","Effects of external causes"],"headings":["Magnitude","Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Epidemiology","Deliberate uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Lighteninginjury.JPG/230px-Lighteninginjury.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Verbrennung_Grad_2b.jpg/220px-Verbrennung_Grad_2b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Rear_view_of_a_lightning-strike_survivor%2C_displaying_Lichtenberg_figure_on_skin.png/220px-Rear_view_of_a_lightning-strike_survivor%2C_displaying_Lichtenberg_figure_on_skin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Mus%C3%A9e_M%C3%A9canique_160.JPG/220px-Mus%C3%A9e_M%C3%A9canique_160.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Singchair.jpg/220px-Singchair.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["parrilla","torture"]],"members":["parrilla"],"related":["Electricity","Electric_current","Electrocution","Alternating_current","Direct_current","Frequency","Ampere","Fibrillation","Volt","Ventricular_fibrillation","Voltage","Stratum_corneum","Macroshock","Dielectric_breakdown","Protection","Perspiration","Microshock","Micro-","Electrical_resistance","Burn","Ventricular_fibrillation","Catheter","Electrode","Defibrillation","Neuropathy","Neural","Oculomotor","Electric_chair","Animal_husbandry","Arc_flash","Radiation","Ohm's_law","NIOSH","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Percentile","Macroshock","Microshock","Electric_chair","Portmanteau","High_voltage","Frequency","Electrosurgery","Cardiac_arrest","Chronaxie","Alternating_current","Direct_current","War_of_Currents","Alternating_current","Static_electricity","Huntington_Canyon","Guinness_Book_of_World_Records","Griffith_Park","Electroconvulsive_therapy","Mental_illness","Defibrillator","Cardioversion","Pain_relief","Transcutaneous_Electrical_Nerve_Stimulator","Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center","Practical_joke","Shocking_gum","Joy_buzzer","Amusement_park","Erotic_electrostimulation","Electricity","Nerve","Genitals","BDSM","BDSM","Electroshock_weapon","Less-lethal_weapon","Weapon","Muscle","Taser","Electric_fence","Agricultural_fencing","Electric_shock_torture","Torture","Parrilla_(torture)","Picana","World_War_II","Amnesty_International","Chechnya","Serial_killer","Futoshi_Matsunaga","Mental_illness","Psychiatrist","Thomas_Szasz","Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center","Sing_Sing","Electric_chair","Capital_punishment","Lethal_injection","United_States","Electromagnetism","Milgram_experiment","Residual-current_device","Static_electricity","Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"]}
