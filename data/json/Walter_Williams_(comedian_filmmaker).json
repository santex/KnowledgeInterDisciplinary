{"cursor":"3239","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Walter Williams' is a filmmaker and comedy writer, most famous for his \"Mr.\nBill\" shorts that aired on the television series [[Saturday Night Live]].\n\nWilliams was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the 1970s he worked as a DJ at a\nFrench Quarter bar. He did comedy sketches, some over local radio, with his\nfriend Vance DeGeneres. Williams became interested in film. Creating the first\n\"Mr. Bill\" short on Super-8 film in 1974 in his living room in New Orleans for a\nbudget of less than $20, it was first aired on a local UHF TV show. He submitted\nit to [[Saturday Night Live]] where Mr. Bill was a hit. Williams made more Mr.\nBill shorts, moved to New York City, and was hired as a full-time writer for\nSaturday Night Live for the 1978-79 and 1979-80 seasons.\n\nThe VHS release of \"Ernest Rides Again\" features \"Mr. Bill Goes to Washington\",\na spoof of [[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]. According to the book Saturday\nNight: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, Williams made very little\nmoney from merchandising Mr. Bill in the 1970s, as most of the Mr. Bill products\nmade (including dolls, pins, posters, coffee mugs, and umbrellas) were bootleg\nand unauthorized (comic strip artist Bill Watterson had a similar problem with\nhis characters Calvin and Hobbes in the 1990s).\n\nWillams has performed as a stand up comedian and produced a number of\nadvertisements for such companies as Pizza Hut and Lexus, and aired comic shorts\non [[The Tonight Show]].\n\nWilliams made films for the ABC television series [[Into the Night with\nRick Dees]].\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Williams created more serious films, including\ndocumentaries for the Public Broadcasting Service on such subjects as the Battle\nof New Orleans and the erosion of Louisiana's wetlands.\n\nThe latter topic, along with related flood control and environmental issues, has\nbeen a focus of Williams' work; he produced a series of shorts featuring\nanimated wetland and sea creatures called \"The Estuarians\" together with Mr.\nBill to draw attention to the region's issues, with the tag line \"Let's act now,\nbefore it's too late\". With Hurricane Katrina in 2005, scenes such as Mr. Bill\ntaking refuge on the roof of his flooded out house in New Orleans seemed\nprophetic (see: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans).\n\nWalter Williams reigned as King of the Krewe du Vieux for the first New Orleans\nMardi Gras parade after Katrina.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","recorded":1375084449,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Walter_Williams_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Filmmaker","/wiki/Comedy","/wiki/Mr._Bill","/wiki/Television_series","/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live","/wiki/New_Orleans","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/DJ","/wiki/French_Quarter","/wiki/Comedy","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/Vance_DeGeneres","/wiki/Film","/wiki/Super-8_film","/wiki/UHF","/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Ernest_Rides_Again","/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington","/wiki/Copyright_infringement","/wiki/Bill_Watterson","/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes","/wiki/Stand_up_comedian","/wiki/Pizza_Hut","/wiki/Lexus","/wiki/The_Tonight_Show","/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company","/wiki/Into_the_Night_with_Rick_Dees","/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service","/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Wetlands","/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina","/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_New_Orleans","/wiki/Krewe_du_Vieux","/wiki/New_Orleans_Mardi_Gras","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.mrbill.com","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/30818042","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&oldid=560104784","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Writers_from_New_Orleans,_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:Saturday_Night_Live","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Walter+Williams+%28comedian+filmmaker%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Walter+Williams+%28comedian+filmmaker%29","/wiki/Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","/wiki/Talk:Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","#","/wiki/Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&oldid=560104784","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7966428","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Walter_Williams_%28comedian_filmmaker%29&id=560104784","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Walter+Williams+%28comedian+filmmaker%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Walter+Williams+%28comedian+filmmaker%29&oldid=560104784&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7966428#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Williams_(comedian_filmmaker)","//wik
