(1999) The Cambridge History of Hellenistic\nPhilosophy, pages 52-3. Cambridge. ), a Greek native of Eresos in Lesbos,\nwas the successor to Aristotle in the Peripatetic school. He came to Athens at a\nyoung age and initially studied in Plato's school. After Plato's death, he\nattached himself to Aristotle. Aristotle bequeathed to Theophrastus his writings\nand designated him as his successor at the Lyceum. Theophrastus presided over\nthe Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school\nflourished greatly. He is often considered the \"father of botany\" for his works\non plants. After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral.\nHis successor as head of the school was Strato of Lampsacus.\n\nThe interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, extending from biology and\nphysics to ethics and metaphysics. His two surviving botanical works, Enquiry\ninto Plants and On the Causes of Plants, were an\nimportant influence on medieval science. There are also surviving works On Moral\nCharacters, On Sensation, On Stones, and fragments on Physics and Metaphysics\nall written in Greek. In philosophy, he studied grammar and language and\ncontinued Aristotle's work on logic. He also regarded space as the mere\narrangement and position of bodies, time as an accident of motion, and motion as\na necessary consequence of all activity. In ethics, he regarded happiness as\ndepending on external influences as well as on virtue and famously said that\n\"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom.\"\n","linknr":869,"url":"Theophrastus","recorded":1362502029,"links":88,"instances":["bishop","assaying_tool","classical","philosophy","spirit","truth","philosopher","classical_element","geographer","physics","son_of_aristotle","bishop","scholar"],"pdf":[],"categories":["370s
