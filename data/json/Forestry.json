Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, including\nassisting forests to provide timber as raw material for wood products, wildlife\nhabitat, natural water quality management, recreation, landscape and community\nprotection, employment, aesthetically appealing landscapes, biodiversity\nmanagement, watershed management, erosion control, and preserving forest as\n'sinks' for atmospheric carbon dioxide. A practitioner of forestry is known as a\nforester. The word \"forestry\" can refer to a forest itself.\n\nForest ecosystems have come to be seen as the most important component of the\nbiosphere,
