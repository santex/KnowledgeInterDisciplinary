{"cursor":"3138","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biology, a 'colony' refers to individual organisms of the same species living\nclosely together, usually for mutual benefit, such as stronger defense or the\nability to attack bigger prey. Some insects (ants and honey bees, for example)\nlive only in colonies. The Portuguese man o' war is an example of a colony of\nfour different polyp forms.\n\n.]]\n\nA colony of single-cell organisms is known as a 'colonial organism' . Colonial\norganisms were probably the first step toward multicellular organisms via\nnatural selection. The difference between a multicellular organism\nand a colonial organism is that individual organisms from a colony can, if\nseparated, survive on their own, while cells from a multicellular lifeform\n(e.g., cells from a brain) cannot. [[Volvox]] (technically a coenobium) is an\nexample of the border between these two states.\n\nA 'bacterial colony' is defined as a visible cluster of bacteria growing on the\nsurface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single\ncell. {{Cite book\n  | last1 = Tortora | first1 = Gerard J. first2 = Funke | last2 = Berdell R.\n  | first3 =Case | last3 = Christine L. title = Microbiology, An Introduction\n  | location = Berlin publisher = Benjamin Cummings year= 2009 pages = 170â171\n  | isbn = 0-321-58420-1 }} Because all organisms within the colony\n  | descend from a single ancestor, they are genetically identical (except for\n  | mutations that occur at a low, unavoidable frequency, as well as the more\n  | likely possibility of contamination). Obtaining such genetically identical\n  | organisms (or pure strains) can be useful in many cases; this is done by\n  | spreading bacteria on a culture plate and starting a new stock of bacteria\n  | from a single colony.\n\nA '[[biofilm]]' is a colony of microorganisms often comprising several species,\nwith properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of\nthe individual organisms.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Colony_(biology)","recorded":1362505814,"links":41,"instances":["biology","biology","beekeeping","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Community ecology","Microbiology terms","Habitat (ecology) terminology","Environmental terminology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Quintote_colony_counter.jpg/200px-Quintote_colony_counter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Paramecium.jpg/35px-Paramecium.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["strain","biology"],["beehive","beekeeping"],["colonisation","biology"]],"members":["colonisation","strain","beehive","cell"],"related":["Biology","Organism","Species","Ant","Honey_bee","Portuguese_man_o'_war","Polyp","Organism","Natural_selection","Multicellular_organism","Cell_(biology)","Brain","Coenobium","Bacteria","Microbiology,_An_Introduction","Benjamin_Cummings","Mutation","Contamination","Strain_(biology)","Microorganism","Beehive_(beekeeping)","Bird_colony","Colonisation_(biology)","Clonal_colony","Eusociality","Superorganism","Swarm","Kombucha"]}
