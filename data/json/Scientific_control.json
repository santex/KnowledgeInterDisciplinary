{"cursor":"11282","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Control}}\n\n\n\nA 'scientific control' is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the\neffects of variables other than the single independent variable. This increases\nthe reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control\nmeasurements and the other measurements. Scientific controls are a part of the\nscientific method.\n\nFor example, during drug testing, scientists will try to control two groups to\nkeep them as identical as possible, then allow one group to try the drug.\nAnother example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the\nplants in a garden: the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group,\nbecause they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated\nplants will be compared against. Without a control group, the experiment cannot\ndetermine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have\nif untreated.\n\nIdeally, all variables in an experiment will be controlled (accounted for by the\ncontrol measurements) and none will be uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if\nall the controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the\nexperiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due\nto the effect of the variable being tested. That is, scientific controls allow\nan investigator to make a claim like \"Two situations were identical until factor\nX occurred. Since factor X is the only difference between the two situations,\nthe new outcome was caused by factor X.\"\n","linknr":228,"url":"Scientific_control","recorded":1362477621,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.montana.edu/wwwarc/Micro%20501/ILAR%20practical%20exp%20design.pdf","http://www.montana.edu/wwwarc/Micro%20501/ILAR%20practical%20exp%20design.pdf","http://schematyc.stat.ucla.edu/unit_04/scurvy.pdf"],"categories":["Scientific method","Experiments"],"headings":["Controlled experiments","Types of control","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Starr_011107-0010_Argyroxiphium_sandwicense_subsp._macrocephalum.jpg/180px-Starr_011107-0010_Argyroxiphium_sandwicense_subsp._macrocephalum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Experiment","Observation","Independent_variable","Scientific_method","Biological_specimen","SDS-PAGE","Confounding_variables","Artificial_sweetener","Rats","Null_result","Confounding_variable","Test_validity","Enzyme_assay","Standard_curve","Systematic_error","Crop_yield","Confirmation_bias","Wishful_thinking","Clinical_trials","Patient","Placebo","Surgery","Sham_surgery","False_positive","False_negative","Experiment","Controlling_for_a_variable","Scurvy","Clinical_trial","James_Lind"]}
