It usually involves the heart valves (native or prosthetic valves).\nOther structures that may be involved include the interventricular septum, the\nchordae tendineae, the mural endocardium, or even on intracardiac devices.\nEndocarditis is characterized by a prototypic lesion, the [[Vegetation\n(pathology)|vegetation]], which is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of\nmicroorganisms, and scant inï¬ammatory cells. In the\nsubacute form of infective endocarditis, the vegetation may also include a\ncenter of granulomatous tissue, which may fibrose or calcify.\n\nThere are multiple ways to classify endocarditis. The simplest classification is\nbased on etiology: either infective or non-infective, depending on whether a\nmicroorganism is the source of the inflammation or not. Regardless, the\ndiagnosis of endocarditis is based on clinical features, investigations such as\nan echocardiogram, and blood cultures demonstrating the presence of endocarditis-\ncausing microorganisms.\n","linknr":536,"url":"Endocarditis","recorded":1362511554,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Valvular heart disease","Inflammations","Rodent-carried diseases"],"headings":["Infective endocarditis","Non-infective endocarditis","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Blood_culture_negative_endocarditis.jpg/230px-Blood_culture_negative_endocarditis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Inflammation","Heart","Endocardium","Heart_valve","Interventricular_septum","Chordae_tendineae","Platelets","Fibrin","Subacute","Granuloma","Etiology","Microorganism","Echocardiogram","Blood_culture","White_blood_cell","Bacteria","Rheumatic_fever","Rheumatic_fever","Heart_valve","Rheumatic_fever","Marantic_endocarditis","Trousseau_syndrome","Libman-Sacks_endocarditis","Lupus_erythematosus"]}
