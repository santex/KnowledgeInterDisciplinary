An adverse\nevent (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an\nabnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the\nuse of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the\nmedicinal (investigational) product. ICH GCP\n\nAEs in patients participating in clinical trials must be reported to the study\nsponsor and if required could be reported to local ethics committee . Adverse\nevents categorized as \"serious\" ( results in death, illness requiring\nhospitalization, events deemed life-threatening, results in persistent or\nsignificant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or medical\nimportant condition ) must be reported to the regulatory authorities\nimmediately, whereas non-serious adverse events are merely documented in the\nannual summary sent to the regulatory authority.\n\nThe sponsor collects AE reports from the local researchers, and notifies all\nparticipating sites of the AEs at the other sites, as well as both the local\ninvestigators' and the sponsors' judgment of the seriousness of the AEs. This\nprocess allows the sponsor and all the local investigators access to a set of\ndata that might suggest potential problems with the study treatment while the\nstudy is still ongoing.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Adverse_event","recorded":1362501837,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Clinical research","Pharmaceutical industry"],"headings":["Types of adverse events","Reporting of adverse events","Database of adverse events","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Food_and_Drug_Administration","Serious_adverse_event","Clinical_trial","Good_clinical_practice","Data_Monitoring_Committees","Serious_adverse_event","Adverse_effect","Adverse_drug_reaction","Pharmacovigilance","EudraVigilance","European_Union","Directive_2001/20/EC","European_Union","National_Library_of_Medicine"]}
