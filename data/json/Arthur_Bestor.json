Bestor and\nJeannette Lemon. Arthur E. Bestor [sr.] was the president of the Chautauaqua\nInstitution, an educational and religious community in western New York State.\n\n(The younger Arthur Bestor dropped the use of his middle name \"Eugene\" and \"Jr.\"\nupon the death of his father in 1944.)\n\nBestor was raised and educated in Chautauqua and New York City, where he\nattended the Horace Mann School. He received his undergraduate and graduate\ndegrees from Yale University (Ph.D. in History, 1938), where he received the\nJohn Addison Porter Prize. Historical Register of Yale University, 1937-1951\n(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1952), p. 80.\n\nHis early research was on the history of 19th century American utopian and\ncommunitarian experimental settlements (especially New Harmony, Indiana, founded\nby followers of the Welsh communitarian philosopher Robert Owen). Bestor's study\nof New Harmony was published as Backwoods Utopias.\n\nIn the mid-1950s he became well known in educational circles as a critic of then\ncommon educational doctrines; Educational Wastelands (1953) was his manifesto\nabout declining educational standards.\n\nFrom the late 1950s, his scholarly research shifted to issues of the\nconstitutional basis of sovereignty, the war powers clauses of the US\nconstitution, and the power of impeachment.\n\nUntil his death in 1994, he published widely in historical and law journals on\nconstitutional history and was several times invited to testify before Congress\non constitutional matters. At the time of his death he was working on an\nintellectual history of European philosophical influences on the framers of the\nUS constitution, with particular focus on the writings of Montaigne.\n\nHe taught at Teachers College, Columbia University; the University of Wisconsin;\nStanford University; and the University of Illinois. In 1963 he joined the\nfaculty of the University of Washington, Seattle, where he taught until his\nretirement.\n\nBestor was the visiting Harmsworth Professor of American History at Queen's\nCollege, Oxford in 1956-57, and taught at the University of Tokyo, Rikkyo\nUniversity (Tokyo), and Doshisha University (Kyoto) as a visiting professor\nsponsored by the Fulbright Program in 1967.\n\nHe married his third wife, Dorothy Alden Koch, in 1951. He had two sons from a\nprevious marriage, William Porter Bestor and Thomas Wheaton Bestor, and one son,\nTheodore C. Bestor, from his third marriage.\n\nHis obituary in the New York Times notes that he was one of the first\nspecialists on American constitutional law to publicly call for the resignation\nof President Richard M. Nixon, in a piece published in The Nation.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Arthur_Bestor","recorded":1363453094,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Chautauqua,_New_York","/wiki/Arthur_E._Bestor","/w/index.php?title=Chautauaqua_Institution&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Horace_Mann_School","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/John_Addison_Porter","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Utopia","/wiki/Communitarian","/wiki/New_Harmony,_Indiana","/wiki/Robert_Owen","/wiki/University_of_Washington","/wiki/Seattle","/wiki/Fulbright_Program","/wiki/Theodore_C._Bestor","#cite_note-NYTobit-2","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-NYTobit_2-0","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/obituaries/arthur-bestor-a-leading-scholar-on-the-constitution-dies-at-86.html?scp=1&sq=arthur%20bestor&st=cse","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/obituaries/arthur-bestor-a-leading-scholar-on-the-constitution-dies-at-86.html?scp=1&sq=arthur%20bestor&st=cse","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/108469893","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Frederick_Jackson_Turner.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Frederick_Jackson_Turner.jpg/25px-Frederick_Jackson_Turner.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-historian-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-historian-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-historian-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&oldid=538207256","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1908_births","/wiki/Category:1994_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chautauqua_County,_New_York","/wiki/Category:Yale_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Historians_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:American_historians","/wiki/Category:American_historian_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arthur+Bestor&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arthur+Bestor","/wiki/Arthur_Bestor","/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Bestor","#","/wiki/Arthur_Bestor","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Arthur_Bestor","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Arthur_Bestor","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&oldid=538207256","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Arthur_Bestor&id=538207256","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Arthur+Bestor","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Arthur+Bestor&oldid=538207256&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Bestor&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia
