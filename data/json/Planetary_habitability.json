Life may develop directly on a planet or\nsatellite or be transferred to it from another body, a theoretical process known\nas panspermia. As the existence of life beyond Earth is currently uncertain,\nplanetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and\nthe characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favourable to\nlife's flourishingâin particular those factors that have sustained complex,\nmulticellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures. Research\nand theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging\ndiscipline of astrobiology.\n\nAn absolute requirement for life is an energy source, and the notion of\nplanetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and\nastrophysical criteria must be met before an astronomical body can support life.\nIn its astrobiology roadmap, NASA has defined the principal habitability\ncriteria as \"extended regions of liquid water, conditions favourable for the\nassembly of complex organic molecules, and energy sources to sustain\nmetabolism.\"\n\n\n\nIn determining the habitability potential of a body, studies focus on its bulk\ncomposition, orbital properties, atmosphere, and potential chemical\ninteractions. Stellar characteristics of importance include mass and\nluminosity, stable variability, and high metallicity. Rocky, terrestrial-type\nplanets and moons with the potential for Earth-like chemistry are a primary\nfocus of astrobiological research, although more speculative habitability\ntheories occasionally examine alternative biochemistries and other types of\nastronomical bodies.\n\nThe idea that planets beyond Earth might host life is an ancient one, though\nhistorically it was framed by philosophy as much as physical science. This article is an analysis of planetary habitability from the\nperspective of contemporary physical science. A historical viewpoint on the\npossibility of habitable planets can be found at Beliefs in extraterrestrial\nlife and Cosmic pluralism. For a discussion of the probability of alien life see\nthe Drake Equation and Fermi Paradox. Habitable planets are also a staple of\nfiction; see Planets in science fiction. The late 20th century saw two\nbreakthroughs in the field. The observation and robotic spacecraft exploration\nof other planets and moons within the Solar System has provided critical\ninformation on defining habitability criteria and allowed for substantial\ngeophysical comparisons between the Earth and other bodies.
