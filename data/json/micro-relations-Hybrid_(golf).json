{"cursor":"11687","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'hybrid' is a type of club used in the sport of golf with a design which\ndiffers from that of irons and woods. The name \"hybrid\" comes from genetics to\ndenote a mixture of two different species with desirable characteristics of\nboth, and the term here has been generalized, combining the familiar mechanics\nof an iron with the more forgiving nature and better distance of a wood.\n\nFor many players, long irons (numbers 1-4) are difficult to hit well even with\nmodern clubfaces, due to the low trajectory and very small face of the low-loft\nclubhead. Players tend to avoid these clubs in favor of fairway woods which have\na larger \"sweet spot\" to hit with, but such woods, having longer shafts, have a\ndifferent swing mechanic that is sometimes difficult to master. The long shaft\nof a fairway wood also requires lots of room to swing, making it unsuitable for\ntighter lies such as \"punching\" out from underneath trees. In addition, the\nfairway wood clubface is designed to skim over instead of cutting into turf,\nwhich makes it undesirable for shots from the rough. The answer to this dilemma\nfor many players is to replace the 1-4 irons with hybrids.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Hybrid_(golf)","recorded":1362543148,"links":18,"instances":["physics","golf","golf","biology","equipment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Golf clubs"],"headings":["Design","Behavior","Usage","Popularity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Callaway_Diablo_Edge_4_Hybrid_LH.jpeg/300px-Callaway_Diablo_Edge_4_Hybrid_LH.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["golf_club","equipment"],["iron","golf"],["wood","golf"],["hybrid","biology"],["impulse","physics"],["impulse","physics"]],"members":["impulse","wood","iron","hybrid","golf_club"],"related":["Golf_club_(equipment)","Golf","Iron_(golf)","Wood_(golf)","Hybrid_(biology)","Impulse_(physics)","Cavity-back_iron","Muscle-back_iron","Impulse_(physics)","TaylorMade-adidas","Professional_golfer","PGA_Tour","Champions_Tour"]}
