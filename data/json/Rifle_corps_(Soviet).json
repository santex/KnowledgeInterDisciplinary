{"cursor":"35270","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'rifle corps' () was a Soviet corps-level military formation during the mid-\ntwentieth century. Rifle corps were made up of a varying number of rifle\ndivisions, although the allocation of three rifle divisions to a rifle corps was\ncommon during the latter part of World War II.\n\nUnlike army corps formed by Germany and the Western Allies, Soviet rifle corps\nwere composed primarily of combat troops and had only a small logistical\ncomponent. Because the rifle divisions themselves were also primarily made up of\ncombat troops, the rifle corps were numerically smaller than corps of other\nnations. The Soviets also formed Guards rifle corps during World War II,\nalthough these were often assigned control of regular rifle divisions and\nsometimes controlled no Guards rifle divisions.\n\nThe Red Army as a whole had 27 rifle corps headquarters in its order of battle\non 1 June 1938; this had been expanded to 62 by June 1941. Glantz, Colossus,\np. 107 When Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, the Red\nArmy initially had some 32 rifle corps headquarters as part of their order of\nbattle in action against the Germans. Because Joseph Stalin's prewar purge of\nthe Red Army had removed so many experienced leaders, the rifle corps echelon of\ncommand in Soviet forces engaged against the Germans dwindled in the face of\nmassive Red Army losses of 1941. The stark shortage of experienced leaders\nforced the Red Army to have rifle army headquarters directly supervising rifle\ndivisions without the assistance of intervening rifle corps\nheadquarters. Stavka Circular 01 of July 15, 1941 directed several changes\nto Red Army force structure, the elimination of rifle corps headquarters and\nsubordination of rifle divisions directly to rifle army headquarters among them.\nGlantz and House, p. 65. The use of rifle corps headquarters never\ndisappeared entirely from the Red Army during World War II, as rifle armies in\nareas not fighting the Germans (such as the Far Eastern military region)\nmaintained their use of rifle corps headquarters during the entire war.\n\nAn example of wartime rifle corps organization is that of the 8th Estonian Rifle\nCorps in 1942: [http://www.historycommission.ee/temp/pdf/appendixes/903-\n907.pdf historycommission.ee]\n\n* 8th Rifle Corps ** 7th Rifle Division ** 249th Rifle Division ** 85th Corps\n  Artillery Regiment ** 36th Sapper Battalion ** 86th Medical Battalion ** 482nd\n  Reconnaissance Company ** 162nd Machine Gun Battalion\n\nOf the 8th Rifle Corps' 1942 strength of 26,466 men, only 2,599 (less than 10\nper cent) made up the corps headquarters and corps assets, the remainder being\nassigned to the two rifle divisions.\n\nBy November 1941, the Soviet order of battle showed only one rifle corps\nheadquarters still active among the forces fighting the German invasion. By\nearly 1942, however, the Soviets began to reactivate rifle corps headquarters\nfor use as an intermediate command echelon between the rifle armies and rifle\ndivisions. Doubtlessly, the direct command of divisions by army headquarters\nresulted in too-large spans of control for army commanders and the Red Army\ndesired to reintroduce the rifle corps headquarters once enough experienced\ncommanders and staff officers were available. By the end of 1942, 21 rifle corps\nheadquarters were in action with Soviet forces engaging the Germans. This grew\nto over 100 by the end of 1943, and reached a peak of 174 either in action\nagainst the Germans or as part of the strategic reserve of the Stavka by the end\nof the war with Germany in May 1945.\n\nA limited number of Rifle Corps remained as part of the Ground Forces post 1945.\nThey were slowly converted to 'Army Corps' though they still mostly consisted of\nRifle and then Motor Rifle Divisions.\n","linknr":666,"url":"Rifle_corps_(Soviet)","recorded":1375085500,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rifle_corps_(Soviet)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rifle_corps_(Soviet)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Corps_(military)","/wiki/Military_formation","/wiki/Infantry_division","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Army_corps","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Western_Allies","/wiki/Russian_Guards","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Red_Army","/wiki/Order_of_battle","/wiki/Joseph_Stalin","#cite_note-2","/wiki/8th_Estonian_Rifle_Corps","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Stavka","#List_of_Soviet_Rifle_Corps_22_June_1941","#List_of_Soviet_Rifle_Corps_formed_during_World_War_II","#Guards_Rifle_Corps","#Notes","#Sources","/w/index.php?title=Rifle_corps_(Soviet)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1st_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/10th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/2nd_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/8th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/4th_Shock_Army","/wiki/Ashgabat","#cite_note-4","/wiki/2nd_Rifle_Corps","/wiki/13th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/Western_Front_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/Battle_of_Bialystok-Minsk","/w/index.php?title=Fortified_Region&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=3rd_Rifle_Corps_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/4th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/20th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/Transcaucasus_Military_District","#cite_note-TC-7","/w/index.php?title=46th_Army&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Transcaucasus_Front","/wiki/Steppe_Front","/wiki/2nd_Ukrainian_Front","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=4th_Rifle_Corps_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/27th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/w/index.php?title=56th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/85th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/3rd_Army_(Soviet_Union)","#cite_note-9","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-%D0%B9_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81_(1-%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F)","/w/index.php?title=5th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/13th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/86th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/w/index.php?title=113th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/10th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/2nd_Far_East_Front","/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria","/w/index.php?title=6th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=41st_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=97th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=159th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/6th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=7th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Odessa_Military_District","/w/index.php?title=116th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=196th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=206th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-11","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-%D0%B9_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81","/wiki/8th_Estonian_Rifle_Corps","/wiki/26th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/99th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/w/index.php?title=173rd_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=72nd_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-G265-12","/w/index.php?title=9th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Odessa_Military_District","/w/index.php?title=10th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/8th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/Baltic_Military_District","/wiki/10th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/48th_Rifle_Division","/w/index.php?title=90th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-Glantz.2C_Stumbling_Colossus_pg._261-13","/w/index.php?title=Ural_Military_District&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-Feskov_et_al_2004.2C_46-14","/w/index.php?title=11th_Rifle_Corps&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/8th_Army_(Soviet_Union)","/wiki/11th_Rifle_Division
