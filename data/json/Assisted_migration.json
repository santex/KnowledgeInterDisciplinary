{"cursor":"19777","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Assisted colonization', also known as assisted migration or managed relocation,\nrefers to the act of deliberately helping plant and animal species colonize new\nhabitats when driven out of their historical habitats due to rapid environmental\nchange, especially climate change. All species have\nsome natural capacity to disperse into new habitats and adapt to change, but\nongoing climate change is occurring so rapidly that many species are unable to\nkeep pace naturally. In order to prevent\nextinctions, some scientists and practitioners are considering assisting the\ndispersal of species that have poor natural dispersal ability. This idea has\nsparked intense debate over the potential benefits of performing assisted\ncolonization, which include avoiding many species extinctions, and the risks,\nwhich include accidentally introducing new invasive species. Although the debate\nremains primarily conceptual with few real-world applications, scientists and land managers have already begun to consider\nseveral specific assisted colonization projects.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Assisted_migration","recorded":1372152300,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology"],"headings":["Background","Controversy","Examples","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["competition","biology"],["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism","competition"],"related":["Climate_change","Biological_dispersal","Adaptation","Climate_change","Species_distribution","Extinction","Environmental_niche_modelling","Introduced_species","Invasive_species","Biological_dispersal","Acclimatization","Adaptation","Temperate","Environmental_niche_modelling","Competition_(biology)","Predator","Mutualism_(biology)","Habitat_corridor","Habitat_fragmentation"]}
