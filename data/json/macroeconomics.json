In\ncontrast, microeconomics is primarily focused on the actions of individual\nagents, such as firms and consumers, and how their behavior determines prices\nand quantities in specific markets.\n\nWhile macroeconomics is a broad field of study, there are two areas of research\nthat are emblematic of the discipline: the attempt to understand the causes and\nconsequences of short-run fluctuations in national income (the business cycle),\nand the attempt to understand the determinants of long-run economic growth\n(increases in national income). Macroeconomic models and their forecasts are\nused by both governments and large corporations to assist in the development and\nevaluation of economic policy and business strategy.\n",
