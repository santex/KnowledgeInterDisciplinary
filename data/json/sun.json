Most of the matter gathered in the\ncenter, while the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that would become the\nSolar System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually\ninitiating thermonuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all other\nstars form by this process. The Sun's stellar classification, based on spectral\nclass, is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) and is informally designated as a\nyellow dwarf because its visible radiation is most intense in the yellow-green\nportion of the spectrum, and although its color is white, from the surface of\nthe Earth it may appear yellow because of atmospheric scattering of blue\nlight.<ref> {{Cite journal |last=Wilk |first=S.
