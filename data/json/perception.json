Perception is not the passive\nreceipt of these signals, but can be shaped by learning, memory, and\nexpectation.<ref name=\"mind_perception\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein2010\" />\nPerception involves these \"top-down\" effects as well as the \"bottom-up\" process\nof processing sensory input.<ref name=\"Bernstein2010\"></ref> The \"bottom-up\"\nprocessing is basically low-level information that's used to build up higher-\nlevel information (e.g., shapes for object recognition). The \"top-down\"\nprocessing refers to a person's concept and expectations (knowledge) that\ninfluence perception. Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous\nsystem, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens\noutside conscious awareness.<ref name=\"Goldstein5\" />\n\nSince the rise of experimental psychology in the late 19th Century, psychology's\nunderstanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of\ntechniques.<ref name=\"mind_perception\">Gregory, Richard. \"Perception\" in\nGregory, Zangwill (1987) pp. 598–601</ref> Psychophysics measures the effect on\nperception of varying the physical qualities of the input. Sensory neuroscience\nstudies the brain mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also\nbe studied computationally, in terms of the information they process. Perceptual\nissues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as\nsounds, smells or colors exist in objective reality rather than the mind of the\nperceiver.<ref name=\"mind_perception\" />\n\nAlthough the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of\nillusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual\nsystems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.<ref\nname=\"mind_perception\" /> There is still active debate about the extent to which\nperception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science, or\nwhether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process\nunnecessary.<ref name=\"mind_perception\" />\n\nThe perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around\nthem as stable, even though the sensory information may be incomplete and\nrapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a modular way, with\ndifferent areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these\nmodules take the form of sensory maps, mapping some aspect of the world across\npart of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and\ninfluence each other. For instance, the taste is strongly influenced by its\nodor.<ref name=\"DeVereCalvert2010_33\" />\n","title":"perception","headings":["Process and terminology <!-- linked from disambiguation: update or define {{Anchor|Process and terminology}} if changed -->","Perception and reality","Features","Effect of experience","Effect of motivation and expectation","Theories","Physiology","Types","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Rubin_vase","2: Ambiguous_image","2: Gestalt_psychology","2: Auditory_system","2: Flavor","1: Sensory_system","1: Information","1: Nervous_system","1: Photon","1: Retina","1: Molecules","1: Sound_wave","1: Perceptual_learning","1: Memory","1: Experimental_psychology","1: Perceptual_psychology","1: Psychophysics","1: Sensory_neuroscience","1: Computation","1: Philosophy_of_perception","1: Illusion","1: Hypothesis","1: Science","1: Perceptual_system","1: Brain","1: Cognitive_module","1: Sensory_Maps","1: Mental_representation","1: Stimulus_modality","1: Multistable_perception","1: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","1: Bergson","1: Deleuze","1: Guattari","1: Mind's_eye","1: Picture_thinking","1: Camouflage","1: Mimicry","1: European_Peacock","1: Weber-Fechner_law","1: Holism","1: Psychology","1: John_Locke","1: Wilhelm_Wundt","1: Motivation","1: Playing_cards","1: Andy_Clark","1: Learning","1: Ecology","1: James_J._Gibson","1: Poverty_of_stimulus","1: Paradigm","1: Direct_perception","1: Constructivist_epistemology","1: Ernst_von_Glasersfeld","1: Fear_processing_in_the_brain","1: Palgrave_Macmillan","1: General_Tau_Theory","1: Empirical_theories_of_perception","1: Feature_integration_theory","1: Interactive_activation_and_competition_networks","1: Recognition_by_Components_Theory","1: Sense","1: Sensory_receptor","1: Neural_pathway","1: Somatic_sensation","1: Taste","1: Olfaction","1: Transducers","1: Receptive_field","1: Rod_cell","1: Cone_cell","1: Visual_system","1: Somatosensory_system","1: Sound","1: Vibration","1: Audio_frequency","1: Hertz","1: Ultrasound","1: Infrasound","1: Ear","1: Primary_auditory_cortex","1: Temporal_lobe","1: Cerebral_cortex","1: Reverberation","1: Syntax","1: Semantics","1: Somatosensory","1: Proprioception","1: Extended_physiological_proprioception","1: Food","1: Tongue","1: Sweetness","1: Sourness","1: Saltiness","1: Umami","1: Western_cuisine","1: Odor","1: Olfactory_epithelium","1: Mechanoreceptor","1: Thermoreceptor","1: Social_cognition","1: Action-specific_perception","1: Alice_in_Wonderland_syndrome","1: Apophenia","1: Change_blindness","1: Introspection","1: Model-dependent_realism","1: Near_sets","1: Neural_correlates_of_consciousness","1: Pareidolia","1: Perceptual_paradox","1: Qualia","1: SamjÃ±Ä","1: Simulated_reality","1: Simulation","1: Visual_routine","1: Transsaccadic_memory"]}
