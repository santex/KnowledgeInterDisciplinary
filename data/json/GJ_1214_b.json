The parent star is 13 parsecs (approximately 40 light-years)\nfrom the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. The planet was discovered in\nDecember 2009. It is classified as a super-Earth because it is larger than Earth\nbut has a mass and radius significantly less than those of the gas giants in the\nSolar System. After COROT-7b, it was the second such planet to be known and is the first of a new class of planets with small\nsize and relatively low density. GJ 1214 b is also\nsignificant because its parent star is relatively near the Sun and because it\ntransits (crosses in front of) that parent star, which allows the planet's\natmosphere to be studied using spectroscopic technologies.\n","linknr":486,"url":"GJ_1214_b","recorded":1362371921,"links":43,"instances":["astrophysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Extrasolar planets","Transiting extrasolar planets","Exoplanets discovered in 2009","Super-Earths","Ophiuchus (constellation)"],"headings":["Detection","Features","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Exoplanet_Comparison_GJ_1214_b.png/300px-Exoplanet_Comparison_GJ_1214_b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/GJ_1214_b.jpg/220px-GJ_1214_b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/GJ1214b.jpg/275px-GJ1214b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Celestia.png/20px-Celestia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["frost_line","astrophysics"]],"members":["frost_line"],"related":["Earth","Neptune","GJ_1214","Ophiuchus","High_Accuracy_Radial_Velocity_Planet_Searcher","David_Charbonneau","MEarth_Project","Fred_Lawrence_Whipple_Observatory","Extrasolar_planet","GJ_1214","Parsecs","Light-years","Sun","Ophiuchus","Super-Earth","Earth","Gas_giants","Solar_System","COROT-7b","Sun","Astronomical_transit","Spectroscopy","MEarth_Project","European_Southern_Observatory","La_Silla","Nature","Doppler_effect","Neptune","Ocean_planet","Galilean_moons","Water","Hydrogen","Helium","Planetary_migration","Protoplanet","Volatiles","Frost_line_(astrophysics)","Nebular_hypothesis","Hydrostatic_pressure","Ice_VII","Hubble_Space_Telescope","Hydrodynamic_escape","Transit_method","Kepler-16b","Kepler_mission","Kelvin","Bond_albedo","COROT-7b","HD_149026_b","Gliese_581_c","Gliese_581_d","MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb","Gliese_876_d"]}
