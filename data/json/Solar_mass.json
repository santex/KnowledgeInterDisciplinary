Based upon the length of the year, the\ndistance from the Earth to the Sun (an astronomical unit or AU), and the\ngravitational constant (G), the mass of the Sun is given by:\n\n: M_\\odot=\\frac{4 \\pi^2 \\times (1\\ {\\rm AU})^3}{G\\times(1\\ {\\rm\n:year})^2} .\n\nThe value of the gravitational constant was derived from measurements that were\nmade by Henry Cavendish in 1798 from his using a torsion balance. The value he\nobtained differed only by about 1% from the modern value. {{cite book\n  | author=Holton, Gerald James; Brush, Stephen G. title=Physics, the human\n  | adventure: from Copernicus to Einstein and beyond year=2001 | page=137 |\n  | edition=3rd publisher=Rutgers University Press isbn=0-8135-2908-5 }}\n  | The diurnal parallax of the Sun was accurately measured during the transits\n  | of Venus in 1761 and 1769, {{cite book author=Pecker, Jean Claude;\n  | Kaufman, Susan title=Understanding the heavens: thirty centuries of\n  | astronomical ideas from ancient thinking to modern cosmology |\n  | pages=291–291 | publisher=Springer year=2001 | isbn=3-540-63198-4\n  | }} yielding a value of 9″ (compared to the present 1976 value of\n  | 8.794148″).

In his work\n[[PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], he estimated that the\nratio of the mass of the Earth to the Sun was about 1/28,700. Then later he\ndetermined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax,\nwhich he had used to estimate the distance to the Sun (1 AU). So, he revised his\nresult to obtain a ratio of 1/169,282 in the third edition of the Principia. The\ncurrent estimated value for the solar parallax is smaller still, giving us a\nmass ratio of 1/332,946. {{cite book\n  | first=David | last=Leverington | year=2003 title=Babylon to Voyager and\n  | beyond: a history of planetary astronomy page=126 | publisher=Cambridge\n  | University Press isbn=0-521-80840-5 }}\n\nAs a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the\ngravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the\ndetermination of the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or of a\nbinary star in units of solar masses does not depend on these poorly known\nconstants. So it was useful to express these masses in units of solar masses\n(see Gaussian gravitational constant).\n\nThe mass of the Sun changes slowly, compared to the lifetime of the Sun. Mass is\nlost due to two main processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the Sun's core\nhydrogen is converted into helium by nuclear fusion, in particular the pp chain.\nThereby mass is converted to energy in correspondence to the massâenergy\nequivalence. This energy is eventually radiated away by the Sun. The second\nprocess is the solar wind, which is the ejection of mainly protons and electrons\nto outer space. The actual net mass of the Sun since it reached the main\nsequence remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass loss rates than\nat present, so, realistically, it may have lost anywhere from 1â7% of its total\nmass over the course of its main sequence lifetime. The\nSun also gains mass when foreign bodies such as asteroids and comets crash into\nit. Because the Sun already holds 99.86% of the Solar System's total mass,\nforeign body impacts are not expected to offset its loss of mass by the two\naforementioned processes.\n","linknr":426,"url":"Solar_mass","recorded":1362877218,"links":63,"instances":["mass"],"pdf":["http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2013/Astronomical_Constants_2013.pdf"],"categories":["Units of mass","Units of measurement in astronomy|Mass"],"headings":["Related units","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Rho_Cassiopeiae_Sol_VY_Canis_Majoris.png/220px-Rho_Cassiopeiae_Sol_VY_Canis_Majoris.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/a/b2ac4536e0a3dd7e67a7d0078fa865d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/8/058b194a3da3ccba2ea35495615954a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/0/7403b4d7237f7a67f2f51b6d0405c636.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/7/3f77e4410a7c2f2f1520c868c9852faf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/24px-He1523a.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/15px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["orders_of_magnitude","mass"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude"],"related":["Rho_Cassiopeiae","Betelgeuse","VY_Canis_Majoris","Sun","Units_of_mass","Astronomy","Star","Star_cluster","Nebula","Galaxy","Sun","Names_of_large_numbers","Kilogram","Earth","Jupiter","Elliptical_orbit","Orbital_period","Astronomical_unit","Gravitational_constant","Henry_Cavendish","Torsion_balance","Isaac_Newton","Solar_System","Gaussian_gravitational_constant","Solar_core","Nuclear_fusion","Proton–proton_chain_reaction","Mass–energy_equivalence","Solar_luminosity","Solar_wind","Main_sequence","Asteroids","Comets","Lunar_mass","Earth_mass","Jupiter_mass","General_relativity","Chandrasekhar_limit","Gaussian_gravitational_constant","Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)","Sun","Sungrazing_comet"]}
