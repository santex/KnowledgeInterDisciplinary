Although much of Chinese\nphilosophy begins in the Warring States period, elements of Chinese philosophy\nhave existed for several thousand years; some can be found in the Yi Jing (the\nBook of Changes), an ancient compendium of divination, which dates back to at\nleast 672 BCE. page 60, Great Thinkers of the Eastern World, edited Ian\nMcGreal Harper Collins 1995, ISBN 0-06-270085-5 It was during the Warring\nStates era that the major philosophies of China, Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism,\nand Taoism, arose, along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like\nAgriculturalism, Chinese Naturalism, and the Logicians.\n\nFollowing the Qin Dynasty, Confucianism became the dominant philosophical school\nof China. Civilizations of the World: The Human Adventure : To the Late\n1600's, Richard Greaves p176 The largest philosophical rivals to\nConfucianism were Legalism and Mohism before the Han dynasty. Legalism as a\ncoherent philosophy disappeared largely due to its relationship with the\nunpopular authoritarian rule of Qin Shi Huang, however, many of its ideas and\ninstitutions would continue to influence Chinese philosophy until the end of\nImperial rule during the Xinhai Revolution. Mohism though popular at first due\nto its emphasis on brotherly love versus harsh Qin Legalism, fell out of favour\nduring the Han Dynasty due to the efforts of Confucians in establishing their\nviews as political orthodoxy. The Six Dynasties era saw the rise of the Xuanxue\nphilosophical school and the maturation of Chinese Buddhism, which had entered\nChina from India during the Late Han Dynasties. By the time of the Tang Dynasty\nfive-hundred years after Buddhisms arrival into China, it had transformed into a\nthoroughly Chinese religious philosophy dominated by the school of Zen Buddhism.\nNeo-Confucianism became highly popular during the Song Dynasty and Ming Dynasty\ndue in large part to the eventual combination of Confucian and Zen Philosophy.\n\nConfucianism represents the collected teachings of the Chinese sage Confucius,\nwho lived from 551 to 479 BCE. His philosophy concerns the fields of ethics and\npolitics, emphasizing personal and governmental morality, correctness of social\nrelationships, justice, traditionalism, and sincerity. The Analects stress the\nimportance of ritual, but also the importance of 'ren', which loosely translates\nas 'human-heartedness, Yuli Liu, 'Confucius', in Essentials of Philosophy\nand Ethics, Hodder Arnold 2006 ISBN 0-340-90028-8 Confucianism, along with\nLegalism, is responsible for creating the worldâs first meritocracy, which holds\nthat one's status should be determined by education and character rather than\nancestry, wealth, or friendship. Confucianism was\nand continues to be a major influence in Chinese culture, the state of China and\nthe surrounding areas of Southeast Asia.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese philosophy integrated concepts from\nWestern philosophy. Anti-Qing Dynasty revolutionaries, involved in the Xinhai\nRevolution, saw Western philosophy as an alternative to traditional\nphilosophical schools; students in the May Fourth Movement called for completely\nabolishing the old imperial institutions and practices of China. During this\nera, Chinese scholars attempted to incorporate Western philosophical ideologies\nsuch as democracy, Marxism, socialism, liberalism, republicanism, and\nnationalism into Chinese philosophy. The most notable examples are Sun Yat-Sen's\nThree Principles of the People ideology and Mao Zedong's Maoism, a variant of\nMarxismâLeninism. 'Maoism', in Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics, Hodder\nArnold 2006 ISBN 0-340-90028-8 In the modern People's Republic of China,\nthe official ideology is Deng Xiaoping's \"market economy socialism\".\n\nAlthough the People's Republic of China has been historically hostile to the\nphilosophy of ancient China, the influences of past are still deeply ingrained\nin the Chinese culture. In the post-Chinese economic reform era, modern Chinese\nphilosophy has reappeared in forms such as the [[New Confucianism]]. As in\nJapan, philosophy in China has become a melting pot of ideas. It accepts new\nconcepts, while attempting also to accord old beliefs their due. Chinese\nphilosophy still carries profound influence amongst the people of East Asia, and\neven Southeast Asia.\n","linknr":1069,"url":"Chinese_philosophy","recorded":1362372201,"links":60,"instances":["philosopher","chinese_philosophy","chinese","buddhism","confucian","chinese_philosophy","state","state"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chinese
