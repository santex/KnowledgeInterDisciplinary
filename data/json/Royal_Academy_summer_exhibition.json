The exhibition includes paintings,\nprints, drawings, sculpture, architectural designs and models, and is the\nlargest and most popular open exhibition in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhen the Royal Academy was founded in 1768 one of its key objectives was to\nestablish an annual exhibition, open to all artists of merit, which could be\nvisited by the public.\n\nThe first Summer Exhibition took place in 1769; it has been held every year\nsince without exception.\n\nToday, around 1,000 works are selected each year from as many as 10,000 entries\nrepresenting some 5,000 artists. Presently (as of 2008), any artist (living,\nknown or unknown) may submit up to two works at a fee of Â£25 per piece for\nselection by The Summer Exhibition Selection and Hanging Committee. Due to the\nsignificant increase in the volume of entries over recent years, the number of\nentries per artist was reduced to 2 (from 3) and the fee was increased Â£18 per\npiece. The committee is formed from the Council of Academicians (the governing\nbody of the RA) and is traditionally chaired by the President of the Royal\nAcademy. In addition to those works selected by the committee, all 80\nAcademicians are entitled to have six of their own pieces in the exhibition.\n\nAlmost all exhibited works are for sale; the Academy receives 30% of the\npurchase price. In 2003, this amounted to a sum of some Â£2,000,000 for the\ninstitution, which receives no financial support from the state or crown.\n\nThe 2005 exhibition theme was \"Printmaking and the multiple\". In 2006, the theme\nwas \"From Life.\" In 2008, the theme was \"Man Made\". The theme for 2010 was \"Raw\". [http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/summer-\nexhibition/ Summer Exhibition 2010], Royal Academy of Arts, 2010. In 2011,\nthe selection committee agreed to have no specific theme.\n\nFor the 2006 exhibition, the academy received a statue and a plinth from David\nHensel. By mistake, the two parts were judged independently, with the result\nthat the statue was rejected and the plinth put on display.\n\nOver Â£70,000 prize money, including the Â£25,000 Charles Wollaston Award, is\nawarded each year at the Summer Exhibition. Winners include Gerard Hemsworth\n(2000), Marc Quinn (2001), Jake and Dinos Chapman (2003), [http://static.royalacademy.org.uk/files/summer-exhibition-2007-\npress-release-107.pdf The Royal Academy of
