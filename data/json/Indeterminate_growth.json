Thus, a plant that\ngrows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other\nexternal factor is called indeterminate.\n\nFor example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather\ngangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast\nto a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most\nproductive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new\ngrowth/fruit, or dies.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Indeterminate_growth","recorded":1362372702,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology","Biology"],"headings":["Inflorescences","Animals","Mushrooms","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Spathoglottis_flwrs_reduced.jpg/250px-Spathoglottis_flwrs_reduced.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Orchid","Biology","Botany","Flower","Fruit","Tomato","Inflorescence","Raceme","Determinate_cultivar"]}
