{"cursor":"9864","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Isozymes' (also known as 'isoenzymes' or more generally as 'Multiple forms of\nenzymes') are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same\nchemical reaction. These enzymes usually display different kinetic parameters\n(e.g. different ''K'' M values), or different regulatory properties.\nThe existence of isozymes permits the fine-tuning of metabolism to meet the\nparticular needs of a given tissue or developmental stage (for example lactate\ndehydrogenase (LDH)). In biochemistry, isozymes (or isoenzymes) are isoforms\n(closely related variants) of enzymes. In many cases, they are coded for by\nhomologous genes that have diverged over time. Although, strictly speaking,\nallozymes represent enzymes from different alleles of the same gene, and\nisozymes represent enzymes from different genes that process or catalyse the\nsame reaction, the two words are usually used interchangeably.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Isoenzymes","recorded":1362508447,"links":33,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","biochemistry","biology","genetics","chemistry","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes"],"headings":["Introduction","An example of an isozyme","Distinguishing isozymes","Isozymes and allozymes as molecular markers","Other major examples","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["locus","genetics"],["fitness","biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["microsatellite","genetics"]],"members":["cofactor","fitness","substrate","homology","microsatellite","precipitation","locus"],"related":["Enzyme","Michaelis-Menten_kinetics","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Biochemistry","Isoform","Homology_(biology)","Allozyme","Allele","Gene","Catalyse","R._L._Hunter","Clement_Markert","Locus_(genetics)","Alleles","Gene_duplication","Polyploidy","Nucleic_acid_hybridization","Mutation","Pseudogene","Gene_expression","Natural_selection","Point_mutation","Mutation","DNA","Gene","Mutations","Fitness_(biology)","Natural_selection","Amino_acid","Active_site","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Genetic_drift","Chemical_reaction","Natural_selection","Glucokinase","Hexokinase","Glucose_6-phosphate","Insulin","Beta_cell","Pancreas","Glycogen","Liver","Permutations_and_Combinations","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Enzyme_kinetics","Biochemical_assay","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Amino_acid","Electric_charge","Aspartic_acid","Glutamic_acid","Gel_electrophoresis","Molecular_marker","Potato_starch","Acrylamide","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Dye","Tetrazolium_salts","Redox","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","NADP","Native_gel_electrophoresis","Population_genetics","Molecular_marker","DNA","DNA_sequencing","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Mating_system","Cytochrome_P450","Metabolism","Steroidogenesis","Phosphodiesterase"]}
