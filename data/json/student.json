In some nations, the English term (or its cognate in\nanother language) is reserved for those who attend university, while a\nschoolchild under the age of eighteen is called a 'pupil' in English (or an\nequivalent in other languages), although in the United States a person enrolled\nin grades K–12 is often called a student. In its widest use, student is used for\nanyone who is learning, including mid-career adults who are taking vocational\neducation or returning to university.\n",
