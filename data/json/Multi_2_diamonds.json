{"cursor":"5717","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Multi' or 'Multi 2 diamonds' is contract bridge convention whereby the opening\nbid of 2 shows multiple types of hands, which always includes a weak two bid in\neither major suit, while the additional meaning may be a strong balanced hand\n(commonly 20-21 high card points), or a 20-22 three suiter. The inherent\nambiguity as to both suit and strength makes it a powerful and popular\nconvention capable of seriously disrupting the opponents' bidding.\n\nAlthough it's technically a brown sticker convention (since no long suit is\ninitially known), its popularity and availability of defenses persuaded World\nBridge Federation to allow its usage on tournaments of lesser ratings. It is\ndescribed in WBF Convention Booklet.\n","linknr":626,"url":"Multi_2_diamonds","recorded":1362555758,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/McSheuBS/McNamaraSheumakerDefense2.pdf"],"categories":["Bridge conventions"],"headings":["Description","Defences","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Contract_bridge","Bridge_convention","Weak_two_bid","High_card_points","Brown_sticker","World_Bridge_Federation","Forcing_bid","Pass-or-correct_bid","Pass-or-correct_bid","High_card_point","Convention_card","High_card_point","High_card_point","High_card_point","High_card_point"]}
