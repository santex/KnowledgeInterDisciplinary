In both processes, the intermediate emission of a virtual\n {{SubatomicParticle (which then decays to electron and antineutrino) is\n not shown.]]\n\nIn nuclear physics, 'beta decay' is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta\nparticle (an electron or a positron) is emitted from an atomic nucleus. Beta\ndecay is a process which allows the atom to obtain the optimal ratio of protons\nand neutrons. There are two types of beta decay: beta\nminus and beta plus. In the case of beta decay that produces an electron\nemission, it is referred to as beta minus (), while in the case of a positron\nemission as beta plus (). In electron emission, an electron antineutrino is also\nemitted, while positron emission is accompanied by an electron neutrino. Beta\ndecay is mediated by the weak force.\n\nEmitted beta particles have a continuous kinetic energy spectrum, ranging from 0\nto the maximal available energy ({{mvar), which depends on the parent and\ndaughter nuclear states that participate in the decay. The continuous energy\nspectra of beta particle occurs because is shared between beta particle and a\nneutrino. A typical is around 1 MeV, but it can range from a few\nkeV to a few tens of MeV. Since the rest mass energy of the electron is\n511 keV, the most energetic beta particles are ultrarelativistic, with\nspeeds very close to the speed of light.\n\nSometimes electron capture decay is included as a type of beta decay (and is\nreferred to as \"inverse beta decay\"), because the basic process, mediated by the\nweak force is the same. However, no beta particle is emitted, but only an\nelectron neutrino. Instead of beta-plus emission, an inner atomic electron is\ncaptured by a proton in the nucleus. This type of decay is therefore analogous\nto positron emission (and also happens, as an alternative decay route, in all\npositron-emitters). However, the route of electron capture is the only type of\ndecay that is allowed in proton-rich nuclides that do not have sufficient energy\nto emit a positron (and neutrino). These may still reach a lower energy state,\nby the equivalent process of electron-capture and neutrino-emission.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Beta_decay","recorded":1362375489,"links":66,"instances":["physics","physics","nuclide","quantum_mechanics","nuclear_science"],"pdf":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0205v1.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear physics","Radioactivity"],"headings":["β<sup>−</sup> decay","β<sup>+</sup> decay","Electron capture (K-capture)","Nuclear transmutation","Double beta decay","Bound-state β<sup>−</sup> decay","Forbidden transitions","Beta emission spectrum","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Beta-minus_Decay.svg/240px-Beta-minus_Decay.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/NuclearReaction.png/200px-NuclearReaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Beta_Negative_Decay.svg/220px-Beta_Negative_Decay.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Beta_decay_spectrum.gif/220px-Beta_decay_spectrum.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Table_isotopes_en.svg/250px-Table_isotopes_en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/d/b8da3661c094da5869a880a5c5192faf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/5/0b546d406cd9d8ca23b198e3d5e02f45.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/7/577cbd678d1796dec924fe8176f71f9c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/3/b/b3bcee86c530a296338eee3b50b27399.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Ndslivechart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["q_value","nuclear_science"],["isobar","nuclide"],["parity","physics"],["perturbation_theory","quantum_mechanics"],["q_value","nuclear_science"],["spin","physics"]],"members":["spin","parity","isobar","perturbation_theory","q_value"],"related":["W_boson","Nuclear_physics","Radioactive_decay","Beta_particle","Electron","Positron","Positron_emission","Electron_antineutrino","Electron_neutrino","Weak_interaction","Kinetic_energy","Q_value_(nuclear_science)","MeV","KeV","Mass-energy_equivalence","Ultrarelativistic_limit","Speed_of_light","Electron_capture","Weak_force","Neutron","Proton","Electron","Electron_antineutrino","W_boson","Weak_interaction","Atomic_nucleus","Atomic_number","Mass_number","Atomic_number","Free_neutron","Fundamental_particle","Feynman_diagram","Down_quark","Up_quark","W_boson","Mass","Nuclear_binding_energy","Electron_capture","Electronic_configuration","Atomic_nucleus","Nuclear_transmutation","Nucleon","Electric_charge","Nuclide","Isobar_(nuclide)","Mass_excess","Beta-decay_stable_isobars","Alpha_decay","Half-life","Nucleosynthesis","Angular_momentum_operator","Forbidden_transition","Selection_rules","Nuclear_spin","Parity_(physics)","Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)","Fermi's_Golden_Rule","Q_value_(nuclear_science)","Fine-structure_constant","Gamma_function","Franz_N._D._Kurie","Henri_Becquerel","Marie_Curie","Pierre_Curie","Ernest_Rutherford","Paul_Villard","Gamma_ray","Specific_charge","J.J.&nbsp;Thomson","Frederick_Soddy","Nuclear_transmutation","Kazimierz_Fajans","Radioactive_displacement_law_of_Fajans_and_Soddy","Periodic_table","Neutrino","Lise_Meitner","Otto_Hahn","Law_of_conservation_of_energy","Spin_(physics)","Nitrogen-14","Charles_Drummond_Ellis","James_Chadwick","Wolfgang_Pauli","Enrico_Fermi","Fermi's_interaction","Frédéric_Joliot-Curie","Irène_Joliot-Curie","Carl_David_Anderson","Gian-Carlo_Wick","Hideki_Yukawa","Luis_Walter_Alvarez","Double_beta_decay","Electron_capture","Neutrino","Alpha_decay","Betavoltaics","Particle_radiation","Radionuclide","Tritium_illumination","Fluorescent_lighting","Franz_N._D._Kurie","Physical_Review","Franz_N._D._Kurie"]}
