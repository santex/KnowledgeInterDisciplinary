{"cursor":"5335","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fisher' is an electoral district of the House of Assembly in the Australian\nstate of South Australia. It is named after James Fisher, a colonial politician\nand the first mayor of Adelaide. It covers a 29.2 kmÂ² suburban and semi\nrural area on the southern fringes of Adelaide, taking in the suburbs of\nAberfoyle Park, Happy Valley, Coromandel Valley, Cherry Gardens, Clarendon,\nReynella East and parts of Chandlers Hill, Flagstaff Hill and O'Halloran Hill.\n\nBefore the 1983 electoral redistribution, Fisher took in the Blackwood area and\nwas a safe Liberal seat, held by Stan Evans. The redistribution turned it into a\nmarginal \"mortgage belt\" seat, and it was subsequently won by Philip Tyler for\nthe Australian Labor Party at the 1985 election. It fell to the Liberal Party of\nAustralia's Bob Such at the 1989 election with Such taking 12,361 votes to Tania\nFarell's 8306, making it a fairly safe Liberal seat. Such substantially\nincreased his margin four years later amidst Dean Brown's massive Liberal\nlandslide victory. Changes in demographics during the 1990s made the seat\nrelatively safe for the Liberal Party, but they lost control of the seat when\nSuch resigned to sit as an independent in October 2000, and successfully\nretained his seat as an independent at the 2002 election. He subsequently\nretained his seat with another strong swing in his favour at the 2006 election,\ndespite early reports that the seat may fall to either the Labor or Liberal\nparties. The outcome of the 2006 election saw Such face former President of\nAustralian Young Labor and a local candidate who had been born in the\nelectorate, Amanda Rishworth on the two party preferred vote as opposed to a\nLiberal candidate in 2002. Amanda Rishworth went on to win the Federal Seat of\nKingston which takes in suburbs to the south west of Fisher.\n\nAt the 2010 election, Bob Such faced a Liberal Candidate and former Liberal\nParty President Christopher Moriarty on a two party preferred basis.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Electoral_district_of_Fisher","recorded":1363138170,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Fisher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Fisher&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/South_Australian_House_of_Assembly_electoral_districts","/wiki/South_Australian_House_of_Assembly","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/South_Australia","/wiki/James_Hurtle_Fisher","/wiki/Adelaide","/wiki/Adelaide","/wiki/Aberfoyle_Park,_South_Australia","/wiki/Happy_Valley,_South_Australia","/wiki/Cherry_Gardens,_South_Australia","/wiki/Clarendon,_South_Australia","/wiki/Reynella_East,_South_Australia","/wiki/Chandlers_Hill,_South_Australia","/wiki/Flagstaff_Hill,_South_Australia","/wiki/O%27Halloran_Hill,_South_Australia","/wiki/Blackwood,_South_Australia","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Stan_Evans","/w/index.php?title=Philip_Tyler&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/South_Australian_state_election,_1985","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Bob_Such","/wiki/South_Australian_state_election,_1989","/wiki/Dean_Brown","/wiki/South_Australian_state_election,_2002","/wiki/South_Australian_state_election,_2006","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Fisher&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Stan_Evans","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Philip_Tyler&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Bob_Such","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Fisher&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Electoral_results_for_the_district_of_Fisher","/wiki/South_Australian_state_election,_2010","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Bob_Such","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Australian_Greens","/wiki/Penny_Wright","/wiki/Family_First_Party","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Bob_Such","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Swing_(Australian_politics)","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Fisher&action=edit&section=3","http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2006/fisher.htm","http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2010/fisher.htm","http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/fish.htm","http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/apps/news/map.php?image=2010/fisher_2010_col.jpg","http://www.seo.sa.gov.au/apps/news/?year=2006&districtSearch=3204","/wiki/Template:Electoral_districts_of_South_Australia","/wiki/Template_talk:Electoral_districts_of_South_Australia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Electoral_districts_of_South_Australia&action=edit","/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_South_Australia","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Adelaide","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Ashford","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Bragg","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Bright","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Chaffey","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Cheltenham","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Colton","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Croydon_(South_Australia)","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Davenport","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Elder","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Enfield","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Finniss","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Flinders","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Florey","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Frome","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Giles","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Goyder","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Hammond","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Hartley","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Heysen","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Kaurna","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Kavel","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Lee","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Light","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Little_Para","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_MacKillop","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Mawson","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Mitchell_(South_Australia)","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Morialta","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Morphett","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Mount_Gambier","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Napier","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Newland","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Norwood","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Playford","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Port_Adelaide","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Ramsay","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Reynell","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Schubert","/wiki/Electoral_distri
