{"cursor":"29670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n from about 1460 is the earliest known depiction of the English\n court. ]] The 'Court of King's Bench' (or 'Court of Queen's Bench'\n during the reign of a female monarch), formally known as 'The Court of the King\n Before the King Himself', was an English court of common law in the English\n legal system. Created in the late 12th to early 13th century from the [[curia\n regis]], initially following the monarch on his travels, the King's Bench\n finally joined the Court of Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas in Westminster\n Hall in 1318, making its last travels in 1421. As one of the two principal\n common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction\n and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery\n and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To recover, the King's\n Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive,\n faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to\n the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the\n long term it helped the King's Bench not only recover but increase its\n workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the\n new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly\n boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.\n\nWhile good for the King's Bench, the Common Pleas became suspicious of the\nnew developments, as legal fictions such as the Bill of Middlesex damaged its\nown business. Fighting against the King's Bench in a reactionary and\nincreasingly conservative way, an equilibrium was eventually reached in the\n17th century. Reaching an acceptable medium with the Common Pleas and\nExchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts; with\nseveral courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for\nseparate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. The\nKing's Bench thus ceased to exist, except as the King's Bench (now Queen's\nBench) Division of the High Court.\n\nDuring its existence the King's Bench's jurisdiction initially covered a wide\nrange of criminal matters, something significantly reduced later on, along with\nany business not claimed by the other courts, and any cases which concerned the\nmonarch. It also acted as a court of appeal for the Exchequer of Pleas and\nCommon Pleas, although it was not a court of last resort and required Parliament\nto sign off on its decisions. The creation of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in\n1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and\nwith the expansion of the Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's\nBench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and\nother legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's\njurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real\nproperty claims could be brought. The King's Bench was staffed by one Chief\nJustice, now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and a variable number\nof puisne justices; normally three, there were five serving when the King's\nBench was dissolved. Those who chose not to retire became Justices of the High\nCourt on the King's Bench's dissolution.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)","recorded":1374967000,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Court_of_King%27s_Bench","/wiki/File:Court_of_King%27s_Bench.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/Court_of_King%27s_Bench.JPG/250px-Court_of_King%27s_Bench.JPG","/wiki/File:Court_of_King%27s_Bench.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript","#cite_note-1","/wiki/England_and_Wales","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/English_legal_system","/wiki/Curia_regis","/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas_(England)","/wiki/Exchequer_of_Pleas","/wiki/Westminster_Hall","/wiki/Court_of_Chancery","/wiki/Equity_(law)","/wiki/Writ","/wiki/Bill_of_Middlesex","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Judicature_Act_1873","/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice","/wiki/Court_of_Exchequer_Chamber","/wiki/Puisne_Justice","#History","#Origins","#Reform","#Struggle_with_the_Common_Pleas","#Dissolution","#Jurisdiction","#Officials","#References","#Bibliography","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Westminster_Hall_edited.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Westminster_Hall_edited.jpg/170px-Westminster_Hall_edited.jpg","/wiki/File:Westminster_Hall_edited.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Westminster_Hall","/wiki/Curia_regis","/wiki/Exchequer","/wiki/Chancery_(medieval_office)#In_England","/wiki/Court_of_Chancery","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Witenagemot","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Eyre_(legal_term)","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Richard_I_of_England","/wiki/Court_of_Common_Pleas_(England)","/wiki/Exchequer_of_Pleas","/wiki/Magna_Carta","#cite_note-ham202-6","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Westminster_Hall","#cite_note-wei754-7","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Magna_Carta","#cite_note-ham202-6","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Plea_rolls","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Leicestershire","/wiki/Staffordshire","/wiki/Shropshire","/wiki/Northamptonshire","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Westminster_Hall","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:The_Court_of_Chancery_during_the_reign_of_George_I_by_Benjamin_Ferrers.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/The_Court_of_Chancery_during_the_reign_of_George_I_by_Benjamin_Ferrers.jpg/200px-The_Court_of_Chancery_during_the_reign_of_George_I_by_Benjamin_Ferrers.jpg","/wiki/File:The_Court_of_Chancery_during_the_reign_of_George_I_by_Benjamin_Ferrers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Court_of_Chancery","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_courts","/wiki/Equity_(law)","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/Complaint","/wiki/Subpoena","/wiki/Guy_Fairfax","#cite_note-bak40-13","/wiki/Writ","/wiki/Detinue","/wiki/Legal_fiction","#cite_note-b41-14","/wiki/Bill_of_Middlesex","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Action_on_the_case","/wiki/Trover","/wiki/Conversion_(law)","/wiki/John_Fineux","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/File:SirJohnPopham.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/SirJohnPopham.jpg/220px-SirJohnPopham.jpg","/wiki/File:SirJohnPopham.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/John_Popham_(Lord_Chief_Justice)","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_King%27s_Bench","/wiki/Assumpsit","#cite_note-b41-14","/wiki/Prothonotary","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Slade%27s_Case","#cite_note-simp70-19","/wiki/Assumpsit","/wiki/Legal_fiction","#cite_note-simp70-19","/wiki/Appellate_court","#cite_note-20","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_King%27s_Bench","/wiki/John_Popham_(Lord_Chief_Justice)","#cite_note-21","/wiki/Edmund_Anderson_(judge)","/wiki/Francis_Gawdy","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas","#cite_note-22","/wiki/Interregnum_(England)","#cite_note-b46-23","/wiki/Latitat","#cite_note-b46-23","/wiki/Francis
