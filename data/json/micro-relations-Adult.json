{"cursor":"9632","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nAn 'adult' is a human being or living organism that is of relatively mature age,\ntypically associated with sexual maturity and the attainment of reproductive\nage. In human context, the term has other subordinate meanings associated with\nsocial and legal concepts; for example, a 'legal adult' is a legal concept for a\nperson who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as\nindependent, self-sufficient, and (contrast with \"minor\"). Adulthood can be\ndefined in terms of physiology, psychological adult development, law, personal\ncharacter, or social status.\n\nThese different aspects of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory. A\nperson may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be\ntreated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely one\nmay legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that\nmay define adult character.\n\nAn event relating to the oncoming of adulthood is coming of age, which\nencompasses passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared\nfor adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with\ndemonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based\non reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of\nphysical maturity or preparation for adulthood.\n\nSome propose that moving into adulthood involves an emotional structuring\nof denial, suggesting this process becomes necessary to cope with one's\nown behavior, especially in uncomfortable situations, and also the\nbehavior of others.\n","linknr":445,"url":"Adult","recorded":1362373543,"links":85,"instances":["television","law","psychological"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adulthood","Biological concepts"],"headings":["Biological adulthood","Legal adulthood","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/RudolfMilly.jpg/270px-RudolfMilly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["maturity","psychological"],["minor","law"],["watershed","television"]],"members":["watershed","minor","maturity"],"related":["Human_being","Biology","Organism","Maturity_(psychological)","Sexual_maturity","Reproduction","Person","Age_of_majority","Self-sufficient","Minor_(law)","Physiology","Adult_development","Law","Coming_of_age","Secondary_sex_characteristics","Childhood","Adolescence","Contract","Parenting","Marriage","Voting","Employment","Military","Firearm","Driving","Alcoholic_beverages","Tobacco_smoking","Sex","Gambling","Lottery","Casino","Prostitute","Pornography","Legal_guardian","Disseminating_pornography_to_a_minor","Pornographic_actor","Child_pornography","Africa","Jewish","Bar_Mitzvah","Torah","Christian","Bible","Jewish_scripture","Marriage","Human_sexual_activity","Neil_Postman","Christian_Church","Middle_Ages","Execution","United_Kingdom","Northern_Ireland","Wales","India","China","Legal","The_United_Kingdom","Scotland","British_Columbia","New_Brunswick","Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Northwest_Territories","Nova_Scotia","Nunavut","Yukon_Territory","Canada","Nebraska","Alabama","The_United_States","South_Korea","Indonesia","Japan","Adolescence","Adult_development","Adultism","Age_of_consent","Age_of_majority","Child","Coming_of_age","Legal_drinking_age","Manhood","Marriageable_age","Motion_picture_rating_system","Voting_age","Watershed_(television)","Womanhood"]}
