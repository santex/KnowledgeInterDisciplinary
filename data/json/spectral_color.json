All other colors are not spectral: the bottom straight line is\nthe [[line of purples]], while within the interior of the diagram are\nunsaturated colors that are various mixtures of a spectral color or a purple\ncolor with white, a grayscale color. White is in the central part of the\ninterior of the diagram, since when all colors of light are mixed together, they\nproduce white.]]\n\nA 'spectral color' is a color that is evoked by a single wavelength of light in\nthe visible spectrum, or by a relatively narrow band of wavelengths. Every\nwavelength of light is perceived as a spectral color, in a continuous spectrum;\nthe colors of sufficiently close wavelengths are indistinguishable.\n\nThe spectrum is often divided up into named colors, though any division is\nsomewhat arbitrary: the spectrum is continuous. Traditional colors include: red,\norange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.\n\nThe division used by Isaac Newton, in his color wheel, was Red, Orange, Yellow,\nGreen, Blue, Indigo and Violet; a mnemonic for this order is Roy G. Biv. In\nmodern divisions of the spectrum, indigo is often omitted; see indigo\n#Classification as a spectral color for details.\n\nOne needs a color vision at least trichromatic to distinguish spectral colors\nfrom non-spectral ones: trichromacy gives a possibility to perceive both hue and\nsaturation in the chroma. In color models capable to represent spectral\ncolors,<ref> HSL and HSV do not qualify because many spectral colors lie rather\nfar from its gamut.</ref> such as CIELUV, a spectral color has the maximal\nsaturation among all colors of the same hue.\n",
