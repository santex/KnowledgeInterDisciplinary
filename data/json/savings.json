      "text" : "\n\n is a frequently used savings strategy.]] 'Saving' is income not spent, or\n deferred consumption. Methods of saving include putting money aside in a bank\n or pension plan.<ref>\"Random House Unabridged Dictionary.\" Random House,\n 2006</ref> Saving also includes reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs.\n In terms of personal finance, saving specifies low-risk preservation of money,\n as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is higher.\n\nThere is some disagreement about what counts as saving. For example, the part of\na person's income that is spent on mortgage loan repayments is not spent on\npresent consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though\npeople do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. However, in the U.S.\nmeasurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National\nIncome and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as\n\"saving\" unless the institutions and people who receive them save them.\n\n\"Saving\" differs from \"savings.\" The former refers to an increase in one's\nassets, an increase in net worth, whereas the latter refers to one part of one's\nassets, usually deposits in savings accounts, or to all of one's assets. Saving\nrefers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings\nrefers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable.\n\nSaving is closely related to investment. By not using income to buy consumer\ngoods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being\nused to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. Saving can\ntherefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which\ncontributes to economic growth.\n\nHowever, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. If\nsavings are stashed in or under a mattress, or otherwise not deposited into a\nfinancial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to\nbe recycled as investment by business. This means that saving may increase\nwithout increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-\nup of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a\nrecession) rather than to economic growth. In the short term, if saving falls\nbelow investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic\nboom. In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces\ninvestment and detracts from future growth. Future growth is made possible by\nforegoing present consumption to increase investment. However savings kept in a\nmattress amount to an (interest-free) loan to the government or central bank,\nwho can recycle this loan.\n\nIn a primitive agricultural economy savings might take the form of holding back\nthe best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. If the\nwhole crop were consumed the economy would deteriorate to hunting and gathering\nthe next season.\n",
