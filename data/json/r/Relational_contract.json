{"cursor":"6773","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'relational contract' is a contract whose effect is based upon a relationship\nof trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an\noutline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the\nbehaviour of the parties.\n\nRelational contract theory was originally developed in the United States by the\nlegal scholars Ian Roderick Macneil and Stewart Macaulay. According to Macneil\nit offered a response to the so-called âDeath of Contractâ schoolâs nihilistic\nargument that contract was not a fit subject for study as a whole; each\ndifferent type of contract (e.g., sales, employment, negotiable instruments)\ncould be studied individually, but not âcontracts-in-grossâ. I.R. Macneil,\nâWhither Contracts?â (1969) 21 Journal of Legal Education 403.\n\nMacneil explains that this is only one of a number of possible relational\ntheories of contracts, and accordingly renamed his own version âessential\ncontract theoryâ. I.R. Macneil, âContracting Worlds and Essential Contract\nTheoryâ (2000) 9 Social & Legal Studies 431.\n\nRelational contract theory is characterized by a view of contracts as relations\nrather than as discrete transactions (which, Macneil argued, I.R. Macneil,\nâThe Many Futures of Contractâ (1974) 47 Southern California Law Review\n691 traditional âclassicalâ or \"neo-classical contract\" theory treats\ncontracts as being). Thus, even a simple transaction can properly be understood\nas involving a wider social and economic context. For instance, if A purchases a\npacket of cigarettes from a shop he has never been into before and will never\nenter again, that seems quite discrete. However, A will almost certainly have a\nloyalty to a particular brand of cigarettes and expectations about quality about\nwhich he would be prepared to complain to the manufacturer, although he has no\ncontractual privity with the manufacturer. There is also an understanding that A\nwill pay for the cigarettes, not simply run off with them, and that if he\ntenders a Â£10 note in exchange for the cigarettes which are priced at Â£6, the\npaper money will be acceptable and change of Â£4 will be given. None of this is\nexplicitly stated between the parties, whose conversation is likely limited to\nâ20 Marlboro, pleaseâ on Aâs part and âThatâll be Â£6, pleaseâ on the part of the\nretailer. Thus, even the simplest transaction has a good deal that is unstated\nand dependent on a wider web of social and economic relations. How far outwards\ninto that web one needs to investigate will depend on the transaction and on the\npurpose for which it is being examined. I.R. Macneil, âReflections on\nRelational Contract Theory After a Neoclassical Seminarâ in H. Collins, D.\nCampbell and J. Wightman (Eds), The Implicit Dimensions of Contract (Hart:\nOxford, 2003).\n\nAlthough earlier writing I.R. Macneil, âThe Many Futures of Contractâ (1974)\n47 Southern California Law Review 691; I.R. Macneil, âContracts: Adjustment of\nLong-Term Economic Relations Under Classical, Neoclassical and Relational\nContract Lawâ (1978) 72 Northwestern University Law Review 340. may be\ntaken in places to suggest that the substantive rules of contract law need to be\nreframed to acknowledge the relational, non-discrete nature of contracts, this\nhas not been subsequently pursued and current scholars have argued that it is\nneither possible nor necessary to reform the law of contract itself to work\neffectively with relationally-constituted contracts. See, M. Eisenberg, âWhy\nThere is No Law of Relational Contractsâ (2000) 94 Northwestern University Law\nReview 805; R. Austen-Baker, âA Relational Law of Contract?â (2004) 20 Journal\nof Contract Law 125.\n\nOther characteristics of relational contract theory are that âcontractâ is\nunderstood to cover economic exchange in general, not just contracts that would\nbe recognized as legally enforceable agreements by courts in any given\njurisdiction, that relations are mostly held together by their own internal\nvalues and wider social/economic factors, and, at least in relational theory in\nthe Macneil mould, that exchange relations are governed by a number of norms.\nThis last is not to say that relational contract theory is normative in nature,\nsetting out what ought to be the case properly, but rather that there are actual\nobservable normal characteristics or factors at play in relations. Macneilâs\nessential contract theory offers some 14 norms. See Wikipedia article Ian\nRoderick Macneil.\n\nThe English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has more recently proposed an\nalternative version of relational contract theory, called âcomprehensive\ncontract theoryâ, which posits four âcomprehensive contract normsâ in place of\nMacneilâs 14, though Austen-Baker does not deny the validity of Macneilâs norms\nas a complex tool of analysis. R. Austen-Baker, âComprehensive Contract\nTheory: A Four-Norm Model of Contract Relationsâ (2009) 25 Journal of Contract\nLaw 216. The Japanese scholar Takashi Uchida has proposed a version of\nrelational contract theory inspired by Macneil, relating it to the Japanese\nsituation. See, e.g., T. Uchida, âThe New Development of Contract Law and\nGeneral Clauses â A Japanese Perspectiveâ in The Organizing Committee (Eds),\nProceedings of the Symposium: Japanese and Dutch Laws Compared (University of\nTokyo Centre for Comparative Law and Politics Institute of Comparative Law:\nTokyo, 1993). Other notable contributions to relational contract theory\nhave been made by Stewart Macaulay (U.S.), Lisa Bernstein (U.S.), David Campbell\n(England) and John Wightman (England).\n","linknr":103,"url":"Relational_contract","recorded":1374858518,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Contract","/wiki/Trust_(social_sciences)","/wiki/Ian_Roderick_Macneil","/w/index.php?title=Death_of_Contract&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Neo-classical_contract","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/wiki/David_Campbell_(legal_academic)","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc712f1a-3134-11df-8e6f-00144feabdc0.html","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/Ian_Roderick_Macneil","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&oldid=555443449","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Business_law","/wiki/Category:Contract_law","/wiki/Category:Economics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relational+contract&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relational+contract","/wiki/Relational_contract","/wiki/Talk:Relational_contract","#","/wiki/Relational_contract","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Relational_contract","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Relational_contract","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&oldid=555443449","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7310713","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Relational_contract&id=555443449","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Relational+contract","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Relational+contract&oldid=555443449&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Relational_contract&printable=yes","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%96%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%97%D7%A1","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrato_relacional","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7310713#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_contract","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["social_sciences","legal_academic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business
