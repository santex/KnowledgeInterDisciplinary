{"cursor":"24314","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Refractory metals' are a class of metals that are extraordinarily resistant to\nheat and wear. The expression is mostly used in the context of materials\nscience, metallurgy and engineering. The definition of which elements belong to\nthis group differs. The most common definition includes five elements: two of\nthe fifth period (niobium and molybdenum) and three of the sixth period\n(tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium). They all share some properties, including a\nmelting point above 2000 Â°C and high hardness at room temperature. They are\nchemically inert and have a relatively high density. Their high melting points\nmake powder metallurgy the method of choice for fabricating components from\nthese metals. Some of their applications include tools to work metals at high\ntemperatures, wire filaments, casting molds, and chemical reaction vessels in\ncorrosive environments. Partly due to the high melting point, refractory metals\nare stable against creep deformation to very high temperatures.\n","linknr":554,"url":"Refractory_metals","recorded":1362512814,"links":30,"instances":["chemistry","metal","metal","deformation","sm","element","periodic_table","metalworking","lubricant","physics","equipment","mechanics"],"pdf":["http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/molybdenum/mcs-2009-molyb.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/molybdenum/mcs-2009-molyb.pdf","http://aux.ciar.org/ttk/mbt/papers/symp_19/TB191191.pdf","http://aux.ciar.org/ttk/mbt/papers/symp_19/TB191191.pdf","http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf","http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_3/images/pdfs/016.pdf"],"categories":["Metals","Refractory materials|Metals, Refractory","Chemical element groups","Refractory metals|"],"headings":["Definition","Properties","Applications","Creep behavior","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Filament.jpg/220px-Filament.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Apollo_CSM_lunar_orbit.jpg/220px-Apollo_CSM_lunar_orbit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fabrication","metal"],["creep","deformation"],["group","periodic_table"],["casting","metalworking"],["foil","metal"],["amalgam","chemistry"],["mercury","element"],["grease","lubricant"],["golf_club","equipment"],["elasticity","physics"],["apollo_command/service_module#service_module","sm"],["creep","deformation"],["deformation","mechanics"]],"members":["amalgam","foil","fabrication","creep","mercury","group","casting","grease","elasticity","golf_club","deformation"],"related":["Metal","Heat","Wear","Materials_science","Metallurgy","Engineering","Period_5_element","Niobium","Molybdenum","Period_6_element","Tantalum","Tungsten","Rhenium","Hardness","Powder_metallurgy","Fabrication_(metal)","Creep_(deformation)","Titanium","Vanadium","Chromium","Zirconium","Hafnium","Ruthenium","Osmium","Iridium","Transuranium_element","Uranium","Earth","Technetium","Niobium","Molybdenum","Tantalum","Tungsten","Rhenium","Melting_point","Boiling_point","Density","Young's_modulus","Vickers_hardness","Carbon","Body-centered_cubic","Close-packing_of_spheres","Group_(periodic_table)","Jet_engines","Forging","Periodic_table","Lighting","Lubricant","Nuclear_reaction","Control_rod","Catalyst","Chemical","Melting_point","Casting_(metalworking)","Wire","Ingot","Rebar","Sheet_metal","Foil_(metal)","Titanium","Zirconium","Amalgam_(chemistry)","Mercury_(element)","Alloy","Steel","Hollow_structural_section","Piping","Stainless_steel","Coefficient_of_friction","Friction","Grease_(lubricant)","Oil","Constant-velocity_joint","Ore","United_States","Canada","Sweden","Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele","Nickel","Iron","Copper","Sintering","Incandescent_lighting","Gas_tungsten_arc_welding","Electrode","Projectile","Kinetic_energy_penetrator","Rocket_engine_nozzle","UGM-27_Polaris","Golf_club_(equipment)","Tungsten_carbide","Drill_bit","Helicopter","China","Korea","Bolivia","Australia","Lubrication","Antioxidant","X-ray","Photographic_chemicals","Petroleum","Textile","Niobe","Greek_mythology","Greece","Tantalus","Elasticity_(physics)","Electrolytic_capacitor","Superconductivity","Aircraft","Gas_turbine","Vacuum_tube","Nuclear_reactor","Liquid_rocket","Apollo_Lunar_Module","Corrosion","Medicine","Surgery","Acid","Capacitance","Aerogel","Miniaturization","Electronic_component","Electrical_network","Mobile_phone","Computer","Platinum","Copper","Ductility","Tensile_strength","Gyroscope","Nuclear_reactor","Alkylation","Dealkylation","Hydrogenation","Oxidation","Metalworking","Vacuum_furnace","Redox","Alkali_metal","Ultra-high_vacuum","Creep_(deformation)","Deformation_(mechanics)","Refractory"]}
