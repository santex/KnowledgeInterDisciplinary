{"cursor":"32223","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" Geothermal Power Plant in Iceland is an example of renewable energy.]]\n\n\nA 'renewable resource' is a natural resource which can replenish with the\npassage of time, either through biological reproduction or other naturally\nrecurring processes. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural\nenvironment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A positive life cycle\nassessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability. In 1962, Paul\nAlfred Weiss defined Renewable Resources as: \"The total range of living\norganisms providing man with food, fibers, drugs, etc...\".\n\nRenewable resources may be the source of power for renewable energy. However, if\nthe rate at which the renewable resource is consumed exceeds its renewal rate,\nrenewal and sustainability will not be ensured.\n\nThe term renewable resource also describes systems like sustainable agriculture\nand water\nresources.

John Armstrong, Esq. & Dr. Jan Hamrin,\nChapter 1, The Renewable Energy Policy Manual, Organization of American States,\nundated. Retrieved 2013-01-05. Sustainable harvesting of renewable\nresources (i.e., maintaining a positive renewal rate) can reduce air pollution,\nsoil contamination, habitat destruction and land degradation.\n\nGasoline, coal, natural gas, diesel and other commodities derived from fossil\nfuels, as well as minerals like copper and others, are non-renewable resources\nwithout a sustainable yield.\n","linknr":680,"url":"Renewable","recorded":1362507895,"links":49,"instances":["geology","soil","physics","geology","economics"],"pdf":["http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/bulletin/bi046.pdf","http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/bulletin/bi046.pdf"],"categories":["Resources|","Natural
