It\nelects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post\nmethod of election. It also forms one of ten constituencies in the West Scotland\nelectoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to ten\nconstituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the\nregion as a whole.\n\nThe constituency was created for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election largely\nfrom the former West Renfrewshire constituency, the majority of which went on to\nform Renfrewshire North and West.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1374766273,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_constituencies_and_regions","/wiki/File:Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Renfrewshire_South_%28Scottish_Parliament_constituency%29.svg/150px-Renfrewshire_South_%28Scottish_Parliament_constituency%29.svg.png","/wiki/File:West_Scotland_(Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/West_Scotland_%28Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region%29.svg/150px-West_Scotland_%28Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region%29.svg.png","/wiki/West_Scotland_(Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region)","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2011","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Hugh_Henry","/wiki/Council_areas_of_Scotland","/wiki/Renfrewshire","/wiki/East_Renfrewshire","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scottish_Labour_Party","/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies","/wiki/Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/First_past_the_post","/wiki/West_Scotland_(Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region)","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_constituencies_and_regions","/wiki/Additional_member_system_(Scottish_Parliament)","/wiki/Proportional_representation","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011","/wiki/West_Renfrewshire_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Renfrewshire_North_and_West_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","#Electoral_region","#Constituency_boundaries_and_council_area","#Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","#Election_results","#Notes_and_references","/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/West_Scotland_(Scottish_Parliament_electoral_region)","/wiki/Clydebank_and_Milngavie_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Cunninghame_North_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Cunninghame_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Dumbarton_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Eastwood_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Greenock_and_Inverclyde_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Paisley_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Renfrewshire_North_and_West_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Strathkelvin_and_Bearsden_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Argyll_and_Bute","/wiki/East_Dunbartonshire","/wiki/East_Renfrewshire","/wiki/Inverclyde","/wiki/North_Ayrshire","/wiki/Renfrewshire","/wiki/West_Dunbartonshire","/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Renfrewshire","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Paisley_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Renfrewshire_North_and_West_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/East_Renfrewshire","/wiki/Eastwood_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Barrhead","/wiki/Johnstone","/wiki/Elderslie","/wiki/Howwood","/wiki/Kilbarchan","/wiki/Lochwinnoch","/wiki/Neilston","/wiki/Uplawmoor","/wiki/Newton_Mearns","/wiki/Eastwood_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Houston,_Renfrewshire","/wiki/Crosslee","/wiki/Linwood,_Renfrewshire","/wiki/Renfrewshire_North_and_West_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_election,_2011","/wiki/Hugh_Henry","/wiki/Scottish_Labour_Party","/w/index.php?title=Renfrewshire_South_(Scottish_Parliament_consti
