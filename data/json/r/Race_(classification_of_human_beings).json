{"cursor":"179369","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Race' is a classification system used to categorize humans into large and\ndistinct populations or groups by anatomical, cultural, ethnic, genetic,\ngeographical, historical, linguistic, religious, or social affiliation. First\nused to denote national affiliations, the term began to be used to relate to\nphysical traits in the 17th century. In the early 20th century the term was\noften used, in a taxonomic sense, to denote genetically differentiated human\npopulations defined by phenotype.\n\nWhile biologists sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among\nfuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea\nof race often is used in a naive or simplistic way, i.e. that among humans, race has no taxonomic\nsignificance: all living humans belong to the same species, ''Homo sapiens'' and\nsubspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.\n\nSocial conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk\ntaxonomies See:\n*\n*  that define of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists\n  consider biological essentialism obsolete, and generally\n  discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical\n  and behavioral traits.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century the associations of race with the\nideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century\nanthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself\nbecoming problematic. Although still used in general contexts, it is now often\nreplaced by other words which are less ambiguous and emotionally charged, such\nas populations, people(s), ethnic groups or communities depending on\ncontext. \"race\".
