After the duke died, the younger Richard\nmarried the widowed duchess, Jacquetta of Luxembourg (1416â1472). This was\ninitially a secret marriage, for which the couple were fined when it came to\npublic notice.\n\nHe was a captain in 1429, served in France in 1433 and was a knight of the\nregent Duke of Bedford in 1435. He was at Gerberoi in 1435 and served under\nWilliam de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, in 1435â6. He then fought under Somerset\nand Shrewsbury in 1439 and the Duke of York in 1441â2, when he was made captain\nof AlenÃ§on and knight-banneret. He was appointed seneschal of Gascony in 1450\n(but failed to reach it before its fall), lieutenant of Calais in 1454â5, and to\ndefend Kent against invasion by the Yorkist earls in 1459â60 (but was captured\nat Sandwich). He was created Baron Rivers by Henry VI on 9 May 1448. Two years\nlater, as Sir Richard, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1450. He was\nappointed Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1459.\n\nIn the Wars of the Roses, he was initially a Lancastrian, but he became a\nYorkist when he thought that the Lancastrian cause was lost. He reconciled\nhimself to the victorious Edward IV, his future son-in-law. On 1 May 1464,\nEdward married his daughter Elizabeth, widow of Sir John Grey of Groby. Richard\nwas created Earl Rivers in 1466, appointed Lord Treasurer in March 1466 and\nConstable of England on 24 August 1467.\n\nThe power of this new family was very distasteful to the old baronial party, and\nespecially so to the Earl of Warwick. Rivers was regarded as a social upstart,\nand in an ironical episode, his future son-in-law in 1459, while accepting his\nsubmission, had rebuked him for daring , given his lowly birth, to fight against\nthe House of York. The Privy Council, in its horrified response to the King's\nmarriage, said bluntly that her father's low social standing in itself meant\nthat the King must surely know \" that Elizabeth was not the wife for him\". Early\nin 1468, the Rivers estates were plundered by Warwick's partisans, and the open\nwar of the following year was aimed at destroying the Woodvilles. After the\nYorkist defeat at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469, Rivers and his\nsecond son John were taken prisoners at Chepstow. Following a hasty show trial,\nthey were beheaded at Kenilworth on 12 August 1469. His eldest son Anthony\nsucceeded him in the earldom.\n\nLord Rivers had a large family. His third son, Lionel (d. 1484) became the\nBishop of Salisbury. All his daughters made great marriages: Catherine\nWoodville, the fifth child, was wife of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.\n\nIt is worth noting that \"Woodville\" is the modern spelling of the name and was\nnot so spelled at the time, even though uniform spelling was not established for\nalmost two centuries. The spelling used at the time was \"Wydeville\" or\n\"Wydville\".\n","linknr":184,"url":"Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers","recorded":1375075946,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Jacquetta_of_Luxembourg","/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville","/wiki/Anthony_Woodville,_2nd_Earl_Rivers","/wiki/John_Woodville","/wiki/Catherine_Woodville,_Duchess_of_Buckingham_and_Bedford","/wiki/Anne_Woodville","/wiki/Mary_Woodville","/wiki/Lionel_Woodville","/wiki/Richard_Woodville,_3rd_Earl_Rivers","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Maidstone","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Kenilworth","/wiki/Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter","/wiki/England","/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville","/wiki/Edward_V_of_England","/wiki/Henry_VIII","/wiki/Maidstone","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/John,_Duke_of_Bedford","/wiki/Jacquetta_of_Luxembourg","/wiki/Baron_Rivers","/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England","/wiki/Knight_of_the_Garter","/wiki/Warden_of_the_Cinque_Ports","/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses","/wiki/House_of_Lancaster","/wiki/House_of_York","/wiki/John_Grey_of_Groby","/wiki/Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Lord_Treasurer","/wiki/Constable_of_England","/wiki/Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/Privy_Council","/wiki/Battle_of_Edgecote_Moor","/wiki/John_Woodville","/wiki/Chepstow","/wiki/Kenilworth","/wiki/Anthony_Woodville,_2nd_Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Lionel_Woodville","/wiki/Bishop_of_Salisbury","/wiki/Catherine_Woodville,_Duchess_of_Buckingham_and_Bedford","/wiki/Henry_Stafford,_2nd_Duke_of_Buckingham","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-RWoodville1469-2","/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville","/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England","/wiki/Anne_Woodville","/wiki/George_Grey,_2nd_Earl_of_Kent","/wiki/Anthony_Woodville,_2nd_Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Elizabeth_Woodville,_Countess_Rivers","/wiki/Mary_Woodville","/wiki/William_Herbert,_2nd_Earl_of_Pembroke","/wiki/Lord_Strange#Barons_Strange_.28de.2Fof_Knockin.29.2C_Second_Creation_.281299.29","/wiki/John_Woodville","/wiki/Lady_Katherine_Neville","/wiki/Lionel_Woodville","/wiki/Bishop_of_Salisbury","/wiki/Richard_Woodville,_3rd_Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Edward_Woodville,_Lord_Scales","/wiki/Thomas_Fitzalan,_17th_Earl_of_Arundel","/wiki/Catherine_Woodville,_Duchess_of_Buckingham","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Henry_Stafford,_2nd_Duke_of_Buckingham","/wiki/Jasper_Tudor,_1st_Duke_of_Bedford","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.thepeerage.com/p10292.htm#i102911","#cite_ref-RWoodville1469_2-0","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fref%3Aodnb%2F29939","http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/libraries/","http://books.google.com/books?id=KbIKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA207&dq=Elizabeth+Herbert,+3rd+Baroness+Herbert&lr=&as_brr=1&ei=zyUeSOHyOoOOjAGg4vWJBg#PPA207,M1","http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/R/RI/RIVERS_RICHARD_WOODVILLE_or_WYDEVILLE_EARL.htm","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0550130004","/wiki/Humphrey_Stafford,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham","/wiki/Lord_Warden_of_the_Cinque_Ports","/wiki/Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Earl_of_Worcester","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_England","/wiki/Richard_III_of_England","/wiki/Walter_Blount,_1st_Baron_Mountjoy","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer","/wiki/John_Langstrother","/wiki/Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Earl_Rivers","/wiki/Anthony_Woodville,_2nd_Earl_Rivers","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Woodville,_1st_Earl_Rivers&oldid=566224705","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Wars_of_the_Roses","/wiki/Category:Knights_of_the_Garter","/wiki/Category:Lord_High_Treasurers_of_England","/wiki/Category:Woodville_family","/wiki/Category:Lords_Warden_of_the_Cinque_Ports","/wiki/Category:Earls_in_the_Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Category:1405_births","/wiki/Category:1469_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_executed_under_the_Yorkists","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kent_executed_by_decapitation","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_the_Kingdom_of_England_by
