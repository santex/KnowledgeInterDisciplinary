{"cursor":"4007","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Rigaud Benoit' (1911â1986) had become, well\nbefore his death, one of the three or four most highly prized Haitian artists.\n\nA native of Port-au-Prince, Benoit had been a shoemaker, musician, and taxi\ndriver before making his living as a painter. He had also supplemented his\nincome by painting pottery, pieces he rarely signed or acknowledged.\n\nBenoit was an early member of the HaÃ¯tian art movement known as Naive Art, so-\ncalled because of its members' limited formal training. The movement was first\nrecognized and promoted by the Centre d'Art, founded in 1944 by the American\nQuaker and World War II conscientious objector Dewitt Peters.\n\nAccording to a widely repeated story, Benoit was working as Peters's chauffeur\nin 1944 when he saw some of the first works displayed at the Centre d'Art. He\nimmediately decided he could do as well as any of the featured artists. Late in\nlife Benoit denied that tale, insisting that he had merely visited the Centre\nout of curiosity before submitting his first works to Peters. His paintings were\nimmediately among the Centre's most popular.\n\nIn the early 1950s Benoit was one of a handful of artists asked to decorate the\ninterior of the Cathedral of Sainte TrinitÃ©; his great mural, Nativity, stands\nabove the high altar. (The Catholic archbishop hadâto his subsequent\nregretâdenied permission for \"mere Haitians\" to decorate the Roman cathedral.\nThe Episcopal bishop eagerly consented to the project. On seeing the result he\nexclaimed \"Thank God!, they painted Haitians.\")\n\nSome of Benoit's later work was surrealist, though he continued to produce\nscenes of Haitian lifeânarrative scenesâuntil his death.\n\nBenoit married the daughter of his friend Hector Hyppolite, the first Haitian\nartist to win international recognition and still the most acclaimed in\ninternational art circles. They had four children. Three of them -- Yves\nLafontant and Jacques Dorce, both adopted, and Rigaud Benoit, fils -- are also\naccomplished artists. (Benoit fils lives in New York, his sister in Montreal.)\n\nBenoit's work is characterized by precise draftsmanship, muted colors (compared\nwith most Haitian artists outside the Northern or Cap-HaÃ¯tien school), and\noftenâin his narrative paintingsâa sense of humor. His surrealist paintings\nmostly depict voodoo scenes or deities lwas. (HaÃ¯ti is, the saying goes, \"80\npercent Catholic and 100 percent Vodou\". In the past century evangelical\nProtestantism has reduced both figures.)\n\nBenoit worked slowlyâusually fewer than half-a-dozen pieces a year. Following a\nnear-fatal automobile accident early in 1980, his production declined further.\nHe had, by that time, attained a measure of financial security: he owned a\ncomfortable cottage on the outskirts of the Haitian capital.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Rigaud_Benoit","recorded":1375071942,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Haiti","/wiki/Port-au-Prince","/wiki/Naive_Art","/w/index.php?title=Centre_d%27Art&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends","/w/index.php?title=Dewitt_Peters&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Cathedral_of_Sainte_Trinit%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Surrealist","/wiki/Hector_Hyppolite","/w/index.php?title=Yves_Lafontant&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jacques_Dorce&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit,_fils&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien","/wiki/Surrealist","/wiki/Haitian_Vodou","/wiki/Loas","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=edit&section=1","http://www.artshaitian.com/Pages/haitianartbenoit.html","http://www.artshaitian.com/Pages/haitianartbenoit.html","http://www.haitianarthopkins.com/benoit.htm","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-9638599-0-0","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/96016903","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&oldid=560285929","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Haitian_artists","/wiki/Category:Haitian_painters","/wiki/Category:1911_births","/wiki/Category:1986_deaths","/wiki/Category:Naive_painters","/wiki/Category:People_from_Port-au-Prince","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rigaud+Benoit&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rigaud+Benoit","/wiki/Rigaud_Benoit","/wiki/Talk:Rigaud_Benoit","#","/wiki/Rigaud_Benoit","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Rigaud_Benoit","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Rigaud_Benoit","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&oldid=560285929","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3057680","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Rigaud_Benoit&id=560285929","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Rigaud+Benoit","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Rigaud+Benoit&oldid=560285929&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Rigaud_Benoit&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigaud_Benoit","//ht.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigaud_Benoit","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%83%99%E3%83%8E%E3%83%AF","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3057680#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigaud_Benoit","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categori
