{"cursor":"14502","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn category theory, an 'epimorphism' (also called an 'epic morphism' or,\ncolloquially, an 'epi') is a morphism f : X â Y which is right-cancellative in\nthe sense that, for all morphisms ,\n: g_1 \\circ f = g_2 \\circ f \\Rightarrow g_1 = g_2.\n\nEpimorphisms are analogues of surjective functions, but they are not exactly the\nsame. The dual of an epimorphism is a monomorphism (i.e. an epimorphism in a\ncategory C is a monomorphism in the dual category C op ).\n\nMany authors in abstract algebra and universal algebra define an 'epimorphism'\nsimply as an onto or surjective homomorphism. Every epimorphism in this\nalgebraic sense is an epimorphism in the sense of category theory, but the\nconverse is not true in all categories. In this article, the term \"epimorphism\"\nwill be used in the sense of category theory given above.
