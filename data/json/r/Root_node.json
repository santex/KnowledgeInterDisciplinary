{"cursor":"14060","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science, a 'tree' is a widely used data structure that simulates a\nhierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes.\n\nA tree can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting\nat a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value,\ntogether with a list of nodes (the \"children\"), with the constraints that no\nnode is duplicated. A tree can be defined abstractly as a whole (globally) as an\nordered tree, with a value assigned to each node. Both these perspectives are\nuseful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually\nrepresented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with\nseparately by node (rather than as a list of nodes and an adjacency list of\nedges between nodes, as one may represent a digraph, for instance). For example,\nlooking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about \"the parent node\" of a given\nnode, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of\nits children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any).\n","linknr":347,"url":"Root_node","recorded":1362551616,"links":42,"instances":["data_structure","set_theory","xanadu","computer_science","graph_theory","hierarchy","data_structure","graph_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data types","Trees (data structures)|","Knowledge representation"],"headings":["Definition","Terminology","Drawing graphs","Representations","Generalizations","Traversal methods","Common operations","Common uses","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/220px-Binary_tree.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vertex","graph_theory"],["referential_transparency","computer_science"],["arborescence","graph_theory"],["tree","graph_theory"],["superior","hierarchy"],["heap","data_structure"],["graph","data_structure#representations"],["tree","graph_theory"],["graph","data_structure"],["vertex","graph_theory"],["arborescence","graph_theory"],["tree","graph_theory"],["tree","set_theory"],["hierarchy","mathematics"],["enfilade","xanadu"]],"members":["heap","tree","enfilade","referential_transparency","arborescence","superior","graph","vertex","hierarchy"],"related":["Computer_science","Data_structure","Tree_structure","Vertex_(graph_theory)","Ordered_tree","Adjacency_list","Functional_language","Referential_transparency_(computer_science)","Ordered_tree","Rooted_tree","Arborescence_(graph_theory)","Directed_graph","Undirected_graph","Tree_(graph_theory)","Branching_factor","Outdegree","Superior_(hierarchy)","Heap_(data_structure)","AVL_Trees","Proper_subset","Ambient_isotopy","Family_tree","Dynamic_memory_allocation","Array_data_structure","Binary_heap","Threaded_binary_tree","Directed_graph","Adjacency_list","Graph_theory","Tree_(graph_theory)","Graph_(data_structure)","Vertex_(graph_theory)","Arborescence_(graph_theory)","Corecursion","Mutual_recursion","K","Binary_tree","Breadth-first_search","Hierarchical","Search_algorithm","Binary_search_tree","Tree_traversal","Sorting_algorithm","Digital_compositing","Visual_effects","Routing","Tree_structure","Tree_(graph_theory)","Tree_(set_theory)","Hierarchy_(mathematics)","Dialog_tree","Single_inheritance","DSW_algorithm","Enfilade_(Xanadu)","Left_child-right_sibling_binary_tree","Donald_Knuth","Thomas_H._Cormen","Charles_E._Leiserson","Ronald_L._Rivest","Clifford_Stein","Dictionary_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures"]}
