{"cursor":"7347","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Royal African Company' was a mercantile company set up by the Stuart family\nand London merchants to trade along the west coast of Africa. It was led by\nJames, Duke of York, Charles II's brother. Its original purpose was to exploit\nthe gold fields up the Gambia River identified by Prince Rupert during the\nInterregnum, and it was setup once Charles II gained the English throne in the\nEnglish Restoration of 1660. However, it was soon engaged in the\nslave trade as well as with other commodities.\n\nOriginally known as the 'Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa', it was\ngranted a monopoly over English trade with West Africa, by its charter issued in\n1660. With the help of the army and navy it established forts on the West\nAfrican coast that served as staging and trading stations, and it was\nresponsible for seizing any English ships that attempted to operate in violation\nof their monopoly. In the prize court the King received half of the proceeds and\nthe company half. , originally published in London by Longmans, Green in\n1957.\n\nThe company fell heavily into debt in 1667 during the war with the Netherlands â\nthe very war it started by having company Admiral Robert Holmes attack the Dutch\nAfrican trade posts in 1664 â as it had lost most of its forts on the African\ncoast except Cape Corse. also published as  For the next several\nyears the company maintained some desultory trade, including licensing single\ntrip private traders, but their biggest effort was the creation in 1668, to\nstart 1 January 1669, of the 'Gambia Adventurers' The \"Gambia Adventurers\"\nis sometimes known as 'The Gambian Merchants' Company'. which was\nseparately subscribed and granted a ten year license for African trade north of\nthe Bight of Benin. In 1672, the company re-emerged, re-structured\nand with a new Royal Charter, as the new Royal African Company. Its new charter\nwas broader than the old one and included the right to set up forts, factories,\nmaintain troops and to exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade\nin gold, silver and slaves. Kitson, Frank. (1999) Prince Rupert: Admiral and\nGeneral-at-Sea. London: Constable, p.238. At the end 1678, the license to\nthe Gambia Adventurers expired and Gambian trade was merged into the\ncompany.\n\nIn the 1680s it was transporting about 5,000 slaves per year. Many were branded\nwith the letters 'DY', after its chief, the Duke of York, who succeeded his\nbrother on the throne in 1685, becoming James II. Other slaves were branded with\nthe company's initials, RAC, on their chests. Micklethwait, John, and Adrian\nWooldridge. The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea. New York:\nModern Library, 2003. ISBN 0-679-64249-8.\n\nBetween 1672 and 1689 it transported around 90,000-100,000 slaves. Its profits\nmade a major contribution to the increase in the financial power of those who\ncontrolled London.\n\nFrom 1694 until 1700, the company was a major participant in the Komenda Wars in\nthe port city Komenda in the Eguafo Kingdom in modern-day Ghana. The company\nallied with a merchant prince named John Cabess and various neighboring African\nkingdoms to depose the king of Eguafo and permanently establish a fort and\nfactory in Komenda.\n\nIn 1689, it acknowledged that it had lost its monopoly with the end of royal\npower in the Glorious Revolution. Although no law was passed by parliament,\nthe company ceased issuing letters of marque. This was advantageous for\nmerchants in Bristol, even if, like the Bristolian Edward Colston, they had\nalready been involved in the trade. The number of slaves transported on English\nships subsequently increased dramatically.\n\nThe company continued purchasing and transporting slaves until 1731, when it\nabandoned slaving in favour of ivory and gold dust. Charles Hayes (1678â1760),\nmathematician and chronologist was sub-governor of Royal African Company till\n1752 when it was dissolved. Its successor was the African Company of Merchants.\n\nThe Royal African Company's logo depicted an elephant and castle.\n\nFrom 1668 to 1722 the Royal African Company provided gold to the English Mint.\nCoins made with this gold bear an elephant below the bust of the king and/or\nqueen. This gold also gave the coinage its nameâthe guinea.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Royal_African_Company","recorded":1363150073,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Royal_African_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Royal_African_Company&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:1686-Guinea-elephant-and-castle-James-II.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/1686-Guinea-elephant-and-castle-James-II.jpg/300px-1686-Guinea-elephant-and-castle-James-II.jpg","/wiki/File:1686-Guinea-elephant-and-castle-James-II.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mercantile","/wiki/House_of_Stuart","/wiki/City_of_London","/wiki/James_II_of_England","/wiki/Duke_of_York","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","/wiki/Gambia_River","/wiki/Interregnum_(England)","/wiki/England","/wiki/English_Restoration","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Monopoly","/wiki/West_Africa","/wiki/Charter","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War","/wiki/Robert_Holmes_(admiral)","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Bight_of_Benin","#cite_note-5","/wiki/African_slave_trade","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Branding_persons","#cite_note-8","/wiki/London","/wiki/Komenda_Wars","/wiki/Komenda-Edina-Eguafo-Abirem_(Ghana_parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ghana","/wiki/John_Cabess","#cite_note-Law-9","/wiki/Glorious_Revolution","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Bristol","/wiki/Edward_Colston","/wiki/Ivory","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Charles_Hayes_(mathematician)","/wiki/African_Company_of_Merchants","/wiki/Logo","/wiki/Elephant_and_castle","/wiki/Royal_Mint","/wiki/Guinea_(British_coin)","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Royal_African_Company&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=-W08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA217","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/1083162","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=w9sH0h391c8C&pg=PA106","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-415-19077-0","#cite_ref-3","http://books.google.com/books?id=vTMaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA20","http://books.google.com/books?id=uEc_cG58dZQC&pg=PA155","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#CITEREFZook1919","http://books.google.com/books?id=vTMaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA23","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#CITEREFDavies1999","http://books.google.com/books?id=w9sH0h391c8C&pg=PA215","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/John_Micklethwait","/wiki/Adrian_Wooldridge","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0679642498","#cite_ref-Law_9-0","#cite_ref-10","/wiki/Letters_of_marque","#CITEREFDavies1999","http://books.google.com/books?id=w9sH0h391c8C&pg=PA123","#cite_ref-11","#CITEREFDavies1999","http://books.google.com/books?id=w9sH0h391c8C&pg=PA181","/w/index.php?title=Royal_African_Company&action=edit&section=2","http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/searches/subjectView.asp?ID=B4637","/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)","http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/searches/subjectView.asp?ID=B5064","/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)","http://books.google.fr/books?id=qUN-VpQPvlwC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22Royal+African+Company%22+shareholders&source=bl&ots=XGHesj5bGv&sig=qRe0RXV4IsQ4-gaFehyxxjeNfzM&hl=fr&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA66,M1","/wiki/Template:Chartered_companies","/wiki/Template_talk:Chartered_companies","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Chartered_companies&action=edit","/wiki/Chartered_company","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Company_of_Merchant_Adventurers_of_London","/wiki/Company_of_Merchant_Adventurers_to_New_Lands","/wiki/London_and_Bristol_Company","/wiki/African_Company_of_Merchants","/wiki/Guinea_Company_(London)","/wiki/Muscovy_Company","/w/index.php?title=Spanish_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Eastland_Company","/wiki/Barbary_Company","/wiki/East_India_Company","/wiki/Levant_Company","/wiki/Virginia_Company","/w/index.php?title=French_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony","/wiki/Providence_Island_Company","/w/index.php?title=Royal_West_Indian_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company","/w/index.php?title=Greenland_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/South_Sea_Company","/wiki/Sierra_Leone_Company","/wiki/New_Zealand_Company","/wiki/Eastern_Archipelago_Company","/wiki/Royal_British_Bank","/wiki/North_Borneo_Chartered_Company","/wiki/R
