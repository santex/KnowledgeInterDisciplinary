She entered graduate studies at Columbia University in 1919, studying\nunder Franz Boas, receiving her Ph.D and joining the faculty in 1923. Margaret\nMead, with whom she may have shared a romantic relationship, Modell 1984:\n145â157 and Marvin Opler were among her students and colleagues.\n\nFranz Boas, her teacher and mentor, has been called the father of American\nanthropology and his teachings and point of view are clearly evident in\nBenedict's work. Ruth Benedict was affected by the passionate humanism of Boas,\nher mentor, and continued it in her research and writing.\n\nBenedict held the post of President of the American Anthropological Association\nand was also a prominent member of the American Folklore Society. She became the first woman to be recognized as a prominent\nleader of a learned profession. She can be viewed as a\ntransitional figure in her field, redirecting both anthropology and folklore\naway from the limited confines of culture-trait diffusion studies and towards\ntheories of performance as integral to the interpretation of culture. She\nstudied the relationships between personality, art, language and culture,\ninsisting that no trait existed in isolation or self-sufficiency, a theory which\nshe championed in her 1934 Patterns of Culture.\n","linknr":741,"url":"Ruth_Benedict","recorded":1362480932,"links":46,"instances":["anthropologist"],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf"],"categories":["1887 births","1948 deaths","American anthropologists","Bisexual women","Bisexual writers","Columbia University alumni","Columbia University faculty","Cultural anthropologists","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Intelligence researchers","American Japanologists","LGBT scientists","LGBT writers from the United States","Psychological anthropologists","Vassar College alumni","Women anthropologists"],"headings":["Early life","Career in anthropology","Work","Legacy","Publications","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Ruth_Benedict.jpg/200px-Ruth_Benedict.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/180px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg/10px-Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alexander_goldenweiser","anthropologist"]],"members":["alexander_goldenweiser"],"related":["New_York_City","New_York","New_York_City","New_York","Anthropology","Columbia_University","Cultural_relativism","Anthropologist","Franz_Boas","Margaret_Mead","United_States","Anthropology","Folkloristics","New_York_City","Vassar_College","Columbia_University","Franz_Boas","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Margaret_Mead","Marvin_Opler","Franz_Boas","Teacher","Mentor","Humanism","American_Anthropological_Association","American_Folklore_Society","New_York_City","Measles","Partial_deafness","Jean_Ingelow","St._Margaret’s_School_for_Girls","Vassar_College","Walter_Pater","Orton_School_for_Girls","Mary_Wollstonecraft","New_School_for_Social_Research","Elsie_Clews_Parsons","Alexander_Goldenweiser_(anthropologist)","Franz_Boas","Margaret_Mead","Edward_Sapir","Psychoanalysis","Margaret_Mead","Ruth_Landes","Nicholas_Murray_Butler","Ralph_Linton","Margaret_Mead","World_War_II","Bryn_Mawr_College","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","New_York","Pueblo","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Great_Plains","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Apollonian_and_Dionysian","Apollo","Dionysus","Wine","Cultural_relativism","Morality","Kwakiutl","Pacific_Northwest","New_Mexico","Dobu_Island","New_Guinea","Reo_Fortune","David_Friend_Aberle","Professor","Columbia_University","Margaret_Mead","Ruth_Landes","Cultural_anthropology","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","United_States","World_War_II","Gene_Weltfish","Axis_powers_of_World_War_II","Fascism","Fascism","Bible","Intelligent","Imbecile","Intelligence_quotient","American_Expeditionary_Force","World_War_I","Southern_United_States","Blood_type","History","Japan","Literature","Allies_of_World_War_II","Nazi_Germany","Hirohito","Persuasion","Culture_of_Japan","United_States","Prisoners_of_war","Colonialism","Emperor_of_Japan","Japanese_popular_culture","Franklin_D._Roosevelt","Takeo_Doi","Great_Americans_series","Postage_stamp","Lois_Banner","Bureau_of_American_Ethnology","Houghton_Mifflin_Company","University_of_California_Press","Mary_Catherine_Bateson","Stanford_University_Press","University_of_Wisconsin_Press","University_of_Massachusetts_Press","Internet_Archive","University_of_Chicago","New_York_City","New_York","New_York_City","New_York"]}
