RNAa was first reported in a 2006 PNAS\npaper by Li et al. who also coined the term \"RNAa\" as\na contrast to RNA interference (RNAi) to describe such\ngene activation phenomenon. Soon after, several groups made similar observation\nin different mammalian species including human, non-human primates, rat and\nmice, suggesting that RNAa is a general gene regulation\nmechanism conserved at least in mammals. In these studies, upregulation of gene\nexpression is achieved by targeting selected promoter regions using either\nsynthetic 21- nucleotide dsRNAs or vector expressed small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).\nSuch promoter targeted dsRNAs have been termed antigene RNA (agRNAs) or small activating RNA (saRNA).\n\nSimilar dsRNA-mediated gene activation phenomenon has also been observed in\nplants.\n","linknr":252,"url":"RNAa","recorded":1362374347,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Gene expression"],"headings":["Mechanism of RNAa","Endogenous RNAa","Applications of RNAa","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["RNA_interference","RNAi","Small_activating_RNA","SaRNA","Argonaute","MiRNA","Non-coding_RNA","NcRNA"]}
