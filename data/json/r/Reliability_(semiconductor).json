{"cursor":"6623","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Reliability' of semiconductor devices can be summarized as follows:\n# Semiconductor devices are very sensitive to impurities and particles.\n# Therefore, to manufacture these devices it is necessary to manage many\n# processes while accurately controlling the level of impurities and particles.\n# The finished product quality depends upon the many layered relationship of\n# each interacting substance in the semiconductor, including metallization, chip\n# material (list of semiconductor materials) and package. The problems of micro-\n# processes, and thin films and must be fully understood as they apply to\n# metallization and wire bonding. It is also necessary to analyze surface\n# phenomena from the aspect of thin films. Due to the rapid advances in\n# technology, many new devices are developed using new materials and processes,\n# and design calendar time is limited due to non-recurring engineering\n# constraints, plus time to market concerns. Consequently, it is not possible to\n# base new designs on the reliability of existing devices. To achieve economy of\n# scale, semiconductor products are manufactured in high volume. Furthermore\n# repair of finished semiconductor products is impractical. Therefore\n# incorporation of reliability at the design stage and reduction of variation in\n# the production stage have become essential. Reliability of semiconductor\n# devices may depend on assembly, use, and environmental conditions. Stress\n# factors affecting device reliability include gas, dust, contamination,\n# voltage, current density, temperature, humidity, mechanical stress, vibration,\n# shock, radiation, pressure, and intensity of magnetic and electrical fields.\nDesign factors affecting semiconductor reliability include: voltage derating,\npower derating, current derating, metastability, logic timing margins (logic\nsimulation), timing analysis, temperature derating, and process control.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Reliability_(semiconductor)","recorded":1363143193,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Semiconductor","/wiki/Metallizing","/wiki/Material","/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_materials","/wiki/Thin_films","/wiki/Wire_bonding","/wiki/Non-recurring_engineering","/wiki/Time_to_market","/wiki/Economy_of_scale","/wiki/Gas","/wiki/Dust","/wiki/Voltage","/wiki/Electric_current","/wiki/Temperature","/wiki/Humidity","/wiki/Mechanical_stress","/wiki/Vibration","/wiki/Shock_(mechanics)","/wiki/Radiation","/wiki/Pressure","/wiki/Magnetic","/wiki/Electrical","/wiki/Voltage","/wiki/Electric_power","/wiki/Electric_current","/wiki/Metastability","/wiki/Logic_simulation","/wiki/Timing_analysis","/wiki/Temperature","/wiki/Process_control","#Methods_of_improvement","#Failure_mechanisms","#Material-interaction-induced_mechanisms","#Stress-induced_failure_mechanisms","#Mechanically_induced_failure_mechanisms","#Environmentally_induced_failure_mechanisms","#See_also","#References","#Bibliography","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Cleanrooms","/wiki/Process_control","/wiki/Burn-in","/wiki/Wafer_prober","/wiki/Wafer_testing","/wiki/Automotive_Electronics_Council","#cite_note-AEC_Documents-1","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Field-effect_transistor","/wiki/Ohmic_contact","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Electromigration","/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge","/wiki/HIRF","/wiki/Latch-up","/wiki/Overvoltage","/wiki/Overcurrent","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Fracture","/wiki/Injection_molding#Molding_defects","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Failure_analysis","/wiki/Cleanroom","/wiki/Burn-in","/wiki/List_of_materials-testing_resources","/wiki/List_of_materials_analysis_methods","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-AEC_Documents_1-0","http://www.aecouncil.com/AECDocuments.html","http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/others/rej27l0001_reliabilityhb.pdf","http://parts.jpl.nasa.gov/mmic/4.PDF","http://www.enre.umd.edu/publications/rs&h.htm","https://www.eurelnet.org/","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&section=9","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&oldid=543033196","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Semiconductors","/wiki/Category:Electronic_design","/wiki/Category:Packaging","/wiki/Category:Semiconductor_device_fabrication","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reliability+%28semiconductor%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reliability+%28semiconductor%29","/wiki/Reliability_(semiconductor)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Reliability_(semiconductor)","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Reliability_(semiconductor)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Reliability_(semiconductor)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&oldid=543033196","/w/index.php?title=Reliability_(semiconductor)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Reliability_%2
