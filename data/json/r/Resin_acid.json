{"cursor":"6512","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Resin acids' refers to mixtures primarily. Abietic acid is the main component\nbut several related carboxylic acids. Nearly all resin acids have the same\nbasic skeleton: three fused ring fused with the empirical formula\nC 19 H29 COOH. These materials occur in rosin but also\noccur in fossil coal or copal resins, in old pine tree stumps, etc. Resin\nacids are tacky, yellowish gums that are water-insoluble. They are used to\nproduce soaps for diverse applications, but their use is being displaced\nincreasingly by synthetic acids such as 2-ethylhexanoic acid or petroleum-\nderived naphthenic acids.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Resin_acid","recorded":1362481493,"links":17,"instances":["wood"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomolecules","Acids","Resins"],"headings":["Botanical analysis","Chemical components","Production in tall oil (chemical pulping byproduct)","Variation with species and biogeoclimatic zone","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Abietic_acid.svg/220px-Abietic_acid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Pimaric_acid_structure.svg/220px-Pimaric_acid_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sapwood","wood"]],"members":["sapwood"],"related":["Abietic_acid","Carboxylic_acid","Rosin","Fossil","Coal","Copal","2-ethylhexanoic_acid","Naphthenic_acid","Protectant","Wood","Parenchyma","Epithelium","Resin_duct","Temperate_coniferous_forests","Resin","Isoprene","Terpene","Carboxyl","Pine","Heartwood","Sapwood_(wood)","Mountain_pine_beetle","British_Columbia","Abietic_acid","Levopimaric_acid","Tall_oil","Molecular_weight","Pimaric_acid","Isopimaric_acid","Wood_pulp","Kraft_process","Sodium_hydroxide","Sodium_sulfide","Sodium_hydrosulfide","Kraft_soap","Resin_soap","Sulfuric_acid","Abietic_acid","Palmiric_acid","Tall_oil","Unsaponifiable","Sterol","Slash_Pine","Loblolly_Pine","Fatty_acid","Virginia","Pitch_Pine","Shortleaf_Pine","Canada","Lodgepole_Pine","British_Columbia","Alberta","Jack_Pine","Alberta","Quebec","Eastern_White_Pine","Red_Pine","Ontario","New_Brunswick","Finland","Sweden","Russia","Scots_Pine"]}
