{"cursor":"5649","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'quinone' is a class of organic compounds that are formally \"derived from\naromatic compounds [such as benzene or naphthalene] by conversion of an even\nnumber of âCH= groups into âC(=O)â groups with any necessary rearrangement of\ndouble bonds,\" resulting in \"a fully conjugated cyclic dione\nstructure.\" The class includes some heterocyclic compounds.\n\nThe prototypical member of the class are 1,4-benzoquinone or\ncyclohexadienedione, often called simply 'quinone' (whence the name of the\nclass). Other important examples are 1,2-benzoquinone ('ortho-quinone'), 1,4-\nnaphthoquinone and 9,10-anthraquinone.\n\nQuinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily\nmade from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such\nas phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and\ncontributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. (Quinones\nare conjugated but not aromatic). Quinones are electrophilic Michael acceptors\nstabilised by conjugation. Depending on the quinone and the site of reduction,\nreduction can either rearomatise the compound or break the conjugation.\nConjugate addition nearly always breaks the conjugation.\n\n File:orthobenzoquinone.svg|1,2-Benzoquinone File:P-Benzochinon.svg|1,4-\nBenzoquinone File:Naphthoquinone.png|1,4-Naphthoquinone File:Anthrachinon.svg|9,10-\nAnthraquinone \n\nThe term 'quinone' is also used more generally for a large class of compounds\nformally derived from aromatic quinones through replacement of some hydrogen\natoms by other atoms or radicals.\n\n File:2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-parabenzoquinone.svg|Chloranil\nFile:HNQ.svg|Lawsone File::Alizaryna.svg|alizarin\nFile:Dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone.svg|DDQ \n","linknr":201,"url":"Quinone","recorded":1362575934,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quinones|"],"headings":["Occurrence and uses","Medicinal Uses","Nomenclature","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Orthobenzoquinone.svg/104px-Orthobenzoquinone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/P-Benzochinon.svg/47px-P-Benzochinon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Naphthoquinone.png/94px-Naphthoquinone.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Anthrachinon.svg/120px-Anthrachinon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/2%2C3%2C5%2C6-tetrachloro-parabenzoquinone.svg/106px-2%2C3%2C5%2C6-tetrachloro-parabenzoquinone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/HNQ.svg/120px-HNQ.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone.svg/120px-Dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compound","Aromatic","Benzene","Naphthalene","Double_bond","Conjugated_system","Diketone","Heterocyclic_compound","1,4-benzoquinone","1,2-benzoquinone","1,4-naphthoquinone","Anthraquinone","Electron-donating_group","Phenols","Catechol","Redox_potential","Michael_acceptor","Conjugate_addition","1,2-Benzoquinone","1,4-Benzoquinone","1,4-Naphthoquinone","Anthraquinone","Hydrogen","Chloranil","Lawsone","Alizarin","2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone","Hydrogen_peroxide","Photosynthesis","Plastoquinone","Phylloquinone","Aerobic_respiration","Ubiquinone","Vitamin_K","Blood_coagulation","Bone","Hydroquinone","Bombardier_beetle","Hydrogen_peroxide","PGE2","Salvia_miltiorrhiza","Dye","Pigment","Azo_dyes","Alizarin","Rubia","Organic_chemistry","Organic_oxidation","Oxidizing_agent","Chloranil","2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone","Anthracene","1,4,5,8-naphthodiquinone","Anthra-1,4-quinone","Anthraquinone","Benzoquinone","Naphthoquinone","Plastoquinone","Pyrroloquinoline_quinone"]}
