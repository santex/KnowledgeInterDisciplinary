For example, it is the means by which rational\nbeings understand themselves to think about cause and effect, truth and\nfalsehood, and what is good or bad.\n\nIn contrast to reason as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration which\nexplains or justifies some event, phenomenon or behaviour.<ref name=mw>[http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary\ndefinition of reason</ref> The ways in which human beings reason through\nargument are the subject of inquiries in the field of logic.\n\nReason is closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change\nbeliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the\ncapacity for freedom and self-determination.<ref>Michel Foucault, \"What is\nEnlightenment?\" in The Essential Foucault, eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose,\nNew York: The New Press, 2003, 43-57.

The field of\nautomated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled\ncomputationally. Animal psychology considers the controversial question of\nwhether animals can reason.\n",
