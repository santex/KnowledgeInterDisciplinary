He\nhas been variously described as Irish, English and Anglo-Irish, his father\nhaving come to Ireland from England during the time of the Plantations.\n\nAlthough his research clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle\nis largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the\nfounders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental\nscientific method. He is best known for Boyle's law,\nwhich describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute\npressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a\nclosed system.

Among his works, [[The Sceptical Chymist]]\nis seen as a cornerstone book in the field of
