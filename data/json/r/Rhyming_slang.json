{"cursor":"19259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Rhyming slang' is a form of phrase construction in the English language and is\nespecially prevalent in dialectal English from the East End of London; hence the\nalternative name, '[[Cockney]] rhyming slang' (or 'CRS'). The construction\ninvolves replacing a common word with a rhyming phrase of two or three words and\nthen, in almost all cases, omitting the secondary rhyming word (which is\nthereafter implied), in a process called hemiteleia, making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to\nlisteners not in the know.\n\nThe most frequently cited exampleâalthough it is almost never employed by\ncurrent users âinvolves the replacement of \"stairs\" with the\nrhyming phrase \"apples and pears\". Following the usual pattern of omission,\n\"(and) pears\" is then dropped and \"stairs\" becomes \"apples\"; this is deciphered\nas \"apples\" > \"apples and pears\" > \"stairs\". Thus the spoken phrase \"I'm going\nup the apples\" means \"I'm going ['up the stairs'/'upstairs']\".\n\nIn similar fashion, \"telephone\" is replaced by \"dog\" (= 'dog-and-bone'); \"wife\"\nby \"trouble\" (= 'trouble-and-strife'); \"eyes\" by \"minces\" (= 'mince pies');\n\"wig\" by \"syrup\" (= 'syrup of figs') and \"feet\" by \"plates\" (= 'plates of\nmeat'). Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: \"It\nnearly knocked me off me platesâhe was wearing a syrup! So I got straight on the\ndog to me trouble and said I couldn't believe me minces.\"\n\nIn some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of\nrhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word \"Aris\"\nis often used to indicate the buttocks. This has been subjected to a double\nrhyme, starting with the original rough synonym \"arse\", which was rhymed with\n\"bottle and glass\", leading to \"bottle\". \"Bottle\" was then rhymed with\n\"Aristotle\" and truncated to \"Aris\".\n\nThe use of rhyming slang has spread beyond the purely dialectal and some\nexamples are to be found in the mainstream British English lexicon and\ninternationally, although many users may be unaware of the origin of those\nwords. One example is \"berk\", a mild pejorative widely used across the UK and\nnot usually considered particularly offensive, although the origin lies in a\ncontraction of \"Berkeley Hunt\", as the rhyme for the significantly more\noffensive\n\"cunt\". [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/berk]\n\nMost of the words changed by this process are nouns. A few are adjectival e.g.\n'bales' (of cotton = rotten), or the adjectival phrase 'on one's tod' = 'on\none's own (Tod Sloan, a famous jockey).\n","linknr":281,"url":"Rhyming_slang","recorded":1362480882,"links":18,"instances":["bandleader","jockey","novel","character","sexual_act","comedian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhyming slang|*","London society","English language in England","Forms of English","Slang","London words","Rhyme"],"headings":["History","Evolution","Regional and international variations","Rhyming slang and taboo terms","Rhyming slang in popular culture","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tod_sloan","jockey"],["max_miller","comedian"],["henry_hall","bandleader"],["scooby-doo","character"],["trap","carriage#types_of_horse-drawn_carriages"],["wank","sexual_act"],["moving_pictures","novel"]],"members":["henry_hall","tod_sloan","trap","moving_pictures","wank","max_miller"],"related":["English_language","East_End_of_London","London","Hemiteleia","Bruces'_Philosophers_Song","Berkeley_Hunt","Cunt","Tod_Sloan_(jockey)","East_End","London","John_Camden_Hotten","Seven_Dials","Cryptolect","Collusion","Peckham_Rye","Hampstead_Heath","Barnet_Fair","Gregory_Peck","Ruby_Murray","Alan_Whicker","Max_Miller_(comedian)","Henry_Hall_(bandleader)","Tony_Blair","Lionel_Blair","Britney_Spears","Butcher","Bread","John_Lennon","United_Artists","Don_Cheadle","Barney_Rubble","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Reg_Grundy","Lionel_Blair","Tony_Blair","Scooby-Doo_(character)","Scooby-Doo","Fox_hunting","Berkeley_Hunt","Stitching_awl","Hampton_Wick","Pony","Blowing_a_raspberry","Raspberry_tart","D'Oyly_Carte","Jimmy_Riddle","Urinate","J._Arthur_Rank","Ham_hock","Wank_(sexual_act)","Bristol_City_Football_Club","Jew","Chelsea_Football_Club","Glue","Dimensional_lumber","Shoemaking","Yiddish","Joe_Pasquale","ITV","Jacob's","Testicles","Sidney_Poitier","Flying_Squad","Kim_Newman","Moving_Pictures_(novel)","Terry_Pratchett","Spike_Jones","Audio_Bullys","Chas_&_Dave","The_Streets","Sham_69","Smiley_Culture","South_London","Kinks","Harry_Wragg","Michael_Caine","Pete_Tong","Oxford_University_Press"]}
