It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since\nequiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360°/4 = 90°). It can also\nbe defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle. A rectangle with four\nsides of equal length is a square. The term '[[wikt:oblong|oblong]]' is\noccasionally used to refer to a non-square rectangle.<ref>http://www.cimt.plymo-\nuth.ac.uk/resources/topics/art002.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.mathsisfun.com/defi-\nnitions/oblong.html Definition of Oblong].
