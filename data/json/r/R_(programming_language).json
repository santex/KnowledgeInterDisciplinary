The R language is widely used among\nstatisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls and\nsurveys of data miners are showing R's popularity has increased substantially in\nrecent years. David Smith (2012); [http://java.sys-\ncon.com/node/2288420 R Tops Data Mining Software Poll], Java Developers Journal,\nMay 31, 2012. Karl Rexer, Heather Allen, & Paul Gearan\n(2011); [http://www.rexeranalytics.com/Data-Miner-Survey-Results-2011.html 2011\nData Miner Survey Summary], presented at Predictive Analytics World, Oct.\n2011. Robert A. Muenchen (2012);\n[http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/ The Popularity of Data Analysis\nSoftware.]\n\nR is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical\nscoping semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers while at\nBell Labs. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the\nUniversity of Auckland, New Zealand, and now, R is developed by the R\nDevelopment Core Team, of which Chambers is a member. R is named partly after\nthe first names of the first two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka),\nand partly as a play on the name of S.\n\nR is a GNU project. The source code for the R software\nenvironment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R. R is freely\navailable under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions\nare provided for various operating systems. R uses a command line interface;\nhowever, several graphical user interfaces are available for use with R.\n","linknr":733,"url":"R_(programming_language)","recorded":1362505108,"links":68,"instances":["computing","computer_science","computer_science","database","mathematics","software","statistical_software","statistician","computer_science","computing","programming_language","programmer","software","text_editor","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","software","software","programming_language","machine_learning","text_editor","text_editor"],"pdf":["http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf","http://www.unt.edu/rss/Teaching-with-R.pdf","http://www.unt.edu/rss/Teaching-with-R.pdf","http://www.nuiton.org/attachments/168/RFromJava.pdf","http://www.nuiton.org/attachments/168/RFromJava.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060721143309/http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf","http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060721143309/http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf","http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/technicalreports/Number1/R_relative_statpack.pdf"],"categories":["R
