{"cursor":"6036","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn molecular biology, a 'reporter gene' (often simply 'reporter') is a gene that\nresearchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in\nbacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters\nbecause the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily\nidentified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes\nare often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by\nor expressed in the cell or organism population.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Reporter_gene","recorded":1362505736,"links":25,"instances":["biology","genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Genetics"],"headings":["Common reporter genes","Transformation and transfection assays","Gene expression assays","Promoter assays","Further uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Reporter_gene.png/295px-Reporter_gene.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transformation","genetics"],["promotor","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["promotor","transcription","cell","transformation"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Gene","Bacteria","Cell_culture","Selectable_markers","DNA_construct","Bacteria","Prokaryote","Plasmid","Green_fluorescent_protein","Cell_(biology)","Luciferase","Luciferin","GUS_reporter_system","Green_fluorescent_protein","Escherichia_coli","Lac_operon","Beta-galactosidase","X-gal","Chloramphenicol_acetyltransferase","Chloramphenicol","LacZ","Beta-galactosidase","Chloramphenicol_acetyltransferase","Chloramphenicol","Phosphotransferase","Kanamycin","Green_fluorescent_protein","Fluorescence_in_the_life_sciences","Transfection","Transformation_(genetics)","Promotor_(biology)","Chloramphenicol","Gene_fusion","Transcription_(genetics)","Messenger_RNA","MRNA","Protein_folding","Two-hybrid_screening","GUS_reporter_system"]}
