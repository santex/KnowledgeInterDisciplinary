Under nitrogen-limiting\nconditions, capable plants form a symbiotic relationship with a host-specific\nstrain of bacteria known as rhizobia. This process has evolved multiple times\nwithin the Fabaceae, as well as in other species found within the Rosid\nclade.\n\nWithin legume nodules, nitrogen gas from the atmosphere is converted into\nammonia, which is then assimilated into amino acids (the building blocks of\nproteins), nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA and RNA as well as the\nimportant energy molecule ATP), and other cellular constituents such as\nvitamins, flavones, and hormones. Their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen makes\nlegumes an ideal agricultural organism as their requirement for nitrogen\nfertilizer is reduced. Indeed high nitrogen content blocks nodule development as\nthere is no benefit for the plant of forming the symbiosis. The energy for\nsplitting the nitrogen gas in the nodule comes from sugar that is translocated\nfrom the leaf (a product of photosynthesis). Malate as a breakdown product of\nsucrose is the direct carbon source for the bacteroid. Nitrogen fixation in the\nnodule is very oxygen sensitive. Legume nodules harbor an iron containing\nprotein called leghaemoglobin, closely related to animal myoglobin, to\nfacilitate the conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonia.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Root_nodules","recorded":1362512518,"links":27,"instances":["botany","botany"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/2y6pbrdwqtegml7c/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/2y6pbrdwqtegml7c/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/v82q0x2475624q10/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/v82q0x2475624q10/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Plant roots","Plant organogenesis","Legumes","Nitrogen metabolism","Symbiosis","Oligotrophs"],"headings":["Classification","Nodulation","Connection to root structure","In other species","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Root-nodule01.jpg/300px-Root-nodule01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Medicago_italica_root_nodules_2.JPG/220px-Medicago_italica_root_nodules_2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Indeterminate_Nodule_Zones_Diagram.svg/220px-Indeterminate_Nodule_Zones_Diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/NitrogenFixingNodulesOnClover.jpg/200px-NitrogenFixingNodulesOnClover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/A_sectioned_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG/220px-A_sectioned_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/An_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG/220px-An_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","botany"],["cortex","botany"]],"members":["cortex","epidermis"],"related":["Fabaceae","Symbiotic","Nitrogen_fixation","Bacterium","Nitrogen","Rhizobia","Rosid","Ammonia","Amino_acids","Nucleotides","Vitamin","Flavone","Plant_hormones","Nitrogen_fixation","Leghaemoglobin","Legume","Meristem","Amyloplast","Vacuole","Nitrogen_fixation","Leghemoglobin","Flavonoid","Nod_factor","Cell_division","Root_hair","Epidermis_(botany)","Cortex_(botany)","Nitrogen_fixation","ENOD40","Fabaceae","Abscisic_acid","Actinobacteria","Cucurbitales","Coriariaceae","Datiscaceae","Fagales","Betulaceae","Casuarinaceae","Myricaceae","Rosales","Rhamnaceae","Elaeagnaceae","Rosaceae","Fungi","Ectomycorrhiza","Lodgepole_pine","Nitrogen_fixation","Bacteria","Nitrogen"]}
