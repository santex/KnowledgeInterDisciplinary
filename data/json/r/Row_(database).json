{"cursor":"2335","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the context of a relational database, a 'row'âalso called a '[[Record\n(computer science)|record]]' or '[[tuple]]'ârepresents a single, implicitly\nstructured data item in a table. In simple terms, a database table can be\nthought of as consisting of rows and columns or fields. Each row in a table\nrepresents a set of related data, and every row in the table has the same\nstructure.\n\nFor example, in a table that represents companies, each row would represent a\nsingle company. Columns might represent things like company name, company street\naddress, whether the company is publicly held, its VAT number, etc.. In a table\nthat represents the association of employees with departments, each row would\nassociate one employee with one department.\n\nIn a less formal usage, e.g. for a database which is not formally relational, a\nrecord is equivalent to a row as described above, but is not usually referred\nto as a row.\n\nThe implicit structure of a row, and the meaning of the data values in a row,\nrequires that the row be understood as providing a succession of data values,\none in each column of the table. The row is then interpreted as a relvar\ncomposed of a set of tuples, with each tuple consisting of the two items: the\nname of the relevant column and the value this row provides for that column.\n\nEach column expects a data value of a particular type. For example, one\ncolumn might require a unique identifier, another might require text\nrepresenting a person's name, another might require an integer representing\nhourly pay in cents.\n\n    Column 1  Column 2   Row 1  Row\n1, Column 1  Row 1, Column 2   Row 2  Row 2, Column 1  Row\n2, Column 2   Row 3  Row 3, Column 1  Row 3, Column 2 \n","linknr":154,"url":"Row_(database)","recorded":1362543438,"links":19,"instances":["computer_science","currency","database","database"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data modeling","Relational model"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["table","database"],["column","database"],["cent","currency"],["column","database"],["record","computer_science"]],"members":["record","cent","table","column"],"related":["Relational_database","Data","Table_(database)","Column_(database)","Value_added_tax_identification_number","Relvar","Tuple","Datatype","Identifier","Cent_(currency)","Column_(database)","Record_(computer_science)"]}
