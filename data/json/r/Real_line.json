That is, the real line is the set of all real numbers,\nviewed as a geometric space, namely the Euclidean space of dimension one. It can\nbe thought of as a vector space (or affine space), a metric space, a topological\nspace, a measure space, or a linear continuum.\n\nJust like the set of real numbers, the real line is usually denoted by the\nsymbol (or alternatively,  \\mathbb{R} , the letter âRâ in\nblackboard bold). However, it is sometimes denoted in order to emphasize its\nrole as the first Euclidean space.\n\nThis article focuses on the aspects of as a geometric space in topology,\ngeometry, and real analysis. The real numbers also play an important role in\nalgebra as a field, but in this context is rarely referred to as a line.
