For example, the common rock, granite, is a combination\nof the quartz, feldspar and biotite minerals. The Earth's outer solid layer, the\nlithosphere, is made of rock.\n\nRocks have been used by mankind through out history. From the Stone Age rocks\nhave been used for tools. The minerals and metals we find in rocks have been\nessential to human civilization.\n\nThree major groups of rocks are defined: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.\nThe scientific study of rocks is called petrology, which is an essential\ncomponent of geology.\n","linknr":479,"url":"rocks","recorded":1362579282,"links":120,"instances":["geology","grain_size","economics","geology","chemistry","geology","geology","geology","geology","materials","geology","composite","earth_sciences"],"pdf":["https://www.elaw.org/files/mining-eia-guidebook/Chapter1.pdf","https://www.elaw.org/files/mining-eia-guidebook/Chapter1.pdf"],"categories":["Petrology","Rocks|","Stone|","Materials"],"headings":["Classification","Human
