A disease is said to be 'incurable' if there is always a\nchance of the patient relapsing, no matter how long the patient has been in\nremission.\n\nThe proportion of people with a disease that are cured by a given treatment,\ncalled the 'cure fraction' or 'cure rate', is determined by comparing disease-\nfree survival of treated people against a matched control group that never had\nthe disease.\n\nInherent in the idea of a cure is the permanent end to the specific instance of\nthe disease. {{cite news |title=Nearing a Cancer Cure? |publisher=Harvard\nHealth Commentaries. |date=21 August 2006}} [http://www.kidshealth.or-\ng/teen/your_body/medical_care/curable.html What's the Difference Between a\nTreatment and a Cure?] When a person has the common cold, and then\nrecovers from it, the person is said to be cured, even though the person might\nsomeday catch another cold.
