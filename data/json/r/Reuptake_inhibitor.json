{"cursor":"20545","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used as an antidepressant.]]\n\nA 'reuptake inhibitor' ('RI'), also known as a 'transporter blocker', is a drug\nthat inhibits the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a\nneurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron, leading to an\nincrease in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and\ntherefore an increase in neurotransmission. Various drugs utilize reuptake\ninhibition to exert their psychological and physiological effects, including\nmany antidepressants and psychostimulants.\n\nMost known reuptake inhibitors affect the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin,\nnorepinephrine (and epinephrine), and dopamine.\nHowever there are also a number of pharmaceuticals and research chemicals that\nact as reuptake inhibitors for other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine,\nadenosine, choline (the precursor of\nacetylcholine), and the endocannabinoids, among others.\n","linknr":607,"url":"Reuptake_inhibitor","recorded":1362668430,"links":18,"instances":["biology_and_chemistry","biochemistry","molecular","chemistry","pharmacology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology"],"headings":["Mechanism
