In some more advanced programs\nsuch as graphic processing, undo will negate the last command done to the file\nbeing edited.\n\nThe opposite of undo is 'redo'. The redo command reverses the undo or advances\nthe buffer to a more current state.\n\nIn most Windows applications, the Undo command is activated by pressing the\nCtrl+Z or Alt+Backspace keybindings. In virtually all Macintosh applications,\nthe Undo command is activated by pressing Command-Z. The common command for Redo\non Microsoft Windows systems is Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z.
