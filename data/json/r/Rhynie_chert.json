It is exposed near\nthe village of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland; a second unit, the 'Windyfield\nchert', is located some 700 m away. The Rhynie chert contains exceptionally\npreserved plant, fungus, lichen and animal material preserved in place by an\noverlying volcanic deposit. The bulk of the fossil bed consists of primitive\nplants (which had water-conducting cells and sporangia, but no true leaves),\nalong with arthropods, lichens, algae and fungi.\n\nThis fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons. First, the age of the site\n(Pragian, Early Devonian, formed about )\nplaces it at an early stage in the colonisation of land. Second, these cherts\nare famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with\nindividual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. Stomata have been\ncounted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material, and the breathing\napparatus of trigonotarbids-of the class Arachnida-(known as book lungs) can be\nseen in cross-sections. Fungal hyphae can be seen entering plant material,\nacting as decomposers and mycorrhizal symbionts.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Rhynie_chert","recorded":1362372788,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1910 in science","1910 in Scotland","Geology of Scotland","Protected areas of Aberdeenshire","Paleontological sites of Europe","Chert","Devonian","Lagerstätten","Environment of Aberdeenshire"],"headings":["Location","History of research","Conditions of formation","Preservation","Interactions","See also","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Rhynie_chert.jpg/300px-Rhynie_chert.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Rhynie_chert_with_Rhynia_1.png/220px-Rhynie_chert_with_Rhynia_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Rhynia_stem.jpg/220px-Rhynia_stem.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Rhynie_chert_with_Horneophyton_1.png/220px-Rhynie_chert_with_Horneophyton_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cooksonia.png/60px-Cooksonia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Scotland","Devonian","Sedimentary_rock","Fossil","Lagerstätte","Rhynie,_Aberdeenshire","Scotland","Volcanic_rock","Plant","Xylem","Spores","Leaf","Arthropod","Pragian","Devonian","Chert","Ultrastructure","Stomata","Lignin","Trigonotarbid","Arachnida","Book_lung","Hypha","Mycorrhiza","Symbiosis","Overburden","Rhynie,_Aberdeenshire","Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest","Strike_and_dip","Münster_school","Aberdeen_University","Drill_core","Petrifaction","Ecosystem","Tuff","Graben","Yellowstone","Hydrothermal_vent","Breccia","Geyserite","Permineralisation","Rhizoid","Rhizome","Plant_litter","Parenchyma","Triassic","Stomata","Paleobotanist","Sporangia","Nematophytes","Crustacean","Euthycarcinoid","Springtail","Opiliones","Acari","Trigonotarbid","Insect","Chytridiomycetes","Ascomycetes","Cyanobacteria","Oscillatoriales","Biomarker","Microbial_mat","Gloeocapsa","Chroococcidiopsis","Hypertrophy","Coprolite","Mycorrhizae","Evolutionary_history_of_plants","Geology_of_Scotland"]}
