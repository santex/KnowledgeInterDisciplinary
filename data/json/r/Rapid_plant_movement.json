For example, the Venus Flytrap\ncloses its trap in about 100 milliseconds. Forterre, Y., J.M. Skotheim, J.\nDumais & L. Mahadevan 2005. Nature '433': 421â425.  The Dogwood\nBunchberry's flower opens its petals and fires pollen in less than 0.5\nmilliseconds. The record is currently held by the White Mulberry tree, with\nflower movement taking 25 Î¼s, moving petals to velocities in excess of half the\nspeed of soundânear the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants.
