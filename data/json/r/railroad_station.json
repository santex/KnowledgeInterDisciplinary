It generally consists of a platform next to the track and a station\nbuilding (depot) providing related services such as ticket sales and waiting\nrooms. If a station is on a single track main line, it often has a passing loop\nto facilitate the traffic. The smallest stations are most often referred to as\n'stops' or, in some parts of the world, as 'halts' (flag stops).\n\nStations may be at ground level, underground, or elevated. Connections may be\navailable to intersecting rail lines or other transport modes such as buses,\ntrams or other rapid transit systems.\n\n built during the British Raj with a mixture of western and eastern\n architecture.]]\n",
