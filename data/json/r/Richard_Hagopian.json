{"cursor":"3969","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Richard Avedis Hagopian' (born 3 April 1937) is an American Oriental-style\n[[oud]] player and traditional Armenian musician.\n\nHagopian was born in Fowler, California. He has been a musician since childhood,\nlearning to play the violin and clarinet at nine years old. He started playing\nthe oud at age of 11. At first he was self taught then by invitation studied\nEastern (Ottoman Classical) music theory and oud under the Armenian kanun player\nKanuni Garbis Bakirgian. Hagopian also took lessons by correspondence from\nlegendary blind Armenian oudist Udi Hrant Kenkulian of Istanbul, who later in\n1969 gave him the title of \"Udi\" (oud master), being one of the few to receive\nthis title.\n\nHagopian gained fame in the 1960s and 70s with the Kef Time Band. According to\nthe liner notes of the 1968 LP Kef Time Las Vegas, the Kef Time Band was formed\noriginally as the band for a Las Vegas show called the Cleopatra Revue, which\nran at the Flamingo Hotel from 1963-1968. During this time the leader of the\nCleopatra Revue band, Armenian-American [[dumbeg]] player Buddy Sarkissian, met\nHagopian and immediately hired him after hearing him play the oud and sing. This\nwas the beginning of the Kef Time Band's career; they would go on to become the\nmost famous band playing the \"kef\" style of dance music popular among the Armenian-\nAmerican community.\n\nHagopian has performed throughout the United States and taught a master class at\nthe Manhattan School of Music, as well as teaching as artist-in-residence at\nCalifornia State University.\n\nHagopian for over 30 has years played annually at \"Kef Time\" events drawing\ntypically 500-1000 people at dances (\"Kefs\") in Cape Cod, Hartford, and\nDetroit. His followers have demonstrated a deep passion for his unique style\nand authenticity, and overall ability to entertain through his Oud mastery and\nvocal charm.\n\nHe currently claims to play over 50 instruments.\n\nHis son is the violinist Harold Hagopian, also a music producer who runs the\nsmall independent label Traditional Crossroads.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Richard_Hagopian","recorded":1375058538,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Oud","/wiki/Music_of_Armenia","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Fowler,_California","/wiki/Violin","/wiki/Clarinet","/w/index.php?title=Kanuni_Garbis_Bakirgian&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Udi_Hrant_Kenkulian","/w/index.php?title=Kef_Time_Band&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Flamingo_Hotel","/wiki/Dumbeg","/wiki/Armenian-American","/wiki/Manhattan_School_of_Music","/wiki/California_State_University","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Harold_Hagopian","#Discography","#LP","#CD","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/fellows/fellow.php?id=1989_04","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit&section=5","http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=2287/","/wiki/Smithsonian_Folkways","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/38969383","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&oldid=542140722","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1937_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Fresno_County,_California","/wiki/Category:American_oud_players","/wiki/Category:American_musicians_of_Armenian_descent","/wiki/Category:Manhattan_School_of_Music_faculty","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Hagopian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Richard+Hagopian","/wiki/Richard_Hagopian","/wiki/Talk:Richard_Hagopian","#","/wiki/Richard_Hagopian","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Richard_Hagopian","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Richard_Hagopian","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&oldid=542140722","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7326203","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Richard_Hagopian&id=542140722","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Richard+Hagopian","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Richard+Hagopian&oldid=542140722&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Hagopian&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7326203#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hagopian","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22w
