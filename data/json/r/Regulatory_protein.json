For information on therapeutic regulation of\n:gene expression, see therapeutic gene modulation. For vocabulary, see\n:[[Glossary of gene expression terms]]\n\n\n\n'Regulation of gene expression' includes a wide range of mechanisms that are\nused by cells to increase or decrease the production of specific gene products\n(protein or RNA), and is informally termed gene regulation. Sophisticated\nprograms of gene expression are widely used in biology, for example to trigger\ndevelopmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food\nsources. Virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated, from\ntranscriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational\nmodification of a protein.\n\nGene regulation is essential for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it\nincreases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell\nto express protein when needed. Although as early as 1951 Barbara McClintock\nshowed interaction between two genetic loci, Activator (Ac) and Dissociator\n(Ds), in the color formation of maize seeds, the first discovery of a gene\nregulation system is widely considered to be the identification in 1961 of the\nlac operon, discovered by Jacques Monod, in which some enzymes involved in\nlactose metabolism are expressed by the genome of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]\nonly in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose.\n\nFurthermore, in multicellular organisms, gene regulation drives the processes of\ncellular differentiation and morphogenesis, leading to the creation of different\ncell types that possess different gene expression profiles, and hence produce\ndifferent proteins/have different ultrastructures that suit them to their\nfunctions (though they all possess the genotype, which follows the same genome\nsequence).\n","linknr":408,"url":"Regulatory_protein","recorded":1362572531,"links":32,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/53/7/1684.full.pdf","http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/53/7/1684.full.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression","DNA","RNA","Posttranslational modification"],"headings":["Regulated stages of gene expression","Modification of DNA","Regulation of transcription","Post-transcriptional regulation","Regulation of translation","Examples of gene regulation","Circuitry","Methods","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Gene_expression_control.png/220px-Gene_expression_control.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Lac_Operon.svg/250px-Lac_Operon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["enhancer","genetics"]],"members":["promoter","translation","transcription","enhancer"],"related":["Therapeutic_gene_modulation","Gene_product","Protein","RNA","Gene_expression","Transcriptional_regulation","RNA_processing","Post-translational_modification","Viruses","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Organism","Barbara_McClintock","Lac_operon","Jacques_Monod","Lactose","Cellular_differentiation","Morphogenesis","Genome","Transcription_(genetics)","Post-translational_modification","Epigenome","Transcription_(genetics)","Post-transcriptional_modification","Translation_(genetics)","Histone","DNA_methylation","Non-coding_RNA","DNA-binding_protein","Epigenetic_regulation","Nucleosome","Supercoiling","Phosphorylation","Methylation","DNA_methylation","CpG_island","Pyrosequencing","Biotage","Sequenom","Histone_acetylation","Histone_acetyltransferase","CREB-binding_protein","Gene_silencing","RNA_polymerase","Promoter_(biology)","Sigma_factor","Prokaryotic_transcription","Promoter_(biology)","Ribozyme","Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition","Heat_shock_protein","Lac_operon","Lambda_phage","HIV","Hox_gene","Sonic_hedgehog","Zone_of_polarizing_activity","Reaction-diffusion_system","Up-regulation","Homeostasis","Down-regulation","Neurotransmitter","Hormone","Tachyphylaxis","QPCR","DNA_microarray","ChIP-chip","RNA_Polymerase_II","Histone_3","Trithorax-group_protein","Polycomb-group_protein","Epistatic","Synthetic_genetic_array","Nuclear_run-on","Thiol","Radioactivity_in_biology","In_vivo","Ribonucleoprotein_Particle","RIP-Chip","DCP2","Ribosome","Polysome","Mass_spectrometry","QPCR","DNA_microarray","Actinomycin_D","Î‘-amanitin","Cycloheximide","Enhancer_(genetics)","Artificial_transcription_factor","Cellular_model","Conserved_non-coding_sequence","Spatiotemporal_gene_expression"]}
