{"cursor":"4944","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Remember Baker' (June 1737 â August 22, 1775) was a member of the Green\nMountain Boys. He was born in Roxbury, Connecticut (then part of Woodbury) and\ndied in Quebec. The son of Remember Baker and Tamar Warner, he was a first\ncousin of Ethan Allen and Seth Warner.\n\nRemember Baker, Jr. was described by a cousin as a tough, redheaded, freckle-\nfaced young giant. He enlisted as a private in a company of provincial troops in\n1755. In 1757, he was stationed at Fort William Henry, at the head of Lake\nGeorge, and during that year participated in battles which went badly for the\nprovincial troops.\n\nIn 1758, he enlisted a second time in the expedition of General Abercrombie in\nhis attempted invasion of Canada, then held by the French. He was part of a band\nof 100 men under command of Major Putnam and accompanied by Lord Howe that went\non a scouting expedition. They were surprised by a party of 500 of the enemy and\nLord Howe was killed. Putnam and Baker and their men cut their way through the\nFrench ranks, charged them in the rear, and after being reinforced killed 300 of\nthe enemy and captured 143 prisoners. Baker received honorable mention in the\nreport of the commanding general. He remained in the service until the close of\nthe year 1759.\n\nHe and Desire Hurlbut were married in Roxbury on April 3, 1760. In 1764,\nRemember, Desire and their small son Ozi moved to Arlington, now in Vermont, and\nbuilt a grist mill. This was in response to an offer of from the town to anyone\nwho would start a mill there. This mill burned down in 1789; a mill built in the\n1790s is still there. Rememberâs cousins Ethan Allen and Ira Allen also settled\nin Arlington. Remember Baker was the first town clerk of Arlington.\n\nThe Bakers and the Allens were involved in the controversy over the title of the\nsettlers of Vermont to their land, and Baker became a captain in one of the\ncompanies of the Green Mountain Boys. Remember is said to have been more hot\nheaded than the Allens and Seth Warner. Following attacks on those loyal to New\nYork, the Governor of New York offered an award for the capture of Ethan Allen,\nRemember Baker, and others. On March 21, 1771, men from New York under the\nleadership of Captain John Munro attacked Baker's mill and took Baker away as a\nprisoner. In the fight, Baker lost a thumb and his wife injured her arm jumping\nout of a window. She never fully recovered the use of that arm. Remember was\ntaken across the New York border. The Green Mountain Boys rescued Baker and\nreturned him to his family.\n\nBy May, 1773, Ira Allen and Remember Baker, as the Allen and Baker Land Co.,\nowned some of virgin land along the Winooski River, near Burlington, Vermont.\nThat year there were no roads north of Castleton, and Baker and Allen cut a\nroad through the forest for seventy miles so that supplies could be brought in\nfrom Lake Champlain. In the summer, they settled on their land and built a log\nhouse across the river from Burlington. Ira Allen was unmarried and lived with\nthe Bakers.\n\nRemember Baker joined Ethan Allen for the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775.\nHe and Seth Warner met at Crown Point, New York and captured the garrison there.\nFollowing that, he served as a scout for General Phillip Schuyler in the area\naround St. John's, where the English troops and Native Americans were camped.\n\nAround August 19, 1775, Baker left Ticonderoga for another scouting expedition\nalong the Richelieu River. On August 22, he was shot and killed by Indians who\nhad taken his boat. The Indians plundered the body, cut off Baker's head, raised\nit upon a pole and carried it in triumph to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, which\nhorrified the British officers there. They bought it from the Indians and buried\nit, and also sent some men to the point to bury the body.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Remember_Baker","recorded":1374858607,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Green_Mountain_Boys","/wiki/Roxbury,_Connecticut","/wiki/Quebec","/wiki/Ethan_Allen","/wiki/Seth_Warner","/wiki/Red_hair","/wiki/Freckle","/wiki/Fort_William_Henry","/wiki/Lake_George_(New_York)","/wiki/James_Abercrombie_(general)","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/George_Howe,_3rd_Viscount_Howe","/wiki/Arlington,_Vermont","/wiki/Ethan_Allen","/wiki/Ira_Allen","/wiki/Green_Mountain_Boys","/wiki/Seth_Warner","/wiki/John_Munro_(loyalist)","/wiki/Winooski_River","/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont","/wiki/Castleton,_Vermont","/wiki/Lake_Champlain","/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga","/wiki/Crown_Point,_New_York","/wiki/Phillip_Schuyler","/wiki/Richelieu_River","/wiki/Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0595329403","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/130430692","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&oldid=526819619","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1737_births","/wiki/Category:1775_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Roxbury,_Connecticut","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_English_descent","/wiki/Category:Connecticut_colonial_people","/wiki/Category:Vermont_militiamen_in_the_American_Revolution","/wiki/Category:People_of_Vermont_in_the_American_Revolution","/wiki/Category:People_of_pre-statehood_Vermont","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Remember+Baker&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Remember+Baker","/wiki/Remember_Baker","/wiki/Talk:Remember_Baker","#","/wiki/Remember_Baker","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Remember_Baker","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Remember_Baker","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&oldid=526819619","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7311644","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Remember_Baker&id=526819619","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Remember+Baker","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Remember+Baker&oldid=526819619&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Remember_Baker&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7311644#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_Baker","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["general","loyalist","new_york"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1737
