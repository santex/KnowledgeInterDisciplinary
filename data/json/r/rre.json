The earlier research and\ndevelopment work of TRE and RRDE on radar, solid state physics, electronics, and\ncomputer hardware and software was continued in the merged establishment, and\nthe overall scope was extended to include cryogenics and other topics. Infrared\ndetection for guided missiles and heat sensing devices was a major defence\napplication.\n","title":"Royal Radar Establishment","headings":["Administrative history","The Physics Division -- some of the staff and their work","Radar, Guided weapons and Engineering Divisions","External links","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Telecommunications_Research_Establishment","2: Solid_state_physics","2: Heriot-Watt_University","2: DERA","2: Cyril_Hilsum","2: Plessey","2: TRE","1: Malvern,_Worcestershire","1: Worcestershire","1: Radar","1: Electronics","1: Computer","1: Cryogenics","1: Infrared_homing","1: Guided_missiles","1: Bawdsey","1: Felixstowe","1: Dundee","1: Swanage","1: History_of_radar","1: Ministry_of_Supply","1: Ministry_of_Aviation","1: Ministry_of_Technology","1: Signals_Research_and_Development_Establishment","1: Royal_Signals_and_Radar_Establishment","1: Defence_Research_Agency","1: Defence_Evaluation_and_Research_Agency","1: Dstl","1: Defence_Science_and_Technology_Laboratory","1: QinetiQ","1: Radio_navigation","1: Thermodynamics","1: Semiconductors","1: MIT","1: C._Thomas_Elliott","1: SPRITE_infrared_detector","1: Indium_antimonide","1: University_of_Essex","1: Liquid_crystal","1: Fellow_of_the_Royal_Academy_of_Engineering","1: Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","1: Max_Born_prize","1: Faraday_medal","1: Surface_acoustic_wave","1: Rayleigh_Medal","1: Duddell_Medal_and_Prize","1: Cybernetics","1: Philip_Woodward","1: Coral_66","1: Sir_John_Chisholm","1: Royal_Academy_of_Engineering","1: Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","1: Michael_P_Barnett","1: J._B._Gunn","1: Gunn_diode","1: Dennis_William_Sciama","1: George_William_Gray","1: University_of_Hull","1: Liquid_crystals","1: Liquid_crystal_display","1: Queen's_Award_for_Technological_Achievement","1: Decca_Radar","1: Mullard","1: Geoffrey_Dummer","1: Royal_Aeronautical_Society","1: IEEE_Cledo_Brunetti_Award","1: IEEE","1: The_National_Archives"]}
