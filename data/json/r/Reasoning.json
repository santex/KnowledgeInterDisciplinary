It is closely associated with such\ncharacteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language,\nmathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a definitive\ncharacteristic of human nature. Alasdair MacIntyre, Dependent Rational\nAnimals: Why Human Beings Need the Virtues, Peru, Illinois: 2002. The\nconcept of reason is sometimes referred to as rationality and sometimes as\n'discursive reason', in opposition to intuitive reason. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/intuitive%20reason Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition\nof intuitive reason]\n\nReason or \"reasoning\" is associated with thinking, cognition, and intellect.\nReason, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking comes from\none idea to a related idea. For example, it is the means by which rational\nbeings understand themselves to think about cause and effect, truth and\nfalsehood, and what is good or bad.\n\nIn contrast to reason as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration which\nexplains or justifies some event, phenomenon or behaviour. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/reason Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary\ndefinition of reason The ways in which human beings reason through\nargument are the subject of inquiries in the field of logic.\n\nReason is closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change\nbeliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the\ncapacity for freedom and self-determination.

The field of\nautomated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled\ncomputationally.
