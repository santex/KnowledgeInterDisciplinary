Its primary function is to\nfilter the blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red\nblood cells.\n\nThe spleen is made of red pulp and white pulp, separated by the marginal zone;\n76-79% of a normal spleen is red pulp. Unlike white\npulp, which mainly contains lymphocytes such as T cells, red pulp is made up of\nseveral different types of blood cells, including platelets, granulocytes, red\nblood cells, and plasma.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Red_pulp","recorded":1362512975,"links":17,"instances":["blood_vessel","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spleen (anatomy)"],"headings":["Sinusoids","Cells found in red pulp","Diseases","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Gray1191.png/250px-Gray1191.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Illu_spleen.jpg/250px-Illu_spleen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sinusoid","blood_vessel"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["sinusoid","denaturation"],"related":["Spleen","Spleen","Cords_of_Billroth","Sinusoid_(blood_vessel)","Antigens","White_pulp","Marginal_zone","Lymphocytes","T_cell","Platelet","Granulocyte","Red_blood_cell","Blood_plasma","Trabecular_veins","Endothelium","Macrophage","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Reticular_fiber","Splenic_trabeculae","Blood","White_corpuscles","Malpighian_corpuscle","Macrophage","Cell_nucleus","Red-blood_corpuscles","Lymphoid_leukemia","Myeloid_leukemia"]}
