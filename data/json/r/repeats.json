There are two types of reruns&mdash;those that occur during a hiatus,\nand those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the\ncase with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (e.g.\nin the afternoon).\n\nIn the UK, the word \"repeat\" refers only to a single episode; \"rerun\" or\n\"rerunning\" is the preferred term for an entire series/season. \"Repeat\" is also\nused to refer to programs shown less than a week after the original broadcast,\nbefore the next episode of the series.\n\nThe term \"rerun\" can also be used in some respects as a synonym for [[reprint]],\nthe equivalent term for print items; this is especially true for print items\nthat are part of ongoing series (such as comic strips; [[Peanuts]], for\ninstance, has been in reruns since the retirement and death of creator Charles\nM. Schulz).\n",
