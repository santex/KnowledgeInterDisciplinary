The length of the\nresistin pre-peptide in human is 108 amino acid residues and in the mouse and\nrat it is 114 aa; the molecular weight is ~12.5 kDa. Resistin is a cytokine\nwhose physiologic role has been the subject of much controversy regarding its\ninvolvement with obesity and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\nResistin has been shown to cause \"high levels of 'bad' cholesterol (low-density\nlipoprotein or LDL), increasing the risk of heart disease [...] resistin\nincreases the production of LDL in human liver cells and also degrades LDL\nreceptors in the liver. As a result, the liver is less able to clear 'bad'\ncholesterol from the body. Resistin accelerates the accumulation of LDL in\narteries, increasing the risk of heart disease. [...] resistin adversely impacts\nthe effects of statins, the main cholesterol-reducing drug used in the treatment\nand prevention of cardiovascular disease.\" \n","linknr":667,"url":"Resistin","recorded":1362485049,"links":24,"instances":["biology","observation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tissues","Endocrinology","Obesity"],"headings":["Discovery","Inflammation","Obesity and insulin resistance","Structure","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Grrr.png/250px-Grrr.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/PBB_GE_RETN_220570_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_RETN_220570_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["discovery","observation"],["energy_balance","biology"]],"members":["energy_balance","discovery"],"related":["Cysteine","Protein","Gene","Primates","Immune","Epithelial","Adipose_tissue","Peptide","Amino_acid","Molecular_weight","KDa","Cytokine","Obesity","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Cholesterol","Liver","Arteries","Statins","Cardiovascular","Mitchell_Lazar","University_of_Pennsylvania","Insulin","Endocrine","Insulin_resistance","Blood_serum","Rats","Mice","Inflammation","Homeostasis","Innate_immune_response","Infection","Irritation","Leukocyte","Neutrophils","Mast_cells","Biogenic","Histamine","Prostaglandin","Cytokines","Interleukin-1","Interleukin-6","TNF-α","NF-κB","Adhesion","ICAM1","Blood_vessel","VCAM1","CCL2","Chemotactic","Leukocyte","Microbial","Lipopolysaccharide","Chronic_inflammation","Kidney_disease","Diseases","Hypothesized","Metabolism","Blood_serum","Adiposity","Medical","Central_obesity","Insulin_resistance","Insulin_resistance","Evidence","Theory","Scientific_community","Adiposity","Obesity","Theory","Theory","Obesity","Scientists","Theory","Obesity","Synchrony","Methodology","Discovery_(observation)","Obesity","Competitive","Debate","Evidence","Energy_balance_(biology)","Inflammation","Infection"]}
