      "text" : "\nIn business, 'revenue' or 'turnover' is income that a company receives from its\nnormal business activities, usually from the sale of goods and services to\ncustomers. In many countries, such as the United Kingdom, revenue is referred to\nas 'turnover'. Some companies receive revenue from interest, royalties, or other\nfees.<ref> This definition is based on IAS 18.</ref> Revenue may refer to\nbusiness income in general, or it may refer to the amount, in a monetary unit,\nreceived during a period of time, as in \"Last year, Company X had revenue of $42\nmillion.\" Profits or net income generally imply total revenue minus total\nexpenses in a given period. In accounting, revenue is often referred to as the\n\"top line\" due to its position on the income statement at the very top. This is\nto be contrasted with the \"bottom line\" which denotes net income.<ref>Williams,\np.51</ref>\n\nFor non-profit organizations, annual revenue may be referred to as 'gross receipts'.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990-\nez.pdf 2006 Instructions for Form 990 and Form 990-EZ], US Department of the\nTreasury, p. 22</ref> This revenue includes donations from individuals and\ncorporations, support from government agencies, income from activities related\nto the organization's mission, and income from fundraising activities,\nmembership dues, and financial investments such as stock shares in companies.\n\nIn general usage, revenue is income received by an organization in the form of\ncash or cash equivalents. Sales revenue or revenues is income received from\nselling goods or services over a period of time. Tax revenue is income that a\ngovernment receives from taxpayers.\n\nIn more formal usage, revenue is a calculation or estimation of periodic income\nbased on a particular standard accounting practice or the rules established by a\ngovernment or government agency. Two common accounting methods, cash basis\naccounting and accrual basis accounting, do not use the same process for\nmeasuring revenue. Corporations that offer shares for sale to the public are\nusually required by law to report revenue based on generally accepted accounting\nprinciples or International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nIn a double-entry bookkeeping system, revenue accounts are general ledger\naccounts that are summarized periodically under the heading Revenue or Revenues\non an income statement. Revenue account names describe the type of revenue,\nsuch as \"Repair service revenue\", \"Rent revenue earned\" or\n\"Sales\".<ref>Williams, p. 196</ref>\n",
