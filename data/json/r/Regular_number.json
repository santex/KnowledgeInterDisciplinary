Inspired by similar diagrams by Erkki Kurenniemi in\n [http://www.beige.org/projects/dimi/CSDL2.pdf \"Chords, scales, and divisor\n lattices\"]. ]]\n\n'Regular numbers' are numbers that evenly divide powers of 60. As an example,\n60 2 = 3600 = 48 × 75, so both 48\nand 75 are divisors of a power of 60. Thus, they are also regular numbers.\n\nThe numbers that evenly divide the powers of 60 arise in several areas of\nmathematics and its applications, and have different names coming from these\ndifferent areas of study.\n\n* In number theory, these numbers are called '5-smooth', because they can be\n  characterized as having only 2, 3, or 5 as prime factors. This is a specific\n  case of the more general k-smooth numbers, i.e., a set of numbers that have no\n  prime factor greater than k.\n* In the study of Babylonian mathematics, the divisors of powers of 60 are\n  called 'regular numbers' or 'regular sexagesimal numbers', and are of great\n  importance due to the sexagesimal number system used by the Babylonians.\n* In music theory, regular numbers occur in the ratios of tones in just\n  intonation, also called 5-limit tuning for this reason.\n* In computer science, regular numbers are often called 'Hamming numbers', after\n  Richard Hamming, who proposed the problem of finding computer algorithms for\n  generating these numbers in order.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Regular_number","recorded":1362672083,"links":19,"instances":["electrical_engineering","programming_language","plato","music","music","music","computer_programming"],"pdf":["http://www.beige.org/projects/dimi/CSDL2.pdf","http://www.terraworld.net/c-jasmussen/thesis_asmussen.pdf","http://www.terraworld.net/c-jasmussen/thesis_asmussen.pdf"],"categories":["Babylonian mathematics","Integer sequences","Functional programming","Mathematics of music"],"headings":["Number theory","Babylonian mathematics","Music theory","Algorithms","Other applications","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Regular_divisibility_lattice.svg/360px-Regular_divisibility_lattice.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/8/bb82cd8f075a5884a9d8d3d04a3416b3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/f/31f631503f2b844c8baa173dab5ccf01.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/c/c1ce8d35ea788694bc1a2c166cff4240.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/4/5d40277275ed075c4077ec747e3ffc46.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/e/2be9da1dfe8c39f5acd4ad1ac201790f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60.svg/200px-Lattice_of_the_divisibility_of_60.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["limit","music"],["pitch","music"],["limit","music"],["interval","music"],["generator","computer_programming"],["python","programming_language"],["signal","electrical_engineering"],["the_republic","plato"]],"members":["signal","python","the_republic","pitch","limit","interval","generator"],"related":["Divisibility","Logarithmic_scale","Number_theory","Prime_factor","Smooth_number","Babylonian_mathematics","Sexagesimal","Music_theory","Just_intonation","Limit_(music)","Computer_science","Richard_Hamming","Algorithm","Integer","Smooth_number","Prime_factor","Tetrahedron","Volume","Big_O_notation","Srinivasa_Ramanujan","G._H._Hardy","Sexagesimal","Multiplicative_inverse","Cuneiform_script","Clay_tablet","Plimpton_322","Otto_E._Neugebauer","Pythagorean_triple","Plimpton_322","Music_theory","Just_intonation","Diatonic_scale","Pitch_(music)","Octave","Harmonic","Fundamental_frequency","Limit_(music)","Interval_(music)","Euler","Tonnetz","Regular_grid","Consonance_and_dissonance","Tonnetz","Equal_temperament","Størmer's_theorem","Superparticular_number","Octave","Perfect_fifth","Perfect_fourth","Just_major_third","Just_minor_third","Just_major_tone","Just_minor_tone","Just_diatonic_semitone","Just_chromatic_semitone","Syntonic_comma","Edsger_Dijkstra","Merge_algorithm","Lazy_evaluation","Functional_programming_language","Imperative_programming_language","Generator_(computer_programming)","Python_(programming_language)","Seleucid","Unimodular_lattice","Smooth_number","Fast_Fourier_transform","Signal_(electrical_engineering)","Plato","The_Republic_(Plato)","American_Mathematical_Monthly","American_Mathematical_Monthly"]}
