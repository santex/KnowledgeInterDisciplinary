It was founded by Reverend David Williams in\n1790 and has received bequests and donations, including royal patronage, ever\nsince. Williams was inspired to set up the Fund by the death in debtor's prison\nof a translator of Plato's dialogues, Floyer Sydenham.\n\nThe Royal Literary Fund has given assistance to many distinguished writers over\nits history, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Samuel Rousseau, FranÃ§ois-RenÃ©\nde Chateaubriand, Thomas Love Peacock, James Hogg, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Hood,\nRichard Jefferies, Joseph Conrad, D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Ivy Compton-\nBurnett, Regina Maria Roche and Mervyn Peake. It also helped very many more\nstruggling authors who found themselves in dire poverty and/or poor health in\nthe period before social security, through small grants.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century and until 1939 much of the Fund's money came\nfrom an annual fund-raising dinner at which major public and literary figures\nexhorted guests to make generous donations. Current funds include the income\nfrom these earlier investments and from royalties bequeathed by writers. Amongst\nthe estates from which the Fund earns royalties are those of the First World War\npoet Rupert Brooke, the novelists Somerset Maugham and G. K. Chesterton and\nchildren's writers Arthur Ransome and A. A. Milne.\n\nIncome from the A. A. Milne estate has enabled the Royal Literary Fund to\nestablish a Fellowship Scheme to place professional writers in universities in\nthe UK. The Fellowship Scheme was established in 1999 under the guidance of\nHilary Spurling. It provides a stipend for established writers to work in\nuniversities and colleges to help students and staff to develop their writing\nskills, concentrating particularly on academic writing. Writers employed include\nnovelists, playwrights, poets, translators, writers of non-fiction and of\nchildren's books. By the end of 2006, there were 77 Fellows in 47 institutions\nthroughout the mainland UK.\n\nThe Fellowship Scheme also undertakes research into the state of writing amongst\nBritish students and school pupils and is proactive in promoting the development\nof writing skills. Between 2002 and 2005 a group of Project Fellowships existed\nto carry out research into how the work for the Fellowship could be furthered in\nthe future.\n","recorded":1362124387,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"54","instances":["minister"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-profit organisations based in the United Kingdom","Organizations established in 1790","Organisations based in London with royal patronage"],"headings":["External links","Sources"],"tags":[["david_williams","minister"],["david_williams","minister"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["David_Williams_(minister)","Plato","Floyer_Sydenham","Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","Samuel_Rousseau","François-René_de_Chateaubriand","Thomas_Love_Peacock","James_Hogg","James_Henry_Leigh_Hunt","Thomas_Hood","Richard_Jefferies","Joseph_Conrad","D._H._Lawrence","James_Joyce","Ivy_Compton-Burnett","Regina_Maria_Roche","Mervyn_Peake","Rupert_Brooke","Somerset_Maugham","G._K._Chesterton","Arthur_Ransome","A._A._Milne","A._A._Milne","Hilary_Spurling"],"members":["david_williams"],"book":[]}
