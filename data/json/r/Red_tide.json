{"cursor":"18136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n San Diego, California.]]\n\n'Red tide' is a common name for a phenomenon known as an algal bloom (large\nconcentrations of aquatic microorganisms) when it is caused by a few species of\ndinoflagellates and the bloom takes on a red or brown color. Red tides are\nevents in which estuarine, marine, or fresh water algae accumulate rapidly in\nthe water column, resulting in coloration of the surface water. It is usually\nfound in coastal areas. {{cite web\n|url=http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/coris_glossary/index.aspx?letter=r |title=Discover\nNOAA's Coral Reef Data |publisher=www8.nos.noaa.gov |accessdate=2009-08-\n22}}\n\nThese algae, known as phytoplankton, are single-celled protists, plant-like\norganisms that can form dense, visible patches near the water's surface. Certain\nspecies of phytoplankton, dinoflagellates, contain photosynthetic pigments that\nvary in color from green to brown to red.\n\nWhen the algae are present in high concentrations, the water appears to be\ndiscolored or murky, varying in color from purple to almost pink, normally being\nred or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water\ndiscoloration, and not all discolored waters associated with algal blooms are\nred. Additionally, red tides are not typically associated with tidal movement of\nwater, hence the preference among scientists to use the term algal bloom.\n\nSome red tides are associated with the production of natural toxins, depletion\nof dissolved oxygen or other harmful effects, and are generally described as\nharmful algal blooms. The most conspicuous effects of these kind of red tides\nare the associated wildlife mortalities of marine and coastal species of fish,\nbirds, marine mammals, and other organisms.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Red_tide","recorded":1362511218,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algae","Aquatic ecology","Fisheries","Biological oceanography"],"headings":["Overview","Definition","Causes","Notable occurrences","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg/250px-La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Red_tide.jpg/220px-Red_tide.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/3875_aquaimages.jpg/140px-3875_aquaimages.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg/140px-Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["San_Diego","California","Algal_bloom","Dinoflagellate","Water_column","Phytoplankton","Phytoplankton","Dinoflagellate","Harmful_algal_bloom","Gulf_of_Mexico","Florida_Fish_and_Wildlife_Conservation_Commission","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","National_Ocean_Service","Dinoflagellate","Gulf_of_Mexico","Gulf_of_Maine","Dinoflagellate","Fishery","Shellfish","Saxitoxin","Estuary","Domoic_acid","Water_pollution","Global_warming","El_Ni√±o","Cabeza_de_Vaca","Anthropogenic","British_Columbia","Canada","Dinoflagellate","Paralytic_shellfish_poisoning","Sabah","East_Malaysia","Montauk,_New_York","Long_Island","West_Coast_Division","South_China_Sea","Sabah","East_Malaysia","Shellfish","Shellfish_poisoning","Algal_bloom","Brevetoxin","Ciguatera","Dinoflagellate","Domoic_acid","Fish_kill","Harmful_algal_bloom","The_Marine_Mammal_Center","Paralytic_shellfish_poisoning","Pfiesteria","Phytoplankton","Saxitoxin","GEOHAB","Woods_Hole_Oceanographic_Institution","NOAA","Woods_Hole_Oceanographic_Institution","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","Mote_Marine_Laboratory","Sarasota,_FL","California_Department_of_Health_Services","University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz"]}
