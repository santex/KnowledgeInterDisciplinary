Herbert,\n [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SP.1984.10001 An Augmented\n Capability Architecture to Support Lattice Security and Traceability of\n Access], sp, p. 2, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,\n 1984 Walter Binder,\n [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SAINT.2001.905166 Design and\n Implementation of the J-SEAL2 Mobile Agent Kernel], saint, p. 35, 2001\n Symposium on Applications and the Internet (SAINT'01), 2001 often called\n 'protection rings', are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from\n faults (fault tolerance) and malicious behaviour (computer security). This\n approach is diametrically opposite to that of capability-based security.\n\nComputer operating systems provide different levels of access to resources. A\nprotection ring is one of two or more hierarchical levels or layers of privilege\nwithin the architecture of a computer system. This is generally hardware-\nenforced by some CPU architectures that provide different CPU modes at the\nhardware or microcode level. Rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most\nprivileged (most trusted, usually numbered zero) to least privileged (least\ntrusted, usually with the highest ring number). On most operating systems, Ring\n0 is the level with the most privileges and interacts most directly with the\nphysical hardware such as the CPU and memory.\n\nSpecial gates between rings are provided to allow an outer ring to access an\ninner ring's resources in a predefined manner, as opposed to allowing arbitrary\nusage. Correctly gating access between rings can improve security by preventing\nprograms from one ring or privilege level from misusing resources intended for\nprograms in another. For example, spyware running as a user program in Ring 3\nshould be prevented from turning on a web camera without informing the user,\nsince hardware access should be a Ring 1 function reserved for device drivers.\nPrograms such as web browsers running in higher numbered rings must request\naccess to the network, a resource restricted to a lower numbered ring.\n","linknr":330,"url":"Ring_(computer_security)","recorded":1362687896,"links":29,"instances":["computer_science","computers","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://theses.nps.navy.mil/03Jun_Rogers_David.pdf","http://cisr.nps.navy.mil/downloads/99paper_multithread.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/papers/2003-xensosp.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/~yuqunc/papers/ngscb.pdf","http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumII/manuals/24319202.pdf","http://www.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tech-reports/TR00-02-a4.pdf"],"categories":["Central processing unit","Computer security models","Operating system technology"],"headings":["Implementations","Supervisor mode","Hypervisor mode","Interoperation between CPU and OS levels of abstraction","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Priv_rings.svg/300px-Priv_rings.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["privilege","computer_science"],["thread","computer_science"],["kernel","computers"],["firewall","computing"],["thread","computer_science"]],"members":["thread","kernel","firewall","privilege"],"related":["Protected_mode","Computer_science","Fault_tolerance","Computer_security","Capability-based_security","Privilege_(computer_science)","Computer_system","Central_processing_unit","Computer_architecture","CPU_modes","Microcode","Abstraction_level","Spyware","Device_Driver","Multics","UNIX","GE-600_series","CPU_modes","Kernel_mode","User_mode","Intel","X86","Windows_NT","OS/2","DOS","EMM386","DR-DOS","DOS_Protected_Mode_Services","OpenVMS","Xen","Virtual_machine_monitor","Tanenbaum-Torvalds_debate","Monolithic_kernel","Microkernel","Usenet","Web_forums","Next-Generation_Secure_Computing_Base","Hypervisor","Firmware","Intel_VT-x","Thread_(computer_science)","Virtual_memory","Data_General_Eclipse_MV/8000","Program_counter","Supervisor_mode","Kernel_mode","Kernel_(computers)","Operating_system","Exokernel","Microkernel","Linux_kernel","Microsoft_Windows","System_call","DOS","EMM386","X86","Getpid","Jochen_Liedtke","L3_microkernel","Maurice_Wilkes","Access_control","Firewall_(computing)","Context_switch","VDSO","X86_virtualization","Hypervisor","Intel_VT-x","AMD-V","Operating_system","PowerPC","MIPS_architecture","Multics","Thread_(computer_science)","Microkernel","Computer_security","Elegance","System_call","Protected_mode","Multics","Multics","Acronyms","Michael_D._Schroeder","Jerome_H._Saltzer"]}
