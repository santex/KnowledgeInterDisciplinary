Burton, Brigham Young\nUniversity |work = specialized language definitions}} The question is used\nas a rhetorical device, posed for the sake of encouraging its listener to\nconsider a message or viewpoint. Though these are technically questions, they do\nnot always require a question mark.\n\nFor example, the question \"Can't you do anything right?\" is asked not to gain\ninformation about the ability of the person being spoken to, but rather to\ninsinuate that the person always fails.\n\nWhile sometimes amusing and even humorous, rhetorical questions are rarely meant\nfor pure, comedic effect. A carefully crafted question can, if delivered well,\npersuade an audience to believe in the position(s) of the speaker.\n\nIn simple terms, it is a question asked more to produce an effect than to summon\nan answer.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Rhetorical_question","recorded":1362553637,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/5371/1/RAEI_11_11.pdf","http://www.psyc.memphis.edu/faculty/kreuz/KAB02.pdf","http://www.psyc.memphis.edu/faculty/kreuz/KAB02.pdf"],"categories":["Rhetorical techniques","Interrogative words and phrases"],"headings":["Different forms","Grammar","Quotes","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Where_is_my_Vote.jpg/250px-Where_is_my_Vote.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Figure_of_speech","Question","Rhetorical_device","Shakespeare","Mark_Antony","Sarcasm","Metaphor","Rodgers_and_Hammerstein","Bob_Dylan","Blowin'_in_the_Wind","Henry_Denham","Rhetorical_question_mark","Aporia","Thought_experiment"]}
