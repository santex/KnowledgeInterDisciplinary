{"cursor":"4473","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Robert Rochfort' (9 December 1652 – 10 October 1727) was attorney-\ngeneral, judge and speaker of the Irish House of Commons.\n\nHe was the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel James \"Prime-Iron \" Rochfort (d.\n1652), a Cromwellian soldier, and Thomasina Pigot. Robert was born posthumously:\nhis father who had fatally wounded a Major Turner in a duel, was court-\nmartialled and shot some months before his birth. Rochfort later married Hannah\nHandcock, with whom he had two sons, George and John. C. I. McGrath,\nâRochfort, Robert (1652â1727)â, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2004 The Rochfort family is recorded in Ireland from\n1243, and acquired substantial lands in Meath, Westmeath and Kildare. Robert was\ndescended from Sir Milo de Rochfort ( died after 1309 ).\n\nRochfort initially pursued a successful legal career in Ireland before going on\nto attain high government office. In 1680 he was appointed recorder of\nLondonderry, a post which he held until 1707.\n\nBetween 1692 and 1707, Rochfort represented Westmeath in the Irish House of\nCommons. He supported the 'whiggish' elements in the House at this time in their\nclaim to possess the 'sole right' to legislate for Ireland. This was both a\nchallenge to Poynings' Law and the Irish executive, leading to a constitutional\ncrisis, resolved by a compromise in the parliamentary session of 1695. Rochfort\nwas, nonetheless, appointed attorney-general in 1694 with the help of the Whig\nLord Justice, Capell. With the executive's support, he was elected Speaker of\nthe Irish House of Commons the same year. He remained in this position until\n1699. He played a key role in the impeachment of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland,\nSir Charles Porter, for judicial misconduct, but the impeachment collapsed after\nPorter's brilliant speech in his own defence. Disappointment and a keen sense of\nhis dignity evidently led Rochfort to start a foolish quarrel the following\nnight: seeing the Lord Chancellor's coach trying to precede his, he jumped down\nand tried to physically restrain the coachman. The House of Lords next day\nrebuked the Commons over the affair. O'Flanagan J. Roderick Lives of the\nLord Chancellors of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870\n\nMeanwhile, Rochfort began to demonstrate Tory sympaties, from 1703 becoming\nidentifiable as one of the government's leading parliamentary managers. He\nbecame Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1707. He remained in this position until\n1714, when, along with other tories, he was dismissed from office. Rochfort now\nreturned to his practice at the bar.\n\nRochfort died on 10 October 1727. His grandson, Robert was raised to the Irish\npeerage in 1737 as Baron Bellfield, and then as Viscount Bellfield (1751), and\nEarl of Belvedere (1757).\n","linknr":107,"url":"Robert_Rochfort","recorded":1375066025,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Irish_House_of_Commons","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Westmeath_(Parliament_of_Ireland_constituency)","/wiki/Irish_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Poynings%27_Law","/wiki/Lord_Justices_(Ireland)","/wiki/Henry_Capell,_1st_Baron_Capell","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland","/wiki/Charles_Porter_(Lord_Chancellor_of_Ireland)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Exchequer_(Ireland)","/wiki/Earl_of_Belvedere","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Parliament_of_Ireland","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Westmeath_(Parliament_of_Ireland_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Dillon_Pollard&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=George_Peyton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/William_Handcock_(Westmeath_politician)","/w/index.php?title=George_Rochfort_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=George_Rochfort_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=John_Cooke_(Irish_politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Richard_Levinge","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Irish_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Alan_Brodrick,_1st_Viscount_Midleton","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/31930400","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&oldid=538797266","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1652_births","/wiki/Category:1727_deaths","/wiki/Category:Anglo-Irish_people","/wiki/Category:Irish_MPs_1692%E2%80%931693","/wiki/Category:Irish_MPs_1695%E2%80%931699","/wiki/Category:Irish_MPs_1703%E2%80%931713","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_(pre-1801)","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+Rochfort&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+Rochfort","/wiki/Robert_Rochfort","/wiki/Talk:Robert_Rochfort","#","/wiki/Robert_Rochfort","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Robert_Rochfort","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Robert_Rochfort","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&oldid=538797266","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7349340","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Robert_Rochfort&id=538797266","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Robert+Rochfort","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Robert+Rochfort&oldid=538797266&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Rochfort&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7349340#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rochfort","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawi
