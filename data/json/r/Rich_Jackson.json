In college Jackson played for Southern\nUniversity. Jackson played for the American Football League's Oakland Raiders in\n1966 and the AFL Denver Broncos from 1967 through 1969. He played for the NFL\nBroncos in 1970 through 1971, and the NFL Cleveland Browns in 1972. Jackson was\nAll-Pro in 1969 and 1970.\n\nA defensive end whose nickname was \"Tombstone\", Jackson was famous for moves\nsuch as the \"head slap\" and the \"halo spinner\" which he used to subdue opposing\noffensive linemen. In the late Lyle Alzado's book \"Mile High\" he recalled Rich\nJackson as the toughest man he'd ever met, and told the story of Jackson\nbreaking the helmet of Green Bay Packer offensive tackle, Bill Hayhoe, with a\nheadslap. He had 10 sacks in both 1968 and 1970 and posted a career-high total\nof 11 in 1969. [http://www.milehighreport.com/2008/5/21/508498/mhr-s-forgotten-\nbroncos-ri] He was named 1st Team All-AFL by the AP, Pro Football Weekly\nand UPI at the conclusion of the 1968 season and by the AP, NEA, NY Daily News,\nPro Football Weekly, The Sporting News and UPI at the end of the 1969 season. He\nwas also a unanimous 1st Team All-NFL choice in 1970.\n\nJackson's career was cut short by a severe knee injury midway through the 1971\nseason. He finished with an unofficial total of 43 sacks, 31 of which came\nduring the three season period of 1968-1970. Despite the shortened career,\n[[Sports Illustrated]]'s football expert, Paul Zimmerman, said that Tombstone\nJackson was perhaps the finest overall defensive end and pass rusher he ever\nsaw, a surefire Hall of Famer if he would have had a longer playing career, in\na bigger media market. As it was Jackson will be remembered as a great one,\nonly by a handful of football insiders, including those who lined up with and\nagainst him.\n\nJackson wore number 87 with the Broncos and was part of the inaugural class of\ninductees into the Denver Broncos' \"Ring of Fame\". He was inducted in 1984 along\nwith safety Goose Gonsoulin, running back Floyd Little, and wide receiver Lionel\nTaylor. He was voted to the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.\n[http://www.coloradosports.org/themuseum.cfm]\n","linknr":153,"url":"Rich_Jackson","recorded":1375056780,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Defensive_End","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Southern_University","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1966_American_Football_League_Draft#Round_:_Undrafted","/wiki/American_Football_League_All-Star_game","/wiki/1970_All-Pro_Team","/wiki/American_Football_League_All-Time_Team","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/JackRi00.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=JACKSRIC01","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Denver_Broncos","/wiki/Cleveland_Browns","/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana","/wiki/Southern_University","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Denver_Broncos","/wiki/Cleveland_Browns","/wiki/Lyle_Alzado","/wiki/Bill_Hayhoe","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Associated_Press","/wiki/Pro_Football_Weekly","/wiki/United_Press_International","/wiki/Newspaper_Enterprise_Association","/wiki/NY_Daily_News","/wiki/The_Sporting_News","/wiki/Sports_Illustrated","/wiki/Paul_Zimmerman","/wiki/Goose_Gonsoulin","/wiki/Floyd_Little","/wiki/Lionel_Taylor","http://www.coloradosports.org/themuseum.cfm","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.milehighreport.com/2008/5/21/508498/mhr-s-forgotten-broncos-ri","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit&section=3","http://www.conigliofamily.com/AFLHallofFamePhotos.htm#RichJackson","/wiki/Template:Broncos50th","/wiki/Template_talk:Broncos50th","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Broncos50th&action=edit","/wiki/Denver_Broncos","/wiki/John_Elway","/wiki/Terrell_Davis","/wiki/Floyd_Little","/wiki/Ed_McCaffrey","/wiki/Rod_Smith_(American_football)","/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe","/wiki/Matt_Lepsis","/wiki/Gary_Zimmerman","/wiki/Keith_Bishop_(American_football)","/wiki/Mark_Schlereth","/wiki/Tom_Nalen","/wiki/Simon_Fletcher_(American_football)","/wiki/Trevor_Pryce","/wiki/Rubin_Carter_(American_football)","/wiki/Karl_Mecklenburg","/wiki/Randy_Gradishar","/wiki/Tom_Jackson_(American_football)","/wiki/Champ_Bailey","/wiki/Louis_Wright_(American_football)","/wiki/Steve_Atwater","/wiki/Dennis_Smith_(American_football)","/wiki/Rick_Upchurch","/wiki/Jason_Elam","/wiki/Tom_Rouen","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&oldid=559677314","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1941_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Sportspeople_from_New_Orleans,_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:American_football_defensive_ends","/wiki/Category:American_Football_League_All-Star_players","/wiki/Category:American_Conference_Pro_Bowl_players","/wiki/Category:Oakland_Raiders_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Denver_Broncos_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Denver_Broncos_players","/wiki/Category:Cleveland_Browns_players","/wiki/Category:Southern_Jaguars_football_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rich+Jackson&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rich+Jackson","/wiki/Rich_Jackson","/wiki/Talk:Rich_Jackson","#","/wiki/Rich_Jackson","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rich_Jackson&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki
