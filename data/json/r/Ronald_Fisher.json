P.\nBox. }} Sir 'Ronald Aylmer Fisher' FRS (17 February 1890 â 29 July 1962) was an\nEnglish statistician, evolutionary biologist, geneticist, and eugenicist. Fisher\nis known as one of the chief architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, and for\nhis contributions to statistics by creating ANOVA (analysis of variance),\nFisher's exact test and Fisher's equation, among other things. Anders Hald\ncalled him \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for\nmodern statistical science\", while Richard Dawkins named him \"the\ngreatest biologist since Darwin\". Dawkins, R. (2010). WHO IS THE GREATEST BIOLOGIST SINCE DARWIN? WHY?\n[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/leroi11/leroi11_index.html#dawkins Edge] \"Who\nis the greatest biologist since Darwin? That's far less obvious, and no doubt\nmany good candidates will be put forward. My own nominee would be Ronald Fisher.\nNot only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-\nDarwinian synthesis. Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and\nexperimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in\nbiology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with\nthe modern version of biology's central theorem.\"\n","linknr":1118,"url":"Ronald_Fisher","recorded":1362483174,"links":68,"instances":["surgical_procedure","biology","uk","biology","statistics","statistics"],"pdf":["http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/fisherbiog.pdf","http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/fisherbiog.pdf","http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000733/073351eo.pdf","http://www.library.adelaide.edu.au/digitised/fisher/18pt1.pdf","http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special/fisher/43.pdf","http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/fisherbiog.pdf"],"categories":["1890
