Between 1969 and 1975 he worked as a\nmathematical analyst for Aerospace Guidance System Center, Newark, Ohio. Since\nthen until 1990 he worked as a research supervisor for Air Force Human Resources\nLaboratory, Dayton, Ohio, and Mesa, Arizona. \n\nIn 1979 he founded the Fairborn Observatory, which he later moved to Mount\nHopkins, Arizona, and worked there until 1993. He was also its first director,\nuntil 1989. Genet and his colleagues developed robotic telescopes there. It\nbecame the first totally automatic robotic observatory in the world. It appeared\nin the documentary of the Public Broadcasting Service The Perfect Stargazer.  He also established the magazine IAPPP Communications,\nthe first international astronomical photometry journal. In\n1983 he received the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of\nthe Pacific for his photometric studies  and in 1986 the Leslie\nPeltier Award of the Astronomical League.  After Genet left this\nobservatory, he founded the Orion Observatory in Santa Margarita,\nCalifornia. \n\nIn 1993 Genet was elected the 51st president of the Astronomical Society of the\nPacific and served in this position for two years.\n Throughout his career, he taught at Central Arizona College, California\nPolytechnic State University's Osher Institute and Cuesta College. In 2007 he\npublished the book Humanity: The Chimpanzees Who Would Be Ants. \n\nWhile teaching at Cuesta College, Genet taught an astronomy research seminar\nthat required students to publish their results. \n\nOn November 17, 2001 Genet married Cheryl Linda Davidson. \n","linknr":168,"url":"Russell_Merle_Genet","recorded":1362540061,"links":12,"instances":["arizona","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/genetcv.pdf","http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/genetcv.pdf"],"categories":["American academics","American astronomers","20th-century astronomers","21st-century astronomers","1940 births","Living people","People from Fairborn, Ohio","Use mdy dates from August 2011"],"headings":["Publications","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["photometry","astronomy"],["mount_hopkins","arizona"]],"members":["mount_hopkins","photometry"],"related":["United_States","Astronomer","Photometry_(astronomy)","Observational_astronomy","Eclipse","Binary_star","Aerospace_engineering","Space_and_Missile_Systems_Center","San_Bernardino,_California","California","Mathematical_analysis","Newark,_Ohio","Ohio","Research_supervisor","Dayton,_Ohio","Mesa,_Arizona","Arizona","Fairborn","Mount_Hopkins_(Arizona)","Robotic_telescope","Public_Broadcasting_Service","Amateur_Achievement_Award_of_Astronomical_Society_of_the_Pacific","Astronomical_Society_of_the_Pacific","Leslie_Peltier_Award","Astronomical_League","Orion_Observatory","Santa_Margarita,_California","Central_Arizona_College","California_Polytechnic_State_University","Cuesta_College"]}
