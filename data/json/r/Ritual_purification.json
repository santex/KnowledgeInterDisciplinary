The aim of these rituals\nis to remove specifically defined uncleanliness prior to a particular type of\nactivity, and especially prior to the worship of a deity. This ritual\nuncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt\nstains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.\n\nMost of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure\nprominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East.\nSome writers remark that similarities between cleansing actions, engaged in by\nobsessive compulsive disorder sufferers and those of religious purification\nrites, point to an ultimate origin of the rituals in the personal grooming\nbehaviour of the primates, but others connect the rituals to primitive taboos.\n\nSome have seen benefits of these practices that as a point of health and\npreventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact\nwith each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory\nwas public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious\nagents seems to be dramatic. \"Nitten Soji and the prevention of infections\"\nClassical fighing arts vol 2 #18\n","linknr":313,"url":"Ritual_purification","recorded":1362372178,"links":25,"instances":["hinduism","religion","hinduism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rituals","Ritual purification|","Christian terms"],"headings":["Bahá'í Faith","Buddhism","Christianity","Hinduism","Indigenous American religions","Islam","Judaism","Kalash (polytheists in the mountains of Pakistan)","Shinto","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Shalom_Koboshvili._Taking_the_bride_to_the_bath_house_%28Mikveh%29._watercolor_on_paper._31.5_%C3%97_41.5cm._1939.jpg/220px-Shalom_Koboshvili._Taking_the_bride_to_the_bath_house_%28Mikveh%29._watercolor_on_paper._31.5_%C3%97_41.5cm._1939.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Tsukubai2.JPG/220px-Tsukubai2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Villa_de_Leyva_el_infiernito.jpg/220px-Villa_de_Leyva_el_infiernito.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Ablution_area_inside_Eastern_wall_of_Badshahi_mosque.JPG/220px-Ablution_area_inside_Eastern_wall_of_Badshahi_mosque.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Judenbad_Speyer_6_View_from_the_first_room_down.jpg/220px-Judenbad_Speyer_6_View_from_the_first_room_down.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["confession","religion"],["puja","hinduism"],["āgama","hinduism"]],"members":["āgama","confession","puja"],"related":["Shalom_Koboshvili","Religion","Ritual","Deity","Body_fluid","Germ_theory_of_disease","Ancient_Near_Eastern_religion","Obsessive_compulsive_disorder","Personal_grooming","Primates","Taboo","Bahá'í_Faith","Obligatory_Bahá'í_prayers","Bahá'u'lláh","Kitáb-i-Aqdas","Ryōan-ji","Kyoto","Japanese_Buddhism","Tsukubai","Buddhist_temple","Tea_ceremony","Baptism","Christianity","Roman_Catholic_Church","Holy_water","Sign_of_the_cross","Piscina","Eucharist","Monasteries","Monk","Nun","Daily_Office","Churching_of_women","Church_of_England","Book_of_Common_Prayer","Western_Christianity","Eastern_Orthodox","Oriental_Orthodox","Eastern_Catholic","High_church","Anglican","Confession_(religion)","Sin","Eucharistic_discipline","Eucharist","Mortal_sin","Ritual_purity","Sanctification","Hinduism","Smartism","Karaite_Judaism","Brahmin","Ganges","Achamana","Mantra","Tilaka","Murti","Puja_(Hinduism)","Āgama_(Hinduism)","Antyesti","Hell","Muisca","Shrine","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Sauna","Sweatlodge","Smudge_stick","Cherokee","Going_to_water","Naming_ceremony","Holidays","Ball_games","Lost_Tribes_of_Israel","Historiography","Lahore","Pakistan","Islam","Salah","Vomiting","Wudu","Ghusl","Ihram","Tayammum","Fard","Mustahab","Basmala","Shahadah","Madh'hab","Islamic_schools_and_branches","Tanakh","Niddah","Childbirth","Keri","Zav","Tzaraath","Death","Korban","Judaism","Oral_law","Mishnah","Gemarrah","Talmud","Excretion","Meal","Sleep","Ritual_washing_in_Judaism","Tumah","Israelites","Orthodox_Judaism","Conservative_Judaism","Temple_in_Jerusalem","Nidda","Mikvah","Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards","Conservative_Judaism","Niddah","Reform_Judaism","Reconstructionist_Judaism","Conversion_to_Judaism","Reform_Judaism","Corpse","Red_Heifer","Kohen","Karaite_Jews","Torah","Kalash_people","Shinto","Misogi","Fundoshi","Kimono","Candlemas","Eleusinian_Mysteries","Churching_of_women","Lady_Macbeth_effect","Leviticus","Sattva","Water_and_religion"]}
