He set a\nstandard for scientific and engineering plausibility, and helped to raise the\ngenre's standards of literary quality.\n\nHe was one of the first science fiction writers to break into mainstream\nmagazines such as [[The Saturday Evening Post]] in the late 1940s. He was one of\nthe best-selling science fiction novelists for many decades. He, Isaac Asimov,\nand Arthur C. Clarke are known as the \"Big Three\" of science\nfiction. Robert J. Sawyer. [http://www.sfwriter.com/rmdeatho.htm\nThe Death of Science Fiction]\n\nHeinlein, a notable writer of science fiction short stories, was one of a group\nof writers who came to prominence under the editorship of John W. Campbell, Jr.\nin his [[Astounding Science Fiction]] magazineâthough Heinlein denied that\nCampbell influenced his writing to any great degree.\n\nWithin the framework of his science fiction stories, Heinlein repeatedly\naddressed certain social themes: the importance of individual liberty and self-\nreliance, the obligation individuals owe to their societies, the influence of\norganized religion on culture and government, and the tendency of society to\nrepress nonconformist thought. He also examined the relationship between\nphysical and emotional love, explored various unorthodox family structures, and\nspeculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices. His\napproach to these themes led to wildly divergent opinions on what views were\nbeing expounded via his fiction.\n\nHeinlein won Hugo Awards for four of his novels; in addition, fifty years after\npublication, three of his works were awarded \"Retro Hugos\"âawards given\nretrospectively for years in which Hugo Awards had not been awarded. He also won\nthe first Grand Master Award, given by the Science Fiction Writers of America,\nfor his lifetime achievement. In his fiction Heinlein coined words that have\nbecome part of the English language, including \"grok\" and \"waldo\", and\npopularized the terms \"TANSTAAFL\" and space marine.\n","linknr":1129,"url":"Robert_Heinlein","recorded":1362506412,"links":72,"instances":["literature","short_story","philosophy","heinlein_character","people","naval","short_story","author","film","book","short_story","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1907 births","1988 deaths","Robert A.
