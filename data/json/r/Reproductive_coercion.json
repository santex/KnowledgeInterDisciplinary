National Domestic Violence\nHotline. 1 in 4 Callers to the National Domestic Violence Hotline Report Birth\nControl Sabotage and Pregnancy Coercion. The Hotline. National Domestic Violence\nHotline, 15 Feb. 2011. Web. .\nReproductive coercion is a form of domestic violence, also known as intimate\npartner violence, where behavior concerning reproductive health is used to\nmaintain power, control, and domination within a relationship and over the\nwoman's body. It is considered a serious public health issue and has great\npsychological and social consequences including drug dependence, suicide\nattempts, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mezey, Gillian C.,\nand Susan Bewley. \"Domestic Violence and Pregnancy: Risk is Greatest After\nDelivery.\" BMJ 314 (1997): 1295. This reproductive control, or a (commonly\nmale) partner's attempt to control a woman's reproductive choices, is highly\ncorrelated to unintended pregnancy. Victims and survivors are\nsignificantly more likely to describe their pregnancy as unplanned and unwanted\nthan women without these violent experiences.\n\nWomen report that their partners engage in reproductive coercion because they\nwant to leave a legacy with the woman or have the woman in their life forever as\na few of the reasons they perpetrate the coercion. Luscombe,\nBelinda. \"Help for Women Who Are Forced to Get Pregnant.\" TIME. Time Inc., 31\nAug. 2010. Web.\n As stated\nby the National Domestic Violence Hotline, âSurvivors of domestic violence donât\nalways recognize reproductive coercion as part of the power and control their\npartner is exerting over them in their relationship.â\n\nThe three forms of reproductive coercion are pregnancy pressure, birth control\nsabotage, and pregnancy coercion; they can exist independently or occur\nsimultaneously. There are also three periods in which reproductive coercion can\ntake place: preintercourse, during intercourse, and postintercourse.\nPreintercourse may involve pregnancy pressure, during intercourse may involve\nbirth control sabotage, and postintercourse may involve pregnancy coercion. If a\nwoman does not comply with her partner's wishes, her partner may act out\nviolently against her, which is a common response.\n\nMen can also be victims of reproductive coercion; although the majority of\nvictims of domestic violence - 86% - are women, Trawick, Shane.\n\"Birth Control Sabotage as Domestic Violence: A Legal Response.\" California Law\nReview 100 (2012): 721-760. reproductive coercion can happen to men if\ntheir partner lies about or misrepresents their contraception usage or need,\nalso known as 'contraceptive fraud'. The CDC reports that a greater percentage\nof men reported an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant (10.4%) than women\nreported an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant (8.6%).

The National Intimate Partner\nand Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report. Atlanta, GA: National\nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention: 48  Trawick appears to assume that the gender asymmetry of reproductive\ncoercion matches the gender asymmetry of domestic violence; there is reason to\nsuspect that this may be unwarranted.
