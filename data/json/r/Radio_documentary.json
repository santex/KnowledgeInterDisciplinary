{"cursor":"6516","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, 1954)]]\n\nA 'radio documentary' or 'feature' is a purely acoustic performance devoted to\ncovering a particular topic in some depth, usually with a mixture of commentary\nand sound pictures. It is broadcast on radio or published on audio media, such\nas tape or CD. Some radio features, especially those including specially\ncomposed music or other pieces of audio art, resemble radio drama in many ways,\nthough non-fictional in subject matter, while others consist principally of more\nstraightforward, journalistic-type reporting – but at much greater length\nthan found in an ordinary news report.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Radio_documentary","recorded":1362554568,"links":28,"instances":["record_producer","producer__air","producer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radio documentaries|","Documentaries"],"headings":["Quotes","Documentaries in Third World","Notable feature makers","Notable resources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F001349-0028%2C_K%C3%B6ln%2C_WDR_Rundfunkstudio.jpg/240px-Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F001349-0028%2C_K%C3%B6ln%2C_WDR_Rundfunkstudio.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Radio_icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Nanook_of_the_north.jpg/20px-Nanook_of_the_north.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charles_parker","producer"],["danish_iqbal","producer__air"],["steve_rowland","record_producer"]],"members":["steve_rowland","danish_iqbal","charles_parker"],"related":["Performance","Radio","Radio_drama","John_Quinn","Noah_Adams","Jay_Allison","Alex_Blumberg","Peter_Leonhard_Braun","Kyla_Brettle","Scott_Carrier","Alex_Chadwick","Bill_Drake","Joe_Frank","Laurence_Gilliam","John_Gilliland","Ira_Glass","Glenn_Gould","Berit_Hedemann","David_Isay","Kitchen_Sisters","Ronan_Kelly","Robert_Krulwich","Bill_Lichtenstein","Bosse_Lindquist","Prix_Europa","Ewan_MacColl","Charles_Parker_(producer)","Danish_Iqbal_(producer)__AIR","Lorenz_Rollhäuser","Prix_Europa","Steve_Rowland_(record_producer)","Nancy_Updike","Emil_Benčík"]}
