It is a dark, often humorous, examination of social poverty. In the\nintroduction in his collected volume of plays, Butler writes of his central\ncharacter Though she is a victim of poverty - in particular, poverty of\nimagination and of opportunity - Lucy is never a victim in her own home. She\nnever gives up, and both her dreams, however delusional, and her tough,\noppositional spirit remain unspoiled even by the end of the play.\n\nIt contained the first ever reference in theatre to Osama bin Laden where a\ncharacter said that the whole country needed to be bombed by him to teach us all\nwhat suffering was. The play premiered at Royal Court on 12 September 2001 (the\nday after the attacks on the World Trade Center) receiving gasps from the\naudience. It was a major flop, even though it has been more recently recognised\nas a greater play than was originally thought.\n\nThe production is well known for its use of the downstairs stage at Royal court\nwhere the overhead arch had been lowered throughout the play until the final\nscene where it was raised as Lucy sat on the bed making her appear smaller and\nsmaller and more and more redundant to the action.\n\nLyndsey Marshal won the Critics Circle Award for Best Newcomer for her\nperformance in the play.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Redundant_(play)","recorded":1374858380,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Redundant_(play)#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/File:Redundantcovers.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Redundantcovers.gif","/wiki/Leo_Butler","/wiki/Royal_Court_Theatre","/wiki/London","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Leo_Butler","/wiki/Royal_Court_Theatre","/wiki/Lyndsey_Marshal","/wiki/Dominic_Cooke","/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden","/wiki/World_Trade_Center","/wiki/Lyndsey_Marshal","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/September_11_attacks","/wiki/The_Stage","/wiki/Evening_Standard","http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/review-578023-mad-bad-and-seeing-red-undant.do","http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/redundant-royal-court-london-669836.html","http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/redundant-rev.htm","http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/archive_reviews.asp?play=251","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/leo-butler-thats-not-an-usher-thats-the-author-662973.html","/wiki/File:Comedy_and_tragedy_masks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Comedy_and_tragedy_masks.jpg/29px-Comedy_and_tragedy_masks.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:2000s-play-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:2000s-play-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:2000s-play-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&oldid=530310820","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2001_plays","/wiki/Category:English_plays","/wiki/Category:British_drama","/wiki/Category:Plays_by_Leo_Butler","/wiki/Category:2000s_play_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Redundant+%28play%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Redundant+%28play%29","/wiki/Redundant_(play)","/wiki/Talk:Redundant_(play)","#","/wiki/Redundant_(play)","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Redundant_(play)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Redundant_(play)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&oldid=530310820","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7306399","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Redundant_%28play%29&id=530310820","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Redundant+%28play%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Redundant+%28play%29&oldid=530310820&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Redundant_(play)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7306399#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wi
