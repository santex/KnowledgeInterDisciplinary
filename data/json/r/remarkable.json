The cups are collected from the Save a Cup Recycling Company. The\ninvention became a Millennium product, which was sold as shown at the\nMillennium Dome. Other products have been made, including plastic rulers (also\nmade from vending machine cups), recycled rubber tyres; to make mouse mats and\npencil cases.\n\nThe company was granted £20,000 by London Remade, and bought brand new binding\nmachines to bind the recycled notepads. This has helped Remarkable to be able to\ncreate a greater range of products, which will help it get contracts from stores\nlike W H Smith.\n","title":"remarkable","headings":["External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: United_Kingdom","1: Stationery","1: Recycled","1: Pencil","1: Vending_machine","1: Save_a_Cup_Recycling_Company","1: Millennium_product","1: Millennium_Dome","1: Tire","1: Mouse_mat","1: Pencil_case","1: London_Remade","1: Notepad","1: W_H_Smith"]}
