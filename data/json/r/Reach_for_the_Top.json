The non-televised tournaments held at high schools throughout\nCanada during the year are known as Schoolreach; both are commonly referred to\nsimply as \"Reach\".\n\nSome districts also have \"Intermediate\" level competitions, where the questions\nare written with a lower level of difficulty to provide experience to new,\nyounger players. Intermediate level champions do not move on to national finals.\n\nIn Canadian universities, Quiz Bowl is the dominant form of trivia competition,\noften played by those who participated in Schoolreach and Reach for the Top in\nhigh school.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Reach_for_the_Top","recorded":1362554782,"links":11,"instances":["ottawa","sydney_mines","tv_channel","tv_channel","ottawa","renfrew","ottawa","producer","vancouver"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canadian game shows","Education in Canada","Student quiz television series","TVOntario shows","CBC network shows","1961 Canadian television series debuts"],"headings":["History","Format","Types of questions","Eligibility","Notable teams","National champions","Alumni","Controversy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/40/Reach4top.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["knowledge","tv_channel"],["access","tv_channel"],["sandy_stewart","producer"],["st._george's_school","vancouver"],["gloucester_high_school","ottawa"],["collegiate_school","richmond,_virginia"],["queen_elizabeth_high_school","halifax,_nova_scotia"],["hillcrest_high_school","ottawa"],["memorial_high_school","sydney_mines"],["st._george's_school","vancouver"],["st._joseph's_high_school","renfrew"],["bell_high_school","ottawa"],["gloucester_high_school","ottawa"]],"members":["hillcrest_high_school","collegiate_school","memorial_high_school","access","knowledge","gloucester_high_school","bell_high_school","sandy_stewart","queen_elizabeth_high_school"],"related":["Canada","Game_show","High_school","Trivia","Quiz_bowl","CBC_Television","CBUT","Vancouver","British_Columbia","BBC","Vincent_Massey_Collegiate_Institute","Etobicoke,_Ontario","Montreal","Quebec","United_Kingdom","Canada","Alex_Trebek","Shelagh_Rogers","CBC_Radio","Bill_Guest","CFRN-DT","TVOntario","Ontario","Nicole_Stamp","TVOKids","Sidney_M._Cohen","British_Columbia","Knowledge_(TV_channel)","Alberta","Access_(TV_channel)","Sandy_Stewart_(producer)","French_language","Télévision_de_Radio-Canada","Francophone","United_States","Quizbowl","Quizbowl","Secondary_school","Quebec","College_education_in_Quebec","Vincent_Massey_Collegiate_Institute","Richview_Collegiate_Institute","Prime_Minister_of_Canada","Stephen_Harper","Etobicoke,_Ontario","Nicole_Stamp","University_of_Toronto_Schools","Toronto","Ontario","Cobequid_Educational_Centre","Truro,_Nova_Scotia","Nova_Scotia","St._George's_School_(Vancouver)","Vancouver","British_Columbia","Saunders_Secondary_School","London,_Ontario","Gloucester_High_School_(Ottawa)","Ottawa","London_Central_Secondary_School","London,_Ontario","Kennebecasis_Valley_High_School","Quispamsis,_New_Brunswick","Sydney_Mines","Collegiate_School_(Richmond,_Virginia)","Richmond,_Virginia","Barrhead,_Alberta","Speaker_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_Alberta","Ken_Kowalski","The_Canadian_Encyclopedia","Vancouver,_British_Columbia","Magee_Secondary_School","Vincent_Massey_Collegiate_Institute","Etobicoke,_Ontario","Ottawa","Ontario","Oak_Bay_High_School","Victoria,_British_Columbia","Neil_McNeil_Catholic_Secondary_School","Toronto","Ontario","Kelvin_High_School","Winnipeg","Manitoba","Edmonton","Alberta","Barrhead,_Alberta","St._John's,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Queen_Elizabeth_High_School_(Halifax,_Nova_Scotia)","City_of_Halifax","Central_Peel_Secondary_School","Brampton","Ontario","Banting_Memorial_High_School","Alliston,_Ontario","Hillcrest_High_School_(Ottawa)","Cobequid_Educational_Centre","Truro,_Nova_Scotia","Roland_Michener_Secondary_School","South_Porcupine,_Ontario","Deloraine,_Manitoba","Coaldale,_Alberta","Avonmore,_Ontario","Memorial_High_School_(Sydney_Mines)","Sydney_Mines,_Nova_Scotia","St._George's_School_(Vancouver)","Vancouver","British_Columbia","Saunders_Secondary_School","London,_Ontario","St._Joseph's_High_School_(Renfrew)","Renfrew,_Ontario","Bell_High_School_(Ottawa)","Nepean,_Ontario","Fredericton_High_School","Fredericton","New_Brunswick","Earl_Haig_Secondary_School","Gloucester_High_School_(Ottawa)","Gloucester,_Ontario","Frontenac_Secondary_School","Kingston,_Ontario","Merivale_High_School","University_of_Toronto_Schools","Woburn_Collegiate_Institute","London_Central_Secondary_School","London,_Ontario","Lisgar_Collegiate_Institute","Ottawa","Ontario","London_Central_Secondary_School","London,_Ontario","Kennebecasis_Valley_High_School","Quispamsis,_New_Brunswick","Kennebecasis_Valley_High_School","Quispamsis,_New_Brunswick","Lucie_Edwards","Stephen_Harper","Prime_Minister_of_Canada","Academic_games","MathCounts","Schools'_Challenge","Génies_en_herbe","Paul_Henderson"]}
