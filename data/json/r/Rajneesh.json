His outspoken criticism of socialism, Mahatma Gandhi{Osho Book\n\"The Path of The Mystic\"} and institutionalised religions made him\ncontroversial. He also advocated a more open attitude towards sexuality: a\nstance that earned him the sobriquet \"sex guru\" in the Indian and later\ninternational press. In 1970, Osho settled\nfor a while in Bombay. He began initiating disciples (known as neo-sannyasins)\nand took on the role of a spiritual teacher. In his discourses, he reinterpreted\nwritings of religious traditions, mystics, and philosophers from around the\nworld. Moving to Poona in 1974, he established an ashram that attracted\nincreasing numbers of Westerners. The ashram offered therapies derived from the\nHuman Potential Movement to its Western audience and made news in India and\nabroad, chiefly because of its permissive climate and Osho's provocative\nlectures. By the end of the 1970s, there were mounting tensions with the Indian\ngovernment and the surrounding society.\n\nIn 1981, Osho relocated to the United States and his followers established an\nintentional community, later known as Rajneeshpuram, in the state of Oregon.\nWithin a year, the leadership of the commune became embroiled in a conflict with\nlocal residents, primarily over land use, which was marked by hostility on both\nsides. The large collection of Rolls-Royce automobiles purchased for his use by\nhis followers also attracted criticism. The Oregon commune collapsed in 1985\nwhen Osho revealed that the commune leadership had committed a number of serious\ncrimes, including a bioterror attack (food contamination) on the citizens of The\nDalles. He was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with\nimmigration violations. Osho was deported from the United States in accordance\nwith a plea bargain. Twenty-one\ncountries denied him entry, causing Osho to travel the world before returning to\nPoona, where he died in 1990. His ashram is today known as the Osho\nInternational Meditation Resort. His syncretic teachings emphasise the\nimportance of meditation, awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity and\nhumourâqualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static\nbelief systems, religious tradition and socialisation. Osho's teachings have had\na notable impact on Western New Age thought,\nand their popularity has increased markedly since his death.\n","linknr":2125,"url":"Rajneesh","recorded":1362501473,"links":82,"instances":["musician","united_states","india","publisher","car","journalist","spiritual","australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1931
