They are\nprivate contractor extensions of the federal government that work under the\nauspices of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nIn recent years QIOs have undertaken to facilitate continual improvement of\nhealth care services within their constituent communities in addition to their\noriginal and ongoing statutory audit/inspection role of medical peer review,\ni.e., akin to the traditional function of quality assurance. This shift in\nemphasis began in the mid-1990s and has accelerated into the 21st century.\nOriginally known as PROs (Peer Review Organizations), their name was officially\nchanged to QIOs as per the Federal Register on May 24, 2002 in large part to\nreflect this new emphasis on population-based quality improvement. CMS contracts\nwith QIOs in three year cycles, referred to as \"Statements of Work\" (SOWs). QIOs\nare staggered into three categories (round 1, round 2, and round 3) - each of\nthese three groups start their contract cycle at slightly different times\n(usually offset by several months). QIOs are currently in their Tenth SOW, which\nstarted in August, 2011 (for round 1 QIOs). The 9SOW continued the theme of\n\"transformational change\" to be achieved through accelerating the rate of\nquality improvement, raising the bar for performance, and facilitating profound\ncultural change by incorporating Health Information Technologies.\n\nAn example of current QIO quality improvement work is that of the federal\nDoctor's Office Quality Information Technology initiative (DOQ-IT) , which:\n\n:promotes the adoption of electronic health record systems and information\ntechnology in small-to-medium sized physician offices with a vision of enhancing\naccess to patient information, decision support, and reference data, as well as\nimproving patient-clinician communications.\n\nAnother example is:\n\n:national coordination and support of the Surgical Care Improvement Project\n(SCIP)[http://www.medqic.org/scip/], a hospital based quality improvement\ninitiative led by CMS that focuses on reducing the rate of adverse outcomes of\ncommon surgical procedures. This is an effort endorsed by the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC), the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the American\nHospital Association (AHA), and a large number of professional societies that\ninclude physicians, pharmacists, nurses, anesthesiologists, and others. It is\nestimated that adoption of all the \"bundles\" of suggested care in the areas of\nsurgical site infection, cardiovascular care, venous thromboembolism prevention,\nand pulmonary care, could reduce the rate of surgical morbidity and mortality by\n25% by the year 2010.\n\nQIOs also help coordinate and facilitate the timely submission of data for\npublic reporting of institution-specific quality measure performance\ninformation that is available on CMS websites such as \"Nursing Home Compare\"\nand \"Hospital Compare\".\n\nIn recent years, QIO hospital work has tended to reinforce and complement that\nof the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (based in Cambridge, MA).\n\nThe QIOs are represented nationally by the American Health Quality Association.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Quality_improvement_organizations","recorded":1362551708,"links":10,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quality improvement organizations|","Healthcare quality"],"headings":["QIO Listings","See also","References & notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf6/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["medicare","united_states"]],"members":["medicare"],"related":["Medicare_(United_States)","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services","Medical_peer_review","Quality_assurance","Electronic_health_record","Information_technology","Decision_support","Institute_for_Healthcare_Improvement","American_Health_Quality_Association","AQAF","Mountain-Pacific_Quality_Health_Foundation","Health_Services_Advisory_Group","Arkansas_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","Health_Services_Advisory_Group","Colorado_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","Qualidigm","Quality_Insights_of_Delaware","Delmarva_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","FMQAI","Georgia_Medical_Care_Foundation","Mountain-Pacific_Quality_Health_Foundation","Qualis_Health","Illinois_Foundation_for_Quality_Health_Care","Health_Care_Excel","Iowa_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","Kansas_Foundation_for_Medical_Care,_Inc.","Health_Care_Excel","EQ_Health_Solutions","Northeast_Health_Care_Quality_Foundation","Delmarva_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","MassPRO","MPRO","Stratis_Health","Information_&_Quality_Healthcare","Primaris","Mountain-Pacific_Quality_Health_Foundation","CIMRO_of_Nebraska","Northeast_Health_Care_Quality_Foundation","Healthcare_Quality_Strategies,_Inc.","New_Mexico_Medical_Review_Association","IPRO","The_Carolinas_Center_for_Medical_Excellence","North_Dakota_Health_Care_Review","Ohio_KePRO","Oklahoma_Foundation_for_Medical_Quality","Acumentra_Health","Quality_Insights_of_Pennsylvania","Quality_Improvement_Professional_Research_Organization,_Inc.","Healthcentric_Advisors","The_Carolinas_Center_for_Medical_Excellence","South_Dakota_Foundation_for_Medical_Care","TMF_Health_Quality_Institute","Northeast_Health_Care_Quality_Foundation","Virgin_Islands_Medical_Institute","Virginia_Health_Quality_Center","Qualis_Health","WVMI_Quality_Insights","MetaStar","Mountain-Pacific_Quality_Health_Foundation","Medical_informatics","QualityNet"]}
