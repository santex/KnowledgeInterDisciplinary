In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total\npreorder of objects. It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two\ndifferent objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally\nordered. For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while\ndegrees of hardness are totally ordered.\n\nBy reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it\npossible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. Thus,\nfor example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to\nan estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to\nselect the pages they are likely to want to see.\n\nAnalysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric\nstatistics.\n","title":"Ranking","headings":["Strategies for assigning rankings","Ranking in statistics","Examples of ranking","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Relevance","2: Ordinal_measurement","1: Order_theory","1: Strict_weak_ordering#Total_preorders","1: Total_order","1: Ordinal_numbers","1: Non-parametric_statistics","1: Mean","1: Borda_count","1: Statistics","1: Numerical","1: Ordinal_scale","1: Order_statistics","1: Statistical_test","1: Friedman_test","1: Kruskal–Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance","1: Rank_product","1: Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient","1: Wilcoxon_rank-sum_test","1: Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test","1: Microsoft_Excel","1: Politics","1: List_of_international_rankings","1: FIFA_World_Rankings","1: World_Football_Elo_Ratings","1: Olympic_Games","1: National_Olympic_Committee","1: Olympic_medal_rankings","1: Snooker","1: Snooker_world_rankings","1: Ice_hockey","1: IIHF_World_Ranking","1: Golf","1: Official_World_Golf_Rankings","1: Liquidation","1: Capital_structure","1: Capital_note","1: Senior_debt","1: Subordinated_debt","1: Search_engine","1: HITS_algorithm","1: PageRank","1: TrustRank","1: Heuristic","1: URL","1: Anchor_text","1: Webometrics","1: Webometrics_Ranking_of_World_Universities","1: Video_gaming","1: Rank_up","1: TrueSkill","1: Bibliogram","1: Academic_journal#Ranking","1: Impact_factor","1: League_table"]}
