It is intended to provide a\nclassification for works that are within British obscenity laws, but exceed what\nthe BBFC considers acceptable for its 18 certificate. In practice, this means\nhardcore pornography.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1984 Video Recordings Act all non-exempt videos sold or\ndistributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC. The\ndistibutor must decide whether a video is\nexempt. [http://www.bbfc.co.uk/faq/index.php BBFC FAQ - What does the 'E'\nsymbol mean, and it is an official category?] Uncertificated recordings\nare not illegal, regardless of content (except where the content is actually\nillegal itself), but supply (i.e. sale, rental, loan or gift) of them is. The\nR18 certificate is the most restrictive of the certificates, and videos given\nthis certificate may only be shown in licensed\ncinemas, [http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/c_R18.php bbfc - the official\nwebsite of the bbfc. classification for entertainment, movies and video\ngames] or sold direct to the buyer in person in licensed sex shops, and\nare not allowed to be sold by mail order or other remote means such as by\ntelephone or over the Internet.

In particular, it\nprohibits: http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/r18/\n* Works judged to be illegal under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.\n* Material deemed likely to encourage an interest in \"sexually abusive\"\n  activity, which can include adults role-playing as non adults.\n* Depiction of non-consensual acts (including role-play).\n* Use of bondage which prevents indicating a withdrawal of consent (e.g., gags).\n* Infliction of pain which may cause lasting physical harm, whether real or\n  simulated.\n* Penetration by any option deemed likely to cause physical harm.\n* Depiction of any sexual threats, humiliation or abuse, even if consensual,\n  unless clearly depicted as a consensual role-playing game. R18 does allow for\n  the depiction of most sex acts, including vaginal sexual intercourse, oral\n  sex, masturbation, and anal sex, between any combination of men and women, and\n  some allowance may be made for moderate consensual BDSM. As of 2008, the\n  broadcasting of R18 material is prohibited, even on encrypted digital\n  channels. Most cuts made by the BBFC are in the R18\n  category (e.g., 13.6% of R18 videos were cut in 2011, compared with 7.5% for\n  18, and 0.5% or less for other categories).
