{"cursor":"6567","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Resin casting' is a method of plastic casting where a mold is filled with a\nliquid synthetic resin, which then hardens. It is primarily used for small-scale\nproduction like industrial prototypes and dentistry. It can be done by amateur\nhobbyists with little initial investment, and is used in the production of\ncollectible toys, models and figures, as well as small-scale jewelry production.\n\nThe synthetic resin for such processes is a monomer for making a plastic\nthermosetting polymer. During the setting process, the liquid monomer\npolymerizes into the polymer, thereby hardening into a solid.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Resin_casting","recorded":1362481525,"links":14,"instances":["manufacturing","process","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plastics industry","Casting (manufacturing)","Sculpture techniques"],"headings":["Process","Collectibles and models","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Silicone_mold_resin_cast_figure.jpg/250px-Silicone_mold_resin_cast_figure.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/SHKANGLE.JPG/250px-SHKANGLE.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molding","process"],["curing","chemistry"],["sprue","manufacturing"]],"members":["sprue","molding","curing"],"related":["Casting","Molding_(process)","Synthetic_resin","Hobby","Monomer","Thermosetting_polymer","Thermosetting_polymer","Polymerization","Curing_(chemistry)","Polystyrene","Polyurethane","Epoxy","Polyester_resin","Acrylic_resin","Silicone_resin","Acrylic_resin","Methyl_methacrylate","Acrylic_glass","Acrylic_trophy","Styrene","Polystyrene","Flexible_mold","Latex","Silicone","Vacuum_chamber","Injection_molding","Designer_toys","Garage_kit","Ball-jointed_doll","Scale_model","Rail_transport_modelling","Model_aircraft","Ship_model","Sculpting","Clay","Resin","Exothermic_reaction","Release_agent","Sprue_(manufacturing)","Dental_composite","Resin_dispensing","Spin_casting"]}
