The first and last of these houses is called an end terrace, and is often\na different layout from the houses in the middle.\n\nTerrace housing can be found throughout the world, though it is in abundance in\nEurope, and extensive examples can be found in North America and Oceania.\nSometimes associated with the working class, historical and reproduction\nterraces have increasingly become part of the process of gentrification in\ncertain inner-city areas.<ref></ref>\n",
