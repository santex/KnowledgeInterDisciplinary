{"cursor":"14499","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe concept of relation has a long and complicated history in philosophy. For\nthe ancient Greeks the relation between one thing and another was just one of\nmany ways in which any particular thing could be described. An interest was also\ndeveloping at the time in the difference between the relations and the things\nthemselves culminating in one view that the things in themselves cannot be known\nexcept through their relations. The debate continues into modern philosophy with\nfurther investigation into types of relation and whether relations exist only in\nthe mind or the real world or both.\n\nAn understanding of types of relation is important to an understanding of\nrelations between many things including that between people, communities and the\nwider world. Most of these are complex relations but of the simpler, analytical\nrelations out of which they are formed there are generally held to be three\ntypes, although opinion on the number may differ. The three types are spatial\nrelations which include geometry and number, relations of cause and effect, and\nthe classificatory relations of similarity and difference that underlie\nknowledge. Going by different names in the sciences, Perreault J. Categories\nand Relators (International Classification, vol 21, No 4, Frankfurt 1994)\npp.189ff where Perreault talks of ordinal relations (e.g. dimensions),\ndeterminative relations (e.g. activities) and subsumptive relations (e.g. types\nand kinds) mathematics, Piaget J. Structuralism (tr. Maschler C.,\nRoutledge and Kegan Paul, London 1971) pp 24-25 where Piaget refers to the\nmathematicians, Nicholas Bourbaki, using topological structures (derived from\ngeometrical relations), order structures (from predecessor-successor relations)\nand algebraic structures (including sets and sub-sets) and the arts Norberg-\nSchulz C., Intentions in Architecture (Allen & Unwin Ltd., London 1963) Besides\nsuch headings as Form (geometrical and spatial relations), Building Task\n(functional relations) and Semantics (relations of meaning) the book refers to\nCharles Morris's division of semiology into syntactics (formal relation of\nsigns), pragmatics (use and effect of signs) and semantics (the relation between\nthe sign and reality) they can be thought of as three large families and\nit is the history of these that will be dealt with here.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Relation_(history_of_concept)","recorded":1374858514,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#Ancient_Greeks","#Scholasticism_to_the_Enlightenment","#Modern_Developments","#References","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","#cite_note-22","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","#cite_note-27","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-28","#cite_note-29","#cite_note-30","#cite_note-31","#cite_note-32","#cite_note-33","#cite_note-34","#cite_note-35","#cite_note-36","#cite_note-37","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","#cite_ref-13","#cite_ref-14","#cite_ref-15","#cite_ref-16","#cite_ref-17","#cite_ref-18","#cite_ref-19","#cite_ref-20","#cite_ref-21","#cite_ref-22","#cite_ref-23","#cite_ref-24","#cite_ref-25","#cite_ref-26","#cite_ref-27","#cite_ref-28","#cite_ref-29","#cite_ref-30","#cite_ref-31","#cite_ref-32","#cite_ref-33","#cite_ref-34","#cite_ref-35","#cite_ref-36","#cite_ref-37","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&oldid=557208776","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Philosophical_concepts","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relation+%28history+of+concept%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relation+%28history+of+concept%29","/wiki/Relation_(history_of_concept)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Relation_(history_of_concept)","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Relation_(history_of_concept)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Relation_(history_of_concept)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&oldid=557208776","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Relation_%28history_of_concept%29&id=557208776","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Relation+%28history+of+concept%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Relation+%28history+of+concept%29&oldid=557208776&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Relation_(history_of_concept)&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(history_of_concept)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wi
