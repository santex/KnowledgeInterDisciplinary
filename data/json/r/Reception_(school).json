{"cursor":"1932","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Reception' or 'Primary 1' or 'FS2' ('foundation second year') is the first year\nof primary school in the United Kingdom (except Scotland) and South Australia.\nIt is preceded by nursery and is followed by Year One in England and Wales or\nPrimary 2 in Northern Ireland. Pupils in Reception are usually aged between four\nand five. Children start school either in the term or in the year in which they\nreach five, depending on the policy of the Local Education Authority. Reception\nis the final part of the Foundation Stage of education.\n\nMost areas admit entire year groups in September, regardless of which month they\nwere born in, meaning that some pupils will be starting primary school in the\nmonth of their fifth birthday, while others will be 11 months away from this\nmilestone.\n\nOther areas admit Reception pupils in the term of their fifth birthday, while\nsome admit pupils in September if they were born between September and February,\nand in January if they were born between March and August.\n\nThere is no reception year in Scotland as children progress directly from\nNursery to Primary 1 (equivalent to English Year One) in the August nearest\ntheir fifth birthday. Generally this means that a complete intake into P1 ranges\nfrom four and a half to five and a half years old. It is also possible for\nparents of children born in January and February to defer admission by one year,\nso as they start at five and half rather than four and a half.\n\nPreviously, children in England and Wales had started school later than children\nin Northern Ireland, where the starting age was generally four, dependent on the\ndate of the child's birthday.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, this is the year children start Primary 1.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Reception_(school)","recorded":1364118770,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Primary_school","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/South_Australia","/wiki/Nursery_school","/wiki/Year_One_(School)","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Local_Education_Authority","/wiki/Foundation_Stage","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Template:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/wiki/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Education_in_England","/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Education_in_Wales","/wiki/History_of_education_in_England","/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/History_of_education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Education_in_Wales","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_England","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Universities_in_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Wales","/wiki/Universities_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Academy_(English_school)","/wiki/Comprehensive_school","/wiki/English_medium_education","/wiki/Free_school_(England)","/wiki/Gaelic_medium_education_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Grammar_Schools","/wiki/Welsh_medium_education","/wiki/File:Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-edu-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:UK-edu-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-edu-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&oldid=507198656","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Educational_years","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_education_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reception+%28school%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reception+%28school%29","/wiki/Reception_(school)","/wiki/Talk:Reception_(school)","#","/wiki/Reception_(school)","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Reception_(school)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Reception_(school)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&oldid=507198656","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Reception_%28school%29&id=507198656","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Reception+%28school%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Reception+%28school%29&oldid=507198656&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Reception_(school)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wik
