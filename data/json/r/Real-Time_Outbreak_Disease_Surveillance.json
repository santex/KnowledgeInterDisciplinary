It is \"prototype developed at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh where real-time clinical data from emergency\ndepartments within a geographic region can be integrated to provide an\ninstantaneous picture of symptom patterns and early detection of epidemic\nevents.\" Public Health-Related Activities at the\n[http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/NHII/phrelated.html US HHS government website]. Accessed\nDecember 2, 2010.\n\nRODS uses a combination of various monitoring tools .\n# The first tool is a moving average with a 120-day sliding phase-I-window. The\n# second tool is a nonstandard combination of CUSUM and EWMA, where an EWMA is\n# used to predict next-day counts, and a CuSum monitors the residuals from these\n# predictions. The third monitoring tool in RODS is a recursive least squares\n# (RLS) algorithm, which fits an autoregressive model to the counts and updates\n# estimates continuously by minimizing prediction error. A Shewhart I-chart is\n# then applied to the residuals, using a threshold of 4 standard deviations. The\n# fourth tool in RODS implements a wavelet approach, which decomposes the time\n# series using Haar wavelets, and uses the lowest resolution to remove long-term\n# trends from the raw series. The residuals are then monitored using an ordinary\n# Shewhart I-chart with a threshold of 4 standard deviations.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Real-Time_Outbreak_Disease_Surveillance","recorded":1362501632,"links":12,"instances":["academic_field"],"pdf":["http://homepage.bzst.com/system/files/Technometrics+StatChallengesBiosurveillanceRevised-II.pdf"],"categories":["Public health","Epidemics","Medical statistics","Epidemiological study projects"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["informatics","academic_field"]],"members":["informatics"],"related":["Biosurveillance","University_of_Pittsburgh","Informatics_(academic_field)","Epidemic","Moving_average","CUSUM","EWMA","Recursive_least_squares","Autoregressive_model","Prediction_error","Standard_deviations","Wavelet","Haar_wavelet"]}
