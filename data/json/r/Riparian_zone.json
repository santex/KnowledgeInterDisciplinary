{"cursor":"15124","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:\"Riparian\" redirects here. For the legal doctrine, see \"[[riparian water\n:rights]].\"\n\n\n.]]\n\nA 'riparian zone' or 'riparian area' is the interface between land and a river\nor stream. 'Riparian' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen\nterrestrial biomes of the earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river\nmargins and banks are called riparian vegetation, characterized by hydrophilic\nplants. Riparian zones are significant in ecology, environmental management, and\ncivil engineering because of their role in soil conservation, their habitat\nbiodiversity, and the influence they have on fauna and aquatic ecosystems,\nincluding grassland, woodland, wetland or even non-vegetative. In some regions\nthe terms 'riparian woodland', '[[riparian forest]]', 'riparian buffer zone,' or\n'riparian strip' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word \"riparian\"\nis derived from Latin [[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]], meaning river bank.\n","linknr":617,"url":"Riparian_zone","recorded":1362685751,"links":40,"instances":["geography","ecology","plant","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://krpcds.org/report/amita.pdf","http://krpcds.org/report/amita.pdf","http://krpcds.org/report/amita.pdf","http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/forst2/mf2724.pdf"],"categories":["Riparian zone| A","Terrestrial biomes","Conservation","Hydrology","Water streams","Rivers","Habitats","Habitat (ecology) terminology","Water and the environment","Freshwater ecology"],"headings":["Characteristics","Roles and functions","Role in logging","Vegetation","Repair and restoration","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Riparian_strip.jpg/220px-Riparian_strip.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Willow_Creek%2C_Trout_Creek_Mountains%2C_Oregon.jpg/220px-Willow_Creek%2C_Trout_Creek_Mountains%2C_Oregon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Cottonwood_Creek%2C_BLM%2C_Oregon%2C_1988.jpg/336px-Cottonwood_Creek%2C_BLM%2C_Oregon%2C_1988.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Cottonwood_Creek%2C_BLM%2C_Oregon%2C_2002.jpg/300px-Cottonwood_Creek%2C_BLM%2C_Oregon%2C_2002.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bank","geography"],["field","agriculture"],["habitat","ecology"],["iris","plant"]],"members":["bank","habitat","iris","field"],"related":["River","Stream","Biome","Bank_(geography)","Aquatic_plant","Ecology","Environmental_management","Civil_engineering","Soil_conservation","Habitat","Biodiversity","Fauna","Aquatic_ecosystem","Grassland","Woodland","Wetland","Latin","Land_rehabilitation","Biofiltration","Sediment","Surface_runoff","Erosion","Aquatic_animal","Construction","Agriculture","Silviculture","Erosion_control","Wetland","Hydric_soil","Biodiversity","Biodiversity_Action_Plan","Water_quality","Groundwater","Nitrate","Denitrification","Fertilizer","Field_(agriculture)","Ecosystem","Meander","Turbidity","Wildlife","Habitat_(ecology)","Wildlife_corridor","Fodder","Landscape","Plant_litter","Thermal_pollution","Geomorphology","Foreshoreway","Climate_change","Urbanisation","Logging","Soil_erosion","Root","Climate","Oregon","Trout","Herb","Tree","Shrub","Iris_(plant)","Bulrush","Spikerush","Asia","Temperate_New_South_Wales","Australia","Central_Europe","Natural_Sequence_Farming","Upper_Hunter","New_South_Wales","Seep","Ecological_succession","Pioneer_species","Accropode","Bioswale","Bosque","Constructed_wetland","Floodplain","Gallery_forest","Green_belt","Outwelling","Riprap","Riparian_water_rights","Vernal_pool","Schiff,_S.L."]}
