A natural resource is often\ncharacterized by amounts of biodiversity and geodiversity existent in various\necosystems.\n\nNatural resources are derived from the environment. Some of them are essential\nfor our survival while most are used for satisfying our wants. Natural resources\nmay be further classified in different ways.\n\nNatural resources are materials and components (something that can be used) that\ncan be found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of\nnatural resources (at its fundamental level). A natural resource may exist as a\nseparate entity such as fresh water, and air, as well as a living organism such\nas a fish, or it may exist in an alternate form which must be processed to\nobtain the resource such as metal ores, oil, and most forms of energy.\n\nThere is much debate worldwide over natural resource allocations, this is partly\ndue to increasing scarcity (depletion of resources) but also because the\nexportation of natural resources is the basis for many economies (particularly\nfor developed nations such as Australia).\n\nSome natural resources such as sunlight and air can be found everywhere, and are\nknown as ubiquitous resources. However, most resources only occur in small\nsporadic areas, and are referred to as localized resources. There are very few\nresources that are considered inexhaustible (will not run out in foreseeable\nfuture) – these are solar radiation, geothermal energy, and air (though\naccess to clean air may not be). The vast majority of resources are exhaustible,\nwhich means they have a finite quantity, and can be depleted if managed\nimproperly.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Resource_extraction","recorded":1362669760,"links":62,"instances":["ethic","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.272.aspx.pdf","http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.272.aspx.pdf","http://www.michaelsoule.com/resource_files/85/85_resource_file1.pdf","http://pdf.wri.org/worldresources_2005_journalist_guide.pdf","http://pdf.wri.org/worldresources_2005_journalist_guide.pdf","http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/cg/cg2011/pdf/chapter3.pdf","http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/cg/cg2011/pdf/chapter3.pdf"],"categories":["Natural resources","Resources"],"headings":["Classification","Extraction","Depletion","Protection","Management","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Rainforest_Fatu_Hiva.jpg/220px-Rainforest_Fatu_Hiva.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Carson_Fall_Mt_Kinabalu.jpg/220px-Carson_Fall_Mt_Kinabalu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Ocean_waves.jpg/220px-Ocean_waves.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Udachnaya_pipe.JPG/220px-Udachnaya_pipe.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Windmills_D1-D4_-_Thornton_Bank.jpg/220px-Windmills_D1-D4_-_Thornton_Bank.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conservation","ethic"],["range","biology"]],"members":["conservation","range"],"related":["Malaysia","Hydroelectric","Wave_power","Renewable_energy","Open-pit_mining","Diamond","Siberia","Natural_environment","Nature","Resource","Biodiversity","Geodiversity","Ecosystems","Biosphere","Forests","Animals","Fossil_fuels","Coal","Petroleum","Water","Air","Ores","Gold","Iron","Copper","Silver","Petroleum","Wood_processing","Hydrogen","Renewable_resources","Non-renewable_resources","Recycled","Traditional_economy","Primary_sector","Raw_material","Add_value","Hunting","Animal_trapping","Mining","Oil_and_gas_drilling","Forestry","Resource_boom","Dutch_disease","Resource_curse","Belgium","Mining","Petroleum_extraction","Fishing","Agriculture","Theodore_Roosevelt","Conservation_biology","Species","Habitats","Extinction","BioScience","Natural_resource_management","University_of_California_at_San_Diego","Habitat_conservation","Land_management","Conservation_(ethic)","Habitat","Plant","Animal","Conservation_reliant_species","Extinction","Habitat_fragmentation","Range_(biology)","Natural_resource_management","Natural_resources","Water","Soil","Plant","Animal","Quality_of_life","Environmental_movement","Resource"]}
