{"cursor":"1443","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Resolution' is the metrical phenomenon in classical poetry of replacing a\nlongum with two brevia. It is generally found in Greek lyric poetry and in Greek\nand Roman drama, most frequently in comedy.\n\nIt should not be confused with a biceps, which is a point in a meter which can\nequally be two shorts or a long, as is found in the dactylic hexameter. The\nbiceps is freely able to be two shorts or a long, while resolution, particularly\nin tragedy, can only occur within very restricted situations. Two resolved longa\nin the same line is very unusual, for instance, while a biceps that is two\nshorts can freely be followed by another biceps that is two shorts. Also, two\nshorts that resolve into a long are almost always within the same word-unit.\n\nOne example from iambic trimeter:\n\n:\n: u - u - u u u u - - - u - (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 41)\n\nMarking metra with | and using \"uu\" to mark the resolution, we can take this as:\n\n: u - u - | u uu u - | - - u -\n\nNote that the resolved pair is the word á½Î½Î¿Î¼', so the resolution stays within\nthe same word-unit.\n","linknr":82,"url":"Resolution_(meter)","recorded":1362901652,"links":10,"instances":["prosody","poetry","language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Poetic rhythm"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meter","poetry"],["greek","language"],["biceps","prosody"]],"members":["biceps","meter","greek"],"related":["Meter_(poetry)","Longum","Brevis","Greek_(language)","Lyric_poetry","Ancient_Greece","Ancient_Rome","Biceps_(prosody)","Dactylic_hexameter","Iambic_trimeter"]}
