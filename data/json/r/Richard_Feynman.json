He was the brother of Joan Feynman. }}\n\n'Richard Phillips Feynman' (; May 11, 1918 â February 15, 1988) was\nan American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral\nformulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the\nphysics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in\nparticle physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the\ndevelopment of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger\nand Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He\ndeveloped a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical\nexpressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became\nknown as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-\nknown scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists\nworldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten\ngreatest physicists of all time.\n\nHe assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel\nthat investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work\nin theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of\nquantum computing, Quantum computation. David Deutsch, Physics\nWorld, 1/6/92 and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. .\nHe held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology.\n\nFeynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures,\nnotably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called, [[There's Plenty of Room\nat the Bottom]], and the three volume publication of his undergraduate\nlectures, [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]. Feynman also became known\nthrough his semi-autobiographical books, [[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]\nand [[What Do You Care What Other People Think?]], and books written about him,\nsuch as [[Tuva or Bust!]].\n","linknr":1332,"url":"Richard_Feynman","recorded":1362480446,"links":109,"instances":["scientist","drug","abstract","play","nuclear_test","particle_physics","journal","physics","nanotechnology","journal","physics"],"pdf":["http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/02/CargoCult.pdf","http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/02/CargoCult.pdf","http://www.xootic.nl/magazine/jul-2003/west.pdf","http://www.xootic.nl/magazine/jul-2003/west.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1999/phyback99.pdf"],"categories":["Richard
