He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, [http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/content/about-fellows/emeritus-and-\nhonorary-fellows Emeritus and Honorary Fellows] of New College, Oxford and\nwas the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science\nfrom 1995 until 2008.\n\nDawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book [[The Selfish Gene]], which\npopularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term [[meme]].\nIn 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that\nthe phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's\nbody, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other\norganisms; this concept is presented in his book [[The Extended Phenotype]].\n\nDawkins is an atheist , a vice president of the British Humanist Association,\nand a supporter of the Brights movement. He is well known for his\ncriticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book [[The Blind\nWatchmaker]], he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the\nexistence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living\norganisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind\nwatchmaker.\n\nHe has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television\nand radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics. In his 2006 book\n[[The God Delusion]], Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost\ncertainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusionâ\"a fixed false\nbelief\". As of January 2010, the English-language version had sold\nmore than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages.\n*
