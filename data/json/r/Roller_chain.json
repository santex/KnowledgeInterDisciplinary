It consists of a\nseries of short cylindrical rollers held together by side links. It is driven by\na toothed wheel called a sprocket. It is a simple, reliable, and\nefficient As much as 98% efficient under ideal conditions, according to\n means of power transmission.\n\nThough Hans Renold is credited with inventing the roller chain in 1880, sketches\nby Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century show a chain with a roller\nbearing. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci made sketches of what\nappears to be the first steel chain. These chains were probably designed to\ntransmit pulling, not wrapping, power because they consist only of plates and\npins and have metal fittings. However, da Vinci's sketch does show a roller\nbearing.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Roller_chain","recorded":1362476868,"links":28,"instances":["chain","bearing","fluid_conveyance","mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chain drives","Mechanical power transmission","Mechanical power control"],"headings":["Construction of the chain","Lubrication","Variants in design","Use","Wear","Chain strength","Chain standards","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Chain.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/The_sketch_%28drawing%29_of_roller_chain%2C_Leonardo_da_Vinci.jpg/250px-The_sketch_%28drawing%29_of_roller_chain%2C_Leonardo_da_Vinci.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Kettenvergleich.jpg/330px-Kettenvergleich.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Vector-nozzle-sea-harrier-jet-common.jpg/220px-Vector-nozzle-sea-harrier-jet-common.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/8/6c87196d74a447e6a4119daf81c1d365.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tube","fluid_conveyance"],["link","chain"],["bushing","bearing"],["belt","mechanical"]],"members":["link","bushing","tube","belt"],"related":["Leonardo_da_Vinci","Chain_drive","Conveyor","Wire","Tube_(fluid_conveyance)","Drawing","Printing_press","Car","Motorcycle","Bicycle","Sprocket","Hans_Renold","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Link_(chain)","Bushing_(bearing)","Sprocket","Tsubakimoto_Chain_Co.","O-ring","List_of_agricultural_machinery","Chain_saw","Genericized_trademark","American_National_Standards_Institute","Inch","Horseshoe_clip","Belt_(mechanical)","Bicycle_chain","Chain_tool","Motorcycle","Toothed_belt","Shaft_drive","Automobile","Engine","United_States","Camshaft","Crankshaft","Gear","Timing_belt","Forklift","Leaf_chain","Chainsaw","Saw_chain","Harrier_Jump_Jet","Thrust_vectoring","Timing_light","Derailleur_gears","Tensile_strength","Standards_organization","ANSI","Interchangeable_parts","Preferred_number"]}
