It\n catalyzes the transcription of DNA to synthesize precursors of mRNA and most\n snRNA and microRNA. A 550 kDa complex of 12\n subunits, RNAP II is the most studied type of RNA polymerase. A wide range of\n transcription factors are required for it to bind to its promoters and begin\n transcription.\n","linknr":514,"url":"RNA_polymerase_II","recorded":1362481187,"links":25,"instances":["coactivator","biology","genetics","ctd"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/273/43/27757.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/273/43/27757.pdf"],"categories":["Enzymes","Proteins","Gene expression"],"headings":["Subunits","Assembly","Kinetics","Holoenzyme","Control by chromatin structure","Protein Complexes Involved","N-terminus","C-terminus","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/RNA_polymerase_II.fcgi.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/RPB1subunits.fcgi.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["mediator","coactivator"],["transcription","genetics"],["rna_polymerase_ii_holoenzyme#c-terminal_domain","ctd"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["mediator","promoter","transcription"],"related":["Enzyme","Eukaryote","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA","MRNA","SnRNA","MicroRNA","KDa","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_factors","Promoter_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","Eukaryote","Enzyme","Human","POLR2A","Gene","C-terminus","Transcription_(genetics)","POLR2B","POLR2C","POLR2J","Gene","POLR2E","POLR2G","POLR2I","POLR2L","POLR2J","POLR2J2","POLR2K","Enzyme","Michaelis-Menten_constant","Turnover_number","Î‘-amanitin","Eukaryote","Protein","Transcription_factor","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Preinitiation_complex","Gene","Promoter_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","Mediator_(coactivator)","Chromatin","Histone","Posttranslational_modification","Transcription_(genetics)","Genes","Ubiquitin","N-terminus","Protein","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Amine","C-terminus","Ribosome","Protein_biosynthesis","Zip_code","Peptidase","C-terminus","Protein","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Carboxyl_group","Amine","Dehydration_reaction","N-terminal_end","ER_retention","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Secretory_pathway","Posttranslational_modification","Lipid","Transmembrane_domain","POLR2A","5'_cap","Messenger_RNA","Spliceosome","RNA_splicing","RNA_polymerase_I","RNA_polymerase_III","RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme","Post-transcriptional_modification","Transcription_(genetics)","Eukaryotic_transcription"]}
