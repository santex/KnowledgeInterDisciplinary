{"cursor":"14156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 7301 router and a Juniper M7i, part of the K root-server instance at AMS-IX.]]\n A 'root name server' is a name server for the Domain Name System's root zone.\n It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other\n requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the\n appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part\n of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating\n (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in\n communication between Internet hosts.\n\nA combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical\nsize of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a\ndecision to limit the number of root servers to 13 logical servers. To serve the\nneeds of the public Internet worldwide, the number of root server instances is\n356 .","linknr":304,"url":"Root_name_server","recorded":1362551615,"links":29,"instances":["dns","internet","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://dns.measurement-factory.com/writings/wessels-pam2003-paper.pdf","http://dns.measurement-factory.com/writings/wessels-pam2003-paper.pdf","http://www.icann.org/committees/security/sac018.pdf"],"categories":["Domain name system"],"headings":["Root domain","Resolver operation","Root server addresses","Root server supervision","Root zone file","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Ams-ix.k.root-servers.net.jpg/290px-Ams-ix.k.root-servers.net.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Root-current.svg/500px-Root-current.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resolver","dns"],["string","computer_science"],["autonomous_system","internet"]],"members":["resolver","autonomous_system","string"],"related":["Juniper_Networks","Amsterdam_Internet_Exchange","Name_server","Domain_Name_System","DNS_root_zone","Authoritative_name_server","Top-level_domain","Resolver_(DNS)","IP_address","Internet_host","User_Datagram_Protocol","Domain_Name_System","Internet","Root_domain","String_(computer_science)","Fully_qualified_domain_name","Full_stop","Generic_top-level_domain","Country_code_top-level_domain",".arpa","Name_space",".test","Internationalized_domain_name","Cached","PDF","Anycast","IPv4","IPv6","Autonomous_system_(Internet)","Verisign","Anycast","BIND","University_of_Southern_California","Information_Sciences_Institute","Marina_del_Rey,_California","BIND","Cogent_Communications","Anycast","BIND","University_of_Maryland,_College_Park","College_Park,_Maryland","BIND","NASA","Anycast","BIND","Internet_Systems_Consortium","Anycast","BIND","Defense_Information_Systems_Agency","Anycast","BIND","United_States_Army_Research_Laboratory","Aberdeen_Proving_Ground","NSD","Netnod_Internet_Exchange_i_Sverige","Anycast","BIND","Verisign","Anycast","BIND","RIPE_NCC","Anycast","NSD","ICANN","Anycast","NSD","WIDE_Project","Anycast","BIND","User_Datagram_Protocol","Extension_mechanisms_for_DNS","Anycast","Alternative_DNS_root","AlterNIC","ICANN","DNS_Backbone_DDoS_Attacks","ICANN","United_States_Department_of_Commerce","Domain_Name_System","Kilobyte","Domain_Name_System","IP_address","Name_server","Top-level_domains","Country_code_top-level_domain","Distributed_denial_of_service_attacks_on_root_nameservers","EDNS0","Internet_backbone","Open_Root_Server_Network","Blackhole_server"]}
