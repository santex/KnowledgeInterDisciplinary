Although Reaction released only\nthree albums, one EP and eighteen singles in its brief existence, its roster\nincluded two of the most popular British bands of the time, The Who and Cream.\nThe label's first single, the Who's \"Substitute\", was released several times\nwith different B-sides due to the band's legal dispute with their former record\nproducer, Shel Talmy. This experience could be seen as one of the deciding\nfactor in the Who's manager's Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp deciding to form their\nown Track Records label which was also distributed by Polydor Records. Polydor's\ninvolvement with these two \"independent\" labels can be seen as a learning\nprocess by Polydor who were interested in expanding their base and had little or\nno experience in the 1960s pop/rock market; at the time, most of their business\nwas done in the easy listening genre, as exemplified by Bert Kaempfert.\n\nStigwood operated the RSO Records label in the 1970s and 1980s. As with\nReaction, RSO was distributed through Polydor Records.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Reaction_Records","recorded":1362374757,"links":18,"instances":["song","band","song","band","the_who_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["British record labels","Record labels established in 1966","Record labels disestablished in 1967","Rock record labels"],"headings":["Discography","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/Reactrecs.jpg/100px-Reactrecs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/MusicalnotesUK.svg/35px-MusicalnotesUK.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cream","band"],["substitute","the_who_song"],["substitute","the_who_song"],["the_birds","band"],["happy_jack","song"],["strange_brew","song"]],"members":["strange_brew","cream","happy_jack","the_birds","substitute"],"related":["Polydor_Records","Robert_Stigwood","Polydor_Records","World_music","United_Kingdom","Independent_record_label","United_Kingdom","Record_label","Robert_Stigwood","The_Who","Cream_(band)","Substitute_(The_Who_song)","Record_producer","Shel_Talmy","Track_Records","Polydor_Records","Pop_music","Rock_music","Easy_listening","Bert_Kaempfert","RSO_Records","Polydor_Records","Substitute_(The_Who_song)","Graham_Bond","Paul_Nicholas","Paul_Nicholas","I'm_a_Boy","The_Birds_(band)","Paul_Nicholas","Wrapping_Paper","Happy_Jack_(song)","I_Feel_Free","Paul_Nicholas","Billy_J._Kramer","Strange_Brew_(song)","Tales_of_Brave_Ulysses","Paul_Nicholas","Marian_Montgomery","Ready_Steady_Who","List_of_record_labels"]}
