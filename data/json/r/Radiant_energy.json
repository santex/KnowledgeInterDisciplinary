Federal standard 1037C The quantity of\nradiant energy may be calculated by integrating radiant flux (or power) with\nrespect to time and, like all forms of energy, its SI unit is the joule. The\nterm is used particularly when radiation is emitted by a source into the\nsurrounding environment. Radiant energy may be visible or invisible to the human\neye.
