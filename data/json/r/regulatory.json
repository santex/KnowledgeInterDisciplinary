      "text" : "\n\n'Regulation' may refer to the following:\n# A process of the promulgation, monitoring, and enforcement of rules,\n# established by primary and/or delegated legislation. A written instrument\n# containing rules having the force of law.\n\nRegulation creates, limits, or constrains a right, creates or limits a duty, or\nallocates a responsibility. Regulation can take many forms: legal restrictions\npromulgated by a government authority, contractual obligations that bind many\nparties (for example, \"insurance regulations\" that arise out of contracts\nbetween insurers and their insureds), self-regulation by an industry such as\nthrough a trade association, social regulation (e.g. norms), co-regulation, third-\nparty regulation, certification, accreditation or market regulation. In its\nlegal sense regulation can and should be distinguished from primary legislation\n(by Parliament of elected legislative body) on the one hand and judge-made law\non the other.<ref>Levi-Faur, David, Regulation and Regulatory Governance,\nJerusalem Papers in Regulation and Governance, No.1, 2010</ref>\n\nRegulation mandated by a state attempts to produce outcomes which might not\notherwise occur, produce or prevent outcomes in different places to what might\notherwise occur, or produce or prevent outcomes in different timescales than\nwould otherwise occur. In this way, regulations can be seen as implementation\nartifacts of policy statements. Common examples of regulation include controls\non market entries, prices, wages, development approvals, pollution effects,\nemployment for certain people in certain industries, standards of production for\ncertain goods, the military forces and services. The economics of imposing or\nremoving regulations relating to markets is analysed in regulatory economics.\n",
