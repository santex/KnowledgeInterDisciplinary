In the early days, the\nstation had an entirely civil function and was the largest in Canada with ten\nwar-surplus aircraft.

In late 1922 when the Air Board and the\nfledgling [[Canadian Air Force (1920â1924)|Canadian Air Force]] was reorganized,\noperations at High River became the responsibility of the Canadian Air Force.\nAnd when the Royal Canadian Air Force was formed in 1924, the station became a\nRoyal Canadian Air Force station: RCAF Station High River.\n\n\nMost of the flying consisted of fire-spotting forestry patrols over the\nmountains and foothills to the west. The aircraft used was the DH.4. Late in\n1924 Avro Vipers began to be used, and in 1928 De Havilland Cirrus 60 Moths were\nadded. Initially, two patrols were made daily, to the Clearwater, Bow and\nCrowsnest Forest Reserves. One patrol flew north as far as the Clearwater River,\nand one south to the International Boundary. Eventually substations were built\nat Pincher Creek in the south and Eckville in the north to increase patrol\nefficiency. In 1928, a substation was constructed at Grande Prairie to enable\nthe patrolling of the Peace River Country. Of the early Canadian air stations,\nHigh River was the most active, with 215 flights flown on forest\npatrols. Roberts, p. 44.\n\nOther responsibilities of the station included aerial photography, parachute\nexperimentation, aircraft testing, and aerial pesticide spraying. In the early\n1920s the station became involved with experimenting with radio. The most\npowerful radio transmitter in North America began operating from the High River\nAir Station in 1922.\n\nAfter jurisdiction for natural resource management was transferred to the\nProvince of Alberta in 1930, fire towers were built and spotting aircraft were\nno longer necessary. Fire-spotting patrols gradually ceased. Other activities\nsuch as aircraft testing continued until the station closed on March 31, 1931.\nThe station did, however, remain as an aircraft storage facility until the\nbeginning of the Second World War when the station was reactivated to train\npilots for wartime service.\n\nRCAF Station High River was a major participant in British Commonwealth Air\nTraining Plan aircrew training during the war. No. 5 Elementary Flying Training\nSchool (EFTS) was established at High River in 1941 using civilian instructors\nfrom the Calgary Aero Club. De Havilland Tiger Moths were the first aircraft\nused. They were later replaced by Fairchild Cornells. An unprepared emergency\nand practice landing field was located on the then dry lakebed of nearby Frank\nLake. Fencelines and Furrows, p. 11.\n\nThe High River aerodrome closed in October 1944. The site is no longer a\nfunctioning airport and is used for private commercial purposes. It should\nnot be confused with the present High River Airport, which is in a\ndifferent location.\n","linknr":127,"url":"RCAF_Station_High_River","recorded":1375083802,"links":["/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Canada_Alberta_location_map_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Canada_Alberta_location_map_2.svg/240px-Canada_Alberta_location_map_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Airplane_silhouette.svg/8px-Airplane_silhouette.svg.png","/wiki/File:High_River_Air_Station.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/High_River_Air_Station.jpg/220px-High_River_Air_Station.jpg","/wiki/File:High_River_Air_Station.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","/wiki/High_River,_Alberta","/wiki/Alberta","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Air_Board_(Canada)","/wiki/Morley,_Alberta","/wiki/Civil_aviation","#cite_note-museum-1","/wiki/Canadian_Air_Force_(1920%E2%80%931924)","/wiki/File:High_River_Station.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/High_River_Station.jpg/220px-High_River_Station.jpg","/wiki/File:High_River_Station.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Airco_DH.4","/wiki/Avro_552","/wiki/De_Havilland_DH.60_Moth","/wiki/Clearwater_River_(Alberta)","/wiki/Pincher_Creek","/wiki/Eckville,_Alberta","/wiki/Grande_Prairie,_Alberta","/wiki/Peace_River_Country","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Aerial_photography","/wiki/Parachute","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/North_America","#cite_note-museum-1","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan","/wiki/De_Havilland_Tiger_Moth","/wiki/Fairchild_PT-19","/wiki/Frank_Lake_(Alberta)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/High_River_Airport","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-museum_1-0","#cite_ref-museum_1-1","http://www.bombercommandmuseum.ca/bcatphighriver.html","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Larry_Milberry","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0969070349","http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=8540","http://www.militarybruce.com/history/base-history_5.html","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=edit&section=2","http://www.bombercommandmuseum.ca/bcatphighriver.html","http://www.geog.uvic.ca/dept/wcag/smith.pdf","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=RCAF_Station_High_River&params=50_35_35_N_113_50_30_W_region:CA-B_type:airport","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&oldid=562078035","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Royal_Canadian_Air_Force_stations","/wiki/Category:Airports_of_the_British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan","/wiki/Category:Defunct_airports_in_Alberta","/wiki/Category:High_River","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=RCAF+Station+High+River&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=RCAF+Station+High+River","/wiki/RCAF_Station_High_River","/wiki/Talk:RCAF_Station_High_River","#","/wiki/RCAF_Station_High_River","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/RCAF_Station_High_River","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/RCAF_Station_High_River","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&oldid=562078035","/w/index.php?title=RCAF_Station_High_River&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7276021","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=RCAF_Station_High_River&id=
