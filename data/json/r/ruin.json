Natural\ndisaster, war and depopulation are the most common root causes, with many\nstructures becoming progressively derelict over time due to long-term weathering\nand scavenging.\n\nThere are famous ruins all over the world, from ancient sites in China, the\nIndus valley and Judea to Zimbabwe in Africa, ancient Greek, Egyptian and Roman\nsites in the Mediterranean basin, and Incan and Mayan sites in the Americas.\nRuins are of great importance to historians, archaeologists and anthropologists,\nwhether they were once individual fortifications, places of worship, houses and\nutility buildings, or entire villages, towns and cities. Many ruins have become\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites in recent years, to identify and preserve them as\nareas of outstanding value to humanity.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/\nWorld Heritage Centre - World Heritage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n","title":"Ruins","headings":["Cities","Deliberate destruction","Relics of steel and wooden towers","Aesthetics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Pompeii","1: Rome","1: Maintenance,_repair_and_operations","1: Natural_disaster","1: Depopulation","1: Weathering","1: Yinxu","1: Indus_valley","1: Judea","1: Zimbabwe","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Mediterranean_basin","1: Inca_Empire","1: Maya_civilization","1: The_Americas","1: Archaeology","1: Anthropology","1: Fortification","1: Place_of_worship","1: UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site","1: Human_settlement","1: Looting","1: Warsaw","1: Dresden","1: Coventry","1: Beirut","1: Kabul","1: Sarajevo","1: Grozny","1: Baghdad","1: Volcanic_eruption","1: Common_Era","1: Lisbon","1: 1755_Lisbon_earthquake","1: Earthquake","1: Tsunami","1: 1906_San_Francisco_earthquake","1: Aberdeenshire","1: Theodosian_Code","1: Majorian","1: Coventry_Cathedral","1: Henry_VIII_of_England","1: Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries","1: Abbey","1: Monastery","1: Property_tax","1: Fetteresso_Castle","1: Slains_Castle","1: Scotland","1: Beverston_Castle","1: Cavalier","1: Deutschlandsender_Herzberg/Elster","1: Transmitter_Ismaning","1: Rust_belt","1: Marble","1: Parthenon_Frieze","1: Rubble","1: Second_Coming","1: Renaissance","1: Domus_Aurea","1: Herculaneum","1: Raphael's_Rooms","1: Neoclassical_architecture","1: Historicism","1: Ruin_value","1: Joseph_Michael_Gandy","1: Sir_John_Soane","1: Bank_of_England","1: Romanticism","1: 1936_Summer_Olympics","1: Metaphor","1: Dunstanburgh_Castle","1: J._M._W._Turner","1: Dunnottar_Castle","1: Dissolution_of_the_monasteries","1: Folly","1: Ozymandias","1: Shipwreck","1: Rose_Macaulay"]}
