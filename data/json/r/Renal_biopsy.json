Microscopic examination of the tissue can provide information needed\nto diagnose, monitor or treat problems of the kidney.\n\nA renal biopsy can be targeted to a particular lesion, for example a tumour\narising from the kidney ('targeted renal biopsy'). More commonly, however, the\nbiopsy is non-targeted as medical conditions affecting the kidney typically\ninvolve all kidney tissue indiscriminately. In the latter situation, any sufficiently-\nsized piece of kidney tissue can be used.\n\nA 'native renal biopsy' is one in which the patient's own kidneys are biopsied.\nIn a 'transplant renal biopsy', the kidney of another person that has been\ntransplanted into the patient is biopsied. Transplant kidney biopsy can be\nperformed when nothing is apparently wrong with the transplant kidney for the\npurposes of surveillance for hidden disease ('protocol transplant biopsy'). This\nis typically done at 0, 3 and 12 months post-transplant according to a\ntransplant unit protocol. Biopsy of the transplanted kidney taken during the\ntransplant operation is termed 'implantation transplant biopsy' or 'post-\nperfusion transplant biopsy' depending on the timing of the biopsy with respect\nto key stages of the operation. When the transplanted kidney is not working\nproperly, biopsy may be undertaken to identify the cause of dysfunction. This is\nreferred to as an 'indication transplant biopsy', because something has prompted\nthe performance of the biopsy.\n\nRenal biopsy may be performed with the aid of \"real-time\" medical imaging to\nguide the positioning of biopsy equipment ('imaging-guided renal biopsy').\nAlternatively, a biopsy may be performed without imaging-guidance using indirect\nassessments of position such as \"needle-swing\" to confirm appropriate placement\nof biopsy equipment ('blind renal biopsy').\n","linknr":267,"url":"Renal_biopsy","recorded":1362510866,"links":14,"instances":["circulatory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopsy"],"headings":["History","Indications","Contraindications","Procedure","Complications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_-_intermed_mag.jpg/220px-Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis_-_intermed_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shock","circulatory"]],"members":["shock"],"related":["Micrograph","PAS_stain","Medical_procedure","Kidney","Microscope","Lesion","Tumour","Organ_transplant","Medical_ultrasonography","X-ray_computed_tomography","Nephrology","Nephrologist","Haematuria","Hematuria","Glomerulus","Proteinuria","Kidney_failure","Nephritic_syndrome","Proteinuria","Nephrotic_syndrome","Renal_failure","Renal_physiology","Acute_renal_failure","Chronic_renal_failure","Acute_renal_failure","Tumour","Surveillance","Transplant_rejection","Polyoma_virus","Kidney_failure","Bleeding_diathesis","Hypertension","Azotemia","Uraemia","Warfarin","Heparin","Pregnancy","Urinary_tract_infection","Obesity","Nephrologist","Coagulation","Medical_ultrasonography","Hydronephrosis","Arteriovenous_fistula","Cystic_kidney_disease","Aspirin","Clopidogrel","Heparin","Warfarin","Desmopressin","Intravenous","Kidney_failure","Uremia","Informed_consent","Nephrologist","Interventional_radiologist","Medical_ultrasonography","X-ray_computed_tomography","Prone","Lateral_decubitus","Supine","Don","Sedation","General_anaesthetic","Local_anaesthetic","Pathologist","Pathology","Scientist","Kidney_cortex","Kidney_medulla","Naked_eye","Analgesic","Paracetamol","Acetaminophen","Kidney_failure","Uraemia","Hematoma","Hematuria","Urinary_retention","Shock_(circulatory)","Anaemia","Blood_transfusion","Surgery","Embolization","Sampling_error","Arteriovenous_fistula","Medical_ultrasonography","Embolization"]}
