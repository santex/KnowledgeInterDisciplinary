{"cursor":"6674","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Rural development' generally refers to the process of improving the quality of\nlife and economic wellbeing of people living in relatively isolated and sparsely\npopulated areas. Rural development has traditionally centered on the\nexploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and\nforestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased\nurbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism,\nniche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and\nagriculture as dominant economic drivers. The need for rural communities to\napproach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad\nrange of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for\nagricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical\ninfrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in\ndeveloping rural regions. Rural development is also characterized by its\nemphasis on locally produced economic development strategies. In contrast to\nurban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive\nfrom one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development\napproaches used globally.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Rural_development","recorded":1362477551,"links":14,"instances":["politics","india","cta"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rural community development","International development","Rural economics"],"headings":["Development actions","Rural development agencies","Recognition","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["localism","politics"],["technical_centre_for_agricultural_and_rural_cooperation_acp-eu","cta"],["district_rural_development_agencies","india"]],"members":["localism","district_rural_development_agencies"],"related":["Social_development","Economic_development","Localism_(politics)","Regional","Regional_Development_Agency","NGO","Land_development","Developing_countries","Developed_countries","Developing_countries","Nepal","India","Participatory_Rural_Appraisal","Rapid_Rural_Appraisal","Technical_Centre_for_Agricultural_and_Rural_Cooperation_ACP-EU_(CTA)","USDA_Rural_Development","European_Network_for_Rural_Development","Northern_Ireland","England_Rural_Development_Programme","DEFRA","Pakistan","India","Agricultural_Development_&_Training_Society","India","Tipperary_Institute","Republic_of_Ireland","Azerbaijan_Rural_Investment_Project","Azerbaijan","Jindal_Prize","Rural","European_Commission","Comilla_Project","Developing_countries","District_Rural_Development_Agencies_(India)","International_Fund_for_Agricultural_Development","Regional_development","Tamil_Nadu_Rural_Development_Department","RIGA_Project","The_George_Foundation","Overseas_Development_Institute"]}
