However, since the Lake Vyrnwy dam was\nbuilt in the 1880s, the river has flowed directly from the base of the dam. The\nriver runs for , and the last form part of the Welsh/English border between\nPowys and Shropshire. It eventually joins the River Severn near the village of\nMelverley.\n\nThe early stages of the river are predominantly [[International Scale of River\nDifficulty#Class/Grade II|Grade II]] white water with a few Grade III sections,\nmost notably the Vyrnwy Gorge near the village of Dolanog. The river is paddled\nfrequently by Kayakers and Canoeists. The other most prominent feature of the\nupper river is Dolanog Falls, a high man-made weir that requires a portage by\nboth kayaks and canoes.\n\nMuch of the lower river below Pontrobert is Grade I and a good touring river.\n","linknr":257,"url":"River_Vyrnwy","recorded":1362890584,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tributaries of the River Severn|Vyrnwy","Rivers of Wales|Vyrnwy","Rivers of Shropshire|Vyrnwy","Rivers of Powys|Vyrnwy","Englandâ€“Wales border"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/ShropshireLoggerhead.jpg/30px-ShropshireLoggerhead.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/WalesPowys.png/30px-WalesPowys.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Powys","Shropshire","Lake_Vyrnwy","River_Severn","River","Powys","Wales","Shropshire","England","Lake_Vyrnwy","Powys","Shropshire","River_Severn","Melverley","Dolanog","Kayakers","Canoeists","Portage","Pontrobert"]}
