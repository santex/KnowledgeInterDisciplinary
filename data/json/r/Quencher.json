It prevents low-temperature processes, such as\nphase transformations, from occurring by only providing a narrow window of time\nin which the reaction is both thermodynamically favorable and kinetically\naccessible. For instance, it can reduce crystallinity and thereby increase\ntoughness of both alloys and plastics (produced through polymerization).\n\nIn metallurgy, it is most commonly used to harden steel by introducing\nmartensite, in which case the steel must be rapidly cooled through its eutectoid\npoint, the temperature at which austenite becomes unstable. In steel alloyed\nwith metals such as nickel and manganese, the eutectoid temperature becomes much\nlower, but the kinetic barriers to phase transformation remain the same. This\nallows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much\neasier. High speed steel also has added tungsten, which serves to raise kinetic\nbarriers and give the illusion that the material has been cooled more rapidly\nthan it really has. Even cooling such alloys slowly in air has most of the\ndesired effects of quenching.\n\nExtremely rapid cooling can prevent the formation of all crystal structure,\nresulting in amorphous metal or \"metallic glass\".\n","linknr":156,"url":"Quencher","recorded":1362481268,"links":34,"instances":["matter","iron","heat"],"pdf":["http://www.selas.com/pdfs/rotaryretorts6300.pdf"],"categories":["Metal heat treatments"],"headings":["Quench hardening","Quenching Distance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/ArthurSiegelcoke1.jpg/250px-ArthurSiegelcoke1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conduction","heat"],["phase","matter"],["ferrite","iron"]],"members":["phase","ferrite","conduction"],"related":["Detroit,_Michigan","Materials_science","Conduction_(heat)","Material_properties","Phase_(matter)","Crystallinity","Alloy","Plastic","Polymerization","Metallurgy","Steel","Martensite","Eutectoid","Austenite","Nickel","Manganese","High_speed_steel","Tungsten","Amorphous_metal","Tempering","Dow_Chemical_Company","Pearlite","Ferrite_(iron)","Cementite","Quench_press","Martempering"]}
