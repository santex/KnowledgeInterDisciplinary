{"cursor":"2802","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sir Robert Thorpe' KS JP (died 29 June 1372) was a British justice. He was the\nson of another Sir Robert Thorpe, and is occasionally confused with another\nRobert Thorpe who was second master of Pembroke College, Cambridge at around\nthe same time. The Thorpe family produced many prominent lawyers, including\nWilliam de Thorpe, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, who may have been\ninfluential in guiding Robert towards a judicial career. In 1339 he was made a\nSerjeant-at-law, and between 1345 and 1356 served as a King's Serjeant. He\nserved as a Justice of the Peace in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk,\nSuffolk, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and was also involved in Assize,\nGaol delivery and Oyer and terminer. On 27 June 1356 he was appointed as Chief\nJustice of the Common Pleas and knighted, and on 1 October he was awarded a\ngrant of Â£40 to support his new position. He was a member of the councils of\nboth the Black Prince and John of Gaunt, and was appointed a Trier of Petitions\nat every Parliament between 1362 and 1371.\n\nIn 1368 he took part in the trial of the Steward of the King's Household, Sir\nJohn de la Lee, and in 1371 he was part of a commission inquiring into the\nembezzlement of money by Sir William Latimer. An anti-clerical movement in 1371\nforced the King to dismiss the Lord Chancellor, treasurer, and keeper of the\nprivy seal and replace them with laymen; as a result, Thorpe was appointed as\nChancellor to replace William of Wykeham, a position he took up on 14 April. He\nunfortunately held the position for only a year until his death on 29 June 1372.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","recorded":1375075862,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/King%27s_Serjeant","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Pembroke_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/William_de_Thorpe","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_King%27s_Bench","/wiki/Serjeant-at-law","/wiki/King%27s_Serjeant","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/wiki/Huntingdonshire","/wiki/Norfolk","/wiki/Suffolk","/wiki/Bedfordshire","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Oyer_and_terminer","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Edward,_the_Black_Prince","/wiki/John_of_Gaunt,_1st_Duke_of_Lancaster","/wiki/Embezzlement","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/William_of_Wykeham","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Roger_Hillary","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/William_Fyncheden","/wiki/William_of_Wykeham","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/John_Knyvet","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&oldid=558058268","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1372_deaths","/wiki/Category:Chief_Justices_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Category:Knights_Bachelor","/wiki/Category:Serjeants-at-law","/wiki/Category:Lord_Chancellors_of_England","/wiki/Category:English_judges","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+Thorpe+%28Lord+Chancellor%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+Thorpe+%28Lord+Chancellor%29","/wiki/Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","/wiki/Talk:Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","#","/wiki/Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&oldid=558058268","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7350389","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Robert_Thorpe_%28Lord_Chancellor%29&id=558058268","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Robert+Thorpe+%28Lord+Chancellor%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Robert+Thorpe+%28Lord+Chancellor%29&oldid=558058268&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7350389#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thorpe_(Lord_Chancellor)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=s
