RNA stores genetic information like DNA, and\ncatalyzes chemical reactions like an enzyme protein. It may, therefore, have\nplayed a major step in the evolution of cellular life. This does not\nnecessarily mean that the first life was RNA-based. For example, Thomas Äech\nproposes that multiple self-replicating molecular systems preceded RNA.\n\nThe RNA world would have eventually been replaced by the DNA, RNA and protein\nworld of today, likely through an intermediate stage of ribonucleoprotein\nenzymes such as the ribosome and ribozymes, since proteins large enough to self-\nfold and have useful activities would only have come about after RNA was\navailable to catalyze peptide ligation or amino acid polymerization.

Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2011 Feb 16. pii: cshperspect.a006742v1. .\n[Epub ahead of print] DNA is thought to have taken over the role of data\nstorage due to its increased stability, while proteins, through a greater\nvariety of monomers (amino acids), replaced RNA's role in specialized\nbiocatalysis.\n\nThe RNA world hypothesis is supported by the observation that many of the most\ncritical components of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly\nor entirely of RNA. This would mean that the RNA in modern cells is an\nevolutionary remnant of the RNA world that preceded ours. Also, many critical\ncofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances\nclearly related to them.\n","linknr":752,"url":"RNA_world_hypothesis","recorded":1362374409,"links":42,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics","nucleic_acid","nucleic_acid","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://web.wi.mit.edu/bartel/pub/publication_reprints/Johnston_Science01.pdf","http://web.wi.mit.edu/bartel/pub/publication_reprints/Johnston_Science01.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/12/a002196.full.pdf","http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/12/a002196.full.pdf","http://www.hhmi.org/bulletin/pdf/june2002/RNA.pdf"],"categories":["Origin of life","RNA","Biology theories"],"headings":["History","Properties of RNA","Support and difficulties","Prebiotic RNA synthesis","Further developments","Alternative hypotheses","Implications of the RNA world","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/RNA-comparedto-DNA_thymineAndUracilCorrected.png/300px-RNA-comparedto-DNA_thymineAndUracilCorrected.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/RNA_chemical_structure.GIF/220px-RNA_chemical_structure.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["terminator","genetics"],["chirality","chemistry"],["terminator","genetics"],["tna","nucleic_acid"],["gna","nucleic_acid"]],"members":["cofactor","terminator","gna","tna","chirality"],"related":["Ribonucleic_acid","Deoxyribonucleic_acid","Protein","Catalysis","Enzyme","Evolution","Thomas_Cech","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Ribonucleoprotein","Ribosome","Ribozymes","Peptide","Native_chemical_ligation","Amino_acid","Polymerization","Monomers","Biocatalysis","Evolution","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Adenosine_triphosphate","Acetyl-CoA","NADH","Nucleotide","Walter_Gilbert","Francis_Crick","Leslie_Orgel","Carl_Woese","Alexander_Rich","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Albert_Szent-Györgyi","Nucleic_acid","Pyrimidine","Ribonucleotides","Abiogenesis","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Threose_nucleic_acid","Glycol_nucleic_acid","Ribozyme","Living_fossil","Ribosome","Hammerhead_ribozyme","RNA_polymerase","Autocatalysis","Primer_extension","Catalysis","Peptide_bonds","Peptide","Protein","Ribosome","RRNA","Ångström","Active_site","Peptide_bonds","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","TRNA","Hydroxyl","Ribose","Phosphodiester_bond","Deoxyribose","B-DNA","A-DNA","Adenine","Guanine","Cytosine","Uracil","Thymine","Methyl_group","Wobble_base_pair","Base_pair","Molecule","Hydrolysis","Archaea","Secondary_structure","Metabolite","Terminator_(genetics)","Shine-dalgarno_sequence","RNA_thermometer","Genetics","DNA","Ribozyme","Enzyme","Virus","Nucleotide","Miller-Urey","Abiogenesis","Purine","Adenine","Pentamer","Hydrogen_cyanide","Bacteriophage_Qβ","Pyrimidine","Cytosine","Uracil","Nucleobase","Geologic_time_scale","Ribose","Enantiomer","Chirality_(chemistry)","Terminator_(genetics)","University_of_Manchester","Cytidine","Uridine","Glycolaldehyde","Glyceraldehyde","Cyanamide","Cyanoacetylene","Enantiomer","Aminooxazoline","UV_light","Tautomer","NASA","Meteorites","Earth","RNA","Adenine","Guanine","Organic_molecules","Outer_space","Copenhagen_University","Glycolaldehyde","Protostar","Ribonucleic_acid","RNA","DNA","Gerald_Joyce","Leslie_Orgel","Self-replicating","RNA","Early_Earth","Nucleotides","Catalyst","Polynucleotide","Phosphate_group","Adenosine_triphosphate","Polymer","5',5'-pyrophosphate","3',5'-phosphodiester","Hydrolysis","Enantiopure","Beta-D-ribonucleosides","Nucleotide","Primordial_soup","Primordial_sandwich","Natural_selection","Amino_acid","Peptide_bond","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Most_recent_common_ancestor","Thermosynthesis","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Peptide_bond","TNA_(nucleic_acid)","GNA_(nucleic_acid)","PAH_world_hypothesis","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons","PAHs","Universe","Primordial_sea","Fullerenes","Origin_of_life","Nebulae","Iron-sulfur_world_theory","Panspermia","Murchison_meteorite","Definition_of_life","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Ribosome","Amino_acid","Protein","Adenine","RRNA","Ribozyme","SnRNP","Pre-mRNA","RNA_editing","RNA_interference","Reverse_transcription","Eukaryote","Telomeres","Telomerase","Abiogenesis","Autocatalytic_set","Panspermia","Scientific_American","Journal_of_Molecular_Evolution","Sidney_Altman","Thomas_R._Cech","James_P._Ferris"]}
