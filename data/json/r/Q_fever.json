This organism is uncommon, but\nmay be found in cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic mammals, including cats\nand dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small cell\nvariant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen\nof infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick borne. The\nincubation period is 9â40 days. A human being can be infected by a single\nbacterium.
