This means that the proposition\nbeing presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there\ncould be no \"reasonable doubt\" in the mind of a \"reasonable person\" that the\ndefendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that\nit would not affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the\ndefendant is guilty. \"The shadow of a doubt\" is sometimes used interchangeably\nwith reasonable doubt, but this extends beyond the latter, to the extent that\nit may be considered an impossible standard. The term \"reasonable doubt\" is\ntherefore used.\n\nIf doubt does affect a \"reasonable person's\" belief that the defendant is\nguilty, the jury is not satisfied beyond \"reasonable doubt\". The precise meaning\nof words such as \"reasonable\" and \"doubt\" are usually defined within\njurisprudence of the applicable country.\n","linknr":300,"url":"Reasonable_doubt","recorded":1362676869,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf","http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf","http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf","http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf"],"categories":["Sociology of law","Skepticism","American legal terms","Criminal law","Criminal procedure","Legal doctrines and principles","Canadian law","Legal reasoning"],"headings":["By jurisdiction","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Legal_burden_of_proof","Adversarial_system","Legal_burden_of_proof","Reasonable_person","Beyond_the_shadow_of_a_doubt","Jurisprudence","Appeal_Court","Jury_instructions","Jury_instructions","U.S._Supreme_Court","Critical_thinking","Metacognition","Moral_certainty","Probable_cause","Reasonable_suspicion","In_dubio_pro_reo"]}
