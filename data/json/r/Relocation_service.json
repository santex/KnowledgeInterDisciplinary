Like other types of employee\nbenefits, these processes are usually administered by human resources\nspecialists within a corporation and outsourced to different types of service\nproviders. Relocation services are not synonymous with moving/relocation\ncompanies as not all of these companies offer \"relocation ''services'\".\n\n\nSuch business processes can include domestic residential services where an\nemployee moves within a country or state as well as international relocation\nservices which include planning for (diplomats, managers etc.) working abroad.\nAn agency providing relocation services directs and manages the process of\nrelocation including arranging necessary documents (visa, long-term stay\npermissions), finding a new house (accommodation), finding a school for children\n(education), finding a job for the partner or \"trailing spouse\", arranging a\nteacher for the family (language teaching) and introducing fresh expats to the\nlocal culture.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Relocation_service","recorded":1362580231,"links":17,"instances":["document","relocation_blog","employee_relocation_council"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Moving companies","Moving and relocation","Moving companies"],"headings":["Cost of international relocations for employers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["visa","document"],["worldwide_erc","employee_relocation_council"],["relocation_journal","relocation_blog"]],"members":["visa","relocation_journal","worldwide_erc"],"related":["Employee_benefit","Human_resources","Corporation","Diplomat","Visa_(document)","Lodging","School","Education","Language","Dutch_East_India_Company","Human_resources","Tax_equalization","University_of_Melbourne","Organizational_learning","Organizational_culture","Subsidiary","Strategic_partnership","Multinational_corporation","Unilever","Philips","Automaker","Keiretsu","Panasonic_Corporation","Siemens_AG","Loughborough_University","Worldwide_ERC","Salary","Tax_equalisation","MOVE_Guides","Moving_company","Worldwide_ERC_(Employee_Relocation_Council)","Relocation_Journal_(Relocation_Blog)"]}
