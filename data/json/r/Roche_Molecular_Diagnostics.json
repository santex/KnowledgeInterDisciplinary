Internally, it is organized into five major business areas: Roche\nApplied Science, Roche Professional Diagnostics, Roche Diabetes Care, Roche\nMolecular Diagnostics and Roche Tissue Diagnostics (Ventana).\n\nAll business areas except Roche Applied Science focus on health care\napplications, targeting either physicians, hospitals and clinics, or consumers.\nApplied Science targets research settings in academia and pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology industries.\n\n\n\nSince then, Roche has grown into one of the world's leading healthcare companies\nand one of the most important in Europe.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year Event\n|- 1896-1920 Roche was founded during the Industrial Revolution .\n\nUpon this background, Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche realised his plans for the\nindustrial manufacture of drugs of uniform strength and quality.\n|- 1920 - 1952 Over a period of 32 year, Roche saw a steady growth of its\n|international business. Not only was it the time of the first synthesis process\n|for vitamin C, by 1938 vitamins were the company's mainstay.\n\nCorporate growth took place in Europe, North and South America and the Far East,\ncreating an ever larger trading and production network\n|- 1953 - 1965 Between 1950s and mid- 1960s pharmaceutical research at Roche\n|was extremely diverse, with a portfolio ranging from antidepressants and\n|antimicrobials to agents for cancer chemotherapy and inflammatory and\n|cardiovascular diseases. To this day these have remained core therapeutics\n|areas, but they were to be eclipsed for a time by development in the field of\n|tranquillisers. Roche scientists had come across the benzodiazepine class\n|which proved to be the base for many milestones drugs to be marketed over the\n|years to come.\n\nDuring this period Roche was also busily pursuing a course of acquisitions,\nentering new business fields like flavours and fragrances\n|- 1965 - 1978 Propelled by the success of the benzodiazepines, Roche branched\n|out into markets spanning the whole spectrum of health care, with a large\n|variety of ventures. Bioelectronic departments developed electronic medical\n|instruments; physicists at Roche helped to develop the liquid crystal displays\n|now found in countless watches, calculators, computers, automobiles and\n|television sets. Roche invested into plant protection, reflecting the growing\n|involvement in the agrochemical sector. Both in Switzerland as well as the\n|United States, development teams were assembled to work on diagnostic tests and\n|analytical systems, thus establishing the diagnostic arm of Roche.\n\nThis period was also the starting point of Roche's involvement in basic\nbiomedical research, creating the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley\nand the Basel Institute for Immunology.\n\nThe time saw also negative impact on Roche - the major chemical accident that\noccurred in Seveso and a product pricing dispute in Great Britain.\n|- 1978 - 2001 The move towards creating separate business units, begun in the\n|mid- 70s, continued and resulted in the creation of autonomous divisions.\n|Accounting and reporting practices were standardised groupwide, and\n|comprehensive reorganisation, rationalisation and modernisation measures were\n|implemented in all areas. The sale of Maag in 1990 and the spin-off of Givaudan\n|in 2000 left Roche with three divisions: pharmaceuticals, vitamins and fine\n|chemicals, diagnostics.\n\nA wide range of pharmaceutical products were introduced over the years to come,\nand some represented real medical breakthroughs.\n\nThe acquisition in 1990 of a majority interest in Genentech, a leader in the\nfield of genetic engineering, and the takeover of Syntex Corporation, a strongly\nresearch-oriented company, were part of a strategy for strengthening Roche's\nposition in the global healthcare market. With the purchase of Nicholas, a\nproducer of non-prescription medicines, Roche strengthens its portfolio of over-the-\ncounter medicines, an increasingly important area because of the growing trend\ntowards self-medication. By acquiring 'Boehringer Mannheim', Roche became the\nworld leader in the area of diagnostic market in terms of a unique range of\ninnovative products, depth and breadth of technologies as well as overall\ngeographical presence.\n|- 2001 - Present The alliance with Chugai in Japan creates a foothold in\n|today's second largest healthcare market. The acquisition of Amira by Roche\n|Diagnostics and the separation of the Vitamins business reflects Roche's\n|concentration on pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Roche has also acquired\n|Allied Medical.
