Note the wooded passenger walkway above\nthe track]] platforms]] A 'railway platform' is a section of pathway, alongside\nrail tracks at a railway station, metro station or tram stop, at which\npassengers may board or alight from trains or trams. Almost all stations used\nfor rail transport have some form of platform, with larger stations having\nmultiple platforms. Most stations have their platforms numbered consecutively\nfrom 1; a few stations including Cardiff Central, Haymarket, King's Cross,\nStockport, (in the UK), Uppsala, (Sweden) and Lidcombe, Sydney (Australia) start\nfrom 0. Some, such as London Waterloo East railway station, use letters as\nplatform names. In the case of Waterloo East this is to distinguish the\nplatforms from those that are numerically numbered at the adjoining Waterloo\nstation. The US English equivalent is track.\n\nThe term railway platform can also mean any type of freight platform beside a\nrail siding for loading/unloading freight to/from rail cars.\n","linknr":363,"url":"Railway_platform","recorded":1362578998,"links":47,"instances":["irt_lexington_avenue_line","new_york_city_subway","singapore","rail_transport","australia","furniture","irt_42nd_street_shuttle"],"pdf":["http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAStandards.pdf"],"categories":["Rail
