{"cursor":"5110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe term 'ruling class' refers to the social class of a given society that\ndecides upon and sets that society's political policy by mandating that there is\none such particular class in the given society, and then appointing itself as\nthat class.\n\nSometimes, there is a ruling class in a particular sector of the upper class\nthat adheres to quite specific circumstances: it has both the most material\nwealth and the most widespread influence over all the other classes, and it\nchooses to actively exercise that power to shape the direction of a locality, a\ncountry, and/or the world.\n\nA sociologist, C. Wright Mills, argued that the ruling class differs from the\npower elite. The latter simply refers to the small group of people with the most\npolitical power. Many of them are politicians, hired political managers, and\nmilitary leaders.\n\nUnder the Marxist view of capitalism, the ruling class, the capitalists or\nbourgeoisie, consists of those who own and control the means of production and\nthus are able to dominate and exploit the working class, getting them to labor\nenough to produce surplus-value, the basis for profits, interest, and rent\n(property income). This property income can be used to accumulate more power, to\nextend class domination further. The economic power of such a class gives it\nextraordinary political power, so that state or government policies almost\nalways reflect the perceived interests of that class.\n\nRuling classes tend to be looked at negatively because they are often viewed as\nhaving little respect of or interest in the rights of the inferior classes.\n","linknr":362,"url":"Ruling_class","recorded":1362480762,"links":25,"instances":["polity"],"pdf":["http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf"],"categories":["Marxist theory","Social classes","Social inequality","Oligarchy"],"headings":["Examples","In the media","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Marx_and_Engels.jpg/180px-Marx_and_Engels.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Red_flag_waving.svg/15px-Red_flag_waving.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","polity"]],"members":["state"],"related":["Social_class","Upper_class","Wealth","Sociology","C._Wright_Mills","Power_elite","Capitalism","Bourgeoisie","Means_of_production","Exploitation","Surplus-value","Capital_accumulation","State_(polity)","Government","Mode_of_production","Feudalism","Slavery","Mattei_Dogan","Russian_Empire","Ottoman_Empire","Totalitarian","Communist","Fascist","Globalization","Transnational_capitalist_class","The_American_Ruling_Class","Aldous_Huxley","Nineteen_Eighty-Four","Aristocracy","Jesus_Christ","Bolshevik","Elite_theory","Overclass","New_class","Nomenklatura","The_Man","Totalitarianism","Upper_ten_thousand","The_Superclass_List"]}
