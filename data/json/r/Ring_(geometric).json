{"cursor":"3103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, an 'annulus' (the Latin word for \"little ring\", with plural\nannuli) is a ring-shaped object, especially a region bounded by two concentric\ncircles. The adjectival form is 'annular' (as in annular eclipse).\n\nThe open annulus is topologically equivalent to both the open cylinder and the\npunctured plane.\n\nThe area of an annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of\nradius and the smaller one of radius :\n: A = \\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi(R^2 - r^2)\\,.\n\nThe area of an annulus can be obtained from the length of the longest interval\nthat can lie completely inside the annulus, 2*d in the accompanying diagram.\nThis can be proven by the Pythagorean theorem; the length of the longest\ninterval that can lie completely inside the annulus will be tangent to the\nsmaller circle and form a right angle with its radius at that point. Therefore\nd and r are the sides of a right angled triangle with hypotenuse R and the area\nis given by:\n: A = \\pi (R^2-r^2) = \\pi d^2 \\,.\n\nThe area can also be obtained via calculus by dividing the annulus up into an\ninfinite number of annuli of infinitesimal width and area ( ) and then\nintegrating from ρ = r to ρ = R:\n: A = \\int_r^R 2\\pi\\rho\\, d\\rho = \\pi(R^2-r^2).\n\nThe area of an annulus segment of angle , with measured in radians, is given by:\n: A = \\frac{\\theta}{2} (R^2 - r^2) \n","linknr":126,"url":"Ring_(geometric)","recorded":1362687948,"links":32,"instances":["geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary geometry","Geometric shapes"],"headings":["Complex structure","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Annulus_area.svg/150px-Annulus_area.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/5/625a63303c4fd802feacd8828c84c799.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/4/d74b5da38fe25b8324113066591b6250.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/3/dc3012756e9c58173505bdab6522d6c3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/c/0/0c0e57a2a3a0a46596e1ce4aa75d551b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/5/8154f9370e3506fab480d0ea62635325.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/4/e9495886efe9b36b0082091ae67a34cf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"],["plane","mathematics"]],"members":["cylinder","plane"],"related":["Mathematics","Latin","Annular_eclipse","Homeomorphism","Cylinder_(geometry)","Punctured_plane","Circle","Pythagorean_theorem","Tangent","Calculus","Infinitesimal","Integral","Complex_analysis","Complex_plane","Open_region","Plane_(mathematics)","Riemann_surface","Holomorphic_function","Hadamard_three-circle_theorem","Annulus_theorem","Spherical_shell","Torus"]}
