From , \"madness\") is a viral disease that causes acute\nencephalitis in warm-blooded animals. The disease is\nzoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted from one species to another, such as\nfrom dogs to humans, commonly by a bite from an infected animal. For a human,\nrabies is almost invariably fatal if postexposure prophylaxis is not\nadministered prior to the onset of severe symptoms. The rabies virus infects the\ncentral nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death.\n\nThe rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The\nincubation period of the disease is usually a few months in humans, depending on\nthe distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. Once the rabies virus reaches the central nervous system and\nsymptoms begin to show, the infection is virtually untreatable and usually fatal\nwithin days.\n\nEarly-stage symptoms of rabies are malaise, headache and fever, progressing to\nacute pain, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, depression, and\nhydrophobia. Finally, the patient may experience periods of\nmania and lethargy, eventually leading to coma. The primary cause of death is\nusually respiratory insufficiency.\n\nRabies causes about 55,000 human deaths annually worldwide. 95% of human deaths due to rabies occur in Asia and\nAfrica. http://www.who.int/rabies/en/ Roughly 97% of human rabies\ncases result from dog bites. In the US, animal control and\nvaccination programs have effectively eliminated domestic dogs as reservoirs of\nrabies. In several countries, including\nAustralia and Japan, rabies carried by terrestrial animals has been eliminated\nentirely. While classical rabies has been eradicated in the United\nKingdom, bats infected with a related virus have been found in the country on\nrare occasions.
