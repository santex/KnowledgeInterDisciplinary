The county is geographically divided by\nthe Hillsborough River's estuary, a tidal inlet which almost splits the county\nand Prince Edward Island. It is the richest and most populous county in the\nprovince of Prince Edward Island.\n\nThe county's geography varies from picturesque shorelines of sandstone cliffs,\nsandy beaches and sheltered bays on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Northumberland\nStrait, to extensive farming operations throughout interior regions. Topography\nranges from relatively flat to rolling hills in the central hill lands known as\nthe Bonshaw Hills.\n\nThe county was named by Captain Samuel Holland in 1765 for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-\nStrelitz, then queen consort of the United Kingdom. As such, Queens County's\ncounty seat is Charlottetown, which was also chosen as the colonial capital\nbecause of its central location.\n\nToday, urban sprawl extending from Charlottetown in the centre of the county is\nthe region's most dominant feature; many rural parts of the county within the\nCharlottetown census agglomeration, and outside, are facing increased pressures\nto subdivide and develop into suburbs and exurbs.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Queens_County,_Prince_Edward_Island","recorded":1375087872,"links":[],"instances":["prince_edward_island"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Queens County, Prince Edward Island|"],"headings":["Municipalities","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["hillsborough_river","prince_edward_island"]],"members":["hillsborough_river"],"related":["Charlottetown","Cornwall,_Prince_Edward_Island","Stratford,_Prince_Edward_Island","Greenville_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","Hillsboro_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","Charlotte_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","Bedford_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","St._John's_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","St._Patrick's_Parish,_Prince_Edward_Island","Queens_Royalty,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_20,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_21,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_22,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_23,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_24,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_29,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_30,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_31,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_32,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_33,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_34,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_35,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_36,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_37,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_48,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_49,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_50,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_57,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_58,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_60,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_62,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_65,_Prince_Edward_Island","Lot_67,_Prince_Edward_Island","Prince_Edward_Island","Canada","Hillsborough_River_(Prince_Edward_Island)","Gulf_of_St._Lawrence","Northumberland_Strait","Samuel_Holland","Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz","Queen_consort","List_of_British_consorts","Charlottetown","Urban_sprawl","Census_agglomeration","Charlottetown","Cornwall,_Prince_Edward_Island","Stratford,_Prince_Edward_Island","Afton,_Prince_Edward_Island","Alexandra,_Prince_Edward_Island","Bayview,_Prince_Edward_Island","Belfast,_Prince_Edward_Island","Bonshaw,_Prince_Edward_Island","Brackley,_Prince_Edward_Island","Breadalbane,_Prince_Edward_Island","Clyde_River,_Prince_Edward_Island","Crapaud,_Prince_Edward_Island","Darlington,_Prince_Edward_Island","Donagh,_Prince_Edward_Island","Grand_Tracadie,_Prince_Edward_Island","Hampshire,_Prince_Edward_Island","Hazelbrook,_Prince_Edward_Island","Hunter_River,_Prince_Edward_Island","Kingston,_Prince_Edward_Island","Meadowbank,_Prince_Edward_Island","Miltonvale_Park,_Prince_Edward_Island","Mount_Stewart,_Prince_Edward_Island","New_Haven-Riverdale,_Prince_Edward_Island","North_Rustico,_Prince_Edward_Island","North_Shore,_Prince_Edward_Island","North_Wiltshire,_Prince_Edward_Island","Orwell,_Prince_Edward_Island","Pleasant_Grove,_Prince_Edward_Island","Resort_Municipality,_Prince_Edward_Island","Union_Road,_Prince_Edward_Island","Victoria,_Prince_Edward_Island","Warren_Grove,_Prince_Edward_Island","Watervale,_Prince_Edward_Island","West_River,_Prince_Edward_Island","Winsloe_South,_Prince_Edward_Island","York,_Prince_Edward_Island","Rocky_Point_3,_Prince_Edward_Island","Scotchfort_4,_Prince_Edward_Island"]}
