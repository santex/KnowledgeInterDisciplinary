{"cursor":"3250","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in Barbados wearing a rastacap]] The 'rastacap' (sometimes spelled 'rastahcap'\n or 'rastercap', depending upon local patois) is a tall, round, usually\n crocheted cap, which is often brightly coloured. It is most commonly\n associated with the pat as a way for Rastafarians (Rastas) and others with\n dreadlocks to tuck their locks away, but may be worn for various reasons by\n Rastas and non-Rastas. The cap is worn mostly by men. It is sometimes\n erroneously referred to as a \"Tam\" (or \"tam\"), a different kind of hat that\n was loosely ancestral to the rastacap. Other Caribbean-islander terms for the\n rastacap include 'rastafar' (sometimes with a silent terminal -r), 'toppa[h]'\n and simply 'cap' or 'hat'.\n\nIn construction, the rastacap is similar to the tuque, but much larger. Most\ncommonly crocheted, the hat can also be knit, woven, sewn, or constructed in a\nnumber of other ways. Examples with sun-cured palm leaves woven into the hat\nexist; this yields a semi-rigid design which a skilled islander can form\nrapidly. Rastacaps range in size and shape, as well as uses. People with\ndreadlocks and non-dreaded people alike wear rastacaps for fashion, convenience,\nsocio-political statement, and a number of other reasons. Some Rastas also wear\nrastacaps and other forms of headdress as a religious headcovering. It may also\nbe worn by health and food service and heavy machinery workers with long hair,\nfor workplace safety reasons. Turda and Longley\n\nPeople of Jamaica and Barbados, as well as some outlying islands, have\nseparately claimed to have originated the cap style, claiming ancestral heritage\nor even personal invention, albeit without credible, documented proof, relying\non un-substantiated drawings or mythical reference.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Rastacap","recorded":1362566583,"links":29,"instances":["cap"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps","Rastafari movement"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Rasta_Man_Barbados.jpg/220px-Rasta_Man_Barbados.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Flag_of_Jamaica.svg/30px-Flag_of_Jamaica.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Flag_of_Barbados.svg/30px-Flag_of_Barbados.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Signorina_in_viola.svg/18px-Signorina_in_viola.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Karte_Karibik_Inseln.png/30px-Karte_Karibik_Inseln.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tam_o'_shanter","cap"]],"members":[],"related":["Barbados","Patois","Crochet","Cap","Rastafarians","Dreadlocks","Tam_o'_Shanter_(cap)","Caribbean","Tuque","Knit","Woven","Sewn"]}
