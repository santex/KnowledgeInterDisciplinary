The current director is Professor David Hume FRSE.\n\nThe Institute won international fame in 1996, when Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell\nand their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from\nan adult cell, at the institute. A year later\nPolly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene.\n\nRoslin has made many other contributions to animal sciences, especially in the\narea of livestock improvement and welfare through applications of Quantitative\nGenetics. In 2007 a Roslin team developed genetically modified chickens capable\nof laying eggs containing proteins needed to make cancer-fighting drugs.\n\nIn April 2007, The Roslin Institute was joined by the Neuropathogenesis Unit of\nthe Institute for Animal Health, well known for its role in deciphering the\nbiology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow disease, scrapie,\nCJD). In 2008, The Institute was incorporated with the Royal (Dick) School of\nVeterinary Studies within the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of The\nUniversity of Edinburgh. There are currently more than 400 staff and students.\n\nThe Roslin Institute aims to enhance the lives of animals and humans through\nworld class research in animal biology. The principal objectives are to:\n\n* Enhance animal health and welfare through knowledge of genetic factors\n  affecting resistance to disease.\n* Enhance sustainability and productivity of livestock systems and food supply\n  chains through understanding of reproductive and developmental biology.\n* Enhance food safety by understanding interactions between disease causing\n  organisms and animals.\n* Enhance human health through an understanding of basic mechanisms of health\n  and disease and comparative biology of animal species.\n* Identify new and emerging zoonoses and understand how pathogens might cross\n  from animals to humans.\n* Enhance quality of life for animals by studying the mechanisms and behaviours\n  associated with optimising their environment and life experiences.\n\nIn March 2011 The Roslin Institute moved from its previous home in Roslin, a\nvillage in Midlothian, to a Â£60.6M building on the University of Edinburgh's\nVeterinary Campus at Easter Bush, across the road from the Royal (Dick) School\nof Veterinary Studies' new teaching building.\n\nThe Roslin Institute and Vet School are part of a formal consortium, the Easter\nBush Research Consortium, [http://www.ebrc.ac.uk/ ebrc.ac.uk] with the\nMoredun Research Institute and the Scottish Agricultural College.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Roslin_Institute","recorded":1362480658,"links":31,"instances":["dick_school_of_veterinary_studies","biologist","sheep"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1993 establishments in Scotland","Cloning","Organisations based in Midlothian","Zoology organizations","Agronomy","Agriculture in Scotland","Research institutes established in 1993","University of Edinburgh","Research institutes in Scotland"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Roslin_Institute.JPG/320px-Roslin_Institute.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/30px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg/30px-Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["keith_campbell","biologist"],["dolly","sheep"],["royal","dick_school_of_veterinary_studies"]],"members":["royal","keith_campbell","dolly"],"related":["Midlothian","Scotland","University_of_Edinburgh","BBSRC","Animal_sciences","Midlothian","Scotland","Biotechnology_and_Biological_Sciences_Research_Council","Ian_Wilmut","Keith_Campbell_(biologist)","Dolly_(sheep)","Mammal","Cloning","Polly_and_Molly","Institute_for_Animal_Health","Royal_(Dick)_School_of_Veterinary_Studies","Roslin,_Midlothian","Midlothian","University_of_Edinburgh","Moredun_Research_Institute","Scottish_Agricultural_College"]}
