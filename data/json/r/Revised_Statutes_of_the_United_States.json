{"cursor":"3576","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Revised Statutes of the United States' (in citations, 'Rev. Stat.') was the\nfirst official codification of the Acts of Congress. It was the precursor to the\nUnited States Code.\n\nPrevious codifications by private publishers were useful shortcuts for research\npurposes, but had no official status.\n\nSenator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts began to press Congress to revise and\nconsolidate national statutes as early as 1851. President Abraham Lincoln also\nrecommended such revision in his annual message of December 3, 1861.\nNonetheless, it was not until 1866 and the administration of President Johnson\nthat the Congress finally approved Sumner's An Act to provide for the Revision\nand Consolidation of the Statute Laws of the United States. June 27, 1866,\nch. 140. Revision and Consolidation of the Statutes. An Act to provide for the\nRevision and Consolidation of the Statute Laws of the United States. The\nAct called for three commissioners to carry out this work for three years, and\nPresident Johnson appointed Caleb Cushing, Charles Pinckney James, and William\nJohnston (judge) as these commissioners. Unfortunately, Cushing, James, and\nJohnston were unable to complete their task within the allotted time. Congress\ncontinued the work by passing a continuation of the original act May 4,\n1870, ch. 72. Statutes of the United States. An act to provide for the revision\nand consolidation of the Statutes of the United States. in 1870. President\nGrant renewed the appointment of Charles Pinckney James but called on Benjamin\nVaughan Abbott and Victor C. Barringer to replace Cushing and Johnston. The\nCongress approved the revision and consolidation prepared by these commissioners\non June 22, 1874, for laws in effect as of December 1, 1873. This codification\nis known as the Revised Statutes of the United States. Charles Sumner: his\ncomplete works. With Introduction by Hon. George Frisbie Hoar. Boston, Lee and\nShepard. 1900. Vol. VIII. Revision and Consolidation of the National Statutes,\np.5.\n\nOn March 2, 1877, the Congress called for an updated and expanded edition of the\nRevised Statutes. Charles Pinckney James was again called to service to support\nGeorge S. Boutwell, who was named commissioner for this work. The Congress\nenacted Boutwell's version of the Revised Statutes in 1878.\n\nThe Revised Statutes were enacted as positive law, but subsequent enactments\nwere not incorporated into the official code, so that over time researchers once\nagain had to delve through many volumes of the [[United States Statutes at\nLarge]] or use unofficial, privately published supplements.\n\nAccording to the preface to the United States Code, \"From 1897 to 1907 a\ncommission was engaged in an effort to codify the great mass of accumulating\nlegislation. The work of the commission involved an expenditure of over\n$300,000, but was never carried to completion.\" During the 1920s, some members\nof Congress revived the codification project, resulting in the approval of the\nCode by Congress in 1926.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","recorded":1374858973,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States_Code","/wiki/Charles_Sumner","/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Caleb_Cushing","/wiki/Charles_Pinckney_James","/wiki/William_Johnston_(judge)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Benjamin_Vaughan_Abbott","#cite_note-3","/wiki/George_S._Boutwell","/wiki/Positive_law","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","/wiki/United_States_Code","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2","http://archive.org/stream/revisedstatutes01statgoog#page/n5/mode/2up","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=018/llsl018.db&recNum=1","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-fed-statute-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-fed-statute-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-fed-statute-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&oldid=548615099","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_legislation_stubs","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_legislation","/wiki/Category:Legal_history_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Revised+Statutes+of+the+United+States&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Revised+Statutes+of+the+United+States","/wiki/Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Talk:Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","#","/wiki/Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&oldid=548615099","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7318436","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&id=548615099","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Revised+Statutes+of+the+United+States","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Revised+Statutes+of+the+United+States&oldid=548615099&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7318436#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_Statutes_of_the_United_States","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawi
