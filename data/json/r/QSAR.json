{"cursor":"27801","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Quantitative structureâactivity relationship' models ('QSAR' models) are\nregression or classification models used in the chemical and biological sciences\nand engineering. Like other regression models, QSAR regression models relate a\nset of \"predictor\" variables (X) to the potency of the response variable (Y),\nwhile classification QSAR models relate the predictor variables to a categorical\nvalue of the response variable. In QSAR modeling, the predictors consist of physico-\nchemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals; the QSAR\nresponse-variable could be a biological activity of the chemicals. QSAR models\nfirst summarize a supposed relationship between chemical structures and\nbiological activity in a data-set of chemicals. Second QSAR models predict the\nactivities of new chemicals. Related terms include quantitative\nstructureâproperty relationships (QSPR)when a physico-chemical property or a\nreactivity are modeled as response variable.\n\nFor example, biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as the\nconcentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response.\nAdditionally, when physicochemical properties or structures are expressed by\nnumbers, one can find a mathematical relationship, or quantitative structure-\nactivity relationship, between the two. The mathematical expression, if\ncarefully validated  can then be\nused to predict the modeled response of other chemical structures, by carefully\nverifying the Applicability domain (AD).\n\nA QSAR has the form of a mathematical model:\n\n* \\;\\text{Activity} = f(\\text{physicochemical properties and/or structural\n  properties})+\\text{Error}\n\nThe error includes model error (bias) and observational variability, that is,\nthe variability in observations even on a correct model.\n","linknr":430,"url":"QSAR","recorded":1362507987,"links":27,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","philosophy","statistics","social_sciences"],"pdf":["http://www.cresset-group.com//publications/Cheeseright_IPT_09.pdf","http://www.cresset-group.com//publications/Cheeseright_IPT_09.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/03/04712709/0471270903.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/03/04712709/0471270903.pdf"],"categories":["Medicinal chemistry","Pharmacology","Cheminformatics","Computational chemistry","Paradoxes|Structure-Activity Relationship paradox"],"headings":["SAR and the SAR paradox","Types","Modeling","Evaluation of the quality of QSAR models","Application","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/d/ebd3b3b3e75af258a537d41b08ae6002.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/3-D_QSAutogrid-R_MPGRS_example_image.png/220px-3-D_QSAutogrid-R_MPGRS_example_image.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["induction","philosophy"],["force_field","chemistry"],["iterative_cross-validation","statistics"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["coding","social_sciences"]],"members":["receptor","force_field","induction","coding"],"related":["Regression_analysis","Response_variable","Biological_activity","Chemical_structure","Biological_activity","Predictive_inference","Mathematical_model","Model_error","Bias_of_an_estimator","Hypotheses","Structure–activity_relationship","Chemical_reaction","Biotransformation","Solubility","Bioisosterism","Trend_estimation","Hypothesis","Finite_set","Induction_(philosophy)","Overfitting","Partition_coefficient","Force_field_(chemistry)","Crystallography","Superimposition","Lennard-Jones_potential","Feature_extraction","Dimensionality_reduction","Machine_learning","Support_vector_machine","Multiple-instance_learning","Half_sandwich_compound","Partial_least_squares","Feature_extraction","Inductive_reasoning","Feature_selection","Data_mining","Support_vector_machine","Decision_tree","Neural_networks","Inductive_reasoning","Molecule_mining","Structured_data_mining","Maximum_common_subgraph_isomorphism_problem","Graph_kernel","Statistical_model","Biological_activity","Molecular_geometry","Molecular_property","Risk_assessment","Drug_discovery","Drug_development","Iterative_cross-validation_(statistics)","History","Boiling_point","Chemical_classification","Chemical_compound","Organic_chemistry","Correlation","Alkanes","Boiling_point","Higher_alkanes","Hammett_equation","Taft_equation","Acid_dissociation_constant","Assay","Signal_transduction","Metabolic_pathway","Toxicity","Drug_discovery","Biological_target","Toxicity","Partition_coefficient","Druglikeness","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","Enzyme","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Structural_domain","Site-directed_mutagenesis","Machine_learning","Minimum-variance_unbiased_estimator","Coding_(social_sciences)","Learning","Risk_management","European_Union","Registration,_Evaluation,_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals","Convex_hull","Applicability_domain","Extrapolation","ADME","Cheminformatics","Computer-assisted_drug_design","Conformation_Activity_Relationship","Differential_solubility","Molecular_design_software","Partition_coefficient","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacophore","QSAR_&_Combinatorial_Science","Scientific_journal","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Chemicalize.org"]}
