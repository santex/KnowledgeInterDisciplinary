{"cursor":"15723","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'RNA-dependent RNA polymerase' ('RdRP'), ('RDR'), or 'RNA replicase', is an\nenzyme () that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. This is in\ncontrast to a typical DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyzes the\ntranscription of RNA from a DNA template.\n\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential protein encoded in the\ngenomes of all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage that have sense negative\nRNA. It catalyses\nsynthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. The RNA\nreplication process is a two-step mechanism. First, the initiation step of RNA\nsynthesis begins at or near the 3' end of the RNA template by means of a primer-\nindependent (de novo), or a primer-dependent mechanism that utilizes a viral\nprotein genome-linked (VPg) primer. The de novo initiation consists in the\naddition of a nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTP) to the 3'-OH of the first\ninitiating NTP. During the following so-called elongation phase, this\nnucleotidyl transfer reaction is repeated with subsequent NTPs to generate the\ncomplementary RNA product.\n","linknr":409,"url":"RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","recorded":1362374309,"links":19,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","RNA","Enzymes"],"headings":["VPg","History","3D structure","Classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/RNA_Replicase_structure.png/220px-RNA_Replicase_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Enzyme","Self-replication","RNA","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA","VPg","Picornavirus","Virus","Polio_virus","Polio_virus","Endocytosis","Hepatitis_C_virus","Eukaryote","RNA_interference","RISC","SiRNA","Telomerase","Flaviviruse","Spiegelman_Monster"]}
