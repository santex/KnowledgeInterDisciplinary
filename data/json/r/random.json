Commonly, it means lack\nof pattern or predictability in events.\n\nThe [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines \"random\" as \"Having no definite aim or\npurpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring,\netc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard.\" This concept of randomness\nsuggests a non- or non- in a sequence of symbols or steps, such that there is no\nintelligible pattern or combination.\n\nApplied usage in science, mathematics and statistics recognizes a lack of\npredictability when referring to randomness, but admits regularities in the\noccurrences of events whose outcomes are not certain. For example, when throwing\ntwo dice and counting the total, we can say that a sum of 7 will randomly occur\ntwice as often as 4. This view, where randomness simply refers to situations\nwhere the certainty of the outcome is at issue, applies to concepts of chance,\nprobability, and information entropy. In these situations, randomness implies a\nmeasure of uncertainty, and notions of haphazardness are irrelevant.\n\nThe fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of\nrandomness. In statistics, a random variable is an assignment of a numerical\nvalue to each possible outcome of an event space. This association facilitates\nthe identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. A random\nprocess is a sequence of random variables describing a process whose outcomes do\nnot follow a deterministic pattern, but follow an evolution described by\nprobability distributions. These and other constructs are extremely useful in\nprobability theory.\n\nRandomness is often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical\nproperties. Monte Carlo methods, which rely on random input, are important\ntechniques in science, as, for instance, in computational\nscience.<ref>[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/Workshops/workshop2007/\nThird Workshop on Monte Carlo Methods], Jun Liu, Professor of Statistics,\nHarvard University</ref>\n\nRandom selection is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a\npopulation where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion\nof those items in the population. For example, if we have a bowl of 100 marbles\nwith 10 red (and any red marble is indistinguishable from any other red marble)\nand 90 blue (and any blue marble is indistinguishable from any other blue\nmarble), a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability\n1/10. Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this\nbowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. In situations where a\npopulation consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection\nmechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. That is, if\nthe section process is such that each member of a population, of say research\nsubjects, has the same probability of being chosen then we can say the selection\nprocess is random. Random selection can be an official method to resolve tied\nelections in some jurisdictions<ref>Municipal Elections Act (Ontario, Canada)\n1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 62 (3) : \"If the recount indicates that two or more\ncandidates who cannot both or all be declared elected to an office have received\nthe same number of votes, the clerk shall choose the successful candidate or\ncandidates by lot.\"</ref> and is even an ancient method of divination, as in\ntarot, the I Ching, and bibliomancy. Its use in politics is very old, as office\nholders in Ancient Athens were chosen by lot, there being no voting.\n","title":"Randomness","headings":["History","Randomness in science","Randomness and religion","Applications and use of randomness","Misconceptions/logical fallacies","Books","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Probability","4: Determinism","3: Predictability","3: Dice","3: Statistics","3: Divination","3: Pi","3: Chaos_theory","2: Probability_distribution","2: Probability_theory","2: Monte_Carlo_method","2: Algorithmic_information_theory","2: Quantum_mechanics","2: Statistical_mechanics","2: Gambling","2: Random_sequence","2: Gregory_Chaitin","2: Free_will","2: Donald_Knuth","2: Cleromancy","2: Lottery","2: Pseudorandomness","1: Symbol","1: Information_entropy","1: Random_variable","1: Random_process","1: Scientific_computing","1: Tarot","1: I_Ching","1: Bibliomancy","1: Pompei","1: Calculus","1: John_Venn","1: Random_walk","1: Algorithmic_randomness","1: Randomized_algorithms","1: Algorithmic_probability","1: Cryptography","1: Game_theory","1: Information_theory","1: Pattern_recognition","1: Thermodynamics","1: Gas_laws","1: Bell's_aspect_experiment","1: Atom","1: John_Gribbin","1: Hidden_variable_theory","1: Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","1: Natural_selection","1: Mutation","1: Gene_pool","1: Freckles","1: Simulation","1: Bit","1: Kolmogorov_randomness","1: Data_compression","1: Andrey_Kolmogorov","1: Per_Martin-Löf","1: Ray_Solomonoff","1: Binary_logarithm","1: Normal_number","1: Simple_random_samples","1: Communication_theory","1: Paul_Erdős","1: Alfréd_Rényi","1: Random_walk_hypothesis","1: Market","1: Determinist","1: Superstition","1: Science","1: Mathematics","1: Frequentist_statistics","1: Bayesian_probability","1: Ohm's_law","1: Kinetic_theory","1: Macroscopic","1: Microscope","1: First_cause","1: Discordianism","1: Hindu","1: Buddhist","1: Karma","1: Martin_Luther","1: Protestantism","1: Bible","1: Behavioral_psychology","1: Evolution","1: Non-random","1: Quantum_computing","1: C._S._Lewis","1: Athenian_democracy","1: Isonomia","1: Sortition","1: Randomization","1: Juror","1: Conscription","1: Shuffling_playing_cards","1: Roulette","1: Gaming_Control_Board","1: Drawing_straws","1: American_Football","1: Coin_toss","1: Playoffs","1: National_Basketball_Association","1: NBA_Draft_Lottery","1: Opinion_poll","1: Quality_control","1: Genetic_algorithm","1: Randomized_controlled_trials","1: Brownian_motion","1: Hardware_random_number_generator","1: Pachinko","1: Pseudo-random_number_generator","1: Arithmetics","1: Cellular_automaton","1: Random_seed","1: Applications_of_randomness","1: Statistical_randomness","1: Random_number_generator","1: Random_number_table","1: Randomness_tests","1: Discrete_transform","1: Complexity","1: Coupon_collector's_problem","1: Playing_card","1: Gerolamo_Cardano","1: Probability_space","1: Boy_or_girl_paradox","1: Monty_Hall_problem","1: Booby_prize","1: Olav_Kallenberg","1: Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb","1: Leonard_Mlodinow","1: Aleatory","1: Chaitin's_constant","1: Frequency_probability","1: Nonlinear_system","1: Probability_interpretations","1: Random.org","1: Stephen_Wolfram","1: Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
