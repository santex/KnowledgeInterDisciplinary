Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and\nsenator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States\nfrom 1953 to 1961.\n\nNixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. He graduated from Whittier College in\n1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to\npractice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the\nfederal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy\nduring World War II. Nixon was elected in California to the House of\nRepresentatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Alger Hiss\ncase established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to\nnational prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the\nRepublican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for\neight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in\n1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of\nCalifornia in 1962. In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected.\n\nAlthough Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War, he\nsubsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's\nRepublic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations,\nand he initiated dÃ©tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet\nUnion the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced\npolicies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other\nthings, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs, imposed wage\nand price controls, enforced desegregation of some Southern schools, and\nestablished the Environmental Protection Agency. Though he presided over the\nlunar landings beginning with Apollo 11, he scaled back manned space\nexploration. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972.\n\nNixon's second term saw an Arab oil embargo, the resignation of his vice\npresident, Spiro Agnew, and a continuing series of revelations about the\nWatergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration. The\nscandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9,\n1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from\noffice. After his resignation, he controversially received a pardon issued by\nhis successor, Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman,\nauthoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to\nrehabilitate his public image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18,\n1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.\n","linknr":3378,"url":"Richard_M._Nixon","recorded":1362501459,"links":199,"instances":["united_states","usa","magazine","united_states","magazine","rank","united_states","united_states","law","composer","united_kingdom","politics"],"pdf":["http://www.yale.edu/cgp/Walrus_CambodiaBombing_OCT06.pdf","http://www.yale.edu/cgp/Walrus_CambodiaBombing_OCT06.pdf","http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/periodicals-postage-history.pdf","http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/periodicals-postage-history.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/docs/scd30/scd30.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/docs/scd30/scd30.pdf"],"categories":["Richard
