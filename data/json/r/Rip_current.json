Typical flow is at 0.5\nmetres per second (1â2 feet per second), and can be as fast as 2.5 metres per\nsecond (8 feet per second). They can move to different locations on a beach\nbreak, up to tens of metres (a few hundred feet) a day. They can occur at any\nbeach with breaking waves, including oceans, seas, and large lakes. {{\ncite web |url=http://www.usla.org/ripcurrents/ |title=United States\nLifesaving Association's - Rip Currents |publisher=www.usla.org |accessdate=8\nJuly 2009 }}\n","linknr":657,"url":"Rip_current","recorded":1362583889,"links":46,"instances":["stream","wave_action"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oceanography","Physical oceanography","Bodies of water","Tides","Surf lifesaving"],"headings":["Causes and occurrence","Dangers","Escaping a rip current","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Ripcurrent_viewed_sideway.jpg/240px-Ripcurrent_viewed_sideway.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Backcomp-clean.gif/240px-Backcomp-clean.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Hanakapiai_Beach_Warning_Sign_Only.jpg/150px-Hanakapiai_Beach_Warning_Sign_Only.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Accreting_coast_Image6.svg/140px-Accreting_coast_Image6.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Fernando_noronha.jpg/140px-Fernando_noronha.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["undertow","wave_action"],["current","stream"]],"members":["current","undertow"],"related":["Sea","Shore","Second","Ocean","Sea","Lake","Wind","Sandbar","Pier","Jetty","Undertow_(wave_action)","Wind_wave","Hurricane","Tide","Radiation_stress","Wave_shoaling","Human_swimming","Beach","Drowning","Exhaustion","Current_(stream)","Ocean_current","Personal_flotation_device","Topography","United_States","Lifeguard","Treadmill"]}
