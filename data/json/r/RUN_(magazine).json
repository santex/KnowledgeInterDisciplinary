Bi-monthly publishing began in\nJune/July 1990 (issue #78, volume 7 number 6), and went on until the magazine\nfolded in November/December 1992 (issue #94, volume 9 number 6). In its heyday,\nRUN's monthly circulation was in the 200,000â300,000 range. Folio, the trade\njournal of the magazine industry, rated it as the second fastest-growing U.S.\nmagazine of 1985.\n\nThe magazine contained articles about Commodore 8-bit home computers and\nperipherals, as well as reviews on available software packages for the\ncomputers. In addition, every issue featured several type-in programs written in\nBASIC and/or machine language. The magazine's name came from the BASIC command\n\" RUN \", which started execution of the computer's program, presumably\ntyped in from the magazine.\n\nMajor RUN columns included the following: *'Magic', perhaps the magazine's most\ndistinctive feature, was a collection of short programs, programming tips, and\ntricks, mostly submitted by readers. Several dozen were published each month,\nand they were all numbered in hexadecimal, with each issue's numbering taking\nover where the last one had left off. Readers could write to Magic at P.O Box\n101011, a box number chosen for its binary appearance. Often, a \"special issue\"\npublished at the end of the year would collect the year's Magic entries and\naugment them with many unpublished ones. This column, created and compiled by\nLouis F. Sander, debuted in the first issue and was run during the entire life\nof the magazine. *'Mega-Magic' was a monthly column that included type-in\nprogramming utilities larger and more powerful than those in the standard Magic\ncolumns. *'Commodore Clinic', a letters column, allowed users to write in with\nquestions about hardware and software issues, which would then be answered in\nthe magazine. *'RUN Amok' was an errata column that published corrections to\nprevious type-in programs and articles. *'Software Gallery' reviewed various\ncommercial software packages. *'128 Mode', taken over from Commodore's own\nmagazine when it was purchased by RUN, included programming advice and short\ntype-ins for the Commodore 128. *'Gold Mine' was another Louis F. Sander column\ntaken over from Commodore's magazine. It featured tips and tricks for\ncommercial games.\n\nFrequent contributors were Dennis Brisson (Editor/Editor-in-Chief), Tim Walsh\n(Technical Editor), Lou Wallace (Consulting Editor), Ellen Rule (Consulting\nEditor), Beth Jala (Review Editor), Tony Branter (Freelance Writer), Robert\nRockefeller (Freelance Writer) and Arnie Katz (Freelance Writer). Marilyn\nAnnucci and Swain Pratt were copy editors, and Marilyn wrote occasional software\nreviews. Also, John Ryan and Walt Latocha were freelance writers who became\ncolumnists and contributing editors at RUN.\n\nOn an interesting anecdote: Mike Konshak, a BASIC software developer and\nmechanical engineer contributed the popular 'DataFile' database management\nprogram and many other utilities for the Commodore 64 to RUN. The code was first\npublished in the back of the November 1984 RUN Issue. A small note, written by\nMike at the end of the article, stated \"If you don't want to type this in, send\nme $6.00 and I'll send you a disk\". 1500 RUN subscribers sent Mike money in the\nfirst month, which prompted the editors to create the \"Re-RUN\" disk to generate\nmore revenue for the publisher. A series of a dozen follow-on article by Mike\nwere published in the ensuing two years, and the programs were exclusively sold\non RUN's Re-RUN disk, as the editors restricted authors from soliciting for\ndisks in the magazine from then on. (Datafile then evolved into dFile64,\ndFile128, dFcalc, DFword, etc., and sold by Mike Konshak through his small\ncompany, MichaelSoft \"A cottage Industry of Home-Spun Software\").\n\nThe demise of the magazine was due to the public's dwindling interest in 8-bit\nmachines as the computer world evolved to 16-bit and standardized on the IBM PC\ncompatible platform for both business and home use. The front cover was\noriginally accented by a logotype reading \"RUN\", with each letter placed on a\nkey button resembling those used on the C-64. In June 1987 the keys were removed\nand the font became italicized with rounded letters.\n","linknr":116,"url":"RUN_(magazine)","recorded":1363367894,"links":["/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:RUN_Premiere_Issue.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/RUN_Premiere_Issue.png/250px-RUN_Premiere_Issue.png","/wiki/IDG_Communications","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Computer_magazine","/wiki/Publisher","/wiki/IDG","/wiki/Folio_(magazine)","/wiki/Commodore_International","/wiki/8-bit","/wiki/Home_computer","/wiki/Peripheral","/wiki/Computer_software","/wiki/Type-in_program","/wiki/BASIC","/wiki/Machine_code","/wiki/Hexadecimal","/wiki/Commodore_128","/wiki/8-bit","/wiki/16-bit","/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible","/wiki/Logotype","/wiki/Computer_keyboard_keys#Keys_on_a_computer_keyboard","/wiki/Italics","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Amiga_World","/wiki/Byte_(magazine)","/wiki/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_(magazine)","/wiki/Wayne_Green","/wiki/Compute!%27s_Gazette","/wiki/Commodore_Magazine","/wiki/Commodore_Power_Play","/wiki/Ahoy!_(magazine)","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUN_(Zeitschrift)","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/magazines/run/run.htm","http://10print.org","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&oldid=532633943","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Magazines_established_in_1984","/wiki/Category:Magazines_disestablished_in_1992","/wiki/Category:Defunct_American_computer_magazines","/wiki/Category:Home_computer_magazines","/wiki/Category:Commodore_64","/wiki/Category:American_computer_magazines","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_September_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=RUN+%28magazine%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=RUN+%28magazine%29","/wiki/RUN_(magazine)","/wiki/Talk:RUN_(magazine)","#","/wiki/RUN_(magazine)","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/RUN_(magazine)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/RUN_(magazine)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&oldid=532633943","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=RUN_%28magazine%29&id=532633943","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=RUN+%28magazine%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=RUN+%28magazine%29&oldid=532633943&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=RUN_(magazine)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUN_(magazine)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=
