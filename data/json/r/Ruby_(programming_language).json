It\nwas also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp http://www.ruby-\nlang.org/en/about/ . Ruby was first designed and developed in the mid-1990s\nby Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan.\n\nRuby supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object\noriented, imperative and reflective. It also has a dynamic type system and\nautomatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to\nSmalltalk, Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, Pike, and CLU.\n\nThe standard 1.8.7 implementation is written in C, as a single-pass interpreted\nlanguage. Starting with the 1.9 branch, and continuing with the current 2.0\nbranch, YARV has been used, and will eventually supersede the slower Ruby MRI.\nThe language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards\nPromotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a Japanese\ngovernment agency) for submission to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee\nand then to the International Organization for Standardization. It was accepted\nas a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in\n2011 [http://www.ipa.go.jp/about/press/20110322.html ãã­ã°ã©ã è¨èªRubyã®JISè¦æ ¼ï¼JIS X\n3017ï¼å¶å®ã«ã¤ãã¦] and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in\n2012.

Each takes a\ndifferent approach, with IronRuby, JRuby, MacRuby and Rubinius providing just-in-\ntime compilation and MacRuby and mruby also providing ahead-of-time compilation.\n","linknr":784,"url":"Ruby_(programming_language)","recorded":1362505109,"links":72,"instances":["computing","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","computer_science","programming","programming_language","program_lifecycle_phase","programming","programming_languages","programming_language","lisp","programming_language","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","computer_science","poignant_guide_to_ruby","computer_software","programming","programming_language","computer_programming","computer_science","software","computer_science","programming_language","computer_science","programming","programming","programming_language","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language","programming","ruby_interpreter"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Class-based
