{"cursor":"2190","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'regulator gene', 'regulator', or 'regulatory gene' is a gene involved in\ncontrolling the expression of one or more other genes. A regulator gene may\nencode a protein, or it may work at the level of RNA, as in the case of genes\nencoding microRNAs.\n\nIn prokaryotes, regulator genes often code for repressor proteins. Repressor\nproteins bind to operators or promoters, preventing RNA polymerase from\ntranscribing RNA. They are usually constantly expressed so the cell always has a\nsupply of repressor molecules on hand.\nInducers cause repressor proteins to change shape or otherwise become unable to\nbind DNA, allowing RNA polymerase to continue transcription. Regulator genes can\nbe located within an operon, adjacent to it, or far away from it.\n\nOther regulatory genes code for activator proteins. An activator binds to a\nsite on the DNA molecule and causes an increase in transcription of a nearby\ngene. In prokaryotes, a well-known example of an activator protein is the\ncatabolite activator protein or CAP, which is involved in positive control of\nthe lac operon.\n\nIn the regulation of gene expression, both activators and repressors are known\nto play important roles.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Regulator_gene","recorded":1362538367,"links":14,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operator","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["operator","promoter","transcription"],"related":["Gene","Gene_expression","Regulatory_protein","RNA","MicroRNA","Prokaryotes","Repressor_protein","Operator_(biology)","Promoter_(biology)","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_(genetics)","Inducer","Conformational_change","DNA","Operon","Activator_protein","Catabolite_activator_protein","Positive_control","Lac_operon","Regulation_of_gene_expression"]}
