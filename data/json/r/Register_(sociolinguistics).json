{"cursor":"9960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, a 'register' is a variety of a language used for a particular\npurpose or in a particular social setting. For example, when speaking in a\nformal setting, an English speaker may be more likely to adhere more closely to\nprescribed grammar, pronounce words ending in -ing with a velar nasal instead of\nan alveolar nasal (e.g. \"walking\", not \"walkin'\"), choose more formal words\n(e.g. father vs. dad, child vs. kid, etc.), and refrain from using contractions\nsuch as [[ain't]], than when speaking in an informal setting.\n\nAs with other types of language variation, there tends to be a spectrum of\nregisters rather than a discrete set of obviously distinct varieties â numerous\nregisters could be identified, with no clear boundaries between them. Discourse\ncategorisation is a complex problem, and even in the general definition of\n\"register\" given above (language variation defined by use not user), there are\ncases where other kinds of language variation, such as regional or age dialect,\noverlap. As a result of this complexity, scholarly consensus has not been\nreached for the definitions of terms such as \"register\", \"field\" or \"tenor\";\ndifferent scholars' definitions of these terms are often in direct contradiction\nof each other. Additional terms such as diatype, genre, text types, style,\nacrolect, mesolect and basilect, among many others, may be used to cover the\nsame or similar ground. Some prefer to restrict the domain of the term\n\"register\" to a specific vocabulary (Wardhaugh, 1986) (which one might commonly\ncall jargon), while others argue against the use of the term altogether. These\nvarious approaches with their own \"register,\" or set of terms and meanings, fall\nunder disciplines such as sociolinguistics, stylistics, pragmatics or systemic\nfunctional grammar.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Register_(sociolinguistics)","recorded":1362480896,"links":35,"instances":["linguistics","literature","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systemic functional linguistics","Discourse analysis","Grammar","Language varieties and styles","Diglossia"],"headings":["History and use","Register as formality scale","ISO standard","Diatype","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variety","linguistics"],["stylistics","linguistics"],["stylistics","linguistics"],["tone","literature"]],"members":["variety","tone","stylistics"],"related":["Linguistics","Variety_(linguistics)","Language","English_language","Prescription_and_description","Velar_nasal","Alveolar_nasal","Genre","Text_types","Stylistics_(linguistics)","Acrolect","Mesolect","Basilect","Jargon","Sociolinguistics","Stylistics_(linguistics)","Pragmatics","Systemic_functional_grammar","Thomas_Bertram_Reid","Legalese","Motherese","Michael_Halliday","Small_talk","Quebec_French","Language_teaching","Martin_Joos","Biblical","Archaism","Pledge_of_Allegiance","United_States_of_America","Elliptical_construction","Slang","International_Organization_for_Standardization","ISO_12620","Dialect","Child-directed_speech","Diglossia","Honorific_speech_in_Japanese","Korean_speech_levels","Literary_language","Tone_(literature)","Vernacular","Martin_Joos","Peter_Trudgill"]}
