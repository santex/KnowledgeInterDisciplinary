Typically\nresources are materials, money, services, staff, or other assets that are\ntransformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made\nunavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth,\nmeeting needs or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being.\nFrom a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the\nenvironment to satisfy human needs and wants.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Miller,\nG.T., and S.

In application within human society, commercial\nor non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource\nmanagement.\n\nResources have three main characteristics: utility, limited availability, and\npotential for depletion or consumption. Resources have been variously\ncategorized as biotic versus abiotic, renewable versus non-renewable, and\npotential versus actual, along with more elaborate classifications.\n","title":"Resource","headings":["Economic resources","Biological resources","Economic versus biological resources","Computer resources","Land or natural resources","Labour or human resources","Capital or infrastructure","Tangible versus intangible resources","Resource use and sustainable development","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Economics","3: Human_resources","3: Sustainability","3: Resource_depletion","3: Natural_resources","2: Natural_resource","2: Natural_environment","2: Biology","2: Minerals","2: Petroleum","1: Computer_science","1: Land_management","1: Competition","1: Conservation_movement","1: Stewardship","1: Resource_allocation","1: Resource_management","1: Utility","1: Scarcity","1: Biotic_material","1: Abiotic","1: Renewable_resource","1: Non-renewable_resource","1: Classical_economics","1: Entrepreneurship","1: Labour_economics","1: Raw_materials","1: Wage","1: Infrastructure","1: Interest","1: Entrepreneur","1: Management","1: Risk","1: Leadership","1: Visionary","1: Ecology","1: Developmental_biology","1: Maintenance_of_an_organism","1: Reproduction","1: Anthropocentrism","1: Ecocentric","1: Computer","1: Information_management","1: Water","1: Air","1: Biosphere","1: Fish","1: Wood_processing","1: Cost","1: Geological_period","1: Sustainable_yield","1: Ecological_footprint","1: Project_management","1: Durable_good","1: Depreciation","1: Production_process","1: Resource_distribution","1: Economic_inequality","1: Sustainable_development","1: Environmental_degradation","1: Over-consumption","1: Resource_curse","1: Tragedy_of_the_commons","1: Economic_growth","1: Ethical_consumerism","1: Prosperity","1: Quality_of_life","1: Wealth","1: Natural_resource_management","1: Resource-based_view"]}
