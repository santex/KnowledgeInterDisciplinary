All members of the\nRuminantia are ruminants: they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing\nin the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to\nre-chew it and thus extract the maximum possible food value.\n\nNot all ruminants belong to the Ruminantia.

Camels and llamas are among the\nexceptions, a suborder known as Tylopoda. Also,\nthere are a number of other large grazing mammals that, while not strictly\nruminants, have similar adaptations for surviving on large quantities of low-\ngrade food. Kangaroos and horses are examples.\n\n* 'ORDER [[artiodactyla|ARTIODACTYLA]]' ** Suborder Suina: pigs and peccaries **\n  Suborder Tylopoda: camels and llamas ** Suborder Cetruminantia: ruminants and\n  whales and hippos *** 'unranked Ruminantia' *** Infraorder Tragulina\n  (paraphyletic) **** Family â Prodremotheriidae **** Family â Hypertragulidae\n  **** Family â Praetragulidae **** Family â Protoceratidae **** Family Tragulidae: chevrotains, 6 living species\n  in 4 genera **** Family â Archaeomerycidae **** Family â Lophiomerycidae ***\n  Infraorder Pecora **** Family Cervidae: deer and moose, 49 living species in\n  16 genera **** Family â Gelocidae **** Family â Palaeomerycidae **** Family\n  â Hoplitomerycidae **** Family â Climacoceratidae **** Family Giraffidae:\n  giraffe and okapi, 2 living species in 2 genera **** Family Antilocapridae:\n  pronghorn, one living species in one genus **** Family â Leptomerycidae **** Family Moschidae: musk deer, 4 living\n  species in one genus **** Family Bovidae: cattle, goats, sheep, and antelope,\n  135 living species in 48 genera\n","linknr":595,"url":"Ruminantia","recorded":1362671205,"links":48,"instances":["genus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Even-toed ungulates"],"headings":["Evolution","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/White-tailed_deer.jpg/220px-White-tailed_deer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capra","genus"],["capra","genus"]],"members":["capra"],"related":["Eocene","White-tailed_Deer","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Artiodactyla","Cetruminantia","Giovanni_Antonio_Scopoli","Tragulidae","Moschidae","Cervidae","Giraffidae","Antilocapridae","Bovidae","Mammal","Cattle","Capra_(genus)","Sheep","Deer","Antelope","Ruminant","Cud","Camel","Llama","Tylopoda","Kangaroo","Horse","Suina","Pig","Peccary","Tylopoda","Camel","Llama","Cetruminantia","Whale","Hippo","Tragulina","Prodremotheriidae","Hypertragulidae","Praetragulidae","Protoceratidae","Tragulidae","Chevrotain","Archaeomerycidae","Lophiomerycidae","Pecora","Cervidae","Deer","Moose","Gelocidae","Palaeomerycidae","Hoplitomerycidae","Climacoceratidae","Giraffidae","Giraffe","Okapi","Antilocapridae","Pronghorn","Leptomerycidae","Moschidae","Musk_deer","Bovidae","Cattle","Capra_(genus)","Sheep","Antelope"]}
