For example, in \"the red car is fancier\nthan the blue one\", red and blue are restrictive, because they restrict which\ncars car and one are referring to. (\"The car is fancier than the one\" would make\nlittle sense.) By contrast, in \"John's beautiful mother\", beautiful is non-\nrestrictive; \"John's mother\" identifies her sufficiently, while \"beautiful\" only\nserves to add more information.\n\nRestrictive modifiers are also called defining, identifying, essential, or\nnecessary; non-restrictive ones are also called non-defining, non-identifying,\ndescriptive, or unnecessary (though this last term can be misleading). In\ncertain cases, generally when restrictiveness is marked syntactically through\nthe lack of commas, restrictive modifiers are called integrated and non-\nrestrictive ones are called non-integrated or supplementary.\n","title":"Restrictiveness","headings":["Restrictiveness in English","Sources","See also"]},"micro-relation":["2: Relative_clause","2: Relative_pronoun","1: Semantics","1: Grammatical_modifier","1: Reference#Semantics","1: Non-restrictive","1: Syntax","1: American_English","1: English_relative_clauses#That_or_which","1: Adjective","1: English_relative_clauses","1: Apposition"]}
