The piston\n is on the left, the crank is mounted on the flywheel axle on the right.]]\n\n\n'Reciprocating motion', also called 'reciprocation', is a repetitive up-and-down\nor back-and-forth motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including\nreciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single\nreciprocation cycle are called strokes.\n\nA crank can be used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or\nconversely turn reciprocating motion into circular motion.\n\nFor example, inside an internal combustion engine (a type of reciprocating\nengine), the expansion of burning fuel in the cylinders periodically pushes the\npiston down, which, through the connecting rod, turns the crankshaft. The\ncontinuing rotation of the crankshaft drives the piston back up, ready for the\nnext cycle. The piston moves in a reciprocating motion, which is converted into\ncircular motion of the crankshaft, which ultimately propels the vehicle or does\nother useful work. The vibrations felt when the engine is running are a side\neffect of the reciprocating motion of the pistons.\n\nReciprocating motion is clearly visible in early steam engines, particularly\nhorizontal stationary engines and outside-cylindered steam locomotives, as the\ncrank and connecting-rod usually are not enclosed.\n\nReciprocating motion is close to, but different from, sinusoidal simple harmonic\nmotion. The point on the camshaft which connects the connecting rod, rotates\nsmoothly at a constant velocity in a circle. Thus, the horizontal displacement,\nof that point, is indeed exactly sinusoidal by definition. However, during the\ncycle, the angle of the connecting rod changes continuously. So, the horizontal\ndisplacement of the \"far\" end of the connecting rod (ie, connected to the\npiston) differs from sinusoidal.\n\n\n*Oscillation *Stroboscope an instrument used to make a cyclically moving object\nappear to be slow-moving, or stationary. *Rotary reciprocation *Reciprocating\nsaw *Rotary reciprocating saw *Agitation\n","linknr":123,"url":"Reciprocating_motion","recorded":1362557516,"links":20,"instances":["engine","mechanism","engine","action","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanical engineering"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Steam_engine_in_action.gif/300px-Steam_engine_in_action.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/53/Rotary_to_Reciprocating_Motion.gif/300px-Rotary_to_Reciprocating_Motion.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Crystal_Clear_action_run.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_action_run.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crank","mechanism"],["motion","physics"],["stroke","engine"],["crank","mechanism"],["cylinder","engine"],["agitation","action"]],"members":["cylinder","crank","stroke","agitation","motion"],"related":["Piston","Crank_(mechanism)","Motion_(physics)","Reciprocating_engine","Pump","Stroke_(engine)","Crank_(mechanism)","Circular_motion","Internal_combustion_engine","Cylinder_(engine)","Piston","Connecting_rod","Crankshaft","Steam_engine","Stationary_steam_engine","Steam_locomotives","Sine_wave","Simple_harmonic_motion","Oscillation","Stroboscope","Rotary_reciprocation","Reciprocating_saw","Rotary_reciprocating_saw","Agitation_(action)"]}
