{"cursor":"3258","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'regulatory sequence' is a segment of a nucleic acid molecule which is capable\nof increasing or decreasing the expression of specific genes within an organism.\nRegulation of gene expression is an essential feature of all living organisms\nand viruses.\n\nIn DNA, regulation of gene expression normally happens at the level of RNA\nbiosynthesis (transcription), and is accomplished through the sequence-specific\nbinding of proteins (transcription factors) that activate or inhibit\ntranscription. Transcription factors may act as activators, repressors, or both.\nRepressors often act by preventing RNA polymerase from forming a productive\ncomplex with the transcriptional initiation region (promoter), while activators\nfacilitate formation of a productive complex.\n\nIn RNA, regulation may occur at the level of protein biosynthesis (translation),\nRNA cleavage, RNA splicing, or transcriptional termination. Regulatory sequences\nare frequently associated with messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, where they are\nused to control mRNA biogenesis or translation. A variety of biological\nmolecules may bind to the RNA to accomplish this regulation, including proteins\n(e.g. translational repressors and splicing factors), other RNA molecules (e.g.\nmiRNA) and small molecules, in the case of riboswitches.\n\nResearch to find all regulatory regions in the genomes of all sorts of organisms\nis under way.

A\ncomparative analysis of relative occurrence of transcription factor binding\nsites in vertebrate genomes and gene promoter areas Conserved non-coding\nsequences often contain regulatory regions, and so they are often the subject of\nthese analyses.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Regulatory_sequence","recorded":1362373892,"links":21,"instances":["biology","genetics","biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Regulatory sequences|","Gene expression"],"headings":["Examples","For the insulin gene","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["activator","genetics"],["promoter","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["operator","biology"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["operator","activator","promoter","translation","transcription"],"related":["Nucleic_acid","Gene_expression","Regulation_of_gene_expression","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Transcription_factors","Activator_(genetics)","Repressors","RNA_polymerase","Promoter_(genetics)","RNA","Translation_(biology)","RNA_splicing","Messenger_RNA","MicroRNA","Small_molecules","Riboswitches","Conserved_non-coding_sequence","CAAT_box","CCAAT_box","Operator_(biology)","Pribnow_box","TATA_box","SECIS_element","Polyadenylation","A-box","Z-box","C-box","E-box","G-box","Insulin_gene","A5_regulatory_sequence","Z_regulatory_sequence","Negative_regulatory_element","C2_regulatory_sequence","E2_regulatory_sequence","A3_regulatory_sequence","CAMP_response_element","A2_regulatory_sequence","CAAT_enhancer_binding","C1_regulatory_sequence","E1_regulatory_sequence","G1_regulatory_sequence","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Cis-acting_element","Gene_regulatory_network","Operon","DNA_binding_site","Promoter_(biology)","Trans-acting_factor","ORegAnno"]}
