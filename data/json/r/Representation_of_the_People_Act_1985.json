Expatriate electors were\nable to register as overseas electors at British consular posts, starting in the\nsummer of 1986. When registered, expatriate voters were eligible to vote by\nproxy at any Parliamentary or European Parliament elections which were held\nafter the 1987 register came into force on 16 February, 1987. It was estimated\nthat half-a-million British expatriates were enfranchised by the Act. [http-\n://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/788AE7FC40A548E387A5BBE652B387F7.pdf\nCampaign Guide], p. 463.\n\nThe Act also made British people abroad on holiday eligible to vote by postal\nballot or by proxy, as well as those who were not reasonably expected to be able\nto by being physically present at the polling station.\n\nThe Act modified the rules concerning deposits in Parliamentary elections.\nPreviously the deposit had been Â£150 and was under this Act raised to Â£500.\nThe percentage of votes needed to retain the deposit was lowered from 12Â½%\nto 5%. The deposit for election to the European Parliament were raised from\nÂ£600 to Â£700.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Representation_of_the_People_Act_1985","recorded":1375055838,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1985&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1985&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies","/wiki/Proxy_voting","/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Postal_ballot","/wiki/Polling_station","/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1985&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/788AE7FC40A548E387A5BBE652B387F7.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Representation_of_the_People_Act_1985&action=edit&section=2","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/50","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980%E2%80%931999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_2000%E2%80%93present","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_England_Measures","/wiki/Church_of_England_Assembly_(Powers)_Act_1919","/wiki/Devolution","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_and_Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Orders_in_Council_for_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Statutory_Instrument_(UK)","/wiki/Scottish_Statutory_Instrument","/wiki/Act_of_Sederunt","/wiki/Template:UK_electoral_reform","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_electoral_reform","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_electoral_reform&action=edit","/wiki/Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Scottish_Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Irish_Reform_Act_1832","/wiki/Reform_Act_1867","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Scotland)_Act_1868","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Ireland)_Act_1868","/wiki/Police_burgh","/wiki/Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835","/wiki/Municipal_Corporations_(Ireland)_Act_1840","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1884","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Eq
