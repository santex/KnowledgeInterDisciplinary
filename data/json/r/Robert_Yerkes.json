Along with John D. Dodson,\nYerkes developed the Yerkes-Dodson law relating arousal to performance.\n\nAs time went on, however, Yerkes began to propagate his support for eugenics in\nthe 1910s and 1920s. His works are largely considered politically incorrect by\nmodern anthropologists and academics.
