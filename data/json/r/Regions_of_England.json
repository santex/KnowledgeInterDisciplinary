Between 1994 and 2011, nine regions had an official\nadministrative role within UK Government. While they no longer fulfill this\nrole, they continue to be used for administrative purposes. They define areas\n(constituencies) for the purposes of elections to the European Parliament.\nEurostat also uses them to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial\nUnits for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\"NUTS 1 regions\") within the European\nUnion. The regions generally followed the boundaries of \"standard regions\"\nestablished in the 1940s.\n\nThe London region is coterminous with the administrative area of Greater London,\nwhich has a directly elected Mayor and Assembly. The other eight regions have\nLocal authority leaders' boards, which have limited powers and functions\ndelegated by Central Government departments, with members appointed by local\ngovernment bodies. These boards replaced indirectly elected regional chambers,\nwhich were established in 1998 and undertook a range of co-ordinating, lobbying,\nscrutiny and strategic planning functions until their abolition in 2010.\n\nEach region also had a Government Office with some responsibility for\ncoordinating policy, and, from 2007 to 2010, each also had its own part-time\nregional minister within the Government. In 2009 the House of Commons\nestablished regional Select Committees for each of the regions outside of\nLondon. These committees ceased to exist upon the dissolution of Parliament on\n12 April 2010 and were not re-established by the newly elected House.\nRegional ministers were not reappointed by the incoming Coalition Government,\nand the Government Offices were abolished in 2011.\n","linknr":528,"url":"Regions_of_England","recorded":1362484576,"links":67,"instances":["region","united_kingdom","united_kingdom","rieps","uk","united_kingdom"],"pdf":["http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/press_13_10.pdf","http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/press_13_10.pdf"],"categories":["Regions
