{"cursor":"24218","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] To 'reuse' is to use an item again after it has been used. This includes\nconventional reuse where the item is used again for the same function, and new-\nlife reuse where it is used for a different function. In contrast, recycling is\nthe breaking down of the used item into raw materials which are used to make new\nitems. By taking useful products and exchanging them, without reprocessing,\nreuse help save time, money, energy, and resources. In broader economic terms,\nreuse offers quality products to people and organizations with limited means,\nwhile generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy.\n\nHistorically, financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the\ndeveloping world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse, however\nrising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of disposable\nproducts has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in\nricher countries, leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current\nenvironmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations, such as\nthe new packaging regulations, are gradually beginning to reverse the situation.\n\nOne example of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of milk in refillable\nbottles; other examples include the retreading of tires and the use of\nreturnable/reusable plastic boxes, shipping containers, instead of single-use\ncorrugated fiberboard boxes.\n\ns, being social insects, have been able to reuse rail tracks abandoned by humans\nfor their own transportation.
