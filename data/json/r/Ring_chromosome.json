Ring chromosomes were first discovered by Lilian Vaughan Morgan in\n1926. A ring chromosome is denoted by the symbol r in human genetics\nor R in Drosophila genetics. Ring chromosomes may form in cells following\ngenetic damage by mutagens like radiation, but they may also arise spontaneously\nduring development.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Ring_chromosome","recorded":1362566706,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ring chromosomes"],"headings":["Formation","Associated diseases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Human_karyotype_from_bladder_carcinoma%2C_including_ring_chromosome.jpg/300px-Human_karyotype_from_bladder_carcinoma%2C_including_ring_chromosome.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Ring_chromosome.gif/200px-Ring_chromosome.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lilian_Vaughan_Morgan","Drosophila_genetics","Telomeres","Genetic_disorder","Ring_chromosome_20_syndrome","Epilepsy","Ring_chromosome_14_syndrome","Mental_retardation","Dwarfism","Microcephaly","Turner_syndrome","Chromosome_abnormalities"]}
