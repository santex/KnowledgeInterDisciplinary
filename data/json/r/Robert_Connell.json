He was\nordained a priest in 1896 and moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1901 after\nseveral years of mission work in Alberta. He served as a vicar in various\nparishes (including two years in California) before retiring from the pulpit in\n1923.\n\nConnell was also involved with education occasionally teaching art at a private\nboy's school and botany at Victoria High School. He also wrote a weekly column\non nature and geology for the Victoria Daily Times and later the Victoria Daily\nColonist.\n\nIn 1932, Connell joined the League for Social Reconstruction and also joined the\nBC Reconstructionist Party formed by some supporters of the LSR in British\nColumbia. The short-lived party quickly joined the Co-operative Commonwealth\nFederation after it was formed in August of the same year.\n\nConnell agreed to run for the provincial legislature as a CCF candidate in the\n1933 provincial election, the new party won seven seats, including Connell's\nVictoria City riding. With the collapse of the governing Conservative Party,\nwhich was in such disarray it decided not to run any candidates, and the\nelection of a Liberal government the CCF found itself as the official opposition\nin the British Columbia legislature. Leaderless, the party caucus met and agreed\nto appoint Connell as Leader of the Opposition.\n\nConnell was a fervent believer of the social gospel movement.\nHe was a moderate when compared to many more radical members of the party,\nincluding a majority of the party executive and much of the caucus, many who\ncame to the CCF from the Socialist Party of Canada. The SPC which had co-founded\nthe CCF in BC and remained in existence as a distinct entity. Connell urged co-\noperation with the Liberals and Conservatives on certain issues and was\ncriticized by CCFers such as T. Guy Sheppard for refusing to call for a general\nstrike against the Liberal government of \"Duff\" Pattullo. He\nalso was the target of criticism for his opposition to class-based politics in\nthe pages of the SPC's newspaper, The BC Clarion.\n\nTensions between Connell and the left-wing of the party emerged publicly when he\nstood up in the legislature to denounce the radical language of fellow CCF MP\nErnest Winch who had given a speech on the merits of communism. At the 1936\nparty convention, Connell survived a vote of non-confidence in his leadership by\na margin of 138-76. Connell's leadership again came under fire\nwhen he publicly opposed a resolution in favour of socializing banking and\ncredit several weeks after it was approved. In July 1936, he issued a statement\nto the party executive and to the media revoking his support for the party\nplatform approved by the convention three weeks earlier. The\npolicy disagreement, which came to be known as the \"Connell Affair\" brought to a\nhead a conflict in the party between moderates such as Connell and\n\"revolutionary\" Marxists such as Winch. Connell was expelled from the party in\nAugust and he promptly formed a new political party, the \"Social Constructives\"\nwith three fellow MLAs from the CCF's 7 person caucus - Jack Price, R.B. Swailes\nand Ernest Bakewell. Also joining Connell was Victor Midgely, former leader of\nthe One Big Union, and Bill Pritchard, editor and owner of The Commonwealth.\nPritchard's defection left the BC CCF without a party newspaper. Howard,\nIrene, \"The Struggle for Social Justice in British Columbia: Helena Gutteridge\",\nUBC Press, 1992, page 183-184\n\nWith four MLAs in Connell's new \"Social Constructive\" caucus versus three\nremaining in the CCF, Connell was able to retain his position as Leader of the\nOfficial Opposition for the remainder of the life of the legislature.\n\nThe \"Social Constructives\" stood 14 candidates (out of a possible 48) in the\n1937 general election but failed to win any seats. The party received 8,086\nvotes to the CCF's 119,400.\n\nWith the end of his political career, Connell returned to spiritual work\nbecoming Archdeacon of Comox in 1940.\n\n\n{{succession box|
