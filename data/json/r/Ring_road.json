{"cursor":"11770","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n\n\n}} , England.]]\n\nA 'ring road' (UK, Europe, China, and most Commonwealth countries), 'orbital\nmotorway,' 'beltway' (United States), 'circumferential highway', or 'loop\nhighway' is a road that encircles a town or city. The name \"ring road\" is used\nfor the majority of metropolitan circumferential routes in the European Union,\nsuch as the Berliner Ring, the Brussels Ring, the Amsterdam Ring, the Boulevard\nPÃ©riphÃ©rique around Paris and the Leeds Inner and Outer ring roads. Australia\nand India also use the term ring road, as in Melbourne's Western Ring Road and\nHyderabad's Outer Ring Road.\n\nIn Europe, some ring roads, particularly those of motorway standard which are\nlonger in length, are often known as \"orbital motorways\". Examples include the\nLondon Orbital (188 km), Rome Orbital (68 km), Manchester Orbital (56 km) and\nthe Madrid Orbital (33 km). In the United States, many ring roads are called\n'beltways' or 'loops', such as the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C. Some\nring roads, such as the Washington's Capital Beltway, use \"Inner Loop\" and\n\"Outer Loop\" terminology for directions of travel, since cardinal (compass)\ndirections cannot be signed uniformly around the entire loop.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Ring_road","recorded":1362564915,"links":45,"instances":["ireland","capital_beltway","hyderabad","harrisburg","maryland","netherlands","north_carolina","florida","tennessee","road","baltimore","texas"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types
