Radio waves have\nfrequencies from 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, and corresponding wavelengths\nranging from 1 millimeter to 100 kilometers. Like all other electromagnetic\nwaves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are\nmade by lightning, or by astronomical objects. Artificially generated radio\nwaves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and\nother navigation systems, communications satellites, computer networks and\ninnumerable other applications. Different frequencies of radio waves have\ndifferent propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves may\ncover a part of the Earth very consistently, shorter waves can reflect off the\nionosphere and travel around the world, and much shorter wavelengths bend or\nreflect very little and travel on a line of sight.\n\ns (E) and magnetic fields (H) of radio waves emitted by a monopole radio\n      transmitting antenna (small dark vertical line in the center).
