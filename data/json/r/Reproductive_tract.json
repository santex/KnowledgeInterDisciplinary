Many non-living substances such as\nfluids, hormones, and pheromones are also important accessories to the\nreproductive system.

Unlike most organ systems, the sexes of\ndifferentiated species often have significant differences. These differences\nallow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which\nallows for the possibility of greater genetic fitness of the offspring.

Diseases of the human reproductive\nsystem are very common and widespread, particularly communicable sexually\ntransmitted diseases.
