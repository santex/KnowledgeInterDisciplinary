As a result, he became\nprotective of his privacy and his work. Years after his death, at the dawn of\nthe Space Age, he came to be recognized as one of the founding fathers of modern\nrocketry. {{Citation\n  | url = http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm chapter =\n  | Part I, Chapter I | section = The Highway to Space\n  |last=Swenson |first=Loyd S., Jr |last2=Grimwood | first2=James M\n  |last3=Alexander | first3=Charles C\n  | title = This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury | pages = 13â18 year =\n  | 1989 publisher = NASA accessdate = 2009-05-27}} {{cite news url =\n  | http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990613,00.html title\n  | =Rocket Scientist Robert Goddard last=Kluger |first=Jeffrey date = March 29,\n  | 1999 publisher = Time accessdate = 2010-04-23}} {{cite web url =\n  | http://www.fathom.com/course/21701743/session1.html title = Part I: Chemical\n  | Propulsion and the Dawn of Rocket Science work = The Past and Future of\n  | Rocket Engine Propulsion year = 2002 publisher = Regents of the University\n  | of Michigan accessdate = 2007-12-28}}.
