Her DNA work achieved the\nmost fame because DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) plays essential roles in cell\nmetabolism and genetics, and the discovery of its structure helped scientists\nunderstand how genetic information is passed from parents to children.\n\nFranklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA which\nled to the discovery of DNA double helix. Her data, according to Francis Crick,\nwere \"the data we actually used\" Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacques\nMonod was discovered in the Archives of the Pasteur Institute by Doris Zeller,\nthen reprinted in \"Nature Correspondence\" 425, 15 on September 4, 2003 Watson\nconfirmed this opinion in his own statement at the opening of the King's college\nFranklin-Wilkins building in 2000. to formulate Crick and Watson's 1953\nhypothesis regarding the structure of DNA. Watson JD, Crick FHC\n(1953). \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\". Nature 171: 737â738.\n[http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf Full text PDF] This article\nwas immediately followed by the two King's submissions: M.H.F. Wilkins, A.R.\nStokes, and H.R. Wilson. Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids,\npp738â740 then by: Rosalind E. Franklin and R.G. Gosling. Molecular\nconfiguration of Sodium Thymonucleate pp 740â741. Franklin's images of X-\nray diffraction confirming the helical structure of DNA were shown to Watson\nwithout her approval or knowledge. Though this image and her accurate\ninterpretation of the data provided valuable insight into the DNA structure,\nFranklin's scientific contributions to the discovery of the double helix are\noften overlooked. Unpublished drafts of her papers (written just as she was\narranging to leave King's College London) show that she had independently\ndetermined the overall B-form of the DNA helix and the location of the phosphate\ngroups on the outside of the structure. Moreover, Franklin personally told Crick\nand Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside, which was crucial since\nbefore this both they and Linus Pauling had independently generated non-\nilluminating models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.

Harvard University Press, 2008 However, her work was published\nthird, in the series of three DNA Nature articles, led by the paper of Watson\nand Crick which only hinted at her contribution to their hypothesis.
