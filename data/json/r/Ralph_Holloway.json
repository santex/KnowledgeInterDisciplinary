Since obtaining his Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley in\n1964, Holloway has served as a professor of anthropology at Columbia. Holloway's\ninterests lie in craniology, producing endocasts, primate behavior, biology of\ngender, sexual dimorphism in the corpus callosum, and other topics.\n\nHolloway's work on the Taung Child was one of the first to suggest brain\nreorganization occurring before the increase of brain size in hominids. His\nclaim that the lunate sulcus, a sulcus which marks the boundary of the occipital\nlobe, was in a posterior position to that of apes suggests that the reduction of\nthe occipital lobe was accompanied by enlargements of parts of the brain\nassociated with higher cognitive function.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Ralph_Holloway","recorded":1362480824,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1935 births","Living people","Columbia University faculty","American anthropologists","Biology of gender","People associated with the American Museum of Natural History"],"headings":["References","See also","Related Readings","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Physical_anthropologist","Columbia_University","American_Museum_of_Natural_History","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Anthropology","Craniology","Endocast","Biology_of_gender","Sexual_dimorphism","Corpus_callosum","Taung_Child"]}
