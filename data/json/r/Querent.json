{"cursor":"3477","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Querent' as \"one who seeks\" is derived, according to the Oxford English\nDictionary, from the Latin quÃ¦rÄns \"seeker,\" the present participle of quÃ¦rere\n\"to seek, gain, ask.\"\n\nIt is clear that Querent became used to denote \"a person who questions an\nOracle\" because it is usually when you have a problem that requires Otherworldly\nadvice that you would seek out the oracle in the first place. This oracle may\nsimply be a divinatory technique, such as the I Ching, that is manipulated by\nthe Querent themselves without recourse to any other human agency. Alternatively\nit may involve another person, someone perhaps seen as a \"fortune teller\"\n— particularly a Practitioner of Tarot reading or other form of Mediumship\n— from whom advice is sought.\n\nThe kinds of questions asked by a Querent may vary widely according to their\nneeds, and the methodology of the divination system. Some Querents seek general\nadvice trusting that they will be told what is most pertinent to their present\nsituation. Others will ask questions that are only slightly more direct such\nas, \"Will I be rich?\" and \"What kind of person will I marry?\" Still others seek\nspecific advice. Although opinions are divided amongst Practitioners of various\ndivinatory arts as to what constitutes a 'good' question: some say that\nquestions in the form of \"What would be likely to happen if I followed course\nof action X?\" is potentially more useful to a Querent than \"Should I follow\ncourse of action X?\" Yes and no questions are not always best because of the\nfinality they represent, besides usually most Querents are after far more than\njust Yes and No.\n\nThe mindset of a Querent plays a significant role in the development of a clear\nand dynamic reading. Those who approach a reading with heavy skepticism,\nespecially if they are dealing with a human oracle, are often unwilling to\nengage the Reader at all which can result in a stifling of the prophetic flow\nthat is so intrinsic to divination. Conversely, some approach with great\nrespect, as if they predetermine that the Diviner or the system of divination is\ninfluence by some kind of higher, even divine, power and thereby will believe\nvirtually anything they are told. A third ideal group will talk freely with a\nhuman oracle and accept their advice with a healthy dose of skepticism, yet\nstill remain open minded to the possibility of revelation.\n\nThese Querent attitudes often stem from their personal beliefs concerning\nspirituality and the nature of the particular oracular system they are\nconsulting. Common theories that inform these attitudes divide generally into\nthree classes:\n\n* The belief that the reading is influenced by synchronicity, or some other\n  system of coincident cause and effect, and can therefore show both personal\n  and more general patterns.\n\n* The belief that their own subconscious mind or Higher Self is somehow\n  influencing the reading in order to pass them advice. These people often point\n  to dream interpretation as a parallel resource.\n\n* The belief that some external agency, such as Deities, Spiritual Guides and\n  Ancestral Spirits, will use the reading to advise them.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Querent","recorded":1362484745,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cartomancy","Divination","Prediction","Technical factors of astrology","Tarot reading"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oxford_English_Dictionary","Oracle","Divination","I_Ching","Fortune_teller","Tarot","Mediumship","Synchronicity","Subconscious_mind","Higher_Self","Dream_interpretation"]}
