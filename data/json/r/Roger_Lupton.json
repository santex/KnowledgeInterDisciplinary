{"cursor":"3573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Roger Lupton' (1456â1540) was an English lawyer and college head.\n\nHe was born in the parish of Sedbergh, then in Yorkshire, in the year 1456. In\n1483, he was awarded a Bachelor of Canon Law degree from King's College,\nCambridge, and Doctor of Canon law in 1504.\n\nShortly after that, he served in the Chancery Court, and went onto become Rector\nof Harlton, Cambridgeshire, and then a Canon of Windsor in 1500. He was elected\na fellow and then Provost of Eton College in February, 1503/4, which post he\nretained until 1535.\n\n1525 is the accepted date at which Roger Lupton began to provide for a Chantry\nSchool in Sedbergh (Sedbergh School).\n\nA few scholars were gathered together under a Chaplain, one Henry Blomeyr.\nLupton's intention was twofold: \"for the maintaining and increase of learning in\nChrist's Church\", and \"for his soul's health\"; an agreement was made that the\nChaplain and Scholars should have free seats in the chancel of Sedbergh Church.\n\nIn 1527, Six Scholarships to St John's College, Cambridge were established, to\nbe awarded exclusively to boys from the School one of the documents held at St\nJohn's relating to this says that the Scholars are \"to be chosen from the\ngrammar scole of Sedbare, wher the sayd Roger Lupton was borne and bath foundyd\na perpetuall chauntry and the sayd grammar scole indued sufficiently with\nlyvelode and lands truly and suerly purchased and manciones sufficiently\nbylded\". After purchase of land and building of a school, almost certainly on\nthe site of the present School Library, the foundation deed was signed, binding\nthe School to St. John's College, Cambridge, which was to have the appointment\nof its Headmasters. In 1535, Two further scholarships to Cambridge were\nestablished, with provision for two fellowships also.\n\n1539/40 - Roger Lupton died and was buried in the Lupton Chapel at Eton. Named\nfor a generous donation made to Eton College by Lupton himself. A bell tower and\ndormitory has also been dedicated in his name, and is perhaps the most famous\nbuilding in the college. According to a new book about Lupton by R. Cann (2005),\nLupton died in 1540.\n\nRoger Lupton is currently survived by his descendents, who currently live in\nVancouver, Canada. They are fully aware of Lupton's contributions to Eton, and\nhope to re-visit their ancestor's burial site and legacy sometime.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Roger_Lupton","recorded":1375082811,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sedbergh","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Court_of_Chancery","/wiki/Harlton","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire","/wiki/List_of_Provosts_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Sedbergh_School","/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Lupton_family","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=LPTN483R&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17203","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Bost&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Provost_of_Eton","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Aldrich&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/22099927","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&oldid=540252422","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1456_births","/wiki/Category:1540_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_academics","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_King%27s_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:Canons_of_Windsor","/wiki/Category:15th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:16th-century_English_people","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Tudor_period","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roger+Lupton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roger+Lupton","/wiki/Roger_Lupton","/wiki/Talk:Roger_Lupton","#","/wiki/Roger_Lupton","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Roger_Lupton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Roger_Lupton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&oldid=540252422","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7358557","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Roger_Lupton&id=540252422","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Roger+Lupton","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Roger+Lupton&oldid=540252422&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Lupton&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7358557#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lupton","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1456
