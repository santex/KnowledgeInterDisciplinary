He was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for 1387, 1391, 1394, 1397,\n1401 and 1410 and High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1403 and 1415.\n\nIn 1393 Richard was granted leave to hold a tournament in Carlisle. In 1397,\nafter campaigning in Ireland with Richard II he was appointed Master of the\nHorse. Between 1399 and 1400 he travelled to Ireland with John de Cobham, 3rd\nBaron Cobham before returning to England in May to create a peace with Scotland.\nIn 1405 he was commissioned to fine members of the gentry associated with the\nrebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and was the same year\nelected to represent Yorkshire as a knight of the shire (MP), a job he returned\nto for the Parliaments of 1414, 1415, 1420 and 1421. In 1408 he was commissioned\nagain to fine gentry associated with the Percy Rebellion after their defeat at\nthe Battle of Bramham Moor.\n\nIn 1409 and 1410 he attempted to gain peace with the Scots; after this failed\nhe was tasked with raising forces against them. In 1415 along with John Strange\nhe raised forces against the French before the Hundred Years' War (1415â1429)\nand was elected speaker of the 1415 parliament, which met on 4 November and\nlasted only 8 days due to the loyalist feeling after the Battle of Agincourt\nbefore Parliament voted for supplies to maintain the war with France. In 1421\nhe was again commissioned to raise money for the war with France before his\ndeath in 1426.\n\nHe died in 1426 and was buried in the Church of the Black Friars, York. An\neleborate memorial to him was installed in Harewood church, Yorkshire, where his\nestates lay.
