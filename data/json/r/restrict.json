programming language"],"text":"\n\nIn the C programming language, as of the C99 standard, <code>restrict</code> is\na keyword that can be used in pointer declarations. The <code>restrict</code>\nkeyword is a declaration of intent given by the programmer to the compiler. It\nsays that for the lifetime of the pointer, only it or a value directly derived\nfrom it (such as ) will be used to access the object to which it points. This\nlimits the effects of pointer aliasing, aiding caching optimizations. If the\ndeclaration of intent is not followed and the object is accessed by an\nindependent pointer, this will result in undefined behavior. The use of the\n<code>restrict</code> keyword in C, in principle, allows non-obtuse C to achieve\nthe same performance as the same program written in Fortran.<ref\nname=drepper></ref>\n","title":"restrict","headings":["Optimization","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: C_programming_language","1: C99","1: Compiler","1: Pointer_aliasing","1: Undefined_behavior","1: Fortran","1: Pointer_alias","1: International_Organization_for_Standardization"]}
