For regular rings, Krull dimension agrees with global\nhomological dimension.\n\nExamples of regular rings include fields (of dimension zero) and Dedekind\ndomains. If A is regular then so is A[X], with dimension one greater than\nthat of A.\n\nA regular ring need not be an integral domain. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/18657/is-a-regular-ring-a-\ndomain\n","linknr":94,"url":"Regular_ring","recorded":1362672082,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ring theory"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Commutative_algebra","Noetherian_ring","Localization_of_a_ring","Prime_ideal","Regular_local_ring","Krull_dimension","Jean-Pierre_Serre","Global_homological_dimension","Dedekind_domain","Jean-Pierre_Serre","Springer-Verlag"]}
