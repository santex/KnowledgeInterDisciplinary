The\nplot intrigued Hughes, who had a strong interest in Hollywood, and he invested\n$40,000 in the project. During filming he sat on the sidelines in order to\nfamiliarize himself with the technical aspects of production. The budget\neventually doubled, and after seeing the completed film numerous times, Hughes\nhired Dorothy Arzner to help him re-edit it, but there was little they could do\nto salvage it. When asked his opinion of it, Hughes' uncle, novelist and film\ndirector Rupert Hughes, said, \"It's nothing. No plot. No build up. No character\ndevelopment. The acting stinks. Destroy the film. If anbody sees it, you and\nthat [[Homosexuality|homo]] Graves will be the laughing stock of Hollywood.\"\nHughes took his uncle's advice and ordered the screening room projectionist to\nburn the sole copy. Graves later claimed he and Hughes had engaged in a sexual\nrelationship while collaborating on Swell Hogan. Porter, Darwin, Howard\nHughes: Hell's Angel. Blood Moon Productions, Ltd. 2005.

ISBN 1-59777-549-5, pp. 60-61\n\nDespite this temporary setback, Graves directed four more films in 1927 and\ncontributed the story or wrote the screenplay for twelve additional films, but\nmost of his career was spent acting. While working for Sennett, Graves met Frank\nCapra, and the director later cast him in several films, including [[Flight\n(1929 film)|Flight]], based on a story by Graves, and a series of adventure\nfilms in which he was cast opposite Jack Holt.\n\nGraves retired from films in 1949. He died in Santa Barbara, California, aged\n77.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Ralph_Graves","recorded":1375057770,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ralph_Graves_(writer)","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California","/wiki/Screenwriter","/wiki/Film_director","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Mack_Sennett","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Howard_Hughes","/wiki/Hughes_Tool_Company","/wiki/Pitch_(filmmaking)","/wiki/Bowery","/wiki/Dorothy_Arzner","/wiki/Rupert_Hughes","/wiki/Homosexuality","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Frank_Capra","/wiki/Flight_(1929_film)","/wiki/Jack_Holt_(actor)","/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/The_Sporting_Life_(1918_film)","/wiki/Men_Who_Have_Made_Love_to_Me","/wiki/The_White_Heather","/wiki/Nobody_Home_(film)","/wiki/The_Greatest_Question","/wiki/Polly_with_a_Past","/wiki/Dream_Street_(film)","/wiki/Kindred_of_the_Dust","/wiki/The_Ghost_Patrol","/wiki/The_Extra_Girl","/wiki/Yolanda_(film)","/wiki/A_Reno_Divorce","/wiki/The_Flying_Fleet","/wiki/The_Fatal_Warning","/wiki/Flight_(1929_film)","/wiki/Song_of_Love_(1929_film)","/wiki/Ladies_of_Leisure","/wiki/Dirigible_(film)","/wiki/Salvation_Nell","/wiki/Speed_Limited","/wiki/Three_Texas_Steers","/wiki/Batman_and_Robin_(serial)","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.imdb.com/JointVentures","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0974811815","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1597775495","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit&section=3","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336339/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/69213501","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&oldid=555893529","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1900_births","/wiki/Category:1977_deaths","/wiki/Category:Actors_from_Ohio","/wiki/Category:American_film_actors","/wiki/Category:American_silent_film_actors","/wiki/Category:American_screenwriters","/wiki/Category:American_film_directors","/wiki/Category:Gay_actors","/wiki/Category:People_from_Cleveland,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:People_from_Santa_Barbara,_California","/wiki/Category:Film_directors_from_California","/wiki/Category:Film_directors_from_Ohio","/wiki/Category:20th-century_American_actors","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ralph+Graves&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ralph+Graves","/wiki/Ralph_Graves","/wiki/Talk:Ralph_Graves","#","/wiki/Ralph_Graves","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ralph_Graves","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ralph_Graves","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&oldid=555893529","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3418255","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ralph_Graves&id=555893529","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ralph+Graves","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ralph+Graves&oldid=555893529&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Graves&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Graves","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Graves","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3418255#sit
