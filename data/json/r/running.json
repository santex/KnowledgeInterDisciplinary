It is simply defined in athletics terms as a gait in\nwhich at regular points during the running cycle both feet are off the ground.\nThis is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the\nground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over\nthe stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.<ref name=\"Bie\">Biewener,\nA.

Records of\ncompetitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland in 1829 BCE,\nwhile the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE.\n","title":"running","headings":["History","Running kinematic description","Elements of good running technique","Running injuries","Benefits of running","Running events","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: IAAF","3: Marathon","2: Tailteann_Games","2: Ancient_Olympic_Games","2: Usain_Bolt","2: Mile_run","2: Half_marathon","2: Long-distance_track_event","2: Outline_of_running","1: Terrestrial_locomotion","1: Gait","1: Walking","1: Center_of_gravity","1: Jogging","1: Australopithecus","1: Nuchal_ligament","1: Sweat_glands","1: Achilles_tendon","1: Knee_joint","1: Glutei_maximi","1: East_African_Rift","1: Tailtiu","1: Ancient_Olympic_Games#Origins","1: Speed","1: Jogger's_nipple","1: Barefoot_running","1: Runner's_high","1: Ecopsychology#Practical_benefits","1: Neurogenesis","1: Endurance","1: Hurdles","1: Running_boom_of_the_1970s","1: One_hour_run","1: Comrades_Marathon","1: 24-hour_run","1: Individual_sport","1: Relay_race","1: Middle-distance_running","1: Hurdling","1: Track_running","1: Cross_country_running","1: Marathons","1: Poaceae","1: Mud","1: Racewalking","1: Stadion_race","1: BBC","1: 100_metres","1: 200_metres","1: 400_metres","1: Imperial_measurement","1: 100_yard_dash","1: Furlong","1: 440_yard_dash","1: Starting_blocks","1: Human_physiology","1: Lactic_acid","1: Oxygen","1: 60_metres","1: 50_metres","1: 55_metres","1: 300_metres","1: 500_metres","1: College_athletics","1: 150_metres","1: Pietro_Mennea","1: BBC_Sport","1: Donovan_Bailey","1: Bailey–Johnson_150-metre_race","1: 800_metres","1: 1500_metres","1: 3000_metres","1: 880_yard_run","1: Ultrarunning","1: Multiday_races","1: Level_and_incline_running"]}
