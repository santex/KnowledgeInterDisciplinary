Before\nbecoming a cardinal, he served as secretary of the conclave that elected Saint\nPius X, who is said to have accepted his election as Pope through Merry del\nVal's encouragement. Pius X later appointed him as the Cardinal Secretary of\nState. Merry del Val composed the Litany of Humility. A cause for his\ncanonization was opened in 1953.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Rafael_Merry_del_Val","recorded":1362685458,"links":30,"instances":["roman_catholicism","catholicism","vatican","catholic_church"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1865 births","1930 deaths","Spanish nobility","Spanish people of Basque descent","Spanish people of Dutch descent","Spanish people of Irish descent","Spanish people of Scottish descent","Spanish cardinals","Deaths from surgical complications","Diplomats of the Holy See","20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops","Venerated Catholics","Roman Catholic titular archbishops","20th-century venerated Christians","Cardinal Secretaries of State","Members of the Holy Office","Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy alumni","Pontifical Gregorian University alumni","Burials at St. Peter's Basilica","Servants of God"],"headings":["Early life","Education","Archbishop and cardinal","Austrian veto at papal conclave","Cardinal Secretary of State","Works (partial list)","Notes","External links and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Rafael_Merry_del_Val.jpg/220px-Rafael_Merry_del_Val.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/MarrydelValpacelli.jpg/250px-MarrydelValpacelli.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/CardinalCoA_PioM.svg/60px-CardinalCoA_PioM.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Rafael_Merry_del_Val_tomb.jpg/250px-Rafael_Merry_del_Val_tomb.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cardinal","catholicism"],["canon_law","catholic_church"],["secretariat_of_state","vatican"],["modernism","roman_catholicism"]],"members":["modernism","cardinal","secretariat_of_state","canon_law"],"related":["Secretary_of_the_Congregation_of_the_Holy_Office","Francesco_Marchetti_Selvaggiani","Raffaele_Monaco_La_Valletta","Mariano_Rampolla_del_Tindaro","London","England","Roman_Catholic","Servant_of_God","Spanish_people","Roman_Catholic_Church","Cardinal_(Catholicism)","Saint_Pius_X","Cardinal_Secretary_of_State","Litany_of_Humility","Canonization","Nicola_Canali","Serbia","Concordat","Pope_Pius_X","London","England","Basque_people","Spain","Alfonso_XII_of_Spain","Aragon","Zaragoza","Breton_people","County_Waterford","Ireland","Seville,_Spain","England","Bournemouth","Society_of_Jesus","Sacred_Heart_Church,_Bournemouth","Ushaw_College","County_Durham","Pontifical_Gregorian_University","Doctorate","Theology","Licentiate","Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)","Monsignor","Nunciature","Apostolic_succession","Roman_Curia","Apostolic_Delegate","Canada","Monsignor","Pontifical_Ecclesiastical_Academy","Titular_bishop","Mariano_Rampolla_del_Tindaro","Cardinal_Secretary_of_State","Pope_Leo_XIII","Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom","Eugenio_Pacelli","Papal_conclave,_1903","Pope_Pius_X","Congregation_for_Bishops","Secretariat_of_State_(Vatican)","Pope_Benedict_XV","Pietro_Gasparri","Congregation_for_Extraordinary_Ecclesiastical_Affairs","Conclave_of_1903","Jan_Puzyna_de_Kosielsko","Krakow","Emperor","Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria-Hungary","Ludwig_von_Pastor","Pope_Leo_XIII","Pope_Pius_X","Excommunication","Conclave","Cardinal-Priest","Galero","Modernism_(Roman_Catholicism)","Sodalitium_Pianum","Umberto_Benigni","Pope_Benedict_XV","Papal_conclave,_1914","Domenico_Ferrata","Pietro_Gasparri","Congregation_of_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith","Holy_Office","Non_possumus","Theodore_Herzl","Zionism","London","England"]}
