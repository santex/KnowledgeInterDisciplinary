In 1749, he founded Londonâs first successful\nliterary magazine, the [[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]] (1749â1845), [http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/thomaswa.htm\nPoet, painterâ¦ and poisoner?]\".

Kent, 10-11. In 1747 Griffiths erected the warning Sign of\nthe Dunciad outside of his own shop. Southey, Robert.

The bookseller's sign warning dunces that The Monthly would have\nno mercy in exposing dull and uninteresting authors. Kent, 11.\n\nThroughout his life Griffiths was an avid collector of books, pamphlets and\nessays. He was an early campaigner for improving the literary status of female\npoets and novelists, and in a 1798 review of Elizabeth Moody's Poetic\nTrifles Lonsdale, xxxviii. wrote, the Age of ingenious and\nlearned Ladies; who have excelled so much in the more elegant branches of\nliterature, that we need not to hesitate in concluding that the long agitated\ndispute between the two sexes is at length determined; and that it is no longer\na question, whether woman is or is not inferior to man in natural ability, or\nless capable of excelling in mental accomplishments.- New Series xxvii.\n441 Lonsdale, xxi.\n\nIn 1748, Griffiths published his most famous pamphlet, \"The Expediency and\nNecessity of Revising and Improving the Public Liturgy. Humbly Represented\". In\n1750, together with his brother Fenton, he published John Cleland's scandalous\n[[Fanny Hill]], or Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\", which he had bought for Â£20,\nbut which earned him a reputed Â£10,000.

Wolfe, \"Marbled paper: its history, techniques, and\npatterns : with special reference to the relationship of marbling to bookbinding\nin Europe and the Western world\", Publications of the A.S.W. Rosenbach\nfellowship in bibliography, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8122-8188-\n8, p.96\n\nMore grounded than her husband, Griffiths' wife largely looked after his\nfinancial affairs and was a regular contributor to The Monthly. Mrs Griffiths\nhas variously been described as \"his literary wife\", and \"an antiquated female\ncritic\". Sir Richard Phillips wrote of \"the portly Dr. Griffiths with his\nliterary wife in her neat and elevated wire-winged cap.\" However,\nGriffiths ran into financial difficulties, and c. 1761 he was forced to sell a\none-quarter share of The Monthly due to competition from the rival periodical\n[[The Critical Review]]. By 1780, he had again recovered sole ownership of the\npublication, though he had by then largely \"retired from his public situation as\na bookseller\". [[The European Magazine]], January 1804. vol. 45 , p.\n4. He died, in his eighties, at Linden House, Turnham Green, London.\n\nGriffiths' editorship of The Monthly brought him fame abroad, and on May 1,\n1764, Benjamin Franklin wrote, I will do everything in my power to\nrecommend the work Mr. Griffiths mentions, having the same sentiments of it that\nyou express. But I conceive many more of them come to America than he imagines.\nOur booksellers, perhaps, write for but few, but the reason is that a multitude\nof our people trade more or less to London; and all that are bookishly disposed\nreceive the reviews singly from their correspondents as they come out.
