Red dwarfs range in mass from a low of 0.075 solar\nmasses (the upper limit for a brown dwarf) to about 50% of the Sun and have a\nsurface temperature of less than 4,000 K.\n\nRed dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way galaxy, at\nleast in the neighborhood of the Sun, but due to their low luminosity,\nindividual red dwarfs cannot easily be observed. From Earth, not one is visible\nto the naked eye.
