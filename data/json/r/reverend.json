There are sometimes differences in the way the style is\nused in different countries and church traditions. The Reverend is correctly\ncalled a style but is often and in some dictionaries called a title, form of\naddress or title of respect.<ref name=\"ldoceonline\"></ref><ref></ref> The style\nis also sometimes used by leaders in non-Christian religions such as Judaism\nand Buddhism.\n\nThe term is an anglicisation of the Latin reverendus, the style originally used\nin Latin documents in medieval Europe. It is the gerundive of the verb revereri\n(to respect; to revere) which may be taken as a gerundive or a passive\nperiphrastic, therefore meaning [one who is] to be revered/must be respected.\nThe Reverend is therefore equivalent to The Hono(u)rable or The Venerable.\n\nIt is paired with a modifier or noun for some offices in some religious\ntraditions: e.g., Roman Catholic bishops are usually styled The Most Reverend\n(reverendissimus); Anglican bishops are styled The Right Reverend; some Reformed\nchurches have used The Reverend Mister as a style for their clergy.\n",
