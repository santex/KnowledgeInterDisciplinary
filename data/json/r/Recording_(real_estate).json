{"cursor":"12033","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe vast majority of states in the United States employ a system of 'recording'\nlegal instruments that affect the title of real estate as the exclusive means\nfor publicly documenting land titles and interests. This system differs\nsignificantly from land registration systems, such as the Torrens System that\nhave been adopted in a few states. The principal difference is that the\nrecording system does not determine who owns the title or interest involved.\nThat determination is ultimately made through litigation in the courts. What the\nsystem does do is to provide framework for determining whom the law will protect\nwith relation to those titles and interests when a dispute arises.\n","linknr":200,"url":"Recording_(real_estate)","recorded":1362580106,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Real property law"],"headings":["Creation","Title searching","How the system works","Limitations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States","Legal_instrument","Real_estate","Land_registration","Torrens_System","Statute","Deed","Mortgage_law","Lease","Easement","Court_order","Notary_public","Consideration_under_American_law","Grantor-grantee_index","Tract_indexes","Chain_of_title","Bona_fide_purchaser","Consideration_under_American_law","Unfair_preference","Constructive_notice","Statute","Legal_procedure","Real_property","Maryland","Delaware","North_Carolina","Louisiana","Bona_fide_purchaser","Land_registration","Shelter_rule"]}
