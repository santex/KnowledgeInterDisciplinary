It is a\nrepublic with an elected president serving as head of state. The head\nof governmentâcalled the Taoiseachâis nominated by the lower house of parliament\n(DÃ¡il Ãireann). The capital is Dublin in the east of the island. The state\nshares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom.\nIt is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the\nsouth, Saint George's Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east.\n\nThe modern Irish state gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1922\nfollowing a war of independence resulting in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, with\nNorthern Ireland exercising an option to remain in the United Kingdom. Initially\na dominion within the British Empire called the Irish Free State, a new\nconstitution and the name of \"Ireland\" were adopted in 1937. In 1949 the\nremaining duties of the British monarch were removed and Ireland was declared a\nrepublic, with the description Republic of Ireland. The state had no formal\nrelations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but since\n1999 they have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North-South\nMinisterial Council created under the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nWhilst Ireland today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in\nterms of GDP per capita, the country was once one of the poorest in\nWestern Europe. Economic protectionism was dismantled in the late 1950s and\nIreland joined the European Economic Community in 1973. Economic liberalism from\nthe late 1980s onwards resulted in rapid economic expansion, particularly from\n1995 to 2007, which became known as the Celtic Tiger period. An unprecedented\nfinancial crisis beginning in 2008 ended this era of rapid economic growth. \"EU: Causes of Growth differentials in Europe\", WAWFA think\ntank\n\nIn 2011, Ireland was ranked the seventh most developed nation in the world by\nthe United Nations' Human Development Index, Ireland is also highly\nranked for press, economic and political freedom. Ireland is a member of the\nEuropean Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD.\nIt pursues a policy of neutrality through non-alignment and consequently is not\na member of NATO, although it does participate in Partnership for Peace.\n","linknr":3265,"url":"Republic_of_Ireland","recorded":1362570597,"links":318,"instances":["irish_division","actor","practice","boxer","human","judge","ireland","ulster_division","metaphor","irish_republic","band","dublin","ireland","ireland","dublin","ireland","playwright","irish_division","politician","poet","great_britain_and_ireland","band","law_enforcement","city","band","international_relations","dublin","rugby_league","ireland","term","politician","irish_rail","ireland","grape","ireland","sport","ireland_act_1898","county_wexford","train","ireland","ireland","band","ireland","ireland","ireland","irish_leader","ireland","ireland","band"],"pdf":["http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_5/vol_5_2006_complete.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_5/vol_5_2006_complete.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Prelim%20complete.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Prelim%20complete.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1949/41/pdfs/ukpga_19490041_en.pdf","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1949/41/pdfs/ukpga_19490041_en.pdf","http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/ConsolidationINCA.pdf/Files/ConsolidationINCA.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb73/eb73_fact_ie_en.pdf","http://www.forfas.ie/media/ncc090108_acr_2008.pdf","http://www.forfas.ie/media/ncc090108_acr_2008.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011pdr/Census%202011%20Highlights%20Part%201%20web%2072dpi.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011pdr/Census%202011%20Highlights%20Part%201%20web%2072dpi.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile6/Profile%206%20Migration%20and%20Diversity%20entire%20doc.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile6/Profile%206%20Migration%20and%20Diversity%20entire%20doc.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf","http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011.07.28-JNLR-Results-July-2010-Jun2011.pdf","http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011.07.28-JNLR-Results-July-2010-Jun2011.pdf","http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf","http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf"],"categories":["1922
