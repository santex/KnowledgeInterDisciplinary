{"cursor":"11125","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Ribosomal ribonucleic acid' ('rRNA') is the RNA component of the ribosome, and\nis essential for protein synthesis in all living organisms. It comprises the\npredominant material within the ribosome, which is ca. 60% rRNA and 40% protein\nby weight. Ribosomes contain two major rRNAs and 50 or more proteins. The LSU\nand SSU rRNAs are found within the large and small ribosomal subunits,\nrespectively. The LSU rRNA acts as a ribozyme, catalyzing peptide bond\nformation. rRNA sequences are widely used for working out evolutionary\nrelationships among organisms, since they are of ancient origin and are found in\nall known forms of life.\n","linknr":522,"url":"Ribosomal_RNA","recorded":1362374327,"links":46,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein biosynthesis","RNA","Non-coding RNA","Ribosomal RNA|","Ribozymes"],"headings":["Inside the ribosome","Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes","Translation","Importance of rRNA","Genes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Ribosome_shape.png/220px-Ribosome_shape.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/RF00177.jpg/120px-RF00177.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["RNA","Ribosome","Protein_synthesis","Ribosomal_protein","Ribozyme","Peptidyl_transferase","Phylogenetics","Peptidyl_transferase","Prokaryotic","Eukaryotic","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Svedberg","50S","5S_ribosomal_RNA","23S_ribosomal_RNA","30S","16S_ribosomal_RNA","60S","5S_ribosomal_RNA","5.8S_ribosomal_RNA","28S_ribosomal_RNA","18S_ribosomal_RNA","Prokaryotes","16S_ribosomal_RNA","23S_ribosomal_RNA","16S_ribosomal_RNA","23S_ribosomal_RNA","Operon","Operon","Genome","Archaea","Operon","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Shine-Dalgarno_sequence","Eukaryotes","Tandem_repeat","Chromosomes","Ribosomal_DNA","18S_ribosomal_RNA","5S_ribosomal_RNA","5.8S_ribosomal_RNA","28S_ribosomal_RNA","12S_ribosomal_RNA","MT-RNR2","Internal_transcribed_spacer","RNA_polymerase_I","Tandemly_arrayed_genes","RNA_polymerase_III","Translation_(biology)","Start_codon","Medicine","Evolution","Antibiotics","Chloramphenicol","Erythromycin","Kasugamycin","Paromomycin","Ricin","Spectinomycin","Streptomycin","Thiostrepton","Taxonomic","RPL1","RPL2","RPL3","RPL4","RPL5","RPL6","RPL7","RPL8","RPL9","RPL10","RPL11","RPL12","RPL13","RPL14","RPL15","RPL16","RPL17","RPL18","RPL19","RPL20","RPL21","RPL22","RPL23","RPL24","RPL25","RPL26","RPL27","RPL28","RPL29","RPL30","RPL31","RPL32","RPL33","RPL34","RPL35","RPL36","RPL37","RPL38","RPL39","RPL40","RPL41","MRPL1","MRPL2","MRPL3","MRPL4","MRPL5","MRPL6","MRPL7","MRPL8","MRPL9","MRPL10","MRPL11","MRPL12","MRPL13","MRPL14","MRPL15","MRPL16","MRPL17","MRPL18","MRPL19","MRPL20","MRPL21","MRPL22","MRPL23","MRPL24","MRPL25","MRPL26","MRPL27","MRPL28","MRPL29","MRPL30","MRPL31","MRPL32","MRPL33","MRPL34","MRPL35","MRPL36","MRPL37","MRPL38","MRPL39","MRPL40","MRPL41","MRPL42","RPS1","RPS2","RPS3","RPS4","RPS5","RPS6","RPS7","RPS8","RPS9","RPS10","RPS11","RPS12","RPS13","RPS14","RPS15","RPS16","RPS17","RPS18","RPS19","RPS20","RPS21","RPS22","RPS23","RPS24","RPS25","RPS26","RPS27","RPS28","RPS29","MRPS1","MRPS2","MRPS3","MRPS4","MRPS5","MRPS6","MRPS7","MRPS8","MRPS9","MRPS10","MRPS11","MRPS12","MRPS13","MRPS14","MRPS15","MRPS16","MRPS17","MRPS18","MRPS19","MRPS20","MRPS21","MRPS22","MRPS23","MRPS24","MRPS25","MRPS26","MRPS27","MRPS28","MRPS29","MRPS30","MRPS31","MRPS32","MRPS33","MRPS34","MRPS35","Ribotyping"]}
