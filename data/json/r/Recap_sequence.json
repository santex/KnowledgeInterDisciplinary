{"cursor":"5956","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'A recap sequence' (or 'recap', often announced as \"Previously on...\") is a\nnarrative device used by many television series to bring the viewer up to date\nwith the current events of the stories' plot. It is usually a short (between 20\nto 40 seconds) montage of important scenes cut directly from previous episodes,\nusually short bursts of dialogue, which serve to lay the background for the\nfollowing episode.\n\nThese devices are predominantly seen on episodic series where every installment\nfurthers the plot, but otherwise are used for plot arcs, that is, when an\nepisode is going to pick up on a storyline initiated several episodes ago. A\nrecap will almost always be present in an episode that picks up from a\ncliffhanger. Recap sequences are most prevalent in dramatic television series\n(though daytime serials are usually excluded) and reality programs, whereas\nsituation comedies and other scripted genres typically use recap sequences only\nfor two-part or in rare cases, multi-part episodes.\n\nThese montages are inserted as the first thing into an episode so that viewers\nwho had not seen the previous episodes or who do not remember what happened can\nunderstand from where the current episode will begin, also so that the viewers\nmay decide to catch up on missed episodes, usually buying the DVDs. They usually\nbegin with a voiceover or subtitle proclaiming, \"Previously on... [the show's\nname]\" or \"Last time on... [the show's name]\". Many shows have begun to use a\nmain character's voice for this voiceover rather than a neutral narrator\n([[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]), and some series such as [[Boston Legal]] and\n[[Stargate Atlantis]] alternate which main character says \"Previously on... [the\nshow's name]\".\n\nOn the Fox show [[24 (TV Series)|24]], the main character, Jack Bauer's\nvoiceover \"Previously on 24...\" is followed by scenes from prior episodes of the\ncurrent season, not necessarily from the very last episode, that concern major\nplot points of the current episode. This was carried over into [[24: The Game]],\nwhere, once a player completes a mission, all cutscenes prior to that mission\ncan be viewed in the manner of the TV show. The playable scenes are not shown,\nas the player is given the opportunity to replay them to get a higher score.\n\nOn the NBC show [[ER (TV series)|ER]], main cast members rotate turns saying the\nphrase \"Previously on ER...\" which is then followed by scenes from previous\nepisodes which are pertinent to the current episode.\n\nIn some cases, the scene leading up to the previous episode's ending is shown\ninstead of a montage. This was common on British television shows from the 1950s\nto 1990s, although now most adopt a recap montage. An example of this is\n[[Doctor Who]], which during its original run (1963â1989) used the final scene\nof the previous episode to begin the next, whereas from the series relaunch\n(2005âpresent) the recaps are made up of a collection of short clips.\n\nRecaps are also used for several soap operas, most notably in Australia. The\nAustralian prison soap opera [[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]] (commonly known\nas Prisoner: Cell Block H) used the a recap sequence throughout its eight-season\nrun. In the early years it only showed the final scene of the previous episode\nbefore the opening credits. However, in later years it began to show several\nselect cuts form the previous episode during the recap sequence, often, a new\nscene would directly follow the recap before the opening credits. In the early\nyears of Australian soaps [[Home and Away]], [[Neighbours]] and [[Sons and\nDaughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]] a recap showed directly\nafter the opening credits, which may have been confusing for viewers who would\nhave started watching them, not realizing they were viewing a recap sequence and\nnot a new opening scene. The layout was changed in later years as recaps for\nHome and Away and Neighbours started before the credits, but currently they\nagain show after the credits in such a way not to confuse the viewer. British\nsoap operas, apart from [[Hollyoaks]], do not use a recap sequence, however,\nthey may be relevant.\n\nIn the English dubs of various episodic anime series that suffer editing for\ntime or censorship reasons, recaps are sometimes extended or introduced where\nthey didn't exist originally, to cover any shortfalls in running time. Some\nexamples where this occurs are ''Robotech'', the FUNimation English dub of\n[[Dragon Ball Z]], and the 4Kids English-language version of [[One Piece]]. The\noriginal Japanese version of One Piece did not always have recaps, though many\nepisodes did have recaps as the first scene following the opening credits.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether these recaps should be considered as part of\nthe episode whole. Some home video and DVD releases of shows that use recaps\ninclude them, some do not, and some seem to randomly use or omit them for\ndifferent episodes within the same collection. A few also place the segment as a\nfull chapter that can easily be skipped if the viewer is viewing the series in a\nmarathon form.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Recap_sequence","recorded":1374542699,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit","/wiki/Narrative","/wiki/Television_series","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Montage_sequence","/wiki/Episode","/wiki/Episode","/wiki/Plot_arc","/wiki/Cliffhanger","/wiki/Reality_show","/wiki/Situation_comedy","/wiki/Voiceover","/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)","/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)","/wiki/Boston_Legal","/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis","/wiki/24_(TV_Series)","/wiki/Jack_Bauer","/wiki/24:_The_Game","/wiki/Cutscenes","/wiki/ER_(TV_series)","/wiki/Doctor_Who","/wiki/Prisoner_(TV_series)","/wiki/Home_and_Away","/wiki/Neighbours","/wiki/Sons_and_Daughters_(Australian_TV_series)","/wiki/Hollyoaks","/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)","/wiki/Episode","/wiki/Anime","/wiki/Robotech_(TV_series)","/wiki/FUNimation","/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z","/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment","/wiki/One_Piece","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/24_(TV_series)","/wiki/Alys_(TV_series)","/wiki/Bad_Girls_(TV_series)","/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer","/wiki/Footballers_Wives","/wiki/Hollyoaks","/wiki/Home_and_Away","/wiki/McLeod%27s_Daughters","/wiki/Neighbours","/wiki/Prisoner:_Cell_Block_H","/wiki/Veronica_Mars","/wiki/Weeds_(TV_series)","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit&section=2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&oldid=551764225","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Television_terminology","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_November_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_November_2007","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_November_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Recap+sequence&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Recap+sequence","/wiki/Recap_sequence","/wiki/Talk:Recap_sequence","#","/wiki/Recap_sequence","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Recap_sequence","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Recap_sequence","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&oldid=551764225","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3934228","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Recap_sequence&id=551764225","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Recap+sequence","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Recap+sequence&oldid=551764225&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Recap_sequence&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riassunto_delle_puntate_precedenti","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3934228#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Common
