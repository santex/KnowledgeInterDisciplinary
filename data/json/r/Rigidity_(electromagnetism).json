{"cursor":"1586","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In accelerator physics, 'rigidity' is a concept used to determine the effect of\nparticular magnetic fields on the motion of the charged particles.\n\nIt is a measure of the momentum of the particle, and it refers to the fact that\na higher momentum particle will have a higher resistance to deflection by a\nmagnetic field. It is defined as R = BÏ = p/q, where B is the magnetic\nfield, Ï is the gyroradius of the particle due to this field, p is the particle\nmomentum, and q is its charge. It is frequently referred to as simply\n\"BÏ\". {{cite book\n  | last = Lee first = S.Y. authorlink = coauthors = title = Accelerator\n  | Physics, Second Edition publisher = World Scientific date = 2004 location =\n  | url = doi = id = isbn = 981-256-200-1 page = 576}}\n\n\nIt is important to note that the rigidity is defined by the action of a static,\ndipole, field, whose field lines are perpendicular to the velocity vector of the\nparticle. This will cause a force perpendicular both to the velocity vector, and\nto the field lines, defining a plane through which the particle moves. The\ndefinition of the Lorenz force implies that the particle's motion will be\ncircular, thus giving a constant radius of curvature.\n\nIf the particle momentum, p, is given in GeV/c, then the rigidity, in tesla-\nmetres, is BÏ = 3.3356p/q.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Rigidity_(electromagnetism)","recorded":1362892912,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Accelerator physics"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/Accelerator_physics_icon.svg/30px-Accelerator_physics_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Accelerator_physics","Gyroradius","Lorenz_force"]}
