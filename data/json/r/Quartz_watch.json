{"cursor":"17766","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'quartz clock' is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated\nby a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with\nvery precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude\nmore accurate than mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic\ncounts the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in\nunits of hours, minutes, and seconds. The first quartz clock was built in 1927\nby Warren Marrison and J.W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Since the\n1980s when the advent of solid state digital electronics allowed them to be made\ncompact and inexpensive, quartz timekeepers have become the world's most widely-\nused timekeeping technology, used in most clocks and watches, as well as\ncomputers and other appliances that keep time.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Quartz_watch","recorded":1362485929,"links":49,"instances":["reference_date","unit","united_kingdom","wristwatch","electronics","unit"],"pdf":["http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2276.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1485.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/timefreq/general/pdf/1485.pdf","http://www.ieee-uffc.org/main/history/step.pdf","http://global.epson.com/company/milestones/05_35sq.pdf"],"categories":["Clocks","Horology","Oscillators"],"headings":["Explanation","Mechanism","Accuracy","Chronometers","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Clock_lock.jpg/250px-Clock_lock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Armbanduhr_Rueckseite.jpg/220px-Armbanduhr_Rueckseite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Inside_QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg/220px-Inside_QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/2/1627685b23e080c7b9d3b8dfa1dc3415.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/MIH-film27jpg_whitebalance.jpg/220px-MIH-film27jpg_whitebalance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["solid_state","electronics"],["newton","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["epoch","reference_date"],["national_physical_laboratory","united_kingdom"],["astron","wristwatch"],["astron","wristwatch"]],"members":["epoch","newton","national_physical_laboratory","astron","solid_state","pascal"],"related":["Clock","Electronic_oscillator","Quartz","Crystal_oscillator","Frequency","Time","Bell_Telephone_Laboratories","Solid_state_(electronics)","Watch","Quartz","Silicon_dioxide","Piezoelectricity","Phonograph","Temperature","Fused_quartz","Walter_Guyton_Cady","NIST","Pendulum_clock","Oscillator","Amplifier","Electronic_filter","Shot_noise","Binary_numeral_system","Digital_electronics","Crystal_oven","Resonator","Tuning_fork","Laser","Hertz","High_frequency","Watch_battery","MOSFET","Integrated_circuit","Coin_cell","Stepper_motor","Liquid_crystal_display","Light-emitting_diode","Fundamental_frequency","Cantilever","Young's_modulus","Density","Quartz","Newton_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","Kilogram","Clock_drift","Epoch_(reference_date)","Analog_signal","Digital","Certified_chronometer","Longitude","Celestial_navigation","Radio_clock","Celestial_navigation","Chronometer_watch","Crystal_oven","Average","Jacques_Curie","Pierre_Curie","Crystal_oscillator","Walter_Guyton_Cady","D._W._Dye","National_Physical_Laboratory_(United_Kingdom)","UK","Bell_Telephone_Laboratories","Vacuum_tube","NIST","Atomic_clocks","Semiconductor","Digital_logic","Watch","Astron_(wristwatch)","Seiko","Seiko","Astron_(wristwatch)","Timer","Alarm_clock","Time_lock","Fuze","Balance_wheel","Quartz_crisis","Watch","Q_factor","Automatic_quartz","Solar-powered_watch","Electric_watch","Quartz_crisis","German_inventors_and_discoverers"]}
