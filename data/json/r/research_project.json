A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the\n field. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments,\n research may replicate elements of prior projects, or the project as a whole.\n The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are\n documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development of\n methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to\n research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and\n between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research:\n scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing,\n practitioner research, etc.\n",
