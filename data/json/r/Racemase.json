Racemases catalyze the\nstereochemical inversion around the asymmetric carbon atom in a substrate having\nonly one center of asymmetry. Epimerases catalyze the stereochemical inversion\nof the configuration about an asymmetric carbon atom in a substrate having more\nthan one center of asymmetry, thus interconverting epimers.\n\nHuman epimerases include methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, involved in the metabolic\nbreakdown of the amino acids isoleucine, methionine and valine, and UDP-glucose\n4-epimerase, which is used in the final step of galactose metabolism -\ncatalyzing the reversible conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Racemase","recorded":1362897799,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Isomerases"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Isomerase","Enzyme","Stereochemistry","Epimer","Methylmalonyl-CoA_epimerase","UDP-glucose_4-epimerase"]}
