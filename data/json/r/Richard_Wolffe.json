He reported on U.S. foreign policy,\ncovered the Microsoft antitrust trial, and regulatory and business issues at the\nUS Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.\n\nWolffe joined Newsweek in November 2002 as diplomatic correspondent, covering\nforeign policy and international affairs. In the 2004 presidential election, he\ncovered the Howard Dean campaign before switching to John Kerry. As Newsweekâs\nsenior White House correspondent, his cover stories included: \"What He Believes\"\n(on Obamaâs faith), \"Black & White\" (about Obama and racial politics), \"Bush In\nThe Bubble\" (after Hurricane Katrina), and \"Weight of the World\" (how Bush\nhandled the Lebanon War). Wolffe covered the entire length of Barack Obamaâs\n2008 presidential campaign for Newsweek magazine, traveling with the candidate\nand his inner circle from his announcement through Election Day 21 months later.\n\nHe has given political commentary on television news shows including: Meet The\nPress and TODAY on NBC; Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Hardball with Chris\nMatthews on MSNBC.

He came under fire from liberal bloggers shortly afterward due to his\nposition at Public Strategies. Olbermann apologized, claiming he was caught \"flat-\nfooted\" and announcing that Wolffe would not appear on Countdown until his\nactivities outside of MSNBC were reviewed. On October 1, 2009 Richard Wolffe\nappeared on Countdown discussing Sarah Palin. Olbermann wrote at Daily Kos that\n\"the broadcast network's very tough practices exec vetted this other job (and as\nindicated, the work he's done for us), found no interrelation.\" Wolffe left\nPublic Strategies two months later.\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Wolffe will serve as VP and executive\neditor of MSNBC.com, scheduled to launch in early 2013.[4]\n\nHe also lectures at many universities and institutes.
