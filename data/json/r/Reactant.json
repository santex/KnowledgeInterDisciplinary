{"cursor":"2264","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'reagent' () is a \"substance or compound that is added to a system in order to\nbring about a chemical reaction, or added to see if a reaction occurs.\" Although the terms reactant and reagent are often used\ninterchangeably, a 'reactant' is more specifically a \"substance that is consumed\nin the course of a chemical reaction\". Solvents, although they\nare involved in the reaction, are usually not referred to as reactants.\nSimilarly, catalysts are not consumed by the reaction, so are not described as\nreactants.\n\nIn organic chemistry, reagents are compounds or mixtures, usually composed of\ninorganic or small organic molecules, that are used to effect a transformation\non an organic substrate. Examples of organic reagents include the Collins\nreagent, Fenton's reagent, and Grignard reagent. There are also analytical\nreagents which are used to confirm the presence of another substance. Examples\nof these are Fehling's reagent, Millon's reagent and Tollens' reagent.\n\nIn another use of the term, when purchasing or preparing chemicals, 'reagent-\ngrade' describes chemical substances of sufficient purity for use in chemical\nanalysis, chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents\nare set by organizations such as ASTM International or the American Chemical\nSociety. For instance, reagent-quality water must have very low levels of\nimpurities like sodium and chloride ions, silica, and bacteria, as well as a\nvery high electrical resistivity.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Reactant","recorded":1362481569,"links":45,"instances":["gas","chemistry","molecule"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reagents for organic chemistry","Chemical reactions"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/SulfurReagent.jpg/200px-SulfurReagent.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["purity","gas"],["water","molecule"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["purity","product","water"],"related":["Solvent","Catalysis","Collins_reagent","Fenton's_reagent","Grignard_reagent","Fehling's_reagent","Millon's_reagent","Tollens'_reagent","Chemical_substance","Purity_(gas)","Chemical_analysis","Chemical_reaction","Standardization","ASTM_International","American_Chemical_Society","Water_(molecule)","Sodium","Chloride","Silica","Bacteria","Electrical_resistivity","Product_(chemistry)","Limiting_reagent","Common_reagents","Solvent","Catalysis"]}
