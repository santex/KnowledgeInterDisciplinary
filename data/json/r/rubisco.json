In chemical terms, it catalyzes the\ncarboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (also known as RuBP). It is probably\nthe most abundant protein on Earth. to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate during the\nCalvin cycle (see Figure 2.39). It is also thought to be the single most\nabundant protein on Earth, so it is noteworthy that one of its subunits is\nencoded by the chloroplast genome.}} (given that plants make up greater than\n99% of the biomass on Earth.)\n","linknr":665,"url":"rubisco","recorded":1362566422,"links":39,"instances":["biochemistry","fluid"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photosynthesis","EC 4.1.1"],"headings":["RuBisCO vs alternative carbon fixation pathways","Structure","Enzymatic activity","Regulation of its enzymatic activity","Genetic engineering","History of the term RuBisCO","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Rubisco.png/220px-Rubisco.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/PDB_3rub_EBI.jpg/200px-PDB_3rub_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Calvin-cycle4.svg/300px-Calvin-cycle4.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/RuBisCOL2S2.png/220px-RuBisCOL2S2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/RuBisCO.jpg/220px-RuBisCO.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["stroma","fluid"]],"members":["substrate","stroma"],"related":["Enzyme","Carbon_fixation","Carbon_dioxide","Fuel","Molecule","Glucose","Carboxylation","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate","Protein","Biology","Chemical_reaction","Inorganic","Carbon","Biosphere","Reductive_acetyl_CoA_Pathway","3-hydroxypropionate_cycle","Reverse_Krebs_cycle","PEPC","Leaf","C3_carbon_fixation","C4_carbon_fixation","Genetic_engineering","Algae","Cyanobacteria","Phototrophic","Chemotroph","Proteobacteria","Atomic_mass_unit","Chloroplast","Cell_nucleus","Stromal","Cytosol","Chloroplast_membrane","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Ribulose","Active_site","Polymer","Protein_dimer","Amino_acid","Proteobacteria","Dinoflagellate","X-ray_crystallography","Eukaryotic","Bacterial","Protein_Data_Bank","Magnesium","Ion","Active_site","Carbon_dioxide","Lysine","Carbamate","Alkalinity","PH","Concentration","Chloroplast","Calvin_cycle","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Glucose","Photorespiration","Mitochondria","Peroxisomes","Glycine","C4_carbon_fixation","Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","Pyrenoid","PH","Stroma_(fluid)","Thylakoid","Light-dependent_reaction","RuBisCO_activase","CA1P-phosphatase","Chemical_conformation","Protease","Photorespiration","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Redox","Thioredoxin","Phosphate","Enzyme_inhibitor","C4_carbon_fixation","C4_carbon_fixation","Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","Photosynthetic_efficiency","Biosequestration","Climate_change","Plastome","Photorespiration","Carbon_dioxide_in_the_Earth's_atmosphere","David_Eisenberg","Sam_Wildman","Carbon_cycle","Photorespiration","Pyrenoid","C4_carbon_fixation","Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","Carboxysome"]}
