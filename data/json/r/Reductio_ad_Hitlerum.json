{"cursor":"10005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Reductio ad Hitlerum', also 'argumentum ad Hitlerum', (Latin for \"reduction to\"\nand \"argument to\" and dog Latin for \"Hitler\" respectively) is a term coined by\nconservative philosopher Leo Strauss in 1951. According\nto Strauss, the Reductio ad Hitlerum is an informal fallacy that consists of\ntrying to refute an opponent's view by comparing it to a view that would be held\nby Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party.\n\nAccording to Strauss, Reductio ad Hitlerum is a form of [[ad hominem]] or\n[[argumentum ad misericordiam|ad misericordiam]], a fallacy of irrelevance, in\nwhich a conclusion is suggested based solely on something's or someone's origin\nrather than its current meaning. The suggested rationale is one of guilt by\nassociation. Its name is a variation on the term reductio ad absurdum.\n\nReductio ad Hitlerum is sometimes called playing the Nazi card, According to its critics and proponents, it is a\ntactic often used to derail arguments, because such comparisons tend to distract\nand anger the opponent.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Reductio_ad_Hitlerum","recorded":1362503737,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adolf Hitler","Genetic fallacies","Dog Latin words and phrases","Comparisons to Nazism and the Holocaust"],"headings":["Fallacious nature of the argument","History of the term","Invocations of the fallacy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Latin","Dog_Latin","Adolf_Hitler","Leo_Strauss","Informal_fallacy","Nazi_Party","Ignoratio_elenchi","Association_fallacy","Reductio_ad_absurdum","Association_fallacy","Adolf_Hitler","Third_Reich","Classical_music","Animal_welfare_in_Nazi_Germany","Fascism","Atheism","Godwin's_Law","University_of_Chicago","Leo_Strauss","Logical_argument","Thomas_Fleming","Michael_Bernstein","Lubavitch","Crown_Heights_Riot","Kristallnacht","Henry_Schwarzschild","Glenn_Beck","2011_Norway_attacks","Hitler_Youth","National_Endowment_for_the_Arts","Joseph_Goebbels","Association_of_Community_Organizations_for_Reform_Now","Sturmabteilung","Godwin's_law","Hannibal_ad_portas","Hannibal","List_of_fallacies"]}
