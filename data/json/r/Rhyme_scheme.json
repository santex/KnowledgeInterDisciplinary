{"cursor":"7179","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'rhyme scheme' is the pattern of rhyme between lines of a poem or song. It is\nusually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines\ndesignated with the same letter all rhyme with each other. In other words, it is\nthe pattern of end rhymes or lines.\n\n\n\n:Bid me to weep, and I will weep :While I have eyes to see ; :And\nhaving none, and yet I will keep :A heart to weep for thee .\n\n A B A B \n\n\nThus its own associations and resonances to cause a particular effect on the\nreader. A basic distinction is between rhyme schemes that apply to a single\nstanza, and those that continue their pattern throughout an entire poem (see\nchain rhyme). There are also more elaborate related forms, like the sestina -\nwhich requires repetition of exact words in a complex pattern.\n\nIn English, highly repetitive rhyme schemes are unusual. English has more vowel\nsounds than Italian, for example, meaning that such a scheme would be far more\nrestrictive for an English writer than an Italian one - there are fewer suitable\nwords to match a given pattern. Even such schemes as the terza rima (\"aba bcb\ncdc ded...\"), used by Dante Alighieri in [[The Divine Comedy]], have been\nconsidered too difficult for English.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Rhyme_scheme","recorded":1362540518,"links":14,"instances":["poetry","alphabet","music","process","poem","forme_fixe"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhyme","Stanzaic form"],"headings":["Example rhyme schemes","Rhyme schemes in hip-hop music","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["letter","alphabet"],["reading","process"],["repetition","music"],["ballade","forme_fixe"],["fire_and_ice","poem"],["limerick","poetry"]],"members":["limerick","letter","repetition","reading","fire_and_ice","ballade"],"related":["Poem","Song","Letter_(alphabet)","Rhyme","Reading_(process)","Stanza","Chain_rhyme","Sestina","English_language","Repetition_(music)","Italian_language","Terza_rima","Dante_Alighieri","Alternate_rhyme","Ballade_(forme_fixe)","Chant_royal","Cinquain","Clerihew","Couplet","Enclosed_rhyme","Fire_and_Ice_(poem)","Keats","Ode_on_Indolence","Ode_on_a_Grecian_Urn","Ode_to_a_Nightingale","Limerick_(poetry)","Monorhyme","Ottava_rima","Edgar_Allan_Poe","Rhyme_royal","Rondelet","Ruba'i","Scottish_stanza","Robert_Burns","To_a_Mouse","Simple_4-line","Sonnet","Petrarchan_sonnet","Shakespeare's_sonnet","Spenserian_sonnet","Onegin_stanza","Feminine_rhyme","Masculine_rhyme","Iambic_tetrameter","Sestina","Spenserian_stanza","Tanaga","Tagalog_people","Terza_rima","Tercet","Villanelle","Hip-hop_music","Rapping","Couplet","Hip-hop_music","Couplet","Couplet","Old_school_rap","End_rhymes","Internal_rhyme","Perl"]}
