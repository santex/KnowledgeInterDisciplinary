{"cursor":"34431","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Reverse engineering' is the process of discovering the technological principles\nof a device, object, or system through analysis of its structure, function, and\noperation. It often involves taking something (a mechanical device,\nelectronic component, computer program, or biological, chemical, or organic\nmatter) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or\nto try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or\nsimply duplicating (without understanding) the original.\n\nReverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial\nor military advantage. The purpose is to deduce design decisions from\nend products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures\ninvolved in the original production. The same techniques are subsequently being\nresearched for application to legacy software systems, not for industrial or\ndefence ends, but rather to replace incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise\nunavailable documentation.
