{"cursor":"12878","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n often symbolizes parliamentary procedure.]] 'Parliamentary procedure' is the\n body of rules, ethics, and customs governing meetings and other operations of\n clubs, organizations, legislative bodies, and other deliberative assemblies.\n It is part of the common law originating primarily in the practices of the\n House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, from which it\n derives its name.\n\nIn the United States, parliamentary procedure is also referred to as\n'parliamentary law', 'parliamentary practice', 'legislative procedure', or\n'rules of order'. In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,\nand other English-speaking countries it is often called 'chairmanship',\n'chairing', the 'law of meetings', 'procedure at meetings', or the 'conduct of\nmeetings'.\n\nAt its heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its\nobject is to allow deliberation upon questions of interest to the organization\nand to arrive at the sense or the will of the assembly upon these\nquestions. Henry M. Robert, Parliamentary Law, 1923, p. 3 Self-\ngoverning organizations follow parliamentary procedure to debate and reach group\ndecisionsâusually by voteâwith the least possible friction.\n\nRules of order consist of rules written by the body itself (often referred to as\nbylaws), but also usually supplemented by a published parliamentary authority\nadopted by the body. Typically, national, state, and other full-scale\nlegislative assemblies have extensive internally written rules of order, whereas\nnon-legislative bodies write and adopt a limited set of specific rules as the\nneed arises.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Rules_of_order","recorded":1362566151,"links":24,"instances":["united_states","sociology","author","parliamentary_procedure","consultant","united_states","national"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parliamentary procedure|"],"headings":["History","Parliamentary authority usage patterns","Parliamentarians","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/CourtGavel.JPG/220px-CourtGavel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Gavel.png/32px-Gavel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","sociology"],["state","national"],["motion","parliamentary_procedure"],["state_legislature","united_states"],["paul_mason","author"],["state_constitution","united_states"],["parliamentarian","consultant"]],"members":["state_legislature","norm","paul_mason","motion","parliamentarian","state_constitution","state"],"related":["Procedural_law","Ethics","Norm_(sociology)","Club","Organization","Legislature","Deliberative_assembly","Common_law","House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","United_States","United_Kingdom","Australia","New_Zealand","South_Africa","Deliberation","Self-governance","Debate","Voting","Parliamentary_authority","State_(national)","Legislature","Parliamentary_system","United_Kingdom","Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Bourinot's_Rules_of_Order_","United_States_Congress","Indonesia","Philippines","Mexico","South_Korea","Diet_of_Japan","Occupied_Japan","Majority_rule","Delegate","Voting","Special_rules_of_order","Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)","Main_motion","Subsidiary_motion","Incidental_motion","Charter","Constitution","Bylaws","United_Kingdom","Thomas_Erskine_May","Westminster_Parliament","State_legislature_(United_States)","United_States","U.S._state","Nebraska","Unicameralism","National_Conference_of_State_Legislatures","United_States_Senate","Standing_Rules_of_the_United_States_Senate","United_States_House_of_Representatives","California_Senate","Paul_Mason_(author)","National_Conference_of_State_Legislatures","State_constitution_(United_States)","State_law","Parliamentarian_(consultant)","Member_of_Parliament","National_Association_of_Parliamentarians","American_Institute_of_Parliamentarians","National_FFA_Organization","Bylaws","History_of_parliamentary_procedure","Principles_of_parliamentary_procedure","Special_rules_of_order","Parliamentary_procedure_in_the_corporate_world"]}
