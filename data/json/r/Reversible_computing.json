A necessary condition for\nreversibility of a computational model is that the relation of the mapping\nstates of transition functions to their successors should at all times be one-to-\none. Reversible computing is generally considered an unconventional form of\ncomputing.\n\nThere are two major, closely related, types of reversibility that are of\nparticular interest for this purpose: physical reversibility and logical\nreversibility. http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/revcomp/\n\nA process is said to be physically reversible if it results in no increase in\nphysical entropy; it is [[isentropic]]. These circuits are also referred to as\n'charge recovery logic' or '[[adiabatic]] computing'. Although in practice no\nnonstationary physical process can be exactly physically reversible or\nisentropic, there is no known limit to the closeness with which we can approach\nperfect reversibility, in systems that are sufficiently well-isolated from\ninteractions with unknown external environments, when the laws of physics\ndescribing the system's evolution are precisely known.\n\nProbably the largest motivation for the study of technologies aimed at actually\nimplementing reversible computing is that they offer what is predicted to be the\nonly potential way to improve the energy efficiency of computers beyond the\nfundamental von Neumann-Landauer limit J. von Neumann, Theory\nof Self-Reproducing Automata, Univ. of Illinois Press, 1966. of kT ln(2)\nenergy dissipated per irreversible bit operation.\n\nAs was first argued by Rolf Landauer of IBM, R. Landauer, \"Irreversibility\nand heat generation in the computing process,\" IBM Journal of Research and\nDevelopment, vol. 5, pp. 183-191, 1961. in order for a computational\nprocess to be physically reversible, it must also be logically reversible.\nLandauer's principle is the loosely formulated notion that the erasure of n bits\nof information must always incur a cost of nk ln(2) in thermodynamic entropy. A\ndiscrete, deterministic computational process is said to be logically reversible\nif the transition function that maps old computational states to new ones is a\none-to-one function; i.e. the output logical states uniquely defines the input\nlogical states of the computational operation.\n\nFor computational processes that are nondeterministic (in the sense of being\nprobabilistic or random), the relation between old and new states is not a single-\nvalued function, and the requirement needed to obtain physical reversibility\nbecomes a slightly weaker condition, namely that the size of a given ensemble of\npossible initial computational states does not decrease, on average, as the\ncomputation proceeds forwards.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Reversible_computing","recorded":1362537840,"links":19,"instances":["logic_gate","computer_scientist"],"pdf":["http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agra/doc/konf/11_ismvl_reversible_circuit_design_tutorial.pdf","http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agra/doc/konf/2012_vdat_reversible_circuits_accompl_chall.pdf"],"categories":["Digital electronics","Models of computation"],"headings":["The reversibility of physics and reversible computing","Reversible circuits","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/8/ee8fb88ec8aee8037195692b9b6b435e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/3/633bff1fa0b2fabb9e12f0f4285e42cb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/b/7bb73b8dfed8cbca2ddf255a5151f87e.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charles_h._bennett","computer_scientist"],["inverter","logic_gate"]],"members":["inverter"],"related":["Computing","Computational_process","DTIME","Invertible_function","Computational_model","Transition_function","Injective_function","Unconventional_computing","Entropy","Energy_conversion_efficiency","Von_Neumann-Landauer_limit","Bit_operation","Rolf_Landauer","IBM","Landauer's_principle","Entropy","Transition_function","One-to-one_function","Single-valued_function","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Logical_consequence","Physics","Hamiltonian_mechanics","Time_evolution","Quantum_mechanics","Arrow_of_time","Computing","Charles_H._Bennett_(computer_scientist)","Logic_gate","Electronic_circuit","Processor_architecture","Programming_language","Algorithm","Physicist","Electrical_engineer","Computer_scientist","Clocking","Synchronization","Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics","Inverter_(logic_gate)","Exclusive_or","Controlled_NOT_gate","Toffoli_gate","Boolean_function","Bit_manipulation","Quantum_algorithm","Signal_gain","Reversible_dynamics","Maximum_entropy_thermodynamics","Reversible_process","Toffoli_gate","Fredkin_gate","Quantum_computing","Billiard-ball_computer","Three-input_universal_logic_gate","Undo","Reversible_cellular_automaton"]}
