The result is that\nthe solute is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure\nsolvent is allowed to pass to the other side. To be \"selective,\" this membrane\nshould not allow large molecules or ions through the (holes), but should allow\nsmaller components of the solution (such as the solvent) to pass freely.\n\nIn the normal osmosis process, the solvent naturally moves from an area of low\nsolute concentration (High Water Potential), through a membrane, to an area of\nhigh solute concentration (Low Water Potential). The movement of a pure solvent\nto equalize solute concentrations on each side of a membrane generates osmotic\npressure. Applying an external pressure to reverse the natural flow of pure\nsolvent, thus, is reverse osmosis. The process is similar to other membrane\ntechnology applications. However, there are key differences between reverse\nosmosis and filtration. The predominant removal mechanism in membrane filtration\nis straining, or size exclusion, so the process can theoretically achieve\nperfect exclusion of particles regardless of operational parameters such as\ninfluent pressure and concentration. Reverse osmosis, however, involves a\ndiffusive mechanism so that separation efficiency is dependent on solute\nconcentration, pressure, and water flux rate.
