{"cursor":"4591","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular biology, a 'reading frame' is a way of dividing the sequence of\nnucleotides in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecule into a set of consecutive,\nnon-overlapping triplets. Where these triplets equate to amino acids or stop\nsignals during translation, they are called codons.\n\nA single strand of a nucleic acid molecule has a phosphoryl end, (called the 5â²-\nend) and a hydroxyl, or (3â²-end). These then define the 5'â3' direction. There\nare three reading frames that can be read in this 5'â3' direction, each\nbeginning from a different nucleotide in a triplet. In a double stranded nucleic\nacid, an additional three reading frames may be read from the other,\ncomplementary strand in the 5'â3' direction along this strand. As the two\nstrands of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule are antiparallel, the 5'â3'\ndirection on the second strand corresponds to the 3'â5' direction along the\nfirst strand.\n\nIn general, at most one reading frame in a given section of a nucleic acid is\nbiologically relevant.\n","linknr":294,"url":"Reading_frames","recorded":1362483966,"links":19,"instances":["molecular_biology","molecular_biology","biochemistry","genetics","molecular_biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.iiisci.org/Journal/CV$/sci/pdfs/P842315.pdf","http://www.iiisci.org/Journal/CV$/sci/pdfs/P842315.pdf"],"categories":["Protein biosynthesis","Genetics","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Transcription","Translation","Multiple reading frames","Open reading frame","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["transcription","biology"],["promoter","genetics"],["antiparallel","biochemistry"],["translation","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"]],"members":["complementarity","directionality","antiparallel","promoter","sense","translation","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Nucleic_acid","DNA","RNA","Amino_acid","Translation_(biology)","Codon","Nucleic_acid","Phosphoryl","5′-end","Hydroxyl","3′-end","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Transcription_(biology)","Promoter_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Primary_transcript","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Ribosome","Polypeptide","Overlapping_gene","Genome","Hepatitis_B_virus","BYDV","Translational_frameshift","Frameshift_mutation","Open_reading_frame","Start_codon","Stop_codon","Genetic_code","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Sense_(molecular_biology)"]}
