They are the lasing medium in free electron lasers (FELs)\nto be used in atmospheric research conducted at such entities as the Pan-oceanic\nEnvironmental and Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) at the University of\nHawaii and NASA.\n\nIt has been suggested that REBs could be used to heat and accelerate the\nreaction mass in electrical rocket engines that Dr. Robert W. Bussard called\nQuiet Electric Discharge Engines (QEDs). {{cite paper |author = Ligon, Tom\n|title = The World's Simplest Fusion Reactor, And How to Make It Work |year =\n1998 |date = 2007-01-05 |pages = 16â17 |url = http://fusor.net/newbie/files/Ligon-QED-\nIE.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-12-17 }}\n","linknr":106,"url":"Relativistic_electron_beam","recorded":1362477991,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://fusor.net/newbie/files/Ligon-QED-IE.pdf","http://fusor.net/newbie/files/Ligon-QED-IE.pdf"],"categories":["Electron beam","Quantum mechanics","Special relativity"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Energia_template.svg/40px-Energia_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Hydrogen300.png/30px-Hydrogen300.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electrons","Relativistic_particle","Free_electron_laser","University_of_Hawaii","NASA","Working_mass","Robert_W._Bussard","PDF"]}
