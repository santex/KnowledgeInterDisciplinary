{"cursor":"2769","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'reverse osmosis plant' is a manufacturing plant where the process of reverse\nosmosis takes place. An average modern reverse osmosis plant needs six kilowatt-\nhours of electricity to desalinate one cubic metre of water.[http://www.global-greenhouse-\nwarming.com/desalination.html] The process also results in an amount of salty\nbriny waste. The challenge for these plants is to find ways to reduce energy\nconsumption, use sustainable energy sources, improve the process of desalination\nand to innovate in the area of waste management to deal with the waste. Self-\ncontained water treatment plants using reverse osmosis, called reverse osmosis\nwater purification units, are normally used in a military context.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Reverse_osmosis_plant","recorded":1362372254,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Water treatment","Membrane technology"],"headings":["Examples of reverse osmosis plants","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/A_1000_liter_reverse_osmosis_plant_for_commercial_use.jpg/220px-A_1000_liter_reverse_osmosis_plant_for_commercial_use.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Icon_river_tributary_R.svg/30px-Icon_river_tributary_R.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Factory","Reverse_osmosis","Waste_management","Reverse_osmosis_water_purification_unit","Israel","Ashkelon","Mediterranean","China","Tianjin","Spain","Pakistan","Nawabshah","Asif_Ali_Zardari","Osmosis","Reverse_osmosis"]}
