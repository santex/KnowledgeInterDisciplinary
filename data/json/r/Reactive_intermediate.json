When generated in a chemical reaction it will quickly convert\ninto a more stable molecule. Only in exceptional cases can these compounds be\nisolated and stored, e.g. low temperatures, matrix isolation. When their\nexistence is indicated, 'reactive intermediates' can help explain how a chemical\nreaction takes place.

Moss,Matthew Platz,Maitland Jones\n\nMost chemical reactions take more than one elementary step to complete, and a\nreactive intermediate is a high energy, yet stable, product that only exists in\none of the intermediate steps. The series of steps together make a reaction\nmechanism. A 'reactive intermediate' differs from a reactant or product or a\nsimple reaction intermediate only in that it cannot usually be isolated, but is\nsometimes observable only through fast spectroscopic methods. It is 'stable' in\nthe sense that an elementary reaction forms the 'reactive intermediate' and the\nelementary reaction in the next step is needed to destroy it.\n\nWhen a reactive intermediate is not an observable, its existence must be\ninferred through experimentation. This usually involves changing reaction\nconditions such as temperature or concentration and applying the techniques of\nchemical kinetics, chemical thermodynamics, or spectroscopy. Reactive\nintermediates based on carbon are radicals, carbenes, carbocations, carbanions,\narynes and carbynes.\n\n File:Radical metilo--\nmethyl radical.png|Radical File:Carbene.png| Carbene File:Methyl\ncation.svg|Carbocation File:ç¢³è´ç¦»å­.png|Carbanion File:Carbyne quartet.png|Carbyne\nFile:1,2-Didehydrobenzol.svg|Aryne \n\nCommon features Reactive intermediates have several features in common:\n\n* low concentration with respect to reaction substrate and final\n  reaction product\n* with the exception of carbanions, these intermediates do not obey the lewis\n  octet rule hence the high reactivity\n* often generated on chemical decomposition of a chemical compound\n* it is often possible to prove the existence of this species by\n  spectroscopic means\n* cage effects have to be taken into account\n* often stabilisation by conjugation or resonance\n* often difficult to distinguish from a transition state\n* prove existence by means of chemical trapping\n","linknr":132,"url":"Reactive_intermediate","recorded":1362559114,"links":17,"instances":["science","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reactive intermediates"],"headings":["Other reactive intermediates","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Radical_metilo--methyl_radical.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Carbene.png/57px-Carbene.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Methyl_cation.svg/120px-Methyl_cation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/%E7%A2%B3%E8%B4%9F%E7%A6%BB%E5%AD%90.png/120px-%E7%A2%B3%E8%B4%9F%E7%A6%BB%E5%AD%90.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Carbyne_quartet.png/120px-Carbyne_quartet.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/1%2C2-Didehydrobenzol.svg/113px-1%2C2-Didehydrobenzol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mechanism","science"],["radical","chemistry"],["cage_effect","chemistry"]],"members":["mechanism","cage_effect","radical"],"related":["Chemistry","Molecule","Chemical_reaction","Matrix_isolation","Chemical_reaction","Elementary_step","Mechanism_(science)","Reaction_intermediate","Spectroscopic","Elementary_reaction","Elementary_reaction","Inferred","Chemical_kinetics","Chemical_thermodynamics","Spectroscopy","Radical_(chemistry)","Carbene","Carbocation","Carbanion","Aryne","Carbyne","Concentration","Octet_rule","Chemical_decomposition","Chemical_compound","Spectroscopy","Cage_effect_(chemistry)","Conjugated_system","Resonance_structure","Transition_state","Chemical_trap","Nitrene","Phosphinidenes","Carbenoid","Tetrahedral_intermediate","Carbonyl","Oxocarbenium","Phosphoryl_nitride"]}
