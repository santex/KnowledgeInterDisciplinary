It is a major cellular protein, comprising ~0.1% of all\ncellular protein by weight, and appears to play an important role in regulating\nthe lifetime of RNA.\n\nRI has a surprisingly high cysteine content (~6.5%, cf. 1.7% in typical\nproteins) and is sensitive to oxidation. RI is also rich in leucine (21.5%,\ncompared to 9% in typical proteins) and commensurately lower in other\nhydrophobic residues, esp. valine, isoleucine, methionine, tyrosine, and\nphenylalanine.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Ribonuclease_inhibitor","recorded":1362371358,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein domains","Hydrolase inhibitors","LRR proteins"],"headings":["Structure","Binding to ribonucleases","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/2bnh_topview.png/220px-2bnh_topview.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/2bnh_sideview.png/400px-2bnh_sideview.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Leucine-rich_repeat","Protein","Ribonuclease","RNA","Cysteine","Leucine","Valine","Isoleucine","Methionine","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","C-terminus","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Secondary_structure","Horseshoe","Asparagine","Exon","Protein-protein_interaction","Dissociation_constant","Ribonuclease_A","Ranpirnase","Onconase"]}
