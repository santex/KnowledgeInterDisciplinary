He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 (with\nHar Gobind Khorana and Marshall Warren Nirenberg) for describing the structure\nof alanine transfer RNA, linking DNA and protein synthesis.\n\nHolley was born in Urbana, Illinois, and graduated from Urbana High School in\n1938. He went on to study chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign, graduating in 1942 and commencing his PhD studies in organic\nchemistry at Cornell University. During World War II Holley spent two years\nworking under Professor Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell University Medical\nCollege, where he was involved in the first chemical synthesis of penicillin.\nHolley completed his PhD studies in 1947.*USDA\nARS.\n\nFollowing his graduate studies Holley remained associated with Cornell. He\nbecame an Assistant Professor of organic chemistry in 1948, and was appointed as\nProfessor of Biochemistry in 1962. He began his research on RNA after spending a\nyear's sabbatical (1955â1956) studying with James F. Bonner at the California\nInstitute of Technology.\n\nHolley's research on RNA focused first on isolating transfer RNA (tRNA), and\nlater on determining the sequence and structure of alanine tRNA, the molecule\nthat incorporates the amino acid alanine into proteins. Holley's team of\nresearchers determined the tRNA's structure by using two ribonucleases to split\nthe tRNA molecule into pieces. Each enzyme split the molecule at location\npoints for specific nucleotides. By a process of \"puzzling out\" the structure\nof the pieces split by the two different enzymes, then comparing the pieces\nfrom both enzyme splits, the team eventually determined the entire structure of\nthe molecule.\n\nThe structure was completed in 1964, and was a key\ndiscovery in explaining the synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA. It was\nalso the first nucleotide sequence of a ribonucleic acid ever determined. Holley\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1968 for this\ndiscovery, and Har Gobind Khorana and Marshall W. Nirenberg were also\nawarded the prize that year for contributions to the understanding of protein\nsynthesis.\n\nUsing the Holley team's method, other scientists determined the structures of\nthe remaining tRNA's. A few years later the method was modified to help track\nthe sequence of nucleotides in various bacterial, plant, and human viruses.\n\nIn 1968 Holley became a resident fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological\nStudies in La Jolla, California.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Robert_W._Holley","recorded":1362483947,"links":47,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/content/240/5/2122.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/240/5/2122.full.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1968/holley-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1968/holley-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["1922 births","1993 deaths","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","American Nobel laureates","American biochemists","Guggenheim Fellows","Cornell University alumni","People from Urbana, Illinois","University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign alumni","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Robert_W._Holley_nobel.jpg/220px-Robert_W._Holley_nobel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/R_Holley.jpg/220px-R_Holley.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Biochemist","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Har_Gobind_Khorana","Marshall_Warren_Nirenberg","TRNA","DNA","Protein_synthesis","Urbana,_Illinois","Chemistry","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","PhD","Organic_chemistry","Cornell_University","World_War_II","Vincent_du_Vigneaud","Penicillin","RNA","James_F._Bonner","California_Institute_of_Technology","RNA","Transfer_RNA","TRNA","Amino_acid","Alanine","Protein","Ribonuclease","Translation_(genetics)","MRNA","Ribonucleic_acid","Har_Gobind_Khorana","Marshall_W._Nirenberg","Virus","Salk_Institute","La_Jolla,_California","History_of_RNA_biology","List_of_RNA_biologists"]}
