It was exploded on 29\nAugust 1949, at Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR, after a top-secret R&D project. The weapon was designed at the Kurchatov Instituteâat the\ntime officially known as \"Laboratory â 2,\" but designated as the \"office\" or\n\"base\" in internal documentsâstarting in April 1946. A uranium-235 plant was\nbuilt near Chelyabinsk in 1948.\n\nThe RDS-1 explosion yielded 22 kilotons of TNT, similar to the American [[The\ngadget|Gadget]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs. At Lavrenty Beria's insistence, the RDS-\n1 bomb was designed as an implosion weapon similar to the Fat Man bomb dropped\non Nagasaki, Japan; RDS-1 also had a solid plutonium core. The bomb designers\nhad developed a more sophisticated design (tested later as RDS-2), but rejected\nit due to the known reliability of the Fat Man type design; the USSR having\nreceived extensive intelligence on the design of the \"Fat Man\" bomb during\nWorld War II.\n\nIn order to test the effects of the new weapon, workers constructed houses made\nof wood and bricks, along with a bridge, and a simulated metro in the vicinity\nof the test site. Armoured hardware and approximately 50 aircraft were also\nbrought to the testing grounds, as well as over 1,500 animals to test the bomb's\neffects on life. The resulting data showed the RDS\nexplosion to be 50% more destructive than originally estimated by its\nengineers.\n\nThere are several explanations for the USSR code-name of RDS-1, usually an\narbitrary designation: a backronym \"Special Jet Engine\" (, Reaktivnyi Dvigatel\nSpetsialnyi), or \"Stalin's Jet Engine\" (, Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Stalina), or\n\"Russia does it herself\" (, Rossiya Delayet Sama). Later\nweapons were also designated RDS, but with different model numbers.\n\nMikhail Pervukhin served as the chairman of the commission in charge of the RDS-\n1 testing.\n","linknr":183,"url":"RDS-1","recorded":1362576003,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cold War military history of the Soviet Union","Soviet nuclear explosive tests","Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union","1949 in the Soviet Union","Nuclear weapons policy","Nuclear proliferation|","1949 in international relations","1949 in military history"],"headings":["Response in the West","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/RDS-1.jpg/250px-RDS-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Joe_one.jpg/220px-Joe_one.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fat_Man","Proximity_fuze","Nuclear_weapon","Soviet_Union","Nuclear_testing","United_States","Joseph_Stalin","Semipalatinsk_Test_Site","Kazakh_SSR","Research_and_development","Kurchatov_Institute","Uranium-235","Chelyabinsk","TNT_equivalent","Lavrenty_Beria","Nagasaki,_Nagasaki","Japan","Plutonium","RDS-2","Atomic_spies","World_War_II","Rapid_transit","Backronym","Mikhail_Pervukhin","Radioactive","Fission_products","Nuclear_fallout","Cold_War","Green_Run","Hydrogen_bomb","Soviet_atomic_bomb_project","RDS-2","RDS-3","RDS-4","RDS-5","RDS-37","RDS-220"]}
