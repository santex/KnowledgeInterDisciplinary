{"cursor":"6418","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In physiology, 'respiration' (often confused with breathing) is defined as the\ntransport of oxygen from the outside air to the cells within tissues, and the\ntransport of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction. This is in contrast to\nthe biochemical definition of respiration, which refers to '[[cellular\nrespiration]]': the metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy by\nreacting oxygen with glucose to give water, carbon dioxide and ATP (energy).\nAlthough physiologic respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration\nand thus life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes\nplace in individual cells of the organism, while physiologic respiration\nconcerns the bulk flow and transport of metabolites between the organism and the\nexternal environment.\n","linknr":229,"url":"Respiration_(physiology)","recorded":1362373625,"links":48,"instances":["medical","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Excretion","Respiration|*"],"headings":["Mechanisms","Classifications of respiration","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["tissue","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["hypoxia","organ","tissue"],"related":["Physiology","Breathing","Oxygen","Tissue_(biology)","Transport","Carbon_dioxide","Biochemistry","Metabolism","Organism","Oxygen","Glucose","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cellular_respiration","Bulk_flow","Unicellular","Diffusion","Lenticel","Humans","Respiratory_system","Circulatory_system","Heart","Brain","Kidney","Skin","Skeletal_muscle","Vertebrates","Alveoli","Lung","Organ_(anatomy)","Lung","Tissue_(biology)","Organ_(anatomy)","Mitochondria","Heart","Thoracic_diaphragm","Intercostal_muscles","Respiratory_physiology","Human_physiology","Phenotype_microarray","Aquatic_respiration","Buccal_pumping","Respiration_organ","Gas_exchange","Arterial_blood_gas","Control_of_respiration","Apnea","Huff_and_puff","Spirometry","Selected_ion_flow_tube_mass_spectrometry","Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome","Myasthenia_gravis","Asthma","Drowning","Choking","Dyspnea","Anaphylaxis","Pneumonia","Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome","Pulmonary_aspiration","Pulmonary_edema","Death","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Mechanical_ventilation","Intubation","Iron_lung","Intensive_care_medicine","Liquid_breathing","ECMO","Oxygen_toxicity","Medical_ventilator","Paramedic","Life_support","General_anaesthesia","Laryngoscope","Respiratory_therapy","Breathing_gas","Hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy","Hypoxia_(medical)","Gas_embolism","Decompression_sickness","Barotrauma","Oxygen_toxicity","Nitrogen_narcosis","Carbon_dioxide_poisoning","Carbon_monoxide_poisoning","HPNS","Salt_water_aspiration_syndrome","Respiratory_system","List_of_basic_biology_topics","Disorders_and_Diseases_of_the_Respiratory_System"]}
