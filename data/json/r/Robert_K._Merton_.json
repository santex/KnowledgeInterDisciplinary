He spent most of his career teaching at Columbia University, where\nhe attained the rank of University Professor. In 1994 Merton won the National\nMedal of Science for his contributions to the field and for having founded the\nsociology of science. Synonyms for the term\n\"sociology of science\" include \"science of science\"\n([http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ \"Science of Science Cyberinfrastructure Portal...\nat Indiana University\"]; Maria Ossowska and StanisÅaw Ossowski, \"The Science of\nScience,\" 1935, reprinted in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish Contributions to\nthe Science of Science, Boston, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, pp. 82-95)\nand the back-formed term \"logology\" (Christopher Kasparek, \"Prus' [[Pharaoh\n(novel)|Pharaoh]]: the Creation of a Historical Novel\", [[The Polish Review]],\nvol. XXXIX, no. 1, 1994, note 3, pp. 45-46; , Komentarze do naukoznawczych\npoglÄdÃ³w Williama Whewella (1794-1866): studium historyczno-metodologiczne\n[Commentaries to the Logological Views of William Whewell (1794-1866): A Historical-\nMethodological Study], Warsaw, Polish Academy of Sciences, 2012, [English-\nlanguage] summary, pp. 741-43). The term \"logology\" provides convenient\ngrammatical variants not available with the earlier terms: i.e., \"logologist\",\n\"to logologize\", \"logological\", \"logologically\".\n\nMerton developed notable concepts such as \"unintended consequences\", the\n\"reference group\", and \"role strain\" but is perhaps best known for having\ncreated the terms \"role model\" and \"self-fulfilling prophecy\". A central element of\nmodern sociological, political and economic theory, the \"self-fulfilling\nprophecy\" is a process whereby a belief or an expectation, correct or incorrect,\naffects the outcome of a situation or the way a person or a group will\nbehave. Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition; January 1, 2009, p. 1\n\"Self-fulfilling prophecy\" Merton's work on the \"role model\" first\nappeared in a study on the socialization of medical students at Columbia. The\nterm grew from his theory of a reference group, or the group to which\nindividuals compare themselves, but to which they do not necessarily belong.\nSocial roles were a central piece of Merton's theory of social groups. Merton\nemphasized that, rather than a person assuming one role and one status, they\nhave a status set in the social structure that has attached to it a whole set of\nexpected behaviors.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Robert_K._Merton_","recorded":1372155002,"links":[],"instances":["illusion","sociology","sociology","sociology","behavior","sociology","sociology","sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1910 births","2003 deaths","American sociologists","Jewish sociologists","Columbia University faculty","Functionalism (social theory)","Futurology","Historians of science","MacArthur Fellows","National Medal of Science laureates","Sociologists of science","Presidents of the American Sociological Association","Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Public administration scholars","Sociology index","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences"],"headings":["Biography","Works","Influences","Quotes","See also","Publications","References","External links","Books about Robert K.
