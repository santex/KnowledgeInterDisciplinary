There are two parallel muscles, separated by\na midline band of connective tissue called the linea alba (\"white line\"). It\nextends from the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle inferiorly, to\nthe xiphoid process and costal cartilages of ribs V to VII\nsuperiorly.<ref>Gray's Anatomy for students, 2nd edition, Page:176</ref>\n\nIt is contained in the rectus sheath, which consists of the aponeuroses of the\nlateral abdominal muscles.\n\nThree, and sometimes four, bands of connective tissue called the tendinous\nintersections traverse the rectus abdominus, which separate it into six or eight\ndistinct muscle bellies, respectively. The appearance of these segments has led\nto the rectus abdominus also being called the \"'six-pack'.\"\n","title":"Rectus%20abdominis%20muscle","headings":["Function","Blood supply","Innervation","Location","Damage","Animals","Additional images","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Xiphoid_process","2: Ribs","2: Inferior_epigastric_artery","2: Rectus_sheath","1: Costal_cartilage","1: Human_sternum","1: Thoraco-abdominal_nerves","1: Erector_spinae","1: Muscle","1: Connective_tissue","1: Pubic_symphysis","1: Pubic_crest","1: Pubic_tubercle","1: Costal_cartilages","1: Aponeurosis","1: Tendinous_intersections","1: Abdomen","1: Human_position","1: Lumbar_spine","1: Pelvis","1: Superior_epigastric_artery","1: Internal_thoracic_artery","1: Intercostal_artery","1: Thoracoabdominal_nerve","1: Costoxiphoid_ligaments","1: Thorax","1: Divarication_of_rectus_abdominis_muscles","1: Chest_wall","1: External_abdominal_oblique","1: Internal_abdominal_oblique"]}
