{"cursor":"3250","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'East Linton' is a town in East Lothian, Scotland, situated on the River Tyne\nand A199 road (former A1 road) five miles east of Haddington, with a population\nof 1,774 (Census 2001). (In 1881 it had a population of 1,042).\n\nEast Linton probably gets its name from the Linn (a waterfall) on the river next\nto the village, although Martine adds that it was called 'East' Linton to\ndistinguish it from West Linton in Peebleshire when the railways were built.\n\nToday it has only one active church - Prestonkirk Parish Church (rebuilt 1770),\nalso the name of the parish, but formerly had a free church (St Andrew's), a\nRoman Catholic church, and a Methodist hall. The clock on St Andrew's former\nChurch was put in by the village to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee;\nit was named Jessie after a local lass when some village lads climbed into the\nsteeple and christened it. The name has remained ever since. There has long been\na school in the town, and the mid-Victorian schoolmaster in East Linton was a\nGeorge Pringle Smith (d.1850).\n\nThere is a fountain in the town square which has 4 cherubs and lights on top.\n\nPreston Mill, an old watermill, is on the outskirts. There has been a mill on\nthe site since 1599, and it is still working. Attached to the watermill is a\nkiln, with a cowl of local design.\n\nFollowing the closure of the branch railway line to Haddington in 1949, the fine\nVictorian station on the East Coast main line at became the next closest for\nthat burgh. Though main line trains still thunder through at high speed, East\nLinton station was closed in 1964 and is now used as a residence. Prior to the\ncoming of the North British Railway, the mail coaches changed horses at the\nDouglas Inn, opposite the distillery in East Linton.\n\nA surviving relic of East Linton's past importance as an agricultural centre is\na timber octagonal auction mart for cattle, pigs and sheep in Station Road.\n\nCivil engineer John Rennie (1761-1821) was born here, at Phantassie on Dunbar\nRoad. He died at his home in London while working on the London Bridge\nproject, a bridge he designed. The work was completed by his sons, George and\nSir John Rennie.\n\nThe East Linton Community Website has more information at\n[http://www.eastlinton.uk.com/ www.eastlinton.uk.com] The East Linton
