The bomber has a crew of two and can drop up\nto eighty -class JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen B83 nuclear bombs. The B-2 is\nthe only aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a\nstealth configuration.\n\nDevelopment originally started under the \"Advanced Technology Bomber\" (ATB)\nproject during the Carter administration, and its performance was one of the\nreasons for his cancellation of the B-1 Lancer. ATB continued during the Reagan\nadministration, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the\nreinstatement of the B-1 program as well. Program costs rose throughout\ndevelopment. Designed and manufactured by Northrop Grumman with assistance from\nBoeing, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737&nbsp;million (in 1997\ndollars).<ref name=Gao>[http://www.fas.org/man/gao/nsiad97181.htm \"B-2 Bomber:\nCost and Operational Issues Letter Report, 14 August 1997, GAO/NSIAD-97-181.\"]\nUnited States General Accounting Office (GAO). Retrieved: 13 September\n2009.</ref> Total procurement costs averaged $929&nbsp;million per aircraft,\nwhich includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support.<ref\nname=Gao/> The total program cost including development, engineering and\ntesting, averaged $2.1&nbsp;billion per aircraft in 1997.<ref name=Gao/>\n\nBecause of its considerable capital and operating costs, the project was\ncontroversial in the U.S. Congress and among the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The winding-\ndown of the Cold War in the latter portion of the 1980s dramatically reduced the\nneed for the aircraft, which was designed with the intention of penetrating\nSoviet airspace and attacking high-value targets. During the late 1980s and\n1990s, Congress slashed plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was\ndestroyed in a crash shortly after takeoff, and the crew ejected\nsafely.<ref>Rolfsen, Bruce.\n[http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2008/06/airforce_b2_crashreport_060508w/\n\"Moisture confused sensors in B-2 crash.\"] Air Force Times, 9 June 2008.\nRetrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> A total of 20 B-2s remain in service with\nthe United States Air Force.\n\nThe B-2 is capable of all-altitude attack missions up to 50,000&nbsp;ft, with a\nrange of more than 6,000 nautical miles unrefuelled and over 10,000 nautical\nmiles with one refueling. Though originally designed primarily as a nuclear\nbomber, it was first used in combat to drop conventional bombs on Serbia during\nthe Kosovo War in 1999, and saw continued use during the wars in Iraq and\nAfghanistan.<ref name = B-2_AF_fact_sheet />\n",
