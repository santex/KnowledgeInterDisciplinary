Foods that contain much starch but little sugar, such as rice and\npotato, taste slightly sweet as they are chewed because amylase turns some of\ntheir starch into sugar in the mouth. The pancreas also makes amylase (alpha\namylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which\nare converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants\nand some bacteria also produce amylase. As [[diastase]], amylase was the first\nenzyme to be discovered and isolated (by Anselme Payen in 1833).
