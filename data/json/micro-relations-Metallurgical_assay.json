{"cursor":"11727","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Arizona.]] .]] A 'metallurgical assay' is a compositional analysis of an ore,\nmetal, or alloy.\n\nSome assay methods are suitable for raw materials; others are more appropriate\nfor finished goods. Raw precious metals (bullion) are assayed by an assay\noffice. Silver is assayed by titration, gold by cupellation and platinum by\ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP\nOES). [http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/assayoffice/hallmarkingprocess.htm The\nGoldsmiths' Company - The Hallmarking Process ][http://www.waarborg.nl/index_uk.php WaarborgHolland, Europe's No.\n1 Assay Office ] Precious metal items of art\nor jewelry are frequently hallmarked (depending upon the requirements of the\nlaws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import). Where required\nto be hallmarked, semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass\nthrough the official testing channels where they are analyzed or assayed for\nprecious metal content. While different nations permit a variety of legally\nacceptable finenesses, the assayer is actually testing to determine that the\nfineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that\nthe maker has claimed (usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold) on\nthe item. In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but\ncurrently (most often) it is done using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF is used\nbecause this method is more exacting than the touchstone test. The most exact\nmethod of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation. This method is better\nsuited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works or art or\njewelry because it is a completely destructive method.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Metallurgical_assay","recorded":1362481258,"links":18,"instances":["mineralogy","assaying_tool","coin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coins","Gold","Laboratory techniques","Metallurgy","Silver"],"headings":["Touchstone","X-ray fluorescence","Fire assay / cupellation","Coins","Notes","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Tombstone_courthouse_assay_lab.jpg/200px-Tombstone_courthouse_assay_lab.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Klondike_Gold_Rush_Nat_Hist_Park_Seattle_seal_03A.jpg/200px-Klondike_Gold_Rush_Nat_Hist_Park_Seattle_seal_03A.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Colorado_Assay_Office%2C_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg/220px-Colorado_Assay_Office%2C_from_Robert_N._Dennis_collection_of_stereoscopic_views.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Assayer%2C_1916.jpg/220px-Assayer%2C_1916.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Goldas_50g_silver_bullion_in_assay_card.jpg/220px-Goldas_50g_silver_bullion_in_assay_card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["touchstone","assaying_tool"],["streak","mineralogy"],["mint","coin"]],"members":["streak","touchstone","mint"],"related":["Arizona","Ore","Metal","Alloy","Precious_metal","Assay_office","Titration","Cupellation","Spectrometry","Hallmark","X-ray_fluorescence","Touchstone_(assaying_tool)","Radiolarian_chert","Slate","Streak_(mineralogy)","White_gold","Cupellation","New_York","Hallmark","Mint_(coin)","Assay_office","Coin","Metal","Gold","Silver","Cupro-nickel","Brass","Perth_Mint","Trial_of_the_Pyx"]}
