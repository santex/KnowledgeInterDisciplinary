Friends' central doctrine is the priesthood of all\nbelievers, a doctrine which is derived from the Biblical\npassage 1 Peter 2:9. Most Quakers view themselves as a Christian\ndenomination. They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and\ntraditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity. Controversially,\nover the last 25 years, a minority of Quakers in the Western world have started\nto question some traditional Christian beliefs and practices.\n\nIn today's world, around 89% of Friends worldwide worship in churches that have\nprogrammed worship âthat is worship with singing\nunto God, a prepared message from the Bible, and often coordinated by a pastor.\nAround 11% of Friends practice waiting worship (also\nknown as unprogrammed worship)âthat is worship where the order of service is not\nplanned in advance, which is predominantly silent, and which may include\nunprepared vocal ministry from anyone present, so long as it is credible to\nthose assembled that the speaker is moved to speak by God. Some meetings of both\nstyles have Recorded Ministers in their meetings. Recorded Ministers are Friends\nwho have been recognised for their gift of vocal ministry. Drayton, Brian\n(1994) Recorded Ministers in the Society of Friends: Then and Now. Friends\nGeneral Conference. http://www.fgcquaker.org/library/ministry/recordedministers-\ndrayton.html\n\nThe first Quakers, known as the Valiant Sixty, lived in mid-17th century\nEngland. The movement arose from the Legatine-Arians and other dissenting\nProtestant groups, breaking away from the established Church of England. These\nQuakers attempted to convert others to their understanding of Christianity,\ntravelling both throughout Great Britain and overseas, preaching the gospel of\nJesus Christ. Some of the early Quaker ministers were women. They\nbased their message on the religious belief that \"Christ has come to teach his\npeople himself,\" stressing the importance of a direct relationship with God\nthrough Jesus Christ, and a direct religious belief in the universal priesthood\nof all believers. They emphasized a personal and direct religious\nexperience of Christ, acquired through both direct religious experience and the\nreading and studying of the Bible. Quakers focused their private life\non developing behavior and speech reflecting emotional purity and the light of\nGod.\n\nIn the past, Quakers were known for their use of ''thee'' as an ordinary\npronoun, refusal to participate in war, plain dress, refusal to swear oaths,\nopposition to slavery, and teetotalism -- the opposition to alcohol. Some\nQuakers have founded banks and financial institutions including Barclays, Lloyds\nand Friends Provident; manufacturing companies including Clarks, Cadbury,\nRowntree and Fry's; and philanthropic efforts, including abolition, prison\nreform and social justice projects.\n\nA well-known image of a Quaker, though not a portrait of an actual person, nor\nin any way connected to the Religious Society of Friends, is found on the label\nof Quaker Oats, dating back to 4 September 1877.
