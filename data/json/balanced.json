Common forms of\nbalanced line are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair,\nused for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such\nas coaxial cable, which is designed to have its return conductor connected to\nground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground. Balanced and\nunbalanced circuits can be interconnected using a transformer called a balun.\n\nCircuits driving balanced lines must themselves be balanced to maintain the\nbenefits of balance. This may be achieved by differential signaling, transformer\ncoupling or by merely balancing the impedance in each conductor.\n\nLines carrying symmetrical signals (those with equal but opposite voltages to\nground on each leg) are often referred to as balanced, but this is an entirely\ndifferent meaning. The two conditions are not related.\n","title":"balanced%20line","headings":["Explanation","Telephone systems","Audio systems","Balanced and differential","Baluns","Characteristic impedance","Electric power lines","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Electrical_impedance","3: Twisted_pair","2: Transformer","2: Balun","2: Common-mode_interference","1: Telecommunication","1: Professional_audio","1: Transmission_line","1: Twin-lead","1: Unbalanced_line","1: Coaxial_cable","1: Differential_signaling","1: Repeating_coil","1: Faraday's_law_of_induction","1: Electromagnetic_shielding","1: Noise","1: Category_3_cable","1: Ethernet","1: Loading_coils","1: Trunk_line","1: Frequency_division_multiplexing","1: Fiber-optic","1: Star_quad","1: Microphone","1: Microphones","1: Mixing_console","1: XLR_connector","1: Impedance_matching","1: International_Electrotechnical_Commission","1: Line_level","1: E-carrier_level_1","1: Category_5_cable","1: Radio_frequency","1: Television","1: Twin_lead","1: Characteristic_impedance","1: Permittivity","1: Relative_permittivity","1: Electric_power_transmission","1: Three-phase_electric_power","1: Single-phase_electric_power","1: Railway_electrification_system","1: High-voltage_direct_current#Bipolar","1: Differential_pair","1: RS-422","1: RS-485","1: Low-voltage_differential_signalling","1: Mackie"]}
