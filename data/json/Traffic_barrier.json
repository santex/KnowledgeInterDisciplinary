{"cursor":"12063","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Traffic barriers', sometimes called 'crash barriers', or 'Armco (barriers)'âas\nan AK Steel (formerly Armco) genericized trademarkâkeep vehicles within their\nroadway and prevent vehicles from colliding with dangerous obstacles such as\nboulders, buildings, walls or large storm drains. Traffic barriers are also\ninstalled at the road side to prevent errant vehicles from traversing steep (non-\nrecoverable) slopes or entering deep water. Traffic barriers are installed\nwithin medians of divided highways to prevent errant vehicles from entering the\nopposing carriageway of traffic and help to reduce head-on collisions. Some of\nthese barriers, designed to be struck from either side, are called median\nbarriers. Crash barriers can also be used to protect vulnerable areas like\nschool yards, pedestrian zones or fuel tanks from errant vehicles.\n\nWhile barriers are normally designed to minimize injury to vehicle occupants,\ninjuries do occur in collisions with traffic barriers. They should only be\ninstalled where a collision with the barrier is likely to be less severe than a\ncollision with the hazard behind it. Where possible, it is preferable to remove,\nrelocate or modify a hazard, rather than shield it with a barrier.\n\nTo make sure they are safe and effective, traffic barriers undergo extensive\nsimulated and full scale crash testing before they are approved for general use.\nWhile crash testing cannot replicate every potential manner of impact, testing\nprograms are designed to determine the performance limits of traffic barriers\nand provide an adequate level of protection to road users.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Traffic_barrier","recorded":1362890058,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transport engineering","Street furniture","Road infrastructure","Road transport","Safety equipment"],"headings":["Need and placement","Barrier types and performance","Barrier end treatments","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Crash_barrier-int.png/220px-Crash_barrier-int.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Jersey_barrier_2.png/220px-Jersey_barrier_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["AK_Steel","Genericized_trademark","Vehicle","Roadway","Obstacle","Storm_drain","Road_median","Carriageway","Head-on_collision","Crash_simulation","Crash_test","Culvert","Rollover","Head-on_crash","United_States","Federal_Highway_Administration","Crash_test","Cable_barriers","Semi-trailer_truck","New_Jersey","Jersey_barrier","Constant_slope_barrier","Concrete_step_barrier","F-shape_barrier","Parkway","Impact_attenuator","Guard_rail","Traffic_cone","Traffic_guard"]}
