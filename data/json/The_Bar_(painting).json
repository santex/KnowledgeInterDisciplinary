The subject of the\npainting is a direct reference to Ãdouard Manet's 1882 work [[A Bar at the Folies-\nBergÃ¨re]]. It depicts a barmaid working in an\nAustralian pub at the time of the \"six o'clock swill\". As in Manet's work, the\npatrons of the bar are shown in a reflection behind the barmaid. The work is\nconsidered a companion piece to Brack's later work [[Collins St., 5 pm]].\n\nThe painting was first sold to a Melbourne art collector for 90 guineas in\n1954. In 2006, the painting sold for $3.12m, a then record\nfor an Australian work of art at auction. The National\nGallery of Victoria acquired the painting in 2009. \n\nThe painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art\ncollection and exhibited in the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square in\nMelbourne.\n","linknr":123,"url":"The_Bar_(painting)","recorded":1362565062,"links":17,"instances":["coin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Paintings by John Brack","Australian paintings","Paintings of the National Gallery of Victoria","Melbourne culture","1954 paintings"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/81/John_Brack_-_The_Bar.jpg/300px-John_Brack_-_The_Bar.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Melbourne_yarra_afternoon.jpg/40px-Melbourne_yarra_afternoon.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Stylized_Mona_Lisa.svg/25px-Stylized_Mona_Lisa.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["guinea","coin"]],"members":["guinea"],"related":["John_Brack","1954_in_art","Melbourne","National_Gallery_of_Victoria","1954_in_art","John_Brack","Édouard_Manet","Barmaid","Pubs_in_Australia","Six_o'clock_swill","Guinea_(coin)","National_Gallery_of_Victoria","Ian_Potter_Centre","Federation_Square","Melbourne"]}
