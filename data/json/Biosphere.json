It can also be called the\nzone of life on Earth, a closed (apart from solar and cosmic radiation), and self-\nregulating system. {{Cite encyclopedia\n  | encyclopedia = The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition publisher = Columbia\n  | University Press year = 2004 accessdate = 2010-11-12 url =\n  | http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/biosphere.jsp\n}} From the broadest biophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the\nglobal ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships,\nincluding their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere,\nand atmosphere. The biosphere is postulated to have evolved, beginning through a\nprocess of biogenesis or biopoesis, at least some 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nIn a broader sense; biospheres are any closed, self-regulating systems\ncontaining ecosystems; including artificial ones such as Biosphere 2 and BIOS-3;\nand, potentially, ones on other planets or moons. but they can be open systems\ntoo. {{cite web\n  | title = Meaning of biosphere work = WebDictionary.co.uk publisher =\n  | WebDictionary.co.uk url =\n  | http://www.webdictionary.co.uk/definition.php?query=biosphere accessdate =\n  | 2010-11-12}}\n\n","linknr":521,"url":"Biosphere","recorded":1362506386,"links":90,"instances":["plants","animals","ecology","abstract","history","ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oceanography","Superorganisms","Biological systems"],"headings":["Origin and use of the term","Extent of Earth's biosphere","Specific biospheres","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Seawifs_global_biosphere.jpg/360px-Seawifs_global_biosphere.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/90_mile_beach.jpg/280px-90_mile_beach.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/250px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ecology","history"],["biomass","ecology"],["biota","ecology"],["model","abstract"],["flora","plants"],["fauna","animals"],["revised_simple_biosphere_model","sib-2"]],"members":["flora","revised_simple_biosphere_model","fauna","biomass","model","ecology","biota"],"related":["SeaWiFS","NASA","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","ORBIMAGE","Life","Earth","Geophysiology","Ecology","Lithosphere","Hydrosphere","Earth's_atmosphere","Evolution","Biogenesis","Origin_of_life","Biosphere_2","BIOS-3","Oceanography","Eduard_Suess","Charles_Darwin","Matthew_F._Maury","Earth_sciences","Vladimir_I._Vernadsky","Ecosystem","Arthur_Tansley","Ecology_(history)","Ecology","Interdisciplinary","Astronomy","Geophysics","Meteorology","Biogeography","Evolution","Geology","Geochemistry","Hydrology","Biomass_(ecology)","Biota_(ecology)","Model_(abstract)","Earth","Mars","James_Lovelock","Lynn_Margulis","Carbon_dioxide","Geobiology","Geomicrobiology","Apollo&nbsp;17","Polar_region","Equator","Microbiology","Microbial","Biomass","Puerto_Rico_Trench","Rüppell's_vulture","Altitude","Bar-headed_Goose","Yak","Mountain_goat","Ultraviolet_radiation","Volcanic_eruption","Piezophile","Mariana_Trench","Earth's_crust","Geothermal_gradient","Earth's_crust","Biome","Flora_(plants)","Fauna_(animals)","Latitude","Arctic_Circle","Antarctic_Circle","Plant","Animal","Equator","Homeothermy","Estivation","Earth","Biosphere_2","BIOS-3","Krasnoyarsk","Siberia","Soviet_Union","Soil_biomantle","Biosphere_reserve","Shadow_biosphere","Simple_Biosphere_model","Revised_Simple_Biosphere_Model_(SIB-2)","Closed_ecological_system","Habitable_zone","Ecosystem","Cryosphere","Geosphere","Life_support_system","Noosphere","Wardian_case","Winogradsky_column","Homeostasis","Thomas_Gold","Montreal_Biosphère"]}
