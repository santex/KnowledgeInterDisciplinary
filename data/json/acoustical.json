A scientist who works in the field of 'acoustics' is\nan acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be\ncalled an acoustical engineer. The application of acoustics can be seen in\nalmost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and\nnoise control industries.\n\nHearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and\nspeech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and\nculture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of\nhuman society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and\nmore. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance\nthe whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. Robert Bruce Lindsay's 'Wheel\nof Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in\nacoustics.<ref></ref>\n\nThe word \"acoustic\" is derived from the Greek word\n[[Wikt:ακουστικός|ακουστικός]] (akoustikos), meaning \"of or for hearing, ready\nto hear\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-\nbin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233396 Akoustikos] Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus</ref> and that\nfrom ἀκουστός (akoustos), \"heard, audible\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-\nbin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233397 Akoustos] Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus</ref> which in\nturn derives from the verb [[Wikt:ἀκούω|ἀκούω]] (akouo), \"I hear\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-\nbin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233399 Akouo] Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus</ref>\n\nThe Latin synonym is \"sonic\", after which the term 'sonics' used to be a synonym\nfor acoustics<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xNQrAAAAMAAJ&q=catacoustics-\n+sonics&dq=catacoustics+sonics&hl=en&ei=dCJ_TOO9BJH2tgPo94WSCw&sa=X&oi=book_res-\nult&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ Kenneth Neville Westerman (1947)]</ref>\nand later a branch of acoustics.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1po8AAAA-\nIAAJ&q=sonics&dq=sonics&hl=en&ei=qiF_TMfRHYqisQPjhLH1Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=-\nresult&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA Theodor F.
