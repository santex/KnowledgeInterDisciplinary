{"cursor":"5082","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Development studies' is a multidisciplinary branch of social science which\naddresses issues of concern to developing countries. It has historically placed\na particular focus on issues related to social and economic development, and its\nrelevance may therefore extend to communities and regions outside of the\ndeveloping world.\n\nDevelopment studies is offered as a specialised Master's degree in a number of\nuniversities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in\npopularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely\ntaught and researched in the third world and in countries with a colonial\nhistory, such as the UK, where development studies originated. Kothari, U.\n(ed), A Radical History of Development Studies: Individuals, Institutions and\nIdeologies â but see The Journal of Peasant Studies 34/1 (2007) for an\nalternative view.\n\nStudents of development studies often choose careers in international\norganisations such as the United Nations or the World Bank, non-\ngovernmental organisations, private sector development consultancy firms,\nand research centres.\n\nThe Development Studies Association is a major source of information for\nresearch on and studying in development studies in the UK and Ireland. Its\nmission is to connect and promote those working on development research.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Development_studies","recorded":1362477548,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Development studies|"],"headings":["Disciplines of development studies","History","Debates","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Multidisciplinary","Social_science","Developing_country","Social_development","Economic_development","Third_world","UK","United_Nations","World_Bank","Non-governmental_organisations","Development_Studies_Association","Area_Studies","Demography","Demographics","Development_communication","Development_theory","Ecology","Engineering","Environmental_studies","Human_security","Migration_studies","Pedagogy","Public_Health","Social_Policy","Urbanization","Women's_studies","Third_world","Decolonisation","Development_economics","Colonial_economics","Politics","Economics","Human_security","Colonization","Economic_development","Community_development","Social_development","International_development","Social_Work","Human_Rights","Industrialization","Human_security"]}
