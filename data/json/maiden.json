There are cultural and religious traditions which place special\nvalue and significance on this state, especially in the case of unmarried\nfemales, associated with notions of personal purity, honor and worth. Like\nchastity, the concept of virginity has traditionally involved sexual\nabstinence before marriage, and then to engage in sexual acts only with the\nmarriage partner.\n\nUnlike the term premarital sex, which can refer to more than one occasion of\nsexual activity and can be judgment neutral, the concept of virginity usually\ninvolves moral or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social\nstatus and in interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe term originally only referred to sexually inexperienced women, but has\nevolved to encompass a range of definitions, as found in traditional, modern,\nand ethical concepts.<ref name=\"consent\"></ref><ref name=\"Carpenter\">See [http:-\n//books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&pg=PT11&lpg=PT11&dq=Many+studies,+more-\nover,+seemed+uncritically+to+lump+nonvirgin+teens+(so+designated+if+they'd+had+-\nvaginal+sex)&source=bl&ots=-\ngiTNZ0Jtq&sig=J6YapNhv6SAukvLSFYJ6wPFlNrA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VElGUKSLL6m62wXZ5oHQDA&-\nved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Many%20studies%2C%20moreover%2C%20seemed%20uncritic-\nally%20to%20lump%20nonvirgin%20teens%20(so%20designated%20if%20they'd%20had%20v-\naginal%20sex)&f=false here] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&-\npg=PA48&dq=In+contrast+to+lesbigay+men+and+women,+most+of+whom+claimed+that+ora-\nl+and+anal+sex+would+result+in+virginity+loss+for+any+combination+of+partners,+-\nthe+majority+of+heterosexuals+I+spoke+with+placed+oral+sex+between+men+and+wome-\nn+squarely+in+the+category+of+foreplay---&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yGWtUKGFN4mo2gXN-\n4HYBQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=In%20contrast%20to%20lesbigay%20men%20and%20w-\nomen%2C%20most%20of%20whom%20claimed%20that%20oral%20and%20anal%20sex%20would%2-\n0result%20in%20virginity%20loss%20for%20any%20combination%20of%20partners%2C%20-\nthe%20majority%20of%20heterosexuals%20I%20spoke%20with%20placed%20oral%20sex%20-\nbetween%20men%20and%20women%20squarely%20in%20the%20category%20of%20foreplay---\n&f=false pages 47-49] for male virginity, how gay and lesbian individuals define\nvirginity loss, and for how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define\nvirginity loss/\"technical virginity\" by whether or not a person has engaged in\nvaginal sex. </ref><ref name=\"Intimate\"></ref><ref name=\"Friedman\"></ref>\nHeterosexual individuals may or may not consider loss of virginity to occur only\nthrough penile-vaginal penetration,<ref name=\"Carpenter\"/><ref\nname=\"Intimate\"/><ref name=\"Friedman\"/><ref name=\"McAnulty\"></ref> while people\nof other sexual orientations often include oral sex, anal sex or mutual\nmasturbation in their definitions of losing one's virginity.<ref\nname=\"Carpenter\"/><ref name=\"Virgin\"></ref><ref name=\"Blank\"></ref> Furthermore,\nwhether a person can lose his or her virginity through rape is also subject to\ndebate, with the belief that virginity can only be lost through consensual sex\nbeing prevalent in some studies.<ref name=\"consent\"/><ref name=\"Carpenter\"/>\n",
