{"cursor":"3390","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n published in Vanity Fair in 1876.]] 'Charles Old Goodford' (15 July 1812, Chilton-\n Cantelo â 9 May 1884, Eton) was an English headmaster, provost of Eton College.\n\nGoodford was the second son of John Goodford of Chilton-Cantelo, Somersetshire,\nwho died in 1835, by Charlotte, fourth daughter of Montague Cholmeley of Easton,\nLincolnshire. He entered Eton in 1826, and proceeded to King's College,\nCambridge, in 1830, whence he took his B.A. 1836, M.A. 1839, and D.D.\n1853.\n\nHe was elected a fellow of his college, but did not long retain his fellowship,\nas on 28 March 1844 he married Katharine Lucia, third daughter of George Law of\nLincoln's Inn. While still an undergraduate he returned to Eton and became an\nassistant-master in 1835. It was not long before he succeeded his former tutor,\nJohn Wilder, in charge of a large and important schoolhouse, in which a number\nof the resident boys were from his own and the adjacent counties. As a house-\nmaster he was liberal and kind, but his management was not equal to his good\nintentions. In 1853 he succeeded Edward Craven Hawtrey, D.D., as head-master at\nEton. His rule on the whole was beneficial to the college. He aimed at a very\ncomplete reconstruction of the system of teaching; he made discipline a reality,\nwhile he abolished many vexatious rules which had needlessly restricted liberty,\nand would have done more but for the veto of the provost. In 1854 he edited P.\nTerentii Afri ComÅdiÃ¦, a work which he printed chiefly to present as a leaving\nbook to his sixth-form boys. On the death of Dr. Hawtrey, Lord Palmerston, in\nignorance of the needs of Eton, and much against Goodford's own wishes,\nappointed him provost of Eton, a position which he held from 27 January 1862 to\nhis death. Under the Cambridge University commission of 1860, and more\nparticularly under the royal commission of 1865, great changes and improvements\nwere made in the college. Goodford held the small family living of Chilton-\nCantelo from 1848 to his death.\n\nHe died at The Lodge, Eton, 9 May 1884, and was buried in the Eton\ncemetery 14 May.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Charles_Old_Goodford","recorded":1375082815,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Charles_Old_Goodford,_Vanity_Fair,_1876-01-22.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Charles_Old_Goodford%2C_Vanity_Fair%2C_1876-01-22.jpg/220px-Charles_Old_Goodford%2C_Vanity_Fair%2C_1876-01-22.jpg","/wiki/File:Charles_Old_Goodford,_Vanity_Fair,_1876-01-22.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Leslie_Ward","/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(British_magazine_1868-1914)","/wiki/Chilton-Cantelo","/wiki/Eton,_Berkshire","/wiki/Provost_(education)","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Easton,_Lincolnshire","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Lincoln%27s_Inn","/wiki/Lord_Palmerston","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=GDFT831CO&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Goodford,_Charles_Old_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Edward_Craven_Hawtrey","/wiki/List_of_head_masters_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Edward_Balston","/wiki/Edward_Craven_Hawtrey","/wiki/Provost_of_Eton","/wiki/James_John_Hornby","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/41673024","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&oldid=522831158","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1812_births","/wiki/Category:1884_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_North_Kesteven_(district)","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_King%27s_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:English_schoolteachers","/wiki/Category:Head_Masters_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_DNB_text_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Old+Goodford&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Charles+Old+Goodford","/wiki/Charles_Old_Goodford","/wiki/Talk:Charles_Old_Goodford","#","/wiki/Charles_Old_Goodford","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Charles_Old_Goodford","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Charles_Old_Goodford","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&oldid=522831158","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5081356","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Charles_Old_Goodford&id=522831158","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Charles+Old+Goodford","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Charles+Old+Goodford&oldid=522831158&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Old_Goodford&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5081356#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wiki
