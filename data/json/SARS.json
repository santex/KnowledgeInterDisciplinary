Between\nNovember 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong nearly became a pandemic,\nwith 8,273 cases and 775 deaths worldwide (9.6% fatality) according\nto the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect\nindividuals in 37 countries in early 2003. \n\nSARS is not claimed to have been eradicated (unlike smallpox), as it may still\nbe present in its natural host reservoirs (animal populations) and may return to\nthe human population.\n\nDuring the outbreak the fatality of SARS was less than 1% for people aged 24 or\nyounger, 6% for those 25 to 44, 15% for those 45 to 64, and more than 50% for\nthose over 65.

For comparison, the fatality of influenza\nis usually under 0.03% (primarily among the elderly), but rose to 2% during the\nmost severe pandemic to date.\n","linknr":1052,"url":"SARS","recorded":1362501619,"links":100,"instances":["tests","tests","biology","genetics","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.mt-archive.info/MTS-2005-Mawudeku.pdf"],"categories":["Severe
