Located in today's region of\nRaÅ¡ka, the city was right in the centre of the early medieval state that started\nto spread in all directions. It was founded between 8th and 9th centuries and\ngot deserted sometime in the 13th century. Its favorable position in the area\nknown as Old Serbia, along the RaÅ¡ka gorge, on the crossroads between the\nAdriatic Sea and state of Zeta, Bosnia in the west and Kosovo in the east added\nto its importance as a city. There is an impressive group of medieval monuments\nconsisting of fortresses, churches and monasteries. The monastery at SopoÄani is\na reminder of the contacts between Western world and the Byzantine world. Today\nthe city lies in mostly unenclosed and unprotected ruins close to the city of\nNovi Pazar, which probably began its own life as a trading enclave for Ras.\nHowever, there are plans for future reconstruction of the site. The site of\nStari Ras, in combination with the nearby Monastery of SopoÄani, is already a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site, and Stari Ras monastery (12th century) is being\nreconstructed and it too may be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List with\nthe site. Stari Ras and SopoÄani World Heritage site is not far from another\nUNESCO World Heritage Site of Serbia, the magnificent medieval monastery and\nchurches of Studenica. The 4th century Church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul\nis one of the oldest in the Balkans.\n\nStari Ras was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1990,\nand it is protected by Republic of Serbia.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Stari_Ras","recorded":1362572661,"links":47,"instances":["state","serbia","novi_pazar","eastern_orthodox","serbia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of Serbia by theme","Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance","Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance","Medieval Serbian architecture","Former populated places in the Balkans","Visitor attractions in Serbia","Landmarks in Serbia"],"headings":["History","See also","External links","References and notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Stari_Ras.jpg/250px-Stari_Ras.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Serbia_location_map.svg/235px-Serbia_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Petrova_crkva.JPG/120px-Petrova_crkva.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Sopocani_monastery16.jpg/120px-Sopocani_monastery16.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Flag_of_UNESCO.svg/55px-Flag_of_UNESCO.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg/55px-Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Flag_of_Serbia.svg/20px-Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Spomenik_Kulture.svg/80px-Spomenik_Kulture.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["monuments_of_culture_of_exceptional_importance","serbia"],["raška","state"],["history_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina","958–1463"],["church_of_saint_apostles_peter_and_paul","novi_pazar"],["monuments_of_culture_of_exceptional_importance","serbia"],["church_of_saint_apostles_peter_and_paul","novi_pazar"],["fourth_council_of_constantinople","eastern_orthodox"],["church_of_saint_apostles_peter_and_paul","novi_pazar"],["monuments_of_culture_of_exceptional_importance","serbia"],["spatial_cultural-historical_units_of_great_importance","serbia"]],"members":["raška","church_of_saint_apostles_peter_and_paul","fourth_council_of_constantinople","history_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina","monuments_of_culture_of_exceptional_importance"],"related":["Novi_Pazar","Serbia","Sopoćani","World_Heritage_Committee","List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Europe","Monuments_of_Culture_of_Exceptional_Importance_(Serbia)","Serb","Raška_(state)","Old_Serbia","Adriatic_Sea","Principality_of_Zeta","History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_(958–1463)","Kosovo","Sopoćani","Western_world","Byzantine","Novi_Pazar","Sopoćani","UNESCO","World_Heritage_Site","Studenica_monastery","Church_of_Saint_Apostles_Peter_and_Paul_(Novi_Pazar)","Monuments_of_Culture_of_Exceptional_Importance_(Serbia)","Republic_of_Serbia","First_Bulgarian_Empire","Church_of_Saint_Apostles_Peter_and_Paul_(Novi_Pazar)","Early_Christian","Constantine_I","Petar_Gojniković","Mutimir","Fourth_Council_of_Constantinople_(Eastern_Orthodox)","John_I_Tzimiskes","Ras_region","Ras_bishopric","Serbia","Church_of_Saint_Apostles_Peter_and_Paul_(Novi_Pazar)","Ohrid_archbishopric","Hungarian-Byzantine_War","Studenica_monastery","Monuments_of_Culture_of_Exceptional_Importance_(Serbia)","Tourism_in_Serbia","Nemanjić_dynasty","Spatial_Cultural-Historical_Units_of_Great_Importance_(Serbia)"]}
