A drop in blood oxygenation is known as hypoxemia; a rise in\narterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. The normal reference\nvalues are: oxygen PaO 2 greater than , and carbon dioxide\nPaCO 2 less than . Classification into type I or type II relates to\nthe absence or presence of hypercapnia respectively.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Respiratory_failure","recorded":1362501548,"links":35,"instances":["medical","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Intensive care medicine","Medical emergencies","Organ failure","Respiratory diseases","Causes of death"],"headings":["Types","Causes","Treatment","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/AARDS_X-ray_cropped.jpg/220px-AARDS_X-ray_cropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/VIP_Bird2.jpg/220px-VIP_Bird2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oxygenation","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["oxygenation","hypoxia"],"related":["Gas_exchange","Respiratory_system","Oxygenation_(medical)","Hypoxemia","Carbon_dioxide","Hypercapnia","Partial_pressure","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Hypoxia_(medical)","Hypercapnia","V/Q","V/Q","Right-to-left_shunt","Pulmonary_embolism","Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome","Pneumonia","Emphysema","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Asthma","Chronic_bronchitis","Asthma","Emphysema","Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease","Pneumonia","Pneumothorax","Pulmonary_contusion","Hemothorax","Acute_Respiratory_Distress_Syndrome","Cystic_Fibrosis","Pulmonary_edema","Cerebrovascular_Accident","Arrhythmia","Congestive_heart_failure","Hyperventilation","Metabolic_acidosis","Morphine","Benzodiazepine","Alcohol","Toxic_Epidermal_Necrolysis","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Endotracheal_intubation","Mechanical_ventilation","Respiratory_stimulant","Doxapram","Overdose","Sedative","Opioid","Benzodiazepines","Antidote","Naloxone","Flumazenil","Ventilation/perfusion_ratio","Pulmonary_shunt"]}
