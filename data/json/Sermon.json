{"cursor":"15270","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'sermon' is an oration by a prophet or member of the clergy. Sermons address a\nBiblical, theological, religious, or moral topic, usually expounding on a type\nof belief, law or behavior within both past and present contexts. Elements of\npreaching include exposition, exhortation and practical application.\n\nIn Christianity, a sermon (also known as a homily within some churches) is often\ndelivered in a place of worship, most of which have a pulpit or ambo, an\nelevated architectural feature. The word \"sermon\" comes from a Middle English\nword which was derived from an Old French term, which in turn came from the\nLatin word sermÅ; (\"discourse\"), although links have been made between the Latin\nword serere, which means 'to join together', so this leaves the modern Latin\ndefinition open to interpretation. The word can mean \"conversation\", which could\nmean that early sermons were delivered in the form of question and answer, and\nthat only later did it come to mean a monologue. In contrast to this are\nexamples from the Bible, where sermons are speeches without interlocution:\nMoses' sermon in Deuteronomy 1-33\n[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=5&chapter=1&version=9]; Jesus'\nsermon on the mount in Matthew 5-7 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205-\n7;&version=9;]; Peter's sermon after Pentecost in Acts 2:14-40 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:14-\n40;&version=9;].\n\nIn modern language, the word \"sermon\" can also be used pejoratively in secular\nterms to describe a lengthy or tedious speech delivered with great passion, by\nany person, to an uninterested audience. A 'sermonette' is a short sermon\n(usually associated with television broadcasting, as stations would present a\nsermonette before signing off for the night).\n","linknr":452,"url":"Sermon","recorded":1362484743,"links":49,"instances":["christianity","theology","broadcast","liturgy","religion","lutheran"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Speeches by type","Sermons|*","Homiletics","Christian genres","Christian terms","Latin loanwords"],"headings":["Christian tradition","Jewish Tradition","Types","Delivery methods","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Face.jpg/190px-StJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Face.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/31px-P_christianity.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg/240px-Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Luther-Predigt-LC-WB.jpg/335px-Luther-Predigt-LC-WB.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ambo","liturgy"],["sign-off","broadcast"],["schism","religion"],["divine_service","lutheran"],["jonathan_edwards","theology"],["mass","liturgy#communion_rite"],["good_news","christianity"]],"members":["good_news","mass","jonathan_edwards","ambo","schism","divine_service"],"related":["Public_speaking","Prophet","Clergy","Bible","Theology","Religion","Morality","Belief","Law","Human_behavior","Christianity","Homily","Pulpit","Ambo_(liturgy)","Middle_English","Old_French","Latin","Deuteronomy","Sermon_on_the_mount","Pentecost","Pejorative","Sign-off_(broadcast)","Carl_Heinrich_Bloch","Sermon_on_the_Mount","Jesus","Gospel_of_Matthew","Sea_of_Galilee","Capernaum","Christianity","Sermon_on_the_Plain","Gospel_of_Luke","History_of_Christianity","Saint_Peter","Acts_of_the_Apostles","Stephen","Tertullian","John_Chrysostom","Gregory_Nazianzus","Europe","Asia_Minor","Middle_Ages","Religious_institute","Saint_Dominic","Francis_of_Assisi","Pope_Urban_II","First_Crusade","Council_of_Clermont","France","Holy_Land","Palestine","Catholic_Church","Homiletics","John_Wesley","Martin_Luther","Postil","CH_Spurgeon","Protestant_Reformation","Protestant","Schism_(religion)","Salvation","Sola_fide","Eucharist","Lutheran","Divine_Service_(Lutheran)","Faith","Great_Awakening","Revival_meeting","United_States","Fire_and_brimstone","Jonathan_Edwards_(theology)","Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God","Mussar_movement","Philip_R._Alstat","Conservative_Judaism","Passover","Nazism","Kingdom_of_Judah","Classical_Athens","Liturgy","Biographical","Evangelistic","Foundational_story","Good_news_(Christianity)","Expository_preaching","Exegesis","Redemptive-Historical_Preaching","Manuscript","Extemporaneous_preaching","Impromptu_preaching","Preacher","List_of_preachers","Expository_preaching","Extemporaneous_preaching","Popular_Sermon_of_the_Medieval_Friar","Khutba","Kerygma","Theology","Midrash","Christian","Virtue","Redemptive-Historical_Preaching","European_History_Online","Institute_of_European_History"]}
