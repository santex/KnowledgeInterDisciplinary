In this\ncontext the term is most commonly used within psychiatry where pathology refers\nto disease processes. Abnormal psychology is a similar term used more frequently\nin the non-medical field of psychology. Another very general use of the term is\nto refer to mental symptoms (e.g., \"we studied the psychopathology of stroke\",\nmeaning that mental symptoms arisen after the occurrence of a stroke episode\nwere addressed).\n",
