While the Voyager and Pioneer probes have traveled into local\ninterstellar space, they are not generally considered starships because they\nhave not traveled to other stars and also because they are not vessels. However,\nexploratory engineering has been undertaken on several preliminary designs and\nfeasibility studies have been done for starships that could be built with modern\ntechnology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future.\n",
