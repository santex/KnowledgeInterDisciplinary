It was once considered\nto be closely related to the migratory Steppe Eagle, Aquila nipalensis, and the\ntwo forms have previously been treated as conspecific. They were split based on\npronounced differences in morphology and anatomy;<ref>Clark, W. S.

It is a resident breeder which lays 1–3\neggs in a stick nest in a tree, crag or on the ground.\n\nThroughout its range it favours open dry habitats, such as desert, semi-desert,\nsteppes, or savannah, plains.\n",
