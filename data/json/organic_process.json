Biological processes\nare made up of any number of chemical reactions or other events that results in\na transformation.\n\nRegulation of biological processes occurs where any process is modulated in its\nfrequency, rate or extent. Biological processes are regulated by many means;\nexamples include the control of gene expression, protein modification or\ninteraction with a protein or substrate molecule.\n* Physiological process, those processes specifically pertinent to the\n  functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, and organisms.\n* Reproduction\n* Digestion\n* Response to stimulus: a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism\n  (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as\n  a result of a stimulus.\n* Interaction between organisms. the processes by which an organism has an\n  observable effect on another organism of the same or different species.\n* Also: fermentation, fertilisation, germination, tropism, hybridisation,\n  metamorphosis, photosynthesis, transpiration.\n",
