{"cursor":"5954","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" fisherman—In the early 20th century, Edward Curtis traveled across\n America recording photographs of the disappearing lifestyle of American\n Indian tribes.]]\n\n'Salvage ethnography' is a term used by anthropologists beginning in the 1960s\nused as part of a critique of 19th-century ethnography and early modern\nanthropology. The term was coined by Jacob W. Gruber, who identified\nits emergence with 19th-century ethnographers documenting the languages of\npeoples being conquered and colonized by European countries or the United\nStates. According to Gruber, one of the first official statements acknowledging\nthat a major effect of colonialism was the destruction of existing languages and\nways of life was The report of the British Select Committee of Aborigines\n(1837). As a scholarly response, Gruber quotes James Cowles Prichard's address\nbefore the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839: :Wherever\nEuropeans have settled, their arrival has been the harbinger of extermination to\nthe native tribes. Whenever the simple pastoral tribes come into relations with\nthe more civilised agricultural nations, the allotted time of their destruction\nis at hand; and this seems to have been the case from the time when the first\nshepherd fell by the hand of the first tiller of soil. Now, as the progress of\ncolonization is so much extended of late years, and the obstacle of distance and\nphysical difficulties are so much overcome, it may be calculated that these\ncalamities, impending over the greater part of mankind, if we reckon by families\nand races, are to be accelerated in their progress; and it may happen that, in\nthe course of another century, the aboriginal nations of most parts of the world\nwill have ceased entirely to exist. In the meantime, if Christian nations think\nit not their duty to interpose and save the numerous tribes of their own species\nfrom utter extermination, it is of the greatest importance, in a philosophical\npoint of view, to obtain much more extensive information than we now possess of\ntheir physical and moral characters. A great number of curious problems in\nphysiology, illustrative of the history of the species, and the laws of their\npropagation, remain as yet imperfectly solved. The psychology of these races has\nbeen but little studied in an enlightened manner; and yet this is wanting in\norder to complete the history of human nature, and the philosophy of the human\nmind. How can this be obtained when so many tribes shall have become extinct,\nand their thoughts shall have perished with them?\n\nFrances Densmore (1867–1957), an important ethnomusicologist, worked in\nthe tradition of salvage ethnography. Densmore recorded the songs and lyrics of\nNative Americans in an attempt to preserve them permanently.\n\nArtists compounded the work of professional anthropologists during this time\nperiod. Photographer Edward S. Curtis (1868–1952) was preceded by painter\nGeorge Catlin (1796–1872) in attempting to capture indigenous North\nAmerican traditions that they believed to be disappearing. Both Curtis and\nCatlin have been accused of taking artistic license by embellishing a scene or\nmaking something appear more authentically \"Native American\". Edward S. Curtis\nnotes in the introduction to his series on the North American Indian: \"The\ninformation that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the\ngreat races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be\nlost.\" This statement reflects the artist's paternalistic concern for\ndocumenting the culture of American Indians and is representative of both the\npopular and academic sentiment of the time.\n\nSalvage ethnography started to be applied methodically in visual anthropology as\nethnographic film since the fifties by filmmakers such as Jean Rouch in France,\nMichel Brault and Pierre Perrault in Canada, or AntÃ³nio Campos in Portugal\n(early sixties), followed by others (seventies).\n\nSalvage ethnography is often taught in film and media studies courses as a style\nof filmmaking that captures a civilization or people's former way of living. The\nbest example of this would be Robert Flaherty's [[Nanook of the North]]. In\nNanook, Flaherty staged incidents and scenes that did not fairly represent the\nInuit tribe's current way of life, but rather their \"former majesty.\"\n","linknr":117,"url":"Salvage_ethnography","recorded":1363416774,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:A_smoky_day_at_the_Sugar_Bowl--Hupa.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/A_smoky_day_at_the_Sugar_Bowl--Hupa.jpg/180px-A_smoky_day_at_the_Sugar_Bowl--Hupa.jpg","/wiki/File:A_smoky_day_at_the_Sugar_Bowl--Hupa.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Hupa","/wiki/Edward_Curtis","/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Anthropology","/wiki/Ethnography","/wiki/Anthropology","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Jacob_W._Gruber&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frances_Densmore","/wiki/Edward_S._Curtis","/wiki/George_Catlin","/wiki/Artistic_license","/wiki/Edward_S._Curtis","/wiki/Visual_anthropology","/wiki/Ethnographic_film","/wiki/Filmmaker","/wiki/Jean_Rouch","/wiki/France","/wiki/Michel_Brault","/wiki/Pierre_Perrault","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Campos","/wiki/Portugal","/wiki/Nanook_of_the_North","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0226114945","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0195157273","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0871692317","/wiki/Salvage_anthropology","/wiki/Visual_anthropology","/wiki/Documentary_film","/wiki/Ethnographic_film","/wiki/Ethnofiction","/wiki/Nanook_of_the_North","/wiki/Edward_Sheriff_Curtis","/wiki/George_Catlin","/wiki/Robert_H._Lowie","/wiki/Alfred_L._Kroeber","/wiki/Frances_Densmore","/wiki/Marcel_Griaule","/wiki/Germaine_Dieterlen","/wiki/Jean_Rouch","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&oldid=540197391","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ethnography","/wiki/Category:Anthropology","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Salvage+ethnography&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Salvage+ethnography","/wiki/Salvage_ethnography","/wiki/Talk:Salvage_ethnography","#","/wiki/Salvage_ethnography","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Salvage_ethnography","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Salvage_ethnography","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&oldid=540197391","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Salvage_ethnography&id=540197391","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Salvage+ethnography","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Salvage+ethnography&oldid=540197391&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Salvage_ethnography&printable=yes","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etnografia_de_salvaguarda","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%90%B6%E6%95%91%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F%E8%AA%8C","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_ethnography","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.v
