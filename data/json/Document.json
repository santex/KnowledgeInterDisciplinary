{"cursor":"10701","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n \n\nThe term 'document' has multiple meanings in ordinary language and in\nscholarship. WordNet 3.1. lists four meanings (October 2011):\n\n* document, written document, papers (writing that provides information\n  (especially information of an official nature))\n* document (anything serving as a representation of a person's thinking by means\n  of symbolic marks)\n* document (a written account of ownership or obligation)\n* text file, document ((computer science) a computer file that contains text\n  (and possibly formatting instructions) using seven-bit ASCII characters).\n\nIn Library and information science and in documentation science, a \"document\" is\nconsidered a basic theoretical construct. It is everything which may be\npreserved or represented in order to serve as evidence for some purpose. The\nclassical example provided by Suzanne Briet is an antelope: \"An antelope running\nwild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But\nif it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has\nbeen made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those\nwho study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are\nsecondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.\" (Quoted\nfrom Buckland, 1998 Buckland, M. (1998). What is a digital document? In:\nDocument NumÃ©rique (Paris) 2(2),\nhttp://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html ). (This view has\nbeen seen as an early expression of what now is known as actorânetwork theory).\n\nThat documents cannot be defined by their transmission medium (such as paper) is\nevident because of the existence of electronic documents.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Document","recorded":1362534942,"links":63,"instances":["parchment","fastener","word_processing","documents","document","business","library_science"],"pdf":["http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8813&rep=rep1&type=pdf"],"categories":["Documents","Information science"],"headings":["What is a document?","Types of documents","Developing documents","History","In law","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["proposal","business"],["certificate","disambiguation#official_document"],["template","word_processing"],["form","document"],["scroll","parchment"],["staple","fastener"],["realia","library_science"],["subject","documents"]],"members":["scroll","staple","template","subject","certificate","form","proposal","realia"],"related":["WordNet","Library_and_information_science","Documentation_science","Suzanne_Briet","Antelope","Actor–network_theory","Transmission_medium","Electronic_document","Paul_Otlet","Suzanne_Briet","Walter_Schürmeyer","Documentalist","David_M_Levy","Classified_information","Privacy","Draft_document","Proofreading","Copying","Originality","Thesis","Academic_publishing","Journal","Invoice","Financial_quote","RFP","Proposal_(business)","Contract","Packing_slip","Ship's_manifest","Report","Spread_sheet","MSDS","Waybill","Bill_of_Lading","Financial_statement","Nondisclosure_agreement","Summons","License","Gazette","White_paper","News_in_brief","Mock-up","Screenplay","Template_(word_processing)","Page_layout","Graphic_design","Typography","Typesetting","Information_design","Information","Sign","Author","Data_entry_clerk","Transcriber","Form_(document)","Material","Paper","Ink","Printing_press","Laser_printer","Papyrus","Egypt","Parchment","Runes","Clay","Clay_tablet","Sumer","Mesopotamia","Scroll_(parchment)","Bookbinding","Book","Staple_(fastener)","Desktop_computer","Computer_display","Laptop","Tablet_computer","Computer_printer","Hard_copy","Personal_digital_assistant","E-book_device","Electronic_paper","Information_appliance","Digital_audio_player","Radio","Television","Telecommunications_Service_Provider","File_format","Evidence","Forensic","Questioned_document_examination","Bates_numbering","Data_storage_device","Document_automation","Document_collaboration","Document-centric_collaboration","Document_file_format","Internet_media_type","Internet_of_Things","Realia_(library_science)","Subject_(documents)","Historical_document","Desktop_publishing","Word_processor","Documentary_film","Documentation_science"]}
