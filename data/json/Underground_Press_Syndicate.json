{"cursor":"9251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Underground Press Syndicate', commonly known as UPS, and later known as\nthe 'Alternative Press Syndicate' or APS, was a network of countercultural\nnewspapers and magazines formed in mid-1966 by the publishers of five early\nunderground papers: the [[East Village Other]], the [[Los Angeles Free Press]],\nthe [[Berkeley Barb]], [[The Paper (newspaper)|The Paper]], and [[Fifth Estate\n(periodical)|Fifth Estate]]. Walter Bowart and John Wilcock of EVO -- along\nwith Michael Kindman of The Paper in East Lansing, MI -- took the lead in\ninviting the other papers to join. Initially it was hoped that the syndicate\nwould sell national advertising space that would run in all five papers, but\nthis never happened.\n\nThe [[San Francisco Oracle]], [[The Rag]], and the [[Illustrated Paper]] (a\npsychedelic paper published in Mendocino, California) joined soon afterward, and\nmembership grew rapidly in 1967 as new papers were founded and immediately\njoined. The first paper in the deep South to join was [[The Inquisition\n(underground newspaper)|The Inquisition]] (Charlotte, North Carolina).\n\nThe first gathering of underground papers, sponsored by UPS, was held at the\nhome of the San Francisco Oracle's Walter Bowart in Stinson Beach, CA, in March\n1967, with some 30 people representing a half dozen papers in\nattendance. [http://books.google.com/books?id=TPaGnYarRCkC&pg=PA83 Walt\nCrowley, Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle] The meeting\nwas chaotic and largely symbolic, and the concept amorphous. As Thorne Dreyer\nand Victoria Smith wrote for LNS, the formation of UPS was designed \"to create\nthe illusion of a giant coordinated network of freaky papers, poised for the\nkill.\" But, they added, \"this mythical value was to be extremely important: the\nshoes could be grown into,\" and the emergence of UPS helped to create a sense of\nnational community and to make the papers feel less isolated in their\nefforts. [http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/newmedia.html Dreyer, Thorne and\nVictoria Smith, The Movement and the New Media], Liberation News Service, March\n1, 1969.\n\nBy June 1967, a UPS conference in Iowa City hosted by [[Middle Earth\n(newspaper)|Middle Earth]] drew 80 newspaper editors from US and Canada,\nincluding representatives of Liberation News Service (LNS). LNS, founded by\nMarshall Bloom and Ray Mungo that summer, would play an equally important and\ncomplementary role in the growth and evolution of the underground press in the\nUnited States.\n\nUPS members agreed to allow all other members to freely reprint their contents,\nto exchange gratis subscriptions with each other, and to occasionally print a\nlisting of all UPS newspapers with their addresses. And anyone who agreed to\nthose terms was allowed to join the syndicate. As a result, countercultural news\nstories, criticism and cartoons were widely disseminated, and a wealth of\ncontent was available to even the most modest start-up paper. First-hand\ncoverage of the 1967 Detroit riots in Fifth Estate was one example of material\nthat was widely copied in other papers of the syndicate. As it evolved, the\nUnderground Press Syndicate created an Underground Press Service, and later its\nown magazine.\n\nThe early papers varied greatly in visual style, content, and even in basic\nconcept -- and emerged out of very different kinds of communities. Many were\ndecidedly rough-hewn, learning journalistic and production skills on the run.\nSome were militantly political while others, like the San Francisco Oracle,\nfeatured highly spiritual content and were graphically sophisticated and\nadventuresome. According to historian Abe Peck, The Rag in Austin was the first\nto successfully merge countercultural content with radical politics, and \"to\nrepresent the participatory democracy, community organizing and synthesis of\npolitics and culture that the New Left of the midsixties was trying to develop.\"\nPeck, Abe. Uncovering the Sixties (New York: Pantheon Books, 1985).\n\nA UPS roster published in November 1966 listed 14 underground\npapers, [http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/ups_roster1966.html 1966 Underground\nPress Syndicate Roster] but within a few years the number had mushroomed.\nA 1971 roster, published in Abbie Hoffmanâs [[Steal This Book]], listed 271 UPS-\naffiliated papers in the United States, Canada, and\nEurope. [http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/ups_roster1971.html 1971 Underground\nPress Syndicate Roster] According to historian John McMillian, writing in\nhis 2010 book Smoking Typewriters, the underground press' combined readership\neventually reached into the millions. }}\n\nAs the underground press movement evolved, women's liberation, initially a non-\nissue in the male-dominated underground press, became an increasing focus. The\nUPS passed the following resolutions at its 1969 conference:  1.\nThat male supremacy and chauvinism be eliminated from the contents of the\nunderground papers. For example, papers should stop accepting commercial\nadvertising that uses women's bodies to sell records and other products, and\nadvertisements for sex, since the use of sex as a commodity specially oppresses\nwomen in this country. Also, women's bodies should not be exploited in the\npapers for the purpose of increasing circulation. 2.\nThat papers make a particular effort to publish material on women's oppression\nand liberation with the entire contents of the paper. \n3. That women have a full role in all the functions of the staffs of underground\npapers. The Underground Press in America by Robert J. Glessing (Indiana\nUniversity Press, 1970), p. 65.\n\nThese resolutions were a harbinger of staff rebellions by women that split\nseveral papers, including Rat, where the feminist faction seized control of the\npaper for several issues. A few papers, already weakened by staff burnout, poor\nfinanaces and other factors, died in the wake of these schisms, while others\nlost revenue and circulation by barring sexual content and advertisements,\nwhich in any event were increasingly being spun off into tabloid sex papers\nlike Screw.\n\nShortly after the formation of the UPS, the number of \"underground\" papers\nthroughout North America expanded dramatically. The explosive growth of the\nunderground press did not begin to subside until 1970, and by 1973 the boom was\nclearly over and most underground newspapers in the US had ceased publication.\nTheir influence resonated through the 1970s and beyond, in scores of eclectic\npapers founded in small towns and suburbs, such as Long Island's Moniebogue\nPress and Suffolk StreetPapers, offering general audiences alternative\nperspectives on local news and culture, and in publications specializing in\nNative American politics Akwesasne Notes), peace, ecology, etc. Many of the\nmembers of the UPS and its successors were founded when the legendary urban\nunderground papers were already dead or dying.\n\nFor many years the Underground Press Syndicate was run by Tom Forcade, who\nlater founded [[High Times]] magazine. After a 1973 meeting of underground and\nalternative newspapers in Boulder, Colorado, the name was changed to the\nAlternative Press Syndicate (APS). APS was an attempt to reinvent the\nsyndicate to compete with the growing network of alternative weeklies\nnetworked by the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies; but failed, and the\nAAN supplanted its role.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Underground_Press_Syndicate","recorded":1364206357,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Dreyer_at_ups_meeting.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Dreyer_at_ups_meeting.jpg/220px-Dreyer_at_ups_meeting.jpg","/wiki/File:Dreyer_at_ups_meeting.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Counterculture","/wiki/Underground_press","/wiki/East_Village_Other","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Free_Press","/wiki/Berkeley_Barb","/wiki/The_Paper_(newspaper)","/wiki/Fifth_Estate_(periodical)","/wiki/Walter_Bowart","/wiki/John_Wilcock","/wiki/San_Francisco_Oracle","/wiki/The_Rag","/wiki/Illustrated_Paper","/wiki/Mendocino,_California","/wiki/The_Inquisition_(underground_newspaper)","/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Thorne_Dreyer","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Middle_Earth_(newspaper)","/wiki/Liberation_News_Service","/wiki/Marshall_Bloom","/wiki/Ray_Mungo","/wiki/Underground_press","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Abbie_Hoffman","/wiki/Steal_This_Book","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Rat_(newspaper)","/wiki/Screw_(magazine)","/wiki/Underground_press","/wiki/Moniebogue_Press","/w/index.php?title=Akwesasne_Notes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tom_Forcade","/wiki/High_Times","/wiki/File:Forcade-Thomas-01.tif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Forcade-Thomas-01.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Forcade-Thomas-01.tif.jpg","/wiki/File:Forcade-Thomas-01.tif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado","/wiki/Alternative_weekly","/wiki/Association_of_Alternative_Newsweeklies","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Chicago_Seed","/wiki/East_Village_Other","/wiki/Liberation_News_Service","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Free_Press","/wiki/Moniebogue_Press","/wiki/The_Rag","/wiki/Rat_Subterranean_News","/wiki/Ray_Mungo","/wiki/San_Francisco_Oracle","/wiki/Thorne_Dreyer","/wiki/Underground_press","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=TPaGnYarRCkC&pg=PA83","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/newmedia.html","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/ups_roster1966.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/ups_roster1971.html","#cite_ref-6","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit&section=3","http://www.azenphonypress.com/books/voices2.html","http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/ups_letter.html","http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/newmedia.html","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Newspaper.svg/30px-Newspaper.svg.png","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-newspaper-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-newspaper-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-newspaper-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&oldid=527283077","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Alternative_weekly_newspapers_published_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:News_agencies","/wiki/Category:History_of_Marin_County,_California","/wiki/Category:United_States_newspaper_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_invalid_ISBNs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Underground+Press+Syndicate&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Underground+Press+Syndicate","/wiki/Underground_Press_Syndicate","/wiki/Talk:Underground_Press_Syndicate","#","/wiki/Underground_Press_Syndicate","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Underground_Press_Syndicate&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal
