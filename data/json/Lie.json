A barefaced (or bald-faced) lie is one that is obviously a lie to\nthose hearing it. A Big Lie is a lie which attempts to trick the victim into\nbelieving something major which will likely be contradicted by some information\nthe victim already possesses, or by their common sense. To bluff is to pretend\nto have a capability or intention one does not actually possess. Bullshit is\noften used to make the audience believe that one knows far more about the topic\nby feigning total certainty or making probable predictions. An emergency lie is\na strategic lie told when the truth may not be told because, for example, harm\nto a third party would result. An exaggeration (or hyperbole) occurs when the\nmost fundamental aspects of a statement are true, but only to a certain degree.\n\nA fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth, without\nknowing for certain whether or not it actually is true. A half-truth is a\ndeceptive statement that includes some element of truth. The statement might be\npartly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth,\nor it may utilize some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or\ndouble meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame or\nmisrepresent the truth. An honest lie (or confabulation) is characterized by\nverbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and\npresent situations. Perjury is the act of lying or making verifiably false\nstatements on a material matter under oath or affirmation in a court of law, or\nin any of various sworn statements in writing. White lies are minor lies which\ncould be considered to be harmless, or even beneficial, in the long term.\n",
