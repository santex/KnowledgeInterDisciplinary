They are composed of numerous, distinct\nNative American tribes and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact\npolitical communities. The terms used to refer to Native Americans have been\ncontroversial. According to a 1995 U.S. Census Bureau set of home\ninterviews, most of the respondents with an expressed preference refer to\nthemselves as 'American Indians' (or simply 'Indians' â see Native American name\ncontroversy), and this term has been adopted by major newspapers and some\nacademic groups; however, this term does not typically include Native Hawaiians\nor certain Alaskan Natives, such as Aleut, Yup'ik, or Inuit peoples.\n\nSince the end of the 15th century, the migration of Europeans to the\nAmericas, and their importation of Africans as slaves, has led to centuries of\nconflict and adjustment between Old and New World societies. Europeans created\nmost of the early written historical record about Native Americans after the\ncolonists' immigration to the Americas. Calloway, Colin G. [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/native-americans-first-view-whites-\nshore \"Native Americans First View Whites from the Shore.\"] American Heritage,\nSpring 2009. Retrieved 2011-12-29 Many Native Americans lived as hunter-\ngatherer societies and told their histories by oral traditions. In many groups,\nwomen carried out sophisticated cultivation of numerous varieties of staple\ncrops: maize, beans and squash. The indigenous cultures were quite different\nfrom those of the agrarian, proto-industrial, mostly Christian immigrants from\nwestern Eurasia. Many Native cultures were matrilineal; the people occupied\nlands for use of the entire community, for hunting or agriculture. Europeans at\nthat time had patriarchal cultures and had developed concepts of individual\nproperty rights with respect to land that were extremely different.\n\nThe differences in cultures between the established Native Americans and\nimmigrant Europeans, as well as shifting alliances among different nations of\neach culture through the centuries, caused extensive political tension, ethnic\nviolence and social disruption. The Native Americans suffered high fatalities\nfrom the contact with infectious Eurasian diseases, to which they had no\nacquired immunity. Epidemics after European contact caused the greatest loss of\nlife for indigenous populations. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of\nwhat today constitutes the U.S. vary significantly, ranging from 1 million to 18\nmillion.\n\nAfter the colonies revolted against Great Britain and established the United\nStates of America, President George Washington and Henry Knox conceived of the\nidea of \"civilizing\" Native Americans in preparation for assimilation as U.S.\ncitizens. {{Cite book |last = Perdue |first = Theda |title =\nMixed Blood Indians: Racial Construction in the Early South |publisher = The\nUniversity of Georgia Press |chapter = Chapter 2 \"Both White and Red\" |page = 51\n|isbn = 0-8203-2731-X |year = 2003 }} \n{{Cite book |last = Remini |first = Robert |title = Andrew Jackson |publisher =\nHistory Book Club |chapter = \"The Reform Begins\" |page = 201 |isbn = 0-06-080132-\n8 |year = 1977, 1998 }} {{Cite book\n|last = Remini |first = Robert |title = Andrew Jackson |publisher = History Book\nClub |chapter = \"Brothers, Listen ...

During the 19th century, the ideology of manifest destiny\nbecame integral to the American nationalist movement. Expansion of European-\nAmerican populations to the west after the American Revolution resulted in\nincreasing pressure on Native American lands, warfare between the groups, and\nrising tensions. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act,\nauthorizing the government to relocate Native Americans from their homelands\nwithin established states to lands west of the Mississippi River, accommodating\nEuropean-American expansion.\n\nThe first European Americans to encounter the western interior tribes were\ngenerally fur traders and trappers. There were also Jesuit missionaries active\nin the Northern Tier. As United States expansion reached into the American\nWest, settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the Great\nBasin, Great Plains, and other Western tribes. These were complex nomadic\ncultures based on horse culture and seasonal bison hunting. They carried out\nstrong resistance to United States incursions in the decades after the\nAmerican Civil War, in a series of Indian Wars, which were frequent up until\nthe 1890s, but continued into the 20th century. The transcontinental railroad\nbrought more non-Natives into tribal land in the west. Over time, the U.S.\nforced a series of treaties and land cessions by the tribes, and established\nreservations for them in many western states. U.S. agents encouraged Native\nAmericans to adopt European-style farming and similar pursuits, but European-\nAmerican agricultural technology of the time was inadequate for often dry\nreservation lands. In 1924, Native Americans who were not already U.S.\ncitizens were granted citizenship by Congress.\n\nContemporary Native Americans have a unique relationship with the United\nStates because they may be members of nations, tribes, or bands with\nsovereignty and treaty rights. Since the late 1960s, Native American\nactivism has led to the building of cultural infrastructure and wider\nrecognition: they have founded independent newspapers and online media; FNX,\nthe first Native American television channel (2011), [http://nafsa.ucdavis.edu/NAFSA%20News.html \"FNX: First Nations\nExperience Television\"], NAFSA News (Native American Faculty and Staff\nAssociation), University of California, Davis, accessed 2011-10-25.\ncommunity schools, tribal colleges, and tribal museums and language programs;\nNative American studies programs in major universities; and national and state\nmuseums. Native American and Alaskan Native authors have been increasingly\npublished; they work as academics, policymakers, doctors, and in a wide\nvariety of occupations. Cultural activism has led to an expansion of efforts\nto teach and preserve indigenous languages for younger generations. Their\nsocieties and cultures exist within a larger population of descendants of\nimmigrants (both voluntary and involuntary): African, Asian, Middle Eastern,\nEuropean, and other peoples.\n","linknr":2655,"url":"Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","recorded":1374859482,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Native_Americans_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Native_Americans_in_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_by_geographic_regions","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_size","/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting","/wiki/Wikipedia:Summary_style","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Split-arrows.svg/60px-Split-arrows.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting","/wiki/Talk:Native_Americans_in_the_United_States#Size_split.3F","/wiki/File:Joseph_Brant_by_Gilbert_Stuart_1786.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Joseph_Brant_by_Gilbert_Stuart_1786.jpg/80px-Joseph_Brant_by_Gilbert_Stuart_1786.jpg","/wiki/File:Sequoyah.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Sequoyah.jpg/87px-Sequoyah.jpg","/wiki/File:Pushmataha_high_resolution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Pushmataha_high_resolution.jpg/86px-Pushmataha_high_resolution.jpg","/wiki/File:Tecumseh02.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Tecumseh02.jpg/85px-Tecumseh02.jpg","/wiki/File:Touch_the_Clouds_1877a.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Touch_the_Clouds_1877a.jpg/84px-Touch_the_Clouds_1877a.jpg","/wiki/File:Sitting_Bull.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Sitting_Bull.jpg/63px-Sitting_Bull.jpg","/wiki/File:ChiefJoseph.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/ChiefJoseph.jpeg/70px-ChiefJoseph.jpeg","/wiki/File:Charles_eastman_smithsonian_gn_03462a.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Charles_eastman_smithsonian_gn_03462a.jpg/76px-Charles_eastman_smithsonian_gn_03462a.jpg","/wiki/File:Billy_Bowlegs_III.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Billy_Bowlegs_III.jpg/65px-Billy_Bowlegs_III.jpg","/wiki/File:Jim_Thorpe_football.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Jim_Thorpe_football.png/61px-Jim_Thorpe_football.png","/wiki/File:WilmaMankillerByPhilKonstantin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/WilmaMankillerByPhilKonstantin.jpg/110px-WilmaMankillerByPhilKonstantin.jpg","/wiki/File:JohnBHarrington.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/JohnBHarrington.jpg/88px-JohnBHarrington.jpg","/wiki/Joseph_Brant","/wiki/Sequoyah","/wiki/Pushmataha","/wiki/Tecumseh","/wiki/Touch_the_Clouds","/wiki/Sitting_Bull","/wiki/Chief_Joseph","/wiki/Charles_Eastman","/wiki/Billy_Bowlegs_III","/wiki/Jim_Thorpe","/wiki/Wilma_Mankiller","/wiki/John_Herrington","#cite_note-2010census-1","/wiki/Western_United_States","/wiki/American_English","/wiki/Native_American_languages","/wiki/Spanish_language","/wiki/Native_American_Church","/wiki/Protestant","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Russian_Orthodox","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","/wiki/Metis","/wiki/Mestizo","/wiki/Latin_Americans","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","/wiki/Continental_United_States","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Alaska","/wiki/Hawaii","/wiki/Native_American_tribes","/wiki/Ethnic_group","/wiki/Native_American_name_controversy","/wiki/U.S._Census_Bureau","/wiki/Native_American_name_controversy","/wiki/Native_Hawaiians","/wiki/Alaskan_Natives","/wiki/Aleut_people","/wiki/Yupik_peoples","/wiki/Inuit","/wiki/Human_migration","/wiki/Africans","/wiki/Slaves","/wiki/Old_World","/wiki/New_World","#cite_note-test-2","/wiki/Hunter-gatherer","/wiki/Agrarian","/wiki/Immigrants","/wiki/Eurasia","/wiki/Matrilineal","/wiki/Patriarchal","/wiki/Infectious_disease","/wiki/Immunity_(medical)","/wiki/Epidemics","#cite_note-ggbook-3","#cite_note-encbrit-4","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Henry_Knox","#cite_note-perdue-5","#cite_note-remini_reform_begins-6","#cite_note-remini_submit_adoption-7","#cite_note-eric_miller-8","#cite_note-Tom_Jewett-9","/wiki/Choctaw","#cite_note-us_congress2-10","#cite_note-us_citizenship-11","/wiki/Manifest_destiny","/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act","/wiki/Mississippi_River","/wiki/Jesuit","/wiki/Missionaries","/wiki/Amer
