In the\nUnited States Air Force and the Royal Air Force (in which 'airwoman' is also\nseen), it can also refer to a specific enlisted rank. More informally, it can\nrefer to any member of an air force, or to any pilot, aviator, or aircrewman,\nmilitary or civilian, male or female.\n\nIn civilian aviation usage, the term airman is analogous to the term [[sailor]]\nin nautical usage. (U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard members are almost all\nsailors, even on naval and Coast Guard shore bases, but the subset of these who\nactually serve at sea in ships and boats are also \"seamen\". Further, people in\nthese services who are involved in flying are also \"airmen\".) In the American\nFederal Aviation Administration usage, an airman is any holder of an airman's\ncertificate, male or female. This certificate is issued to those who qualify for\nit by the Federal Aviation Administration Airmen Certification Branch.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Airman","recorded":1362665933,"links":18,"instances":["girl_scouts_of_the_usa","boy_scouts_of_america"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military ranks","Combat occupations"],"headings":["United States Air Force","United States Navy","United States Coast Guard","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/E2_USAF_AM.svg/150px-E2_USAF_AM.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/E3_AM_USN.png/50px-E3_AM_USN.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/E2_AM_USN.png/50px-E2_AM_USN.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Seal_of_the_US_Air_Force.svg/28px-Seal_of_the_US_Air_Force.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eagle_scout","boy_scouts_of_america"],["gold_award","girl_scouts_of_the_usa"]],"members":["gold_award","eagle_scout"],"related":["Armed_service","United_States_Air_Force","Royal_Air_Force","Air_force","Aviator","U.S._Navy","U.S._Coast_Guard","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Airman_certificate","U.S._Air_Force","Airman_Basic","Airman_First_Class","Human_resources","Senior_Airman","Junior_Reserve_Officers'_Training_Corps","High_school","Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)","Boy_Scouts_of_America","Gold_Award_(Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA)","Girl_Scouts_of_the_United_States_of_America","Lackland_Air_Force_Base","Texas","Intercontinental_ballistic_missile","Helicopter","Jet_engine","Turboprop","Electronics","Radar","Explosives","Artillery","Air-to-air_missile","Nuclear_weapon","Communication_system","Nurse","Physician's_assistant","Dental_assistant","U.S._Navy","Petty_officer_third_class","Aviation_boatswain's_mate","U.S._Coast_Guard","Seaman_apprentice","Petty_officer_third_class","Soldier","Seaman","U.S._Air_Force_enlisted_rank_insignia","United_States_Navy_enlisted_rates","RAF_enlisted_ranks"]}
