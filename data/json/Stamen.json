Stamens\ntypically consist of a stalk called the 'filament' (from Latin filum, meaning\n\"thread\"), and an 'anther' (from Ancient Greek anthera, feminine of antheros\n\"flowery,\" from anthos \"flower\"), which contains [[sporangium|microsporangia]].\nAnthers are most commonly two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at\nthe base or in the middle portion. The sterile tissue between the lobes is\ncalled the connective.\n\nA typical anther contains four microsporangia. The microsporangia form sacs or\npockets (locules) in the anther. The two separate locules on each side of an\nanther may fuse into a single locule. Each microsporangium is lined with a\nnutritive tissue layer called the tapetum and initially contains diploid pollen\nmother cells. These undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. The spores may\nremain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis. Each\nmicrospore then divides mitotically to form an immature microgametophyte called\na pollen grain.\n\nThe pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings (dehiscence).\nThese may consist of longitudinal slits, pores, as in the heath family\n(Ericaceae), or by valves, as in the barberry family (Berberidaceae). In some\nplants, notably members of Orchidaceae and Asclepiadoideae, the pollen remains\nin masses called pollinia, which are adapted to attach to particular pollinating\nagents such as birds or insects. More commonly, mature pollen grains separate\nand are dispensed by wind or water, pollinating insects, birds or other\npollination vectors.\n\nPollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma, the receptive surface\nof the [[Gynoecium|carpel]], of a compatible flower, for successful pollination\nto occur. After arriving, the pollen grain (an immature microgametophyte)\ntypically completes its development. It may grow a pollen tube and undergoing\nmitosis to produce two sperm nuclei.\n\n\n\nThe stamens in a flower are collectively called the 'androecium' (from Greek\nandros oikia: man's house). The androecium forms a whorl surrounding the\ngynoecium (carpels) and inside the 'perianth' (the [[petal]]s and [[sepal]]s\ntogether) if there is one. (The one exception is a few members of the family\nTriuridaceae, particularly [[Lacandonia schismatica]], in which the gynoecium\nsurrounds the androecium.)\n\nStamens can be free or fused in various ways. A column formed from the fusion of\nmultiple filaments is known as an 'androphore'.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Stamen","recorded":1362674144,"links":75,"instances":["flower","weaving","anatomy","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Plant morphology","Plant sexuality","Plant reproductive system","Pollination"],"headings":["Descriptive terms","Sexual reproduction in plants","Gallery","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Amaryllis_stamens_aka.jpg/250px-Amaryllis_stamens_aka.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Mature_flower_diagram.svg/400px-Mature_flower_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Penta_anther.jpg/250px-Penta_anther.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Phalaenopsis_orchid-Stipe.jpg/250px-Phalaenopsis_orchid-Stipe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Bee_pollenating_a_rose.jpg/120px-Bee_pollenating_a_rose.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Crateva_religiosa.jpg/111px-Crateva_religiosa.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/WheatFlower3.jpg/120px-WheatFlower3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Daylily_Stamens_dry_01v2.jpg/120px-Daylily_Stamens_dry_01v2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Albizia_julibrissin_%27Rosea%27_flower_detail.jpg/120px-Albizia_julibrissin_%27Rosea%27_flower_detail.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Passion_flower_stamen.jpg/120px-Passion_flower_stamen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Hylocereus_undatus._Night-blooming_cereus.jpg/120px-Hylocereus_undatus._Night-blooming_cereus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Solanum_anther-terminal-pores.jpg/107px-Solanum_anther-terminal-pores.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/RedandBlueLotusPistils.JPG/120px-RedandBlueLotusPistils.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["warp","weaving"],["organ","anatomy"],["corolla","flower"],["column","botany"]],"members":["corolla","warp","organ","column"],"related":["Pollen","Plural","Latin","Warp_(weaving)","Pollen","Organ_(anatomy)","Flower","Ancient_Greek","Haploid","Gametophyte","Pollen","Erica","Ericaceae","Barberry","Berberidaceae","Orchidaceae","Asclepiadoideae","Pollinium","Pollination","Greek_language","Gynoecium","Triuridaceae","Asteraceae","Corolla_(flower)","Anther","Carpel","Pistillate","Gynoecium","Orchid","Column_(botany)","Pollination","Spider_tree","Wheat","Passion_flower"]}
