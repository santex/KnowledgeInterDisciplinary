The\ndeterminant provides important information about a matrix of coefficients of a\nsystem of linear equations, or about a matrix that corresponds to a linear\ntransformation of a vector space. In the first case the system has a unique\nsolution exactly when the determinant is nonzero; when the determinant is zero\nthere are either no solutions or many solutions. In the second case the\ntransformation has an inverse operation exactly when the determinant is nonzero.\nA geometric interpretation can be given to the value of the determinant of a\nsquare matrix with real entries: the absolute value of the determinant gives the\nscale factor by which area or volume (or a higher dimensional analogue) is\nmultiplied under the associated linear transformation, while its sign indicates\nwhether the transformation preserves orientation. Thus a 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2\nmatrix with determinant −2, when applied to a region of the plane with finite\narea, will transform that region into one with twice the area, while reversing\nits orientation.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. The use of determinants in calculus\nincludes the Jacobian determinant in the substitution rule for integrals of\nfunctions of several variables. They are used to define the characteristic\npolynomial of a matrix that is an essential tool in eigenvalue problems in\nlinear algebra. In some cases they are used just as a compact notation for\nexpressions that would otherwise be unwieldy to write down.\n\nThe determinant of a matrix 'A' is denoted det('A'), det&nbsp;'A', or\n|'A'|.<ref></ref> In the case where the matrix entries are written out in full,\nthe determinant is denoted by surrounding the matrix entries by vertical bars\ninstead of the brackets or parentheses of the matrix. For instance, the\ndeterminant of the matrix\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix}a&b&c\\\\d&e&f\\\\g&h&i\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nis written\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c\\\\d & e & f\\\\g & h & i \\end{vmatrix}</math>\nand has the value\n:<math>aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\\,</math>\n\nAlthough most often used for matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers,\nthe definition of the determinant only involves addition, subtraction and\nmultiplication, and so it can be defined for square matrices with entries taken\nfrom any commutative ring. Thus for instance the determinant of a matrix with\ninteger coefficients will be an integer, and the matrix has an inverse with\ninteger coefficients if and only if this determinant is 1 or −1 (these being the\nonly invertible elements of the integers). For square matrices with entries in a\nnon-commutative ring, for instance the quaternions, there is no unique\ndefinition for the determinant, and no definition that has all the usual\nproperties of determinants over commutative rings.\n","title":"determinant","headings":["Definition","Properties of the determinant","Properties of the determinant in relation to other notions","Abstract algebraic aspects {{anchor|Abstract formulation}}","Generalizations and related notions","Calculation","History","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Commutative_ring","4: Identity_matrix","3: Linear_transformation","3: Characteristic_polynomial","3: Leibniz_formula_for_determinants","2: System_of_linear_equations","2: Real_number","2: Absolute_value","2: Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant","2: Eigenvalue","2: Integer","2: Factorial","2: Laplace_expansion","2: Symmetric_group","2: Parity_of_a_permutation","2: Levi-Civita_symbol","2: Multilinear_map","2: Alternating_form","2: Standard_basis","2: Gaussian_elimination","2: CauchyâBinet_formula","2: Sylvester's_determinant_theorem","2: Positive_definite_matrix","2: LU_decomposition","2: QR_decomposition","2: Big_O_notation","2: Multiplicative_group","2: Functional_determinant","2: DieudonnÃ©_determinant","2: Berezinian","2: Permanent","2: Immanant_of_a_matrix","2: Matrix_determinant_lemma","2: Pfaffian","2: Wronskian","1: Linear_algebra","1: Square_matrix#Square_matrices","1: Coefficients","1: Inverse_operation","1: Scale_factor","1: Calculus","1: Substitution_rule","1: Integral","1: Complex_number","1: Quaternion","1: Square_matrix","1: Polynomial_expression","1: Commutativity","1: Linear_mapping","1: 2Ã2_real_matrices#Equi-areal_mapping","1: Rule_of_Sarrus","1: Permutation","1: Even_and_odd_permutations","1: Even_number","1: Tullio_Levi-Civita","1: Tensor","1: Triangular_matrix","1: Column_vector","1: Linearly_independent","1: Main_diagonal","1: Matrix_product","1: Special_linear_group","1: Matrix_group","1: Special_orthogonal_group","1: Rotation_matrix","1: Special_unitary_group","1: Adjugate_matrix","1: Eigenvectors","1: Algebraic_multiplicity","1: Pseudo-determinant","1: Hermitian_matrix","1: Sylvester's_criterion","1: Matrix_exponential","1: Matrix_logarithm","1: Cayley-Hamilton_theorem#Illustration_for_specific_dimensions_and_practical_applications","1: Newton's_identities#Computing_coefficients","1: Mercator_series","1: Cramer's_rule","1: Singular_value_decomposition","1: Invertible_matrix","1: Polynomial","1: Derivative","1: Jacobi's_formula","1: Adjugate","1: Tangent_space","1: Lie_groups","1: Cross_product","1: Matrix_similarity","1: Similarity_invariance","1: Vector_space","1: Roger_Godement","1: Exterior_algebra","1: Vector_bundle","1: Chain_complex","1: Inverse_element","1: Unimodular_matrix","1: Group_homomorphism","1: Ring_homomorphism","1: Complex_conjugate","1: Modular_arithmetic","1: Category_theory","1: Natural_transformation","1: Algebraic_group","1: Functional_analysis","1: Fredholm_determinant","1: Trace_class_operator","1: Regular_element","1: Quasideterminant","1: Capelli_determinant","1: Manin_matrices","1: Superring","1: Graded_ring","1: Character_theory","1: Numerical_linear_algebra","1: Decomposition_method","1: Cholesky_decomposition","1: Permutation_matrix","1: Unitriangular_matrix","1: Closed_ordered_walk","1: CoppersmithâWinograd_algorithm","1: Bit_complexity","1: Bareiss_Algorithm","1: Gerolamo_Cardano","1: Gottfried_Leibniz","1: Gabriel_Cramer","1: BÃ©zout","1: Vandermonde","1: Laplace","1: Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","1: Elimination_theory","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Theory_of_numbers","1: Discriminant","1: Algebraic_form","1: Jacques_Philippe_Marie_Binet","1: Cauchy","1: Carl_Gustav_Jakob_Jacobi","1: James_Joseph_Sylvester","1: Arthur_Cayley","1: Lebesgue","1: Otto_Hesse","1: Persymmetric","1: Hermann_Hankel","1: Circulant","1: EugÃ¨ne_Charles_Catalan","1: William_Spottiswoode","1: James_Whitbread_Lee_Glaisher","1: Orthogonal_transformation","1: Elwin_Bruno_Christoffel","1: Ferdinand_Georg_Frobenius","1: Hessian_matrix","1: Trudi","1: Linear_span","1: Differential_equation","1: Analytic_function","1: Wronskian#The_Wronskian_and_linear_independence","1: Sequence","1: Orthogonal_matrix","1: Orthonormal_basis","1: Euclidean_space","1: Parallelepiped","1: Lebesgue_measure","1: Subset","1: Dimension","1: Tetrahedron","1: Skew_line","1: Spanning_tree","1: Differentiable_function","1: Jacobian_matrix","1: Jacobian_determinant","1: Integration_by_substitution","1: Open_subset","1: Inverse_function_theorem","1: Slater_determinant"]}
