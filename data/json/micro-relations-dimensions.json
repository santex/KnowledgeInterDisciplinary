The square is bounded by 1-dimensional lines, the\ncube by 2-dimensional areas, and the tesseract by 3-dimensional volumes. A\nprojection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen.\nThe same applies to the tesseract, which additionally can only be shown as a\nprojection even in three-dimensional space.]]\n\n\nIn physics and mathematics, the 'dimension' of a space or object is informally\ndefined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within\nit. [http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 Curious About\nAstronomy] [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html MathWorld:\nDimension] Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate\nis needed to specify a point on it (for example, the point at 5 on a number\nline). A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a\ndimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it\n(for example, to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its\nlatitude and its longitude). The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is\nthree-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within\nthese spaces.\n\nIn physical terms, dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space (\nvolume) and its position in time (perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-\naxis), as well as the spatial constitution of objects withinâstructures that\ncorrelate with both particle and field conceptions, interact according to\nrelative properties of massâand are fundamentally mathematical in description.\nThese, or other axes, may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or\nstructure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences.\nPhysical theories that incorporate time, such as general relativity, are said to\nwork in 4-dimensional \"spacetime\", (defined as a Minkowski space). Modern\ntheories tend to be \"higher-dimensional\" including quantum field and string\ntheories. The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional\nfunction space.\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. High-dimensional\nspaces occur in mathematics and the sciences for many reasons, frequently as\nconfiguration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are\nabstract spaces, independent of the physical space we live in.\n","linknr":481,"url":"dimensions","recorded":1362898778,"links":72,"instances":["dimension","graph_theory","geometry","data_warehouse","linear_algebra","topology","mathematics","linear_algebra","book","mathematics","mathematics","fiction","mathematics","geometry","physics","statistics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts
