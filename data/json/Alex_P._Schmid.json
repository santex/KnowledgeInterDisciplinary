In 2006 he was appointed to a Chair in\nInternational Relations at St Andrews University as well as succeeding Magnus\nRanstorp as Director of its Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political\nViolence (CSTPV). Since 2009, he is the editor of the journal \"Perspectives on\nTerrorism\".\n\nPrior to his appointment to St Andrews, Professor Schmid served as Officer-in-\nCharge of the United Nationsâ Terrorism Prevention Branch in Vienna, where, from\n1999 to 2005, he held the position of a Senior Crime Prevention and Criminal\nJustice Officer. Before joining the United Nations, he held the Synthesis Chair\non Conflict Resolution at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. He also taught\nInternational Relations at the Department of Political Sciences of Leiden\nUniversity where he acted as Research Coordinator of the Interdisciplinary\nResearch Programme on Causes of Human Rights Violations (PIOOM). 11\n\nHe was an Einstein Fellow at the Harvard Center for International Affairs,\nHarvard University, and served on the Executive Board of the International\nScientific and Professional Advisory Council (ISPAC) of the United Nations Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice Programme. Professor Schmid is a Member of the\nWorld Society of Victimology and a Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of\nArts and Sciences of the Netherlands. He also is a Member of the European\nCommissionâs Expert Group on Violent Radicalisation.\n\nThe '[[Supreme Court of India]]' adopted Alex P. Schmid's definition of\nterrorism in a 2003 ruling (Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar), \"defin[ing] acts of\nterrorism veritably as 'peacetime equivalents of war\ncrimes.'\"[http://www.sacw.net/hrights/judgementjehanabad.doc]\n\nSchmid's academic consensus definition of terrorism (1988) is widely used, e.g.\nby Jane's Intelligence\n\n'Schmid and Jongman (1988)': \"Terrorism is an anxiety-inspiring method of\nrepeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group or\nstate actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal or political reasons, whereby - in\ncontrast to assassination - the direct targets of violence are not the main\ntargets. The immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly\n(targets of opportunity) or selectively (representative or symbolic targets)\nfrom a target population, and serve as message generators. Threat- and violence-\nbased communication processes between terrorist (organization), (imperilled)\nvictims, and main targets are used to manipulate the main target (audience(s)),\nturning it into a target of terror, a target of demands, or a target of\nattention, depending on whether intimidation, coercion, or propaganda is\nprimarily sought\".

1988.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Alex_P._Schmid","recorded":1374860277,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/St_Andrews_University","/wiki/Magnus_Ranstorp","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_the_Study_of_Terrorism_and_Political_Violence&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Rotterdam","/wiki/Leiden_University","/wiki/Harvard_Center_for_International_Affairs","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India","/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism","http://www.sacw.net/hrights/judgementjehanabad.doc","/wiki/Jane%27s_Intelligence","#cite_note-UN-1","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=edit&section=1","http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/research/cstpv","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-UN_1-0","http://web.archive.org/web/20070527145632/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_definitions.html","http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_definitions.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/49309877","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&oldid=556920573","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1943_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Dutch_academics","/wiki/Category:Terrorism_theorists","/wiki/Category:Counter-terrorism_theorists","/wiki/Category:University_of_Zurich_alumni","/wiki/Category:Erasmus_University_Rotterdam_faculty","/wiki/Category:Leiden_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:Academics_of_the_University_of_St_Andrews","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_people","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alex+P.+Schmid&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alex+P.+Schmid","/wiki/Alex_P._Schmid","/wiki/Talk:Alex_P._Schmid","#","/wiki/Alex_P._Schmid","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alex_P._Schmid","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alex_P._Schmid","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&oldid=556920573","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4717592","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alex_P._Schmid&id=556920573","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alex+P.+Schmid","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alex+P.+Schmid&oldid=556920573&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alex_P._Schmid&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_P._Schmid","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4717592#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_P._Schmid","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1943
