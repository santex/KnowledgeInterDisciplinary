The word\n[[wiktionary:geyser|geyser]] comes from [[Geysir]], the name of an erupting\nspring at Haukadalur, Iceland; that name, in turn, comes from the Icelandic verb\n[[wiktionary:geysa|geysa]], \"to gush\", the verb itself from Old Norse.\n\nThe formation of geysers is due to particular hydrogeological conditions, which\nexist in only a few places on Earth, so they are a fairly rare phenomenon.\nGenerally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the\ngeyser effect is due to the proximity of magma. Generally, surface water works\nits way down to an average depth of around where it contacts hot rocks. The\nresultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot\nwater and steam spraying out of the geyser's surface vent (a hydrothermal\nexplosion).\n\nAbout a thousand known geysers exist worldwide, roughly half of which are in\nYellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States. A geyser's eruptive activity\nmay change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser\nplumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences,\nand human intervention. Bryan, T.S. 1995\n\nJet-like eruptions, often referred to as geysers, have been observed on several\nof the moons of the outer solar system. Due to the low ambient pressures, these\neruptions consist of vapor without liquid; they are made more easily visible by\nparticles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas. Water vapor jets have been\nobserved near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus, while nitrogen\neruptions have been observed on Neptune's moon Triton. There are also signs of\ncarbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars. In the latter\ntwo cases, instead of being driven by geothermal energy, the eruptions seem to\nrely on solar heating via a solid-state greenhouse effect.\n","linknr":629,"url":"Geyser","recorded":1362371973,"links":95,"instances":["optics","geology","molecule","geology","moon","hydrosphere","moon","ecology","moon","enceladus","physical_geography"],"pdf":["http://atropos.as.arizona.edu/aiz/teaching/a204/extremophile.pdf"],"categories":["Hydrothermal
