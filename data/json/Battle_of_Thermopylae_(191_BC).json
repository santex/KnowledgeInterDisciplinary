The Romans were victorious, and as a result, Antiochus was forced to flee\nGreece. It was described by Appian (included below) and by Livy at 36.16-19.\n\nAppian's account: :Antiochus marched against the Thessalians and came to\nCynoscephalae, where the Macedonians had been defeated by the Romans, and\nfinding the remains of the dead still unburied, gave them a magnificent funeral.\nThus he curried favor with the Macedonians and accused Philip before them of\nleaving unburied those who had fallen in his service.\n\n:Until now Philip had been wavering and in doubt which side he should espouse,\nbut when he heard of this he joined the Romans at once. He invited Baebius,\ntheir nearest general, to a rendezvous and gave pledges anew of faithful\nalliance against Antiochus. Baebius praised him for this, and felt emboldened to\nsend Appius Claudius straightway with 2000 foot through Macedon into Thessaly.\n\n:When Appius arrived at Tempe and from that point saw Antiochus besieging\nLarissa, he kindled a large number of fires to conceal the smallness of his\nforce. Antiochus thought that Baebius and Philip had arrived, and became\npanic-stricken, abandoned the siege on a pretext of bad weather, and\nretreated to Chalcis.\n\n:There he fell in love with a pretty girl, and, although he was above fifty\nyears of age and was supporting the burden of so great a war, he celebrated his\nnuptials with her, gave a public festival, and allowed his army to spend the\nwhole winter (191 BC) in idleness and luxury. When spring came he made a descent\nupon Acarnania, where he perceived that idleness had unfitted his army for every\nkind of duty. Then he repented of his marriage and his public festival.\nNevertheless he reduced a part of Acarnania and was besieging the rest of its\nstrongholds when he learned that the Romans were making a passage of the\nAdriatic. Then at once he returned to Chalcis.\n\n:[Â§17] The Romans crossed hastily from Brundusium to Apollonia with the forces\n:that were then ready, being 2000 horse, 20,000 foot, and a few elephants, under\n:the command of Manius Acilius Glabrio. They marched to Thessaly and relieved\n:the besieged cities. They expelled the enemy's garrisons from the towns of the\n:Athamanians and made a prisoner of that Philip of Megalopolis who was still\n:expecting the throne of Macedon. They also captured about 3,000 of the soldiers\n:of Antiochus.\n\n:While Manius was doing these things, Philip made a descent upon Athamania and\nbrought the whole of it under subjection, king Amynander fleeing to Ambracia.\n\n:When Antiochus learned these facts, he was terrified by the rush of events and\nby the suddenness of the change of fortune, and he now perceived the wisdom of\nHannibal's advice. He sent messenger after messenger to Asia to hasten the\ncoming of Polyxenidas. Then from all sides he drew in what forces he had. These\namounted to 10,000 foot and 500 horse of his own, besides some allies, with\nwhich he occupied Thermopylae in order to put this difficult pass between\nhimself and the enemy while waiting for the arrival of his army from Asia.\n\n:The passage at Thermopylae is long and narrow, flanked on the one side by a\nrough and inhospitable sea and on the other by a deep and impassable morass. It\nis overhung by two mountain peaks, one called Tichius and the other Callidromus.\nThe place also contains some hot springs, whence comes the name Thermopylae,\n\"hot gates\".\n\n:[Â§18] There Antiochus built a double wall on which he placed engines. He sent\n:Aetolian troops to occupy the summits of the mountains to prevent anybody from\n:coming around secretly by way of the hill called Atropos, as Xerxes had come\n:upon the Spartans under Leonidas, the mountain paths at that time being\n:unguarded. One thousand Aetolians occupied each mountain. The remainder\n:encamped by themselves near the city of Heraclea.\n\n:When Manius saw the enemy's preparations he gave the signal for battle on\nthe morrow and ordered two of his tribunes, Marcus Cato and Lucius Valerius,\nto select such forces as they pleased and to go around the mountains by night\nand drive the Aetolians from the heights as best they could. Lucius was\nrepulsed from Mount Tichius by the Aetolians, who at that place fought well,\nbut Cato, who moved against Mount Callidromus, fell upon the enemy while they\nwere still asleep, about the last watch. Nevertheless there was a stiff fight\nhere, as he was obliged to climb over high rocks and precipices in the face\nof an opposing enemy.\n\n:Meantime Manius was leading his army against Antiochus' front in straight\nlines, as this was the only way possible in the narrow pass. The king placed his\nlight-armed troops and peltasts in front of the phalanx, and drew up the phalanx\nitself in front of the camp, with the archers and slingers on the right hand\nnext to the foot-hills, and the elephants, with the guard that always\naccompanied them, on the left near the sea.\n\n:[Â§19] Battle being joined, the light-armed troops assailed Manius first,\n:rushing in from all sides. He received their onset bravely, first yielding and\n:then advancing and driving them back. The phalanx opened and let the light-\n:armed men pass through. It then closed and pushed forward, the long pikes set\n:densely together in order of battle, with which the Macedonians from the time\n:of Alexander and Philip have struck terror into enemies who have not dared to\n:encounter the thick array of long pikes presented to them.\n\n:At this juncture the Aetolians were seen fleeing from Callidromus with loud\ncries, and leaping down into the camp of Antiochus. At first neither side knew\nwhat had happened, and there was confusion among both in their uncertainty but\nwhen Cato made his appearance pursuing the Aetolians with shouts of victory and\nwas already close above the camp of Antiochus, the king's forces, who had been\nhearing for some time back fearful accounts of the Roman style of fighting, and\nwho knew that they themselves had been enervated by idleness and luxury all\nwinter, took fright.\n\n:Not knowing how large Cato's force was, it was magnified to their minds by\nterror. Fearing for the safety of their camp they fled to it in disorder, with\nthe intention of defending it against the enemy. But the Romans were close at\ntheir heels and entered the camp with them. Then there was another flight of the\nAntiocheans as disorderly as the first. Manius pursued them as far as Scarphia,\nkilling and taking prisoners. Returning thence he plundered the king's camp, and\nby merely showing himself drove out the Aetolians who had broken into the Roman\ncamp during his absence.\n\n:[Â§20] The Romans lost about 200 in the battle and the pursuit; Antiochus about\n:10,000, including prisoners. The king himself, at the first sign of defeat,\n:fled precipitately with 500 horse as far as Elateia, and from Elateia to\n:Chalcis, and thence to Ephesus with his bride Euboea, as he called her, with\n:his ships; but not all of them, for the Roman admiral made an attack upon some\n:that were bringing supplies, and sunk them.\n\n:When the people of Rome heard of this victory, so swiftly and easily gained,\nthey offered sacrifice, being satisfied with their first trial of the formidable\nreputation of Antiochus. To Philip, in return for his services as an ally, they\nsent his son Demetrius, who was still a hostage in their hands.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","recorded":1375083647,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Thermopylae","/wiki/Roman_Republic","/wiki/Seleucid_Empire","/wiki/Manius_Acilius_Glabrio_(consul_191_BC)","/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great","/wiki/Template:Campaignbox_Roman%E2%80%93Syrian_War","/wiki/Template_talk:Campaignbox_Roman%E2%80%93Syrian_War","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Campaignbox_Roman%E2%80%93Syrian_War&action=edit","/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Syrian_War","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eurymedon_(190_BC)","/wiki/Battle_of_Myonessus","/wiki/Battle_of_Magnesia","/wiki/Roman_Republic","/wiki/Manius_Acilius_Glabrio_(consul_191_BC)","/wiki/Seleucid","/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Livy","/wiki/Appian","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)#endnote_appian","/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great","/wiki/Battle_of_Cynoscephalae","/wiki/Philip_V_of_Macedon","/wiki/Appius_Claudius_Pulcher_(consul_185_BC)","/wiki/Macedon","/wiki/Thessaly","/wiki/Vale_of_Tempe","/wiki/Larissa","/wiki/Chalcis","/wiki/Acarnania","/wiki/Brindisi","/wiki/Apollonia,_Illyria","/wiki/Manius_Acilius_Glabrio_(consul_191_BC)","/wiki/Athamanians","/wiki/Hannibal","/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae","/wiki/Trachis","/wiki/Cato_the_Elder","/wiki/Elateia","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=edit&section=1","#ref_appian","http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_00.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&oldid=546705675","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:191_BC","/wiki/Category:Battles_involving_the_Roman_Republic","/wiki/Category:Battles_involving_the_Seleucid_Empire","/wiki/Category:Battles_of_the_Hellenistic_era","/wiki/Category:History_of_Phthiotis","/wiki/Category:Roman%E2%80%93Syrian_War","/wiki/Category:Greece_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_coordinates","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Battle+of+Thermopylae+%28191+BC%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Battle+of+Thermopylae+%28191+BC%29","/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","#","/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&oldid=546705675","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q783058","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Battle_of_Thermopylae_%28191_BC%29&id=546705675","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Battle+of+Thermopylae+%28191+BC%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Battle+of+Thermopylae+%28191+BC%29&oldid=546705675&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Thermopylae_(191_BC)&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8_%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5_(191_%D0%BF%D1%80.%D0%BD.%D0%B5.)","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalla_de_les_Term%C3%B2piles_(191_aC)","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlacht_bei_den_Thermopylen_(R%C3%B6m
