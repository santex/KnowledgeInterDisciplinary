Couplings do not normally allow disconnection\nof shafts during operation, however there are torque limiting couplings which\ncan slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded.\n\nThe primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment\nwhile permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. By careful\nselection, installation and maintenance of couplings, substantial savings can be\nmade in reduced maintenance costs and downtime.\n","title":"coupling","headings":["Uses","Types","Requirements of good shaft alignment / good coupling setup","Coupling maintenance and failure","Checking the coupling balance","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Torque","1: Torque_limiter","1: Acetal","1: Maraging_steel","1: Titanium","1: Encoder","1: Robotics","1: Constant-velocity_joint#Rzeppa_joints","1: Constant-velocity_joint#Double_Cardan","1: Thompson_coupling","1: Gear_ratio","1: Gear","1: Angular_displacement","1: Rotating_spline","1: Universal_joint","1: Torque_density","1: Vibration","1: Flexible_coupling","1: Tongue_and_groove","1: Ireland","1: Paddle_steamer","1: Steering","1: Drive_train","1: Giubo","1: Jaw_coupling","1: Geislinger_coupling","1: Clutch","1: Railway_coupling","1: Yutaka_Nishiyama"]}
