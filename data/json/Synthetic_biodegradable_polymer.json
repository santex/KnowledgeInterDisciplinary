Degradation is important in biomedicine for many reasons.\nDegradation of the polymeric implant means surgical intervention may not be\nrequired in order to remove the implant at the end of its functional life,\neliminating the need for a second surgery. In tissue engineering,\nbiodegradable polymers can be designed such to approximate tissues, providing a\npolymer scaffold that can withstand mechanical stresses, provide a suitable\nsurface for cell attachment and growth, and degrade at a rate that allows the\nload to be transferred to the new tissue. In the field of\ncontrolled drug delivery, biodegradable polymers offer tremendous potential\neither as a drug delivery system alone or in conjunction to functioning as a\nmedical device.
