A\nloanword from the Japanese , umami can be translated \"pleasant savory\ntaste\". This particular writing was chosen by Professor Kikunae Ikeda\nfrom umai (ãã¾ã) \"delicious\" and mi (å³) \"taste\". The kanji æ¨å³ are used for a more\ngeneral meaning to describe a food as delicious.\n\nThe human tongue has receptors for L-glutamate, which is the source of umami\nflavor. For that reason, scientists consider umami to be distinct from\nsaltiness.
