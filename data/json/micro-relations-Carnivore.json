Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their\nnutrient requirements are considered carnivores while those that also consume\nnon-animal food are considered carnivores. Omnivores also\nconsume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general\ndefinition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that\nwould distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore.
