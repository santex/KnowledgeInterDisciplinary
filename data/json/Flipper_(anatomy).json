{"cursor":"1460","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n is in fact a very effective flipper.]] , Hawaii.|alt=Photo of turtle swimming\n towards surface with diver in background]] A 'flipper' is a typically flat\n forelimb evolved for movement through water. Various creatures have evolved\n flippers, for example penguins (also called \"wings\"), cetaceans (e.g. dolphins\n and whales; usually called \"fins\"), pinnipeds, and reptiles such as some\n varieties of turtle and the now-extinct plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs,\n and metriorhynchids.\n\nSome flippers are very efficient hydrofoils, analogous to wings (airfoils), used\nto propel and maneuver through the water with great speed and maneuverability\n(see Foil (fluid mechanics)). Some flippers are less foiled, with the appendages\nstill apparent, as in the webbed forefeet seen in amphibious turtles.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Flipper_(anatomy)","recorded":1362483439,"links":48,"instances":["fluid_mechanics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal anatomy","Biological evolution"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Schwimmender-Pinguin.jpg/220px-Schwimmender-Pinguin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Chelonia_mydas_is_going_for_the_air.jpg/220px-Chelonia_mydas_is_going_for_the_air.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Crossopterygii_fins_tetrapod_legs.JPG/140px-Crossopterygii_fins_tetrapod_legs.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Gray188.png/32px-Gray188.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["foil","fluid_mechanics"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["foil","homology"],"related":["Hawaii","Forelimb","Penguin","Wing","Cetacean","Dolphins","Whales","Fins","Pinniped","Reptiles","Turtle","Plesiosaur","Mosasaur","Ichthyosaur","Metriorhynchid","Hydrofoils","Wing","Airfoils","Foil_(fluid_mechanics)","Homology_(biology)"]}
