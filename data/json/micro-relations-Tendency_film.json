{"cursor":"1322","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A is a name given to the socially conscious, left-leaning films produced in\nJapan during the 1920s and 1930s. These were in general produced by the\ncommercial studios, in contrast to the politically radical independent films of\nthe Proletarian Film League of Japan. However, with the rise of Japanese\nmilitarism in the 1930s, tendency films (as well as any works that were not\nactively supportive of the war effort in China and the Pacific) were frowned\nupon or outright censored.\n\nDaisuke ItÅ's [[jidaigeki]] include some well known tendency films, such as\n1929's Man-Slashing, Horse-Piercing Sword. Tomu Uchida's A Living Puppet and\nKenji Mizoguchi's Metropolitan Symphony (both 1929) were also tendency films,\nand Shigeyoshi Suzuki's tendency film [[What Made Her Do It?]] was one of the\nbig hits of 1930.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Tendency_film","recorded":1362675117,"links":19,"instances":["film_director"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cinema of Japan","Film genres","Japanese words and phrases"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Japan_film_icon.svg/50px-Japan_film_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Video-x-generic.svg/30px-Video-x-generic.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg/30px-Flag_of_Japan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Hourglass_drawing.svg/23px-Hourglass_drawing.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["daisuke_itō","film_director"],["shigeyoshi_suzuki　(film_director"]],"members":["daisuke_itō"],"related":["Proletarian_Film_League_of_Japan","Daisuke_Itō_(film_director)","Tomu_Uchida","Kenji_Mizoguchi","Shigeyoshi_Suzuki　(film_director)"]}
