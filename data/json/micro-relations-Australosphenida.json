Today, living specimens exist\nonly in Australia and New Guinea with only five surviving species, but fossils\nhave been found in Madagascar and Argentina. The surviving species consist of\nthe platypus and 4 species of echidna.\n\nThis grouping includes the following animals:\n\n*Monotremata, divided into families Kollikodontidaeâ , Ornithorhynchidae\n(platypus), Steropodontidaeâ  and Tachyglossidae (echidnas) and the genus\n[[Kryoryctes]]; *Ausktribosphenidaâ , including the genera [[Ambondro\n(genus)|Ambondro]], [[Asfaltomylos]], [[Ausktribosphenos]], [[Bishops\n(genus)|Bishops]], and [[Henosferus]] from the Middle Jurassic to Lower\nCretaceous of Argentina, Madagascar and Australia. 'â ' denotes an extinct taxon.\n\nThe clade Australosphenida was proposed by Luo et al. (2001, 2002) and was\ninitially left unranked, as the authors do not apply the Linnaean hierarchy. In\nBenton (2005) it is ranked as a 'superdivision', i.e. one or two levels below\nthe infraclass.\n\nThe grouping embodies a hypothesis about the evolution of molar teeth in\nmammals. Living monotremes are toothless as adults, but the juvenile platypus,\nfossil monotremes and Ausktribosphenida all share a pattern of three molar cusps\narranged in a triangle or V shape, which is known as the tribosphenic type of\nmolar. Tribosphenic molars have long been held to characterize the subclass\nTheria (marsupials, placentals and their extinct relatives) while monotremes\nwere thought to be related to fossil groups with a linear alignment of cusps:\nmorganucodontids, docodonts, triconodonts and multituberculates, all of which\nwere united with the monotremes into the 'subclass Prototheria'. Defined in this\nway, the 'Prototheria' is no longer recognised as a valid clade, since the\nlinear cusp pattern is a primitive condition within Mammalia and cannot supply\nthe shared derived character which is required to establish a subgroup. Instead,\nthe available evidence suggests that the monotremes descend from a Mesozoic\nradiation of tribosphenic mammals in the southern continents (hence the name\nAustralosphenida, meaning 'southern wedges'), but this interpretation is highly\ncontroversial.\n\nAccording to Luo et al., tribosphenic molars were evolved by the\nAustralosphenida independently of the true Tribosphenida, or Boreosphenida (that\nis, the therians and their relatives) in the northern continents. Others contend\nthat the Ausktribosphenida in fact belong to the placentals and were therefore\ntrue tribosphenids, but unrelated to the ancestry of the monotremes. Benton\n2005: 300, 306-308. If this were confirmed, it would entail abandoning the\nclade Australosphenida.\n","linknr":208,"url":"Australosphenida","recorded":1362584823,"links":26,"instances":["tooth","biology","dentistry"],"pdf":["http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app47/app47-001.pdf","http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app47/app47-001.pdf"],"categories":["Australosphenida|","Mammals"],"headings":["Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Ameisenigel.jpg/200px-Ameisenigel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["order","biology"],["molar","tooth"],["cusp","dentistry"]],"members":["molar","order","cusp"],"related":["Middle_Jurassic","Holocene","Short-beaked_Echidna","Order_(biology)","Ausktribosphenida","Monotremata","Clade","Australia","New_Guinea","Madagascar","Argentina","Platypus","Echidna","Monotremata","Kollikodontidae","Ornithorhynchidae","Steropodontidae","Tachyglossidae","Ausktribosphenida","Genus","Jurassic","Cretaceous","Extinct","Taxon","Linnaean_taxonomy","Infraclass","Molar_(tooth)","Cusp_(dentistry)","Tribosphenic","Theria","Marsupial","Placental","Morganucodon","Docodont","Triconodont","Multituberculate","Prototheria","Mesozoic","Tribosphenida","Boreosphenida"]}
