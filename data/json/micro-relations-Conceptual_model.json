Some models are physical objects, for instance, a toy model which may be\nassembled, and may even be made to work like the object it represents. Whereas,\na 'conceptual model' is a model that exists only in the mind. Conceptual models\nare used to help us know and understand the subject matter they represent.\n\nThe term conceptual model may be used to refer to models which are formed after\na conceptualization process in the mind. Conceptual models represent human\nintentions or semantics. Conceptualization from observation of physical\nexistence and conceptual modeling are the necessary means human employ to think\nand solve problems. Concepts are used to convey semantics during various natural\nlanguages based communication. Since that a concept might map to multiple\nsemantics by itself, an explicit formalization is usually required for\nidentifying and locating the intended semantic from several candidates to avoid\nmisunderstandings and confusions in conceptual models.
