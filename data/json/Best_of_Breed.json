{"cursor":"4414","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Best of Breed' is the title given to the dog who has been judged the best\nrepresentative specimen of its breed at a conformation show.\n\nDogs compete in a hierarchical fashion at each show, where winners at lower\nlevels are gradually combined to narrow the winners until the final round, where\nBest in Show is chosen.\n\nEach breed is divided into classes based on sex and age. Dogs (males) are judged\nfirst, in their age classes. Within one breed, there are puppies (dogs under a\ncertain age), mature male dogs (subdivided by age into junior, limit (or\nintermediate) and open); bitches (female dogs) have corresponding classes. At\nsome events, usually single-breed or novelty shows, there may be a baby puppy\nclass (typically under three months old) which is usually contested after the\nadult classes as a ploy to keep spectators interested. Baby puppies are not\neligible for Best of Breed and are judged largely on their âcutenessâ factor, as\nyoung puppies from many breeds look very much alike and their conformation to\ntheir breed's Standard is most likely not yet evident.\n\nThe winners of all classes in each sex compete for Challenge (best) Dog and\nChallenge Bitch; the individuals who will challenge each other for the accolade\nBest of Breed. The remaining class winners are joined by the runner-up from the\nclass from which the challenge winner was selected and there are competitions\nfor second place in each gender, called Reserve Challenge Dog and Reserve\nChallenge Bitch. This is for fairness, as one class may contain a stronger\nfield of specimens of the breed. If the judge believes that this is the case,\nthe Challenge Dog and Reserve Challenge Dog, for example, may both be from the\nsame class.\n\nFrom the two finalists (Challenge Dog and Challenge Bitch) is selected Best of\nBreed. The runner-up is deemed Best of Opposite Sex. There is then a run-off in\nwhich the second best individual in the gender of the winner (the Reserve\nChallenge from the same gender as the BOB) is brought back to stand against the\nBest of Opposite Sex (the Challenge who did not win) for the title of Runner-up\nto Best of Breed. So, if for example the Best of Breed is the Challenge Bitch,\nthe Runner-up to Best of Breed may be the Challenge Dog or the Reserve Challenge\nBitch if, in the judgeâs opinion, the competing bitches were superior to the\ncompeting dogs.\n\nIn some breeds, the males and females of the breed have decidedly different\nappearances, and it is often the males who have the quintessential look of the\nbreed (females may be smaller, have less 'coat' and feminine or less pronounced\nfeatures. The judge must set personal preference aside and decide objectively\nwhether the bitch is a better example of the female of the breed than the dog is\nan example of the male.\n\nIn multi-breed and all-breed shows, the winners of all breeds within the kennel\nclub's breed groups then compete for [[General Specials]]. So, for example, all\nthe Terrier Group breed winners compete to determine Best Terrier (sometimes\ncalled Best in Group). The group winners (in some countries nicknamed \"[[The\nMagnificent Seven]]\") go on to compete for Best in Show. In large shows, there\nare so many competitors that General Specials must be held on a different day,\nfor which the Best of Breed winners must return.\n\nThe value of titled dogs and their progeny increases greatly with the attainment\nof a title. Because of the subjective nature of judging and the politics\ninvolved in any judged competition, some breeders feel that it is next to\nimpossible for dogs in their chosen breed to win Best in Group or Best in Show.\nFor these reasons, Best of Breed is the often the most highly-coveted title\namong fanciers.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Best_of_Breed","recorded":1375059590,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging","/wiki/Conformation_show","/wiki/Talk:Conformation_show","/wiki/Title_(animal)","/wiki/Dog","/wiki/Dog_breed","/wiki/Conformation_show","/wiki/Hierarchy","/wiki/Conformation_show","/wiki/Novelty_show","/wiki/Breed_standard","/wiki/Coat_(dog)","/wiki/List_of_dog_breeds","/wiki/Kennel_club","/wiki/Breed_Groups_(dog)","/wiki/General_Specials","/wiki/Terrier_Group","/wiki/Terrier","/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Buzzword","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Breed_registry","/wiki/Breed_Groups_(dog)","/wiki/Crufts","/wiki/Dog_breeding","/wiki/Selective_breeding","/wiki/Westminster_Dog_Show","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&oldid=542570043","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dog_shows_and_showing","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_merged_from_January_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_to_be_merged","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Best+of+Breed&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Best+of+Breed","/wiki/Best_of_Breed","/wiki/Talk:Best_of_Breed","#","/wiki/Best_of_Breed","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Best_of_Breed","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Best_of_Breed","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&oldid=542570043","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4175823","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Best_of_Breed&id=542570043","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Best+of+Breed","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Best+of+Breed&oldid=542570043&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Best_of_Breed&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOB","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwyci%C4%99zca_Rasy","//sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOB","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4175823#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_Breed","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["dog","dog","animal"],"
