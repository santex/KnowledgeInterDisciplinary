GNOME Terminal 3, Fedora 15]] session, taken on an old release of\nGentoo Linux.]] 's CommandShell in A/UX 3.0.1.]]\n 1., running under Windows Vista]]\n\nA 'command-line interface' ('CLI') is a means of interaction with a computer\nprogram where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of\nsuccessive lines of text (command lines).\n\nThe CLI was the primary means of human interaction with most early operating\nsystems, including MS-DOS, CP/M, Unix, and Apple DOS. The interface is usually\nimplemented with a command line shell, which is a program that accepts commands\nas text input and converts commands to appropriate operating system functions.\n\nDue to its text-based nature, a command-line interface is sometimes confused\nwith the text-based user interface, a kind of user interface which uses only\ntext, but not necessarily presented in successive lines. Text may be formatted\nand appear in fixed locations on a computer terminal display, as opposed to only\nappearing in successive lines.\n\nCommand-line interfaces to computer operating systems are less widely used by\ncasual computer users, who favor graphical user interfaces.\n\nCommand-line interfaces are often preferred by more advanced computer users, as\nthey often provide a more concise and powerful means to control a program or\noperating system.\n\nPrograms with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via\nscripting.\n\nAlternatives to the command line include, but are not limited to menus (see IBM\nAIX SMIT for example) and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer\n(usually controlled with a mouse).\n","linknr":577,"url":"Command_line","recorded":1362552217,"links":59,"instances":["programming_language","programming","company","computing","computer_interface","operating_system","file_systems","video_game","unix_shell","mac_os_x","computing","computing","program","unix","computing","computing","command_line_interpreter","editor","computer_programming","unix","programming_language","operating_system","programming_language","computing","programming_language","variable","computer_science","computer_science","computing","programming_language","graphical_user_interfaces","programming","command"],"pdf":[],"categories":["User
