{"cursor":"4972","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe term 'Bioconversion', also known as biotransformation refers to the use of\nlive organisms often microorganisms to carry out a chemical reaction that is\nmore costly or not feasible nonbiologically. These organisms convert a substance\nto a chemically modified form. An example is the industrial production of\ncortisone. One step is the bioconversion of Progesterone to 11-alpha-\nHydroxyprogesterone by [[Rhizopus nigricans]].\n\nAnother example of this is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or\nanimal waste, into usable products or energy sources by biological processes or\nagents, such as certain microorganisms, some Detritivores or enzymes.\n\nThe conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable\nproducts or energy sources by biological processes or agents, such as certain\nmicroorganisms. (david)\n\nThe Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&D\nfor the Department of Energy's (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing,\nespecially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical\nengineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is\ninvestigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial\nenzymes in bioenergy research. (david)\n\nNew cellulosic ethanol conversion processes have enabled the variety and\nvolume of feedstock that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now\nincludes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-\nfluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, municipal solid waste (MSW),\nsludge, sewage, etc.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Bioconversion","recorded":1362503270,"links":15,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.bioconversion.it/1/upload/bioconversion_presentazione_web.pdf"],"categories":["Biodegradable waste management","Chemical processes","Environmental chemistry","Fermentation","Bioenergy","Sustainable technologies"],"headings":["Three different processes for bioconversion","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conversion","chemistry"]],"members":["conversion"],"related":["Cortisone","Progesterone","Conversion_(chemistry)","Organic_material","Energy_source","Microorganism","Detritivore","Enzyme","Cellulosic_ethanol","Feedstock","Municipal_solid_waste","Sludge","Sewage","Gasified","Syngas","Syngas","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Hydrogen"]}
