{"cursor":"11496","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n on 22 January 1879]] The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 23 members of\n the British Armed Forces and colonial forces for actions performed during the\n Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for\n valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of the armed forces of some\n Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. The VC was\n introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts\n of valour during the Crimean War, and takes precedence over all other orders,\n decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any\n service and to civilians under military command. The first ceremony was held on\n 26 June 1857, when Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in\n Hyde Park. Ashcroft, Michael; preface; XI–XIII\n\nThe Anglo-Zulu War (also known as the Zulu War) was fought in 1879 between the\nBritish Empire and the Zulu Kingdom (Zululand; part of modern KwaZulu-Natal,\nSouth Africa). Although British and colonial forces under General Lord\nChelmsford entered Zululand unopposed, on 11 January 1879, the Zulu army soon\ninflicted a heavy defeat on them at the Battle of Isandlwana, in which more than\n1,300 British and colonial forces were killed. Immediately after the battle,\nZulu troops moved onto the small garrison at Rorke's Drift. Here, just over 150\nBritish and colonial soldiers defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors.\nThe action was later made famous by the film [[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]. The\ndefence of Rorke's Drift is considered by historians as a masterly defensive\naction and an example of heroism against overwhelming numbers. Eleven VC\nrecipients received their awards for deeds performed during the defence of the\nsmall garrison â one of the largest number awarded for a single action, and the\nlargest number (7) awarded to a single unit (the 2nd/24th Foot) for a single\naction. The severe losses at Isandlwana resulted in Lord Chelmsford having to\nabandon his initial invasion plan and to request significant reinforcements\nbefore another could be attempted. After these reinforcements arrived, a second\ninvasion was launched in May. The second invasion culminated in the defeat of\nthe Zulu army at the Battle of Ulundi, on 4 July 1879. The war saw the end of\nthe Zulu nation's independence as it became a protectorate of the British.\n\nUnder the original Royal Warrant, the VC could not be awarded posthumously.\nBetween 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the [[London Gazette]]\nregarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a\npartial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted\nthe VC, but not \"officially\" awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy\nwas completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six\nofficers and men; Nevill Coghill and Teignmouth Melvill were two of the soldiers\nwho were decorated thus. The Victoria Cross warrant was not\nofficially amended to include posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of\nall awards for the First World War were posthumous.
