He started his public career as Vice President of the\nHyderabad Municipality. Hidayatullah was also the first Non-official\nPresident of the Hyderabad District Board. In 1921 he became a Member of the\nBombay Legislative Council.\n\nIn the same year, he was appointed a Minister in the Bombay Government, an\noffice which he occupied till 1928 when he was made a Member of the Executive\ncouncil of the Governor of Bombay. He served in this capacity til11934.\n\nAs a Minister, Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah was associated with the famous\n'Sukkur Barrage project' which contributed so much to the prosperity of Sindh in\nlater years. He was awarded the titles of 'Khan Bahadur', 'Knight' and 'The\nK.C.S.I.' but renounced all his titles when the Muslim League in 1946 decided on\na policy of renunciation of titles conferred by the British Government.\n\nGhulam Hussain Hidayatullah, along with Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ayub Khuhro, Syed\nMiran Shah and Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, represented Sindh in the Round Table\nConferences in London.\n\nThey convinced the Chairman of the 'Committee on Sindh' that Sindh was not to be\na deficit province and had sufficient revenue and administrative capability to\nbe a full fledged province. Sindh was separated from Bombay and its first\nassembly came into being in 1937.\n\nAfter the separation of Sindh from Bombay Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah became\nthe first Chief Minister and remained so until 1947 with two short breaks when\nAllah Bux Soomro and Mir Bande Ali Talpur had formed their Governments. Sir\nGhulam Hussain became the Chief Minister of Sindh three times.\n\nIn 1938, the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution demanding a separate homeland\nfor the Muslims of India. In 1943, the Sindh Government became the first\nProvincial Assembly of the sub-continent to pass an official resolution in\nfavour of the creation of Pakistan.\n\nAfter independence Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah earned the unique\ndistinction of being the only Pakistani Governor of a Province in Pakistan as\nall other Governors were British. This shows the faith and trust the Quaid-e-\nAzam laid in him.\n\nWithin a month of the passing away of the Quaid-e-Azam, Sir Ghulam\nHussain Hidayatullah the \"Grand Old Man of Sindh\" died in Karachi on the\nOctober 4,
