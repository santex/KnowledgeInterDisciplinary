{"cursor":"5277","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn baseball, there are two legal pitching positions: the windup, and 'the set'.\nColloquially, the set is often referred to as \"the stretch\", although this term\nactually only refers to one part of the pitching motion when pitching from the\nset.\n\nEach type of pitching position has its strengths and weaknesses. Compared to the\nset, the windup takes a relatively slower execution, so therefore is better\nsuited for situations in which there are no baserunners, or when the lead runner\nis on third base, since it is difficult to steal home plate. Conversely, a pitch\nfrom the set, having a relatively faster execution, is preferred when there are\nbaserunners. Faster execution is important to prevent stolen bases. A pitcher\nmay also use other techniques to prevent stealing; these are ways of holding the\nrunner on and include the pickoff, the pitchout and the slide step.\n\nHowever, some pitchers, particularly relief pitchers, are more comfortable\npitching from the set position, and thus use it regardless of the situation.\n\n, closer for the New York Yankees, having come set]] A pitcher is in 'the\nwindup' when, with the ball, the pitcher stands on or directly in front of the\npitching rubber, located at the top of the mound, with his feet pointing toward\nhome plate. Prior to throwing a pitch, the pitcher has the option of taking one\nstep back toward second base or to either side, using his free leg (left leg for\na right-handed pitcher). During the delivery of the pitch, the pitcher must take\none step forward, in the direction of home plate. Alternatively, the pitcher may\nstep off the rubber with his pivot foot (the right foot, for right-handed\npitchers) or step toward and throw or feign a throw to a base, subject to the\nbalk rules. In the windup, the time of pitch is the instant when one of the\nfollowing occurs: the pitcher commits to taking a step backward, or he takes a\nstep to the side, or brings his hands together.\n\n of the Cincinnati Reds, pitching from the set, just before the time of pitch]]\n A pitcher is in 'the set' when, with the ball, he stands on, or directly in\n front ofâand touchingâthe pitching rubber, with his toes pointing toward the\n side (toward third base for a right-handed pitcher) and his arms apart at his\n sides. This initial part of the set is called 'the stretch', because the\n pitcher usually stretches toward home plate to take signs from the catcher. At\n this point, the pitcher may make any number of preparatory movements necessary\n for delivering the pitch. Delivery begins when the pitcher brings his arms\n together in front of his body (a movement punctuated with a discernible pause).\n This is called coming set. After coming set, the pitcher takes a step toward\n home and delivers the pitch. Typically, pitchers from the set use a high leg\n kick, thus lunging toward home in pitching; a pitcher may instead release the\n ball more quickly by using the slide step, quickly stepping directly and\n immediately toward home and pitching. In the set position, the time of pitch is\n that instant when the pitcher makes a move toward home plate after coming set.\n\nAs with the windup, prior to the time of pitch, the pitcher may step toward and\nthrow or feign a throw to a base, subject to the balk rules, or disengage the\nrubber by stepping back (toward second base) with his pivot foot.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Pitching_position","recorded":1374863157,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/The_Set_(film)","/wiki/List_of_poker_hands#Three_of_a_kind","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Pickoff","/wiki/Pitchout","/wiki/File:Rivera2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Rivera2.jpg/200px-Rivera2.jpg","/wiki/File:Rivera2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mariano_Rivera","/wiki/Closer_(baseball)","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Baseball_field#Pitcher.27s_mound","/wiki/Pitchers_mound","/wiki/Home_plate","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","/wiki/Second_base","/wiki/Home_plate","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Time_of_pitch","/wiki/File:Reds_haynes.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Reds_haynes.jpg","/wiki/File:Reds_haynes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Jimmy_Haynes","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Third_base","/wiki/Balk","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.thecompletepitcher.com/pitching_mechanics.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/3260/rockies-jimenez-among-many-farm-gems","#cite_ref-3","http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/does-the-stretch-cost-a-pitcher-fastball-speed/","#cite_ref-4","http://ajs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/137.abstract","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0363546507308938","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&oldid=532367107","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baseball_rules","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pitching+position&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pitching+position","/wiki/Pitching_position","/wiki/Talk:Pitching_position","#","/wiki/Pitching_position","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pitching_position","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Pitching_position","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&oldid=532367107","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7198893","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Pitching_position&id=532367107","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Pitching+position","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Pitching+position&oldid=532367107&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Pitching_position&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7198893#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitching_position","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png",
