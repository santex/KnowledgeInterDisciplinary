{"cursor":"9993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'stock market bubble' is a type of economic bubble taking place in stock\nmarkets when market participants drive stock prices above their value in\nrelation to some system of stock valuation.\n\nBehavioral finance theory attributes stock market bubbles to cognitive biases\nthat lead to groupthink and herd behavior. Bubbles occur not only in real-world\nmarkets, with their inherent uncertainty and noise, but also in highly\npredictable experimental markets. In the laboratory,\nuncertainty is eliminated and calculating the expected returns should be a\nsimple mathematical exercise, because participants are endowed with assets that\nare defined to have a finite lifespan and a known probability distribution of\ndividends. Other theoretical explanations of stock market bubbles have suggested\nthat they are rational, intrinsic, and contagious.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Stock_market_boom","recorded":1362484695,"links":22,"instances":["finance","economist","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stock market","Economic bubbles","Market trends","Economic problems","Behavioral finance","Behavioral and social facets of systemic risk"],"headings":["Examples","Whether rational or irrational","Positive feedback","Effect of incentives","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nasdaq_Composite_dot-com_bubble.svg/220px-Nasdaq_Composite_dot-com_bubble.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Nikkei_225%281970-%29.svg/220px-Nikkei_225%281970-%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","finance"],["diversification","finance"],["john_law","economist"]],"members":["volatility","john_law","diversification"],"related":["Economic_bubble","Stock_market","Stock","Stock_valuation","Behavioral_finance","Cognitive_biases","Groupthink","Herd_behavior","Mississippi_Company","South_Sea_Company","Charles_Mackay","Dot-com_bubble","Great_Depression","Dot-com_bubble","Radio","Automobiles","Aviation","Electrical_power_grid","Encilhamento","Nifty_Fifty","Economy_of_Taiwan","Initial_Public_Offerings","Behavioral_finance","New_economy","Greater_fool_theory","Rational_expectations","Vernon_L._Smith","Positive_feedback","Volatility_(finance)","Negative_feedback","Disequilibrium","Mutual_fund","Business_cycle","Collective_behavior","Diversification_(finance)","Dot-com_bubble","Fictitious_capital","Irrational_exuberance","Market_trend","Modeling_and_analysis_of_financial_markets","Stock_market_crash","Mississippi_Company","Poseidon_bubble","Railway_Mania","South_Sea_Company","Tulip_mania","South_Sea_Bubble","John_Law_(economist)","Mississippi_Company","Charles_Mackay","Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds"]}
