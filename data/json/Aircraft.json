{"cursor":"33977","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, the world's largest passenger airliner]]\n\nAn 'aircraft' is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air,\nor, in general, the atmosphere of a planet. It\ncounters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the\ndynamic lift of an airfoil, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft\ndictionary.com definition of aircraft] or in a few cases the downward\nthrust from jet engines.\n\nThe human activity that surrounds aircraft is called [[aviation]]. Crewed\naircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be\nremotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may\nbe classified by different criteria, such as lift type, propulsion, usage,\nand others.\n","linknr":937,"url":"Aircraft","recorded":1362482177,"links":125,"instances":["aircraft","air_rescue","sailing","aircraft","aircraft","aircraft","aeronautics","force","aircraft","physics","physics","aeronautics","flight","sailplane","aircraft"],"pdf":["http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf"],"categories":["Aircraft|"],"headings":["History","Methods
