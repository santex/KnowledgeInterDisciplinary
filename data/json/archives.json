Professional\narchivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have\nbeen naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal,\ncommercial, administrative or social activities. They have been metaphorically\ndefined as \"the secretions of an organism\"<ref></ref>â€”rather than those that\nhave been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to\nposterity. <!--removed from another section where it was irrelevant; may wish to\nbe incorporated: The word archive can refer to any organised body of records\nfixed on media. The management of archives is essential for effective day-to-day\norganisational decision making, and even for the survival of organisations.-->\n\nIn general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or\nlong-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or\nevidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always\nunique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This\nmeans that archives (the places) are quite distinct from libraries with regard\nto their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be\nfound within library buildings.<ref></ref>\n\nA person who works in archives is called an archivist. The study and practice of\norganizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in\narchives is called archival science. The physical place of storage is sometimes\nreferred to as an 'archive repository'.\n\nWhen referring to historical records or the places they are kept, the plural\nform archives is chiefly used.<ref>\"archive\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd\ned. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> The computing use of the\nterm 'archive' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the\nterm. When records and archiving professionals use the term 'archive' they are\nreferring to the permanent storage of records, not merely their removal from\ncurrent usage.\n","title":"Archive","headings":["Etymology","History","Users and institutions","Standardization","See also","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Archivist","3: Archival_science","3: International_Organization_for_Standardization","2: Digital_preservation","2: International_Council_on_Archives","1: Primary_source","1: OED_Online","1: Oxford_University_Press","1: Latin","1: Romanization","1: Greek_language","1: Public_records","1: Town-hall","1: Magistrate","1: Archon","1: Ebla","1: Mari,_Syria","1: Amarna","1: Hattusas","1: Ugarit","1: Pylos","1: Papyrus","1: French_National_Archives","1: French_Revolution","1: Genealogist","1: Demographer","1: Thesis","1: Alumni","1: American_Library_Association","1: Coca-Cola","1: World_of_Coca-Cola","1: Procter_and_Gamble","1: Motorola","1: Levi_Strauss_&_Co.","1: Records_management","1: Integrity","1: Reporters","1: Genealogists","1: Historians","1: National_Archives_and_Records_Administration","1: District_of_Columbia","1: College_Park,_Maryland","1: Bachelor's_degree","1: Wales","1: English_Heritage_Archive","1: English_Heritage","1: National_Archives_of_Scotland","1: Edinburgh","1: Public_Record_Office_of_Northern_Ireland","1: Belfast","1: County_record_office","1: India","1: National_Archives_of_India","1: Taiwan","1: Taipei","1: Vatican_Secret_Archive","1: Archdiocese","1: Diocese","1: Anglicanism","1: Monastery","1: Monte_Cassino","1: Abbey_of_Saint_Gall","1: Fulda_monastery","1: List_of_Historical_Societies","1: World_Wide_Web","1: Archive_site","1: Web_crawler","1: CPAN","1: Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","1: Provenance","1: List_of_archives","1: List_of_national_archives","1: Archival_informatics","1: Archival_research","1: Archive_Fever","1: Jacques_Derrida","1: BS_5454","1: Computer_data_storage","1: Data_proliferation","1: Historical_document","1: Information_repository","1: Internet_Archive","1: Manuscript_processing","1: Web_archiving","1: Database","1: M25_motorway"]}
