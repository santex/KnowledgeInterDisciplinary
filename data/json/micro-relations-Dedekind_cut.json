{"cursor":"7806","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, real numbers.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a 'Dedekind cut', named after Richard Dedekind, is a partition\nof the rational numbers into two non-empty parts A and B, such that all elements\nof A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element.\n\nIf B has a smallest element among the rationals, the cut corresponds to that\nrational. Otherwise, that cut defines a unique irrational number which, loosely\nspeaking, fills the \"gap\" between A and B. In other words, A contains every\nrational number less than the cut, and B contains every rational number greater\nthan the cut. An irrational cut is equated to an irrational number which is in\nneither set. Every real number, rational or not, is equated to one and only one\ncut of rationals.\n\n\n\nMore generally, a Dedekind cut is a partition of a totally ordered set into two\nnon-empty parts (A and B), such that A is closed downwards (meaning that for all\na in A, x â¤ a implies that x is in A as well) and B is closed upwards, and A\ncontains no greatest element. See also completeness (order theory).\n\nIn particular, as discussed below, Dedekind cuts among the real numbers may be\nconsidered defined as cuts among the rationals. It turns out that every cut of\nreals is identical to the cut produced by a specific real number (which can be\nidentified as the smallest element of the B set). In other words, the number\nline where every real number is defined as a Dedekind cut of rationals is a\ncomplete continuum without any further gaps.\n\nDedekind used the German word Schnitt (cut) in a visual sense rooted in\nEuclidean geometry. When two straight lines cross, one is said to cut the other.\nDedekind's construction of the number line ensures that two crossing lines\nalways have one point in common because each of them defines a Dedekind cut on\nthe other.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Dedekind_cut","recorded":1362674371,"links":34,"instances":["mathematics","order_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Order theory","Rational numbers"],"headings":["Representations","Ordering of cuts","Construction of the real numbers","Generalizations","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Dedekind_cut_sqrt_2.svg/350px-Dedekind_cut_sqrt_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/d/c8d3674a3e15ae16f414c30721d880f9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/0/d/90d262738e2f34a906e40a71bf95ef37.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/b/2/6b206a28e60f665e235f89f460448467.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/6/c/d6c2be8bdfc417f58b242468c7a31e1e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/9/ec9ff0a12771e750c2685d3b89a37c79.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/3/37368baafc510600f02e7c8a53e3e2a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/b/88b266c40d718293fa70d4087107495e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/8/378fc087263f807db6e15ee8df958420.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/f/5/5f558fa7e9b1567daca23dc3433f5cec.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/b/2/6b206a28e60f665e235f89f460448467.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/1/b71d770d7e503b3f14af5d9a7abd8546.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["completeness","order_theory"],["interval","mathematics"]],"members":["interval","completeness"],"related":["Real_number","Mathematics","Richard_Dedekind","Partition_of_a_set","Rational_number","Totally_ordered_set","Completeness_(order_theory)","Number_line","Real_number","Complete_metric_space","Linear_continuum","Greatest_element","Interval_(mathematics)","Rational_number","Rational_numbers","Irrational_number","Supremum","Rational_number","Irrational_number","Surreal_number","Partially_ordered_set","Complete_lattice","Subset","Galois_connection","Dedekind–MacNeille_completion","Cauchy_sequence"]}
