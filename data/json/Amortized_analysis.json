{"cursor":"3891","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer science, 'amortized analysis' is a method of analyzing algorithms\nthat considers the entire sequence of operations of the program. It allows for\nthe establishment of a worst-case bound for the performance of an algorithm\nirrespective of the inputs by looking at all of the operations. At the heart of\nthe method is the idea that while certain operations may be extremely costly in\nresources, they cannot occur at a high-enough frequency to weigh down the entire\nprogram because the number of less costly operations will far outnumber the\ncostly ones in the long run, \"paying back\" the program over a number of\niterations. It is particularly useful because it\nguarantees worst-case performance rather than making assumptions about the state\nof the program.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Amortized_analysis","recorded":1362562515,"links":21,"instances":["computer_science","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fiebrink/423/AmortizedAnalysisExplained_Fiebrink.pdf","http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fiebrink/423/AmortizedAnalysisExplained_Fiebrink.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vlr/s06.357/notes/lec16.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vlr/s06.357/notes/lec16.pdf"],"categories":["Analysis of algorithms"],"headings":["History","Method","Common use","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["union","computer_science"],["state","computer_science"]],"members":["union","state"],"related":["Computer_science","Analysis_of_algorithms","Robert_Tarjan","Binary_trees","Union_(computer_science)","Data_structure","State_(computer_science)","Accounting_method","Potential_method","Online_algorithm","Allan_Borodin"]}
