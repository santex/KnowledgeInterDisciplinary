Thus lipophilic substances tend to dissolve\nin other lipophilic substances, while hydrophilic (water-loving) substances tend\nto dissolve in water and other hydrophilic substances.\n\nLipophilicity, hydrophobicity, and non-polarity can describe the same tendency\ntowards participation in the London dispersion force as the terms are often used\ninterchangeably. However, the terms \"lipophilic\" and \"hydrophobic\" are not\nsynonymous, as can be seen with silicones and fluorocarbons, which are\nhydrophobic but not lipophilic.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Lipophilic","recorded":1362511889,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties"],"headings":["Chemical bonding","Surfactants","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_compound","Fat","Oil","Lipid","Non-polar_solvent","Hexane","Toluene","Compendium_of_Chemical_Terminology","Hydrophilic","London_dispersion_force","Hydrophobicity","Silicone","Fluorocarbons","London_dispersion_force","Hydrogen_bond","Thermodynamics","Partition_coefficient","Hydrocarbon","Surfactants","Amphiphilic","Surface_tension","Emulsions","Micelles","Micelles","Phospholipids","Phosphate","Fluorosurfactant","Detergents","Lipophobicity","Lipophilic_bacteria","Microemulsion","ITIES","Ionic_partition_diagram"]}
