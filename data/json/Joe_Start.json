He started his career before\nthe American Civil War and continued to play professionally until 1886, when\nhe was 43.\n\nBorn in New York City, he led the Brooklyn Atlantics, the team he joined in\n1862, to undefeated seasons in 1864 and 1865. In 1871, he joined the new\nNational Association's New York Mutuals, hitting a career-high .360 in his first\nseason with the team, when he was age 28. When the National League was formed in\n1876, the Mutuals joined, bringing Start with them. After spending 1877 with the\nHartford Dark Blues and 1878 with the Chicago White Stockings, he found his next\nhome with the Providence Grays. From 1879 until 1885, when he was 42, Start held\ndown first base for the Grays and continued to hit well. Unfortunately, 1885 was\nProvidence's last season in the NL, so in 1886, he moved to the Washington\nNationals for what would be his last season. Start only played 31 games for the\nNationals and didn't hit well, even for a 43 year-old.\n\n1878 was probably Start's best season with the bat. He led the league with 100\nhits and 125 total bases. He came close to the league lead with his 12 doubles,\n5 triples, and a single home run. His 58 runs that year were second in the\nleague. These statistics all came in only 285 at bats, and at the age of 35,\nlong after most players have begun to decline. Start ended his career with 1418\nhits, 854 runs, and 544 RBI in National League and National Association play. He\nhad a .299 batting average, a .322 on base percentage, and a .367 slugging\npercentage. These numbers ignore the first 11 years of his career and, since\nthey were achieved in much shorter seasons than today's professionals play, they\nonly show a portion of his value to his teams. In addition, his career spanned\nmany important rule changes that changed the game in many ways, but Start\ncontinued to play at a high level through all of them. Start's 1879 Providence\nteam won the National League, and in 1884 they won a championship, beating the\nNew York Metropolitans.\n\nStart was also regarded as an excellent fielder, although at 5'9\" he was a much\nsmaller player than would later be typical at his position. Some even say that\nhe originated the modern positioning of the first baseman, being the first to\nplay away from the bag. Just like every other player of his time, Start never\nfielded with a glove, as modern players do, making his fielding contributions\nmore impressive.\n\nStart died in Providence, Rhode Island at the age of 84.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Joe_Start","recorded":1375076502,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joe_Start&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Start&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Start&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Joestart.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Joestart.jpg/200px-Joestart.jpg","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/New_York,_New_York","/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island","/wiki/New_York_Mutuals","/wiki/Washington_Nationals_(1886-1889)","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Brooklyn_Atlantics","/wiki/New_York_Mutuals","/wiki/1871_in_baseball","/wiki/1876_in_baseball","/wiki/Hartford_Dark_Blues","/wiki/1877_in_baseball","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/1878_in_baseball","/wiki/Providence_Grays","/wiki/1879_in_baseball","/wiki/1885_in_baseball","/wiki/Washington_Nationals_(1886-1889)","/wiki/1886_in_baseball","/wiki/New_York_Mutuals","/wiki/1873_in_baseball","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/New_York,_New_York","/wiki/Brooklyn_Atlantics","/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","/wiki/New_York_Mutuals","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Hartford_Dark_Blues","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Providence_Grays","/wiki/Washington_Nationals_(1886-1889)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball_statistics)","/wiki/Total_bases","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_(baseball_statistics)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/On_base_percentage","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/New_York_Metropolitans","/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Start&action=edit&section=1","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/startjo01.shtml","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Start_Joe.stm","/wiki/Template:1879_Providence_Grays","/wiki/Template_talk:1879_Providence_Grays","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1879_Providence_Grays&action=edit","/wiki/Providence_Grays","/wiki/1879_Providence_Grays_season","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Lew_Brown_(baseball)","/wiki/Jack_Farrell","/wiki/Emil_Gross","/wiki/Bill_Hague","/wiki/Paul_Hines","/wiki/Bobby_Mathews","/wiki/Mike_McGeary","/wiki/Jim_O%27Rourke_(baseball)","/wiki/John_Montgomery_Ward","/wiki/George_Wright_(sportsman)","/wiki/Tom_York_(baseball)","/wiki/George_Wright_(sportsman)","/wiki/Template:1884_Providence_Grays","/wiki/Template_talk:1884_Providence_Grays","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1884_Providence_Grays&action=edit","/wiki/Providence_Grays","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Cliff_Carroll","/wiki/Ed_Conley","/wiki/Jerry_Denny","/wiki/Jack_Farrell","/wiki/Barney_Gilligan","/wiki/Paul_Hines","/wiki/Arthur_Irwin","/wiki/Sandy_Nava","/wiki/Charles_Radbourn","/wiki/Paul_Radford","/wiki/Frank_Bancroft","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/New_York,_New_York","/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Start&oldid=543747347","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Enterprise_players","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Atlantics_(NABBP)_players","/wiki/Category:Hartford_Dark_Blues_players","/wiki/Category:New_York_Mutuals_players","/wiki/Category:Chicago_White_Stockings_players","/wiki/Category:Providence_Grays_players","/wiki/Category:New_York_Mutuals_managers","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_New_York","/wiki/Category:Baseball_player%E2%80%93managers","/wiki/Category:19th-ce
