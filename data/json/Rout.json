{"cursor":"3004","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'rout' is a chaotic and disorderly retreat or withdrawal of troops from a\nbattlefield, resulting in the victory of the opposing party, or following\ndefeat, a collapse of discipline, or poor morale. A routed army often\ndegenerates into a sense of \"every man for himself\" as the surviving combatants\nattempt to flee to safety. A disorganized rout often results in much higher\ncasualties for the retreating force than an orderly withdrawal. On many\noccasions, more soldiers are killed in the rout than in the actual battle.\nNormally, though not always, routs either effectively end a battle, or provide\nthe decisive victory the winner needs to gain the momentum with which to end a\nbattle (or even campaign) in their favor. The opposite of a rout is a rally, in\nwhich a military unit that has been giving way and is on the verge of being\nrouted suddenly gathers itself and turns back to the offensive.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Rout","recorded":1362543502,"links":13,"instances":["military","military"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military strategy","Lists of battles|Routs","Military tactics"],"headings":["History","Tactics","Other uses of the term","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["withdrawal","military"],["withdrawal","military"],["partisan","military"]],"members":["partisan","withdrawal"],"related":["Withdrawal_(military)","Withdrawal_(military)","Discipline","Morale","Military_campaign","Auxiliaries","Light_cavalry","Partisan_(military)","Militia","Armoured_warfare","Blitzkrieg","Brittany","Battle_of_Hastings","Riot","Iliad","Ares","Collective_nouns","Snails","Crowd_psychology"]}
