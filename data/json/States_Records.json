A subsidiary of United\nRecords, it was in business from May 1952 to December 1957. States focused on\nrhythm and blues, jazz, and gospel.\n\nStates was operated by Leonard Allen and Lew Simpkins until Simpkins' death in\nApril 1953; thereafter, Allen was solely responsible for the company. [http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/unitedstates.html\nPruter, Robert, Campbell, Robert L. and Kelly, Tom \"The United and States Labels\nPart I\"] Accessed August 13, 2009\n\nMost sessions for States were done at Universal Recording, with high-\nfidelity results.\n\nThe most important blues artist to record for States was Junior Wells, making\nhis debut as a leader; he cut sessions for the company in 1953 and 1954. In the\ndown-home category, Allen also released singles by Robert Nighthawk and Big\nWalter Horton, as well as pianist Eddie Ware, guitarist L. C. McKinley, and\ndrummer James Bannister. Standup blues singers to record for the label included\nEdward \"The Great Gates\" White (accompanied on his outing by Tom Archia and Red\nSaunders), Cliff Butler, Arbee Stidham, Jack Cooley, and Harold Burrage.\n\nStates issued juke-box jazz sides by tenor saxophonists Paul Bascomb, Jimmy Coe,\nand Cozy Eggleston. A few forays into the Detroit scene produced rhythm and\nblues by Sax Kari, Jimmy Hamilton, T. J. Fowler, and Helen Thompson. States\nbecame involved in doo-wop in 1953 when Allen recorded The Hornets. He soon\nadded The Danderliers, the Five Chances, The Strollers and The Palms.\n\nThe vocal groups were rehearsed by Al Smith, who also led studio bands featuring\nsuch performers as guitarist Lefty Bates, tenor saxophonist Red Holloway, and\ndrummer Vernel Fournier. In gospel, The Caravans were a mainstay of the label\nthroughout its existence. Eventually, Allen added the Genesa Smith Singers and\nthe Lucy Smith Singers.\n\nAllen did less recording after 1954, and closed both of his labels around the\nend of 1957. [http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~campber/unitedstates2.html\nPruter, Robert, Campbell, Robert L., and Kelly, Tom. \"The United and States\nLabels Part II\"] Accessed August 26, 2009 States releases ran\nconsecutively from 101 to 164, for a total of 64 singles on the label.\n\nStates relied heavily on The Caravans, releasing 14 singles on them and\ncompiling many more unissued tracks. After the company closed, Savoy Records,\nwhich had signed the group and was seeking to consolidate its position in gospel\nmusic, bought this rich cache of material. States' remaining output was acquired\nin 1975 by Bob Koester of Delmark Records, and has been included in\ncomprehensive reissue programs.\n","linknr":157,"url":"States_Records","recorded":1362477381,"links":14,"instances":["vocal_group","bandleader","businessman","vocal_group"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct record labels of the United States"],"headings":["Releases","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/StatesRecords147.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["leonard_allen","businessman"],["leonard_allen","businessman"],["the_strollers","vocal_group"],["the_palms","vocal_group"],["tommy_dean","bandleader"],["grant","mr._blues_jones"],["the_palms","vocal_group"],["the_strollers","vocal_group"]],"members":["the_palms","tommy_dean","leonard_allen","grant","the_strollers"],"related":["Leonard_Allen_(businessman)","Blues","Jazz","Doo-wop","Gospel_music","Chicago","Illinois","Chicago","Record_label","United_Records","Rhythm_and_blues","Jazz","Gospel_music","Leonard_Allen_(businessman)","Lew_Simpkins","Universal_Recording","Junior_Wells","Robert_Lee_McCollum","Big_Walter_Horton","L._C._McKinley","Tom_Archia","Red_Saunders","Cliff_Butler","Arbee_Stidham","Harold_Burrage","Jazz","Tenor_saxophone","Paul_Bascomb","Jimmy_Coe","Cozy_Eggleston","Detroit","Rhythm_and_blues","Sax_Kari","Jimmy_Hamilton","Doo-wop","The_Danderliers","Five_Chances","The_Strollers_(vocal_group)","The_Palms_(vocal_group)","Albert_B._Smith","Lefty_Bates","Red_Holloway","Vernel_Fournier","Gospel_music","The_Caravans","The_Caravans","Savoy_Records","Bob_Koester","Delmark_Records","Paul_Bascomb","The_Caravans","Tommy_Dean_(bandleader)","Cliff_Butler","Jimmy_Hamilton","Grant_(Mr._Blues)_Jones","Sax_Kari","Jimmy_Coe","Junior_Wells","Cliff_Butler","Robert_Lee_McCollum","Harold_Burrage","Big_Walter_Horton","James_Cleveland","The_Danderliers","Cliff_Butler","Five_Chances","The_Palms_(vocal_group)","The_Strollers_(vocal_group)","Lefty_Bates","Arbee_Stidham","List_of_record_labels"]}
