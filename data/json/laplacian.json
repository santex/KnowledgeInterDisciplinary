It is\nusually denoted by the symbols ∇·∇, ∇<sup>2</sup> or ∆. The Laplacian ∆f(p) of a\nfunction f at a point p, up to a constant depending on the dimension, is the\nrate at which the average value of f over spheres centered at p, deviates from\nf(p) as the radius of the sphere grows. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the\nLaplacian is given by sum of second partial derivatives of the function with\nrespect to each independent variable. In other coordinate systems such as\ncylindrical and spherical coordinates, the Laplacian also has a useful form.\n\nThe Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de\nLaplace (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial\nmechanics, where the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when\nit is applied to a given gravitational potential. Solutions of the equation ∆f =\n0, now called Laplace's equation, are the so-called harmonic functions, and\nrepresent the possible gravitational fields in free space.\n\nThe Laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical\nphenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation\nfor heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics. The Laplacian\nrepresents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function. For instance,\nthe net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from\nsome point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at\nthat point; expressed symbolically, the resulting equation is the diffusion\nequation. For these reasons, it is extensively used in the sciences for\nmodelling all kinds of physical phenomena. The Laplacian is the simplest\nelliptic operator, and is at the core of Hodge theory as well as the results of\nde Rham cohomology. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian\noperator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection.\n","title":"Laplace%20operator","headings":["Definition","Motivation","Coordinate expressions","Spectral theory","Generalizations","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Gravitational_potential","3: Elliptic_operator","2: Divergence","2: Gradient","2: Euclidean_space","2: Partial_derivative","2: Laplace's_equation","2: Diffusion_equation","2: Wave_equation","2: Image_processing","2: Computer_vision","2: Blob_detection","2: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Mathematics","1: Differential_operator","1: Cartesian_coordinate_system","1: Independent_variable","1: Cylindrical_coordinates","1: Spherical_coordinates","1: French_people","1: Pierre-Simon_de_Laplace","1: Celestial_mechanics","1: Harmonic_function","1: Differential_equations","1: Electric_potential","1: Heat_equation","1: Fluid_mechanics","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Flux_density","1: Gradient_flow","1: Hodge_theory","1: De_Rham_cohomology","1: Edge_detection","1: Derivative","1: Real-valued_function","1: Continuously_differentiable","1: Open_set","1: Physics","1: Diffusion","1: Diffusion_equilibrium","1: Net_flux","1: Unit_normal","1: Divergence_theorem","1: Electrostatic_potential","1: Charge_distribution","1: Gauss's_law","1: Mass_distribution","1: Poisson's_equation","1: Dirichlet_energy","1: Stationary_point","1: Green's_first_identity","1: Fundamental_lemma_of_calculus_of_variations","1: Azimuthal_angle","1: Zenith_angle","1: Colatitude","1: Einstein_summation_convention","1: Unit_sphere","1: N_sphere","1: LaplaceâBeltrami_operator","1: Homogeneous_function","1: Spectral_theory","1: Helmholtz_equation","1: Orthonormal_basis","1: Hilbert_space","1: Lp_space","1: Spectral_theorem","1: Compact_operator","1: Self-adjoint_operator","1: PoincarÃ©_inequality","1: Kondrakov_embedding_theorem","1: Infinitely_differentiable","1: N-sphere","1: Spherical_harmonics","1: Riemannian_manifold","1: Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold","1: Hessian_matrix","1: Metric_tensor","1: Tensor_field","1: Exterior_derivative","1: Codifferential","1: Hodge_dual","1: Differential_form","1: WeitzenbÃ¶ck_identity","1: Non-Euclidean","1: Hyperbolic_operator","1: Ultrahyperbolic_operator","1: Minkowski_space","1: D'Alembert_operator","1: Isometry_group","1: Particle_physics","1: KleinâGordon_equation","1: Natural_units","1: Vector_Laplacian","1: Vector_field","1: Laplace_operators_in_differential_geometry","1: Discrete_Laplace_operator","1: Laplacian_of_Gaussian","1: Scale_space","1: List_of_formulas_in_Riemannian_geometry","1: Earnshaw's_theorem","1: Analysis_on_fractals","1: Time_scale_calculus","1: Discrete_exterior_calculus"]}
