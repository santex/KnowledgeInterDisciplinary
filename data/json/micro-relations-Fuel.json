{"cursor":"13061","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n was one of the first fuels used by humans and is still the primary energy\n source in much of the world.]]\n\n'Fuel' is any material that stores potential energy in a form that can be\npracticably released and used as heat energy. The concept originally applied\nsolely to those materials storing energy in the form of chemical energy that\ncould be released through combustion, but the concept has since been\nalso applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear\nfission or nuclear fusion), as well as releases of chemical energy released\nthrough non-combustion oxidation (such as in cellular biology or in fuel cells).\n\nThe heat energy released by many fuels is harnessed into mechanical energy via\nan engine. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or\nindustrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with combustion.\nFuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular\nrespiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release un-usable energy.\nHydrocarbons are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other\nsubstances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other methods of storing potential energy, such as\nthose that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors)\nor mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a\nreservoir).\n","linknr":402,"url":"Fuel","recorded":1362503883,"links":94,"instances":["electricity","fuel","biology","geology"],"pdf":["http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf"],"categories":["Fuels|","Energy development"],"headings":["History","Chemical","Nuclear","World trade","See also","Footnotes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Buying_fuelwood.jpeg/220px-Buying_fuelwood.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Nuclear_fuel_pellets.jpeg/220px-Nuclear_fuel_pellets.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/2005fuel_import.PNG/220px-2005fuel_import.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Large_bonfire.jpg/16px-Large_bonfire.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["battery","electricity"],["coke","fuel"],["crust","geology"],["battery","electricity"]],"members":["battery","coke","cell","crust"],"related":["Potential_energy","Heat_energy","Chemical_energy","Combustion","Nuclear_energy","Nuclear_fission","Nuclear_fusion","Oxidation","Fuel_cell","Engine","Cell_(biology)","Organisms","Cellular_respiration","Hydrocarbons","Electrical_energy","Battery_(electricity)","Capacitor","Mechanical_energy","Flywheel","Charcoal","Coke_(fuel)","Barbecue","China","Steam_engine","London","Electricity","Oxidation","Solid_fuel","Liquid_fuel","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Gaseous_fuel","Charcoal","Peat","Saterland","Biofuel","Biomass","Swartkrans","South_Africa","Energy_density","Joule","Kilogram","Bioethanol","Biodiesel","Hydrocarbon","Coal","Petroleum","Liquid_petroleum","Natural_gas","Fossil","Earth","Crust_(geology)","Natural_resource","Tar_sands","Nuclear_power","Fissile","Nuclear_fission","Chain_reaction","Nuclear_reactor","Fuel_rod","Neutron_moderator","Uranium-235","Pu-239","Nuclear_fuel_cycle","Nuclear_power","Nuclear_weapon","Nuclear_fusion","Star","Hydrogen","Atomic_nuclei","Proton","Neutron","Helium","Proton-proton_chain_reaction","CNO_cycle","ITER","Inertial_confinement","World_Bank","Alcohol_fuel","Alternative_fuels","Ammonia","Battery_(electricity)","Bitumen-based_fuel","Cryogenic_fuel","Fuel_card","Fuel_cell","Fuel_management_systems","Fuel_oil","Fuel_poverty","Hydrogen_economy","Hydrogen_fuel","Liquid_fuels","List_of_energy_topics","Marine_fuel_management","Propellant","Recycled_fuel","Solid_fuel","World_energy_resources_and_consumption"]}
