{"cursor":"6361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'mass number' ('A'), also called 'atomic mass number' or 'nucleon number',\nis the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an\natomic nucleus. Because protons and neutrons both are baryons, the mass number A\nis identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or\nion. The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical\nelement. This is not the same as the atomic number ('Z') which denotes the\nnumber of protons in a nucleus, and thus uniquely identifies an element. Hence,\nthe difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of\nneutrons (N) in a given nucleus: N=AâZ.\n\nThe mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript\nto the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of\ncarbon is carbon-12, or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The full isotope\nsymbol would also have the atomic number ('Z') as a subscript to the left of\nthe element symbol directly below the mass number: . This is\ntechnically redundant, as each element is defined by its atomic number, so it\nis often omitted.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Mass_number","recorded":1362675089,"links":73,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05258.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05258.pdf","http://preparatorychemistry.com/Bishop_Book_atoms_3.pdf","http://preparatorychemistry.com/Bishop_Book_atoms_3.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear chemistry","Chemical properties"],"headings":["Mass number changes in radioactive decay","Mass number and isotopic mass","Atomic mass of an element","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Proton","Neutron","Nucleon","Atomic_nucleus","Baryon","Baryon_number","Atom","Ion","Isotope","Chemical_element","Atomic_number","Neutron_number","Carbon","Carbon-12","Radioactive_decay","Atomic_number","Radioactive_displacement_law_of_Fajans_and_Soddy","Uranium-238","Alpha_decay","Alpha_particle","Thorium-234","Carbon-14","Beta_decay","Electron","Antineutrino","Nitrogen-14","Gamma_ray","Nuclear_isomer","Metastable","Isotopic_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Mass_defect","Binding_energy","Mass-energy_equivalence","Relative_atomic_mass","Atomic_weight","Unified_atomic_mass_unit","Isotopes_of_chlorine","Mole_(unit)"]}
