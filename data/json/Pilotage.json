{"cursor":"3983","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Pilotage' is the use of fixed visual references on the ground or sea by means\nof sight or radar to guide oneself to a destination, sometimes with the help of\na map or nautical chart. People use pilotage for activities such as guiding\nvessels and aircraft, hiking and scuba diving. Pilotage techniques apply when\nclose enough to land or other navigational reference points. In these\ncircumstances there is often not enough time for more elaborate navigational\ntechniques that are used out of sight of both navigational aids and hazards. In\nthese circumstances, it is usually not necessary to know exactly where you are,\nbut that one is in a safe position, or at least on a safe line and will remain\nso for a period of time, and to know when the next change will be\nrequired.\n\nWithout such pilotage references, it is necessary to navigate using dead\nreckoning (typically with a compass and some form of log for speed or distance\nestimation), radar, radio navigation, and satellite navigation (such as GPS).\n","linknr":137,"url":"Pilotage","recorded":1362576308,"links":22,"instances":["position","geology","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Underwater diving procedures","Navigation"],"headings":["Difficulties","Visual features","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fix","position"],["rock","geology"],["antenna","electronics"]],"members":["fix","rock","antenna"],"related":["Map","Nautical_chart","Aircraft","Hiking","Scuba_diving","Navigation","Navigational_aid","Fix_(position)","Dead_reckoning","Compass","Chip_log","Radar","Radio_navigation","Satellite_navigation_system","Global_Positioning_System","Map","Aeronautical_chart","Nautical_chart","Visibility","Mountain","Hill","Lake","River","Cliff","Rock_(geology)","Beach","Sea_mark","Daymark","Radio","Antenna_(electronics)","Airport","City","Dam","Highway","Lighthouse","Lightvessel","Sea_mark","Navigation","Dead_reckoning","Visual_flight_rules","Maritime_pilot","American_Practical_Navigator","National_Imagery_and_Mapping_Agency"]}
