{"cursor":"4381","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Karl von Abel' (September 17, 1788 â September 3, 1859) was a Bavarian\nstatesman.\n\nBorn in Wetzlar, Abel was the son of a at the superior Court of Justice.\nHe studied law in GieÃen from 1806-1809, and became a civil servant of\nBavaria in 1810.\n\nIn 1817 he was appointed city and police commissar in Bamberg, in 1819,\nGovernmental Councillor in Munich, and in 1827 promoted to Senior Legal\nSecretary. In the Diet of 1831 he gave a speech in favour of freedom of the\npress and against censorship.\n\nIn the following year, Abel was assigned by King Ludwig I to be a part of the\ndelegation accompanying the young King Otto to Greece. He joined with Georg\nLudwig von Maurer in opposing the head of the delegation, Count Josef Ludwig von\nArmansperg who he felt was too susceptible to the wishes of the English\ndiplomats. However, the count was able to mobilise his supporters in Munich and\nhave Abel and Maurer unseated from the delegation. Abel once again became Legal\nSecretary in the Ministry of the Interior. He married Friederike von Rinecker in\n1836, a very religious woman who had much influence on him.\n\nOn 1 November 1837, Abel became Privy Councillor in place of Ludwig, FÃ¼rst von\nWallerstein and began to lead the Ministry of the Interior. At this time, the\nChurch Conflict of Colonia excited the masses on religious and political levels.\nSoon enough the Ministry under Abel proved to be strictly Catholic, following\nthe traditions of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The status of the clergy was\nraised and large sums were spent for religious issues. This was followed by\nseveral edicts, for example prescribing that Protestant soldiers must also\ngenuflect during a Catholic service. The formation of Evangelic communities and\nthe execution of their services was made complicated and restricted and strict\ncensorship applied to all opposing movements.\n\nIn other issues Abel showed his absolutist and ultramontane position. He\nauthorized an edict disallowing the use of all modern terms, which try to foist\nthe principle of classes with a representative one. As an example, the term of\nMinistry of the State was forbidden as the king must unite all power in\nhimself. Several affronts against his precursor Wallerstein resulted in a duel\nwhich he lost.\n\nWallerstein lead the opposition forming mainly in the newly acquired provinces\nof the kingdom against the paternalism of the Ministry. In the Diet of 1846 he\nopenly fought the existing system. Abel could not avert the claims that he had\nbroken the principle of parity, and that the Christian party was in contact with\nradical elements. For this the King lost his trust in Abel, and removed him as\nMinistry of Culture and Education.\n\nAbel was dismissed from power on 17 February 1847 when he and the other\nministers opposed the naturalisation of the Kings' young lady Lola Montez.\nAfterwards, he had not only to suffer the disgrace of the king he had served for\na long time, but was also repudiated by the members of his own party. In 1848\nAbel was voted into the Second Chamber, but refused to take the charge until the\nreign of Maximilian II of Bavaria, due to heavy attacks from all sides.\n\nAbel was recalled in 1850 and retired from the political life. Until his death\nin 1859 he lived on his tenure Stamsried manor in Upper Palatinate.\n\nHe died in Munich.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Karl_von_Abel","recorded":1375077693,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Karl_von_Abel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Karl_von_Abel.jpg/220px-Karl_von_Abel.jpg","/wiki/File:Karl_von_Abel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Wetzlar","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/procurator","/wiki/Gie%C3%9Fen","/wiki/Civil_servant","/wiki/Police_commissioner","/wiki/Bamberg","/wiki/Munich","/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press","/wiki/Censorship","/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Otto_of_Greece","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Georg_Ludwig_von_Maurer","/wiki/Josef_Ludwig_von_Armansperg","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Maximilian_I_Joseph_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Edict","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Genuflect","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Absolutism_(European_history)","/wiki/Ultramontane","/wiki/Duel","/wiki/Paternalism","/wiki/Naturalisation","/wiki/Lola_Montez","/wiki/Maximilian_II_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Stamsried","/wiki/Upper_Palatinate","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=edit&section=1","http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Abel,_Karl_von","/wiki/Allgemeine_Deutsche_Biographie","/wiki/Wikisource","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/52492771","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&oldid=543713676","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1788_births","/wiki/Category:1859_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Wetzlar","/wiki/Category:German_Roman_Catholics","/wiki/Category:Bavarian_politicians","/wiki/Category:Ministers-President_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+von+Abel&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Karl+von+Abel","/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","/wiki/Talk:Karl_von_Abel","#","/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Karl_von_Abel","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Karl_von_Abel","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&oldid=543713676","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72729","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Karl_von_Abel&id=543713676","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Karl+von+Abel","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Karl+von+Abel&oldid=543713676&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Karl_von_Abel&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72729#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Abel","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/stati
