The area has been designated as the 'Cannock Chase Area\nof Outstanding Natural Beauty'. The Chase gives its name to the Cannock Chase\nlocal government district.\n\nCannock Chase is located between Cannock, Lichfield, Rugeley and Stafford. It\ncomprises a mixture of natural deciduous woodland, coniferous plantations, open\nheathland and the remains of early industry, such as coal mining. The landscape\nowes much to the underlying Triassic bunter formations. Cannock Chase was\ndesignated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) on 16 September 1958\nand is the smallest area so designated in mainland Britain, covering . Much of\nthe area is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\nDespite being relatively small in area, the chase provides a remarkable range of\nlandscape and wildlife, including a herd of around 800 fallow deer and a number\nof rare and endangered birds, not least migrant Nightjars. A feeding station at\nthe Marquis Drive Visitors' Centre, sponsored by the West Midland Bird Club,\nattracts many species, including Brambling, Yellowhammer and Bullfinch. Efforts\nare underway to increase the amount of heathland on the chase, reintroducing\nshrubs such as heather in some areas where bracken and birch forest have crowded\nout most other plants. The local flora also includes several species of\nVaccinium, including the eponymous Cannock Chase Berry ([[Vaccinium\nÃintermedium]] Ruthe). In January 2009, an outbreak of Sudden Oak\nDeath disease (Phytophthora ramorum) was discovered on the chase, at Brocton\nCoppice. Various restrictions were put in place in an attempt to prevent its\nspread.\n\nThere are a number of visitor centres, museums and waymarked paths, including\nthe Heart of England Way and the Staffordshire Way. There are also accessible\ntrails to enable people with barriers to experience the health benefits of\nCannock Chase, such as The Route to Health. [http://www.thegoodlife.uk.net/out-and-about/route-to-\nhealth The Route to Health] Additionally, there are many unmarked public\npaths. On the Chase's north-eastern edge can be found Shugborough Hall,\nancestral home of the Earls of Lichfield. At its southern edge are the remains\nof Castle Ring, an Iron Age hill fort, which is the highest point on the Chase.\nSeveral glacial erratic boulders are also found on the Chase, remnants of\nglaciation. One is mounted on a plinth.\n\n\nThe Chase has several war memorials, including German and Commonwealth war\ncemeteries. A memorial to the victims of the Katyn Massacre was unveiled by\nStefan Staniszewski, whose father Hillary Zygmunt Staniszewski (a high court\njudge) died in the massacre. Preserved below the memorial are phials of soil\nfrom both Warsaw and the Katyn forest. Freda, the Harlequin Great Dane mascot of\nthe New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool's Own) is also buried on the\nchase marked with a memorial marble headstone.\n\nThe Chase is popular with cross-country mountain bike users. The purpose-built\nXC 'Follow the Dog' trail is an technically challenging route, opened\nin 2005, starting and finishing at the Birches Valley Visitors/Cycle Centre. It\nis open to all, however it is not recommended for beginners. A new section of XC\ntrail was opened in April 2010. The 'Monkey Trail' (7 mile) is a more technical\ntrail that splits from 'Follow the Dog' at about the halfway point, then rejoins\nslightly further on. There are several features mountain bikers can look out for\nwhen riding on the chase, such as Kitbag Hill, Rabbit Hill, Quagmire Bridge,\nRoots Hall and Brocton Shorts to name a few.\n\nSince 2006, the forest has been used as an open air music venue as part of the\nForestry Commission nationwide Forest Tour, with acts such as The Zutons, The\nFeeling, Status Quo and Jools Holland playing in a forest clearing.\n\nThe area gained notoriety in the late 1960s when the Cannock Chase murders made\nnational headlines; the remains of three young girls were found buried on the\nChase after going missing from areas along the A34 road between there and\nBirmingham. Raymond Leslie Morris, a motor engineer from Walsall, was found\nguilty at Stafford assizes of one of the murders in 1968 and was sentenced to\nlife imprisonment. He is still in prison over 40 years later and one of the\ncountry's longest serving prisoners.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Cannock_Chase","recorded":1374541659,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cannock_Chase&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cannock_Chase&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_(district)","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty","/wiki/File:Cannock_Chase_Path.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Cannock_Chase_Path.jpg/300px-Cannock_Chase_Path.jpg","/wiki/England","/wiki/Staffordshire","/wiki/West_Midlands_(region)","/wiki/Triassic","/wiki/Bunter_(geology)","/wiki/Birch","/wiki/Bracken","/wiki/Calluna","/wiki/Brambling","/wiki/Tree_Pipit","/wiki/Nightjar","/wiki/British_national_grid_reference_system","http://toolserver.org/~rhaworth/os/coor_g.php?pagename=Cannock_Chase&params=SK000165_region%3AGB_scale%3A25000","/wiki/Staffordshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_(district)","/wiki/Cannock","/wiki/Lichfield","/wiki/Rugeley","/wiki/Stafford","/wiki/Coal_mining","/wiki/Triassic","/wiki/Bunter_(geology)","/wiki/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest","/wiki/Fallow_deer","/wiki/Bird_migration","/wiki/European_Nightjar","/wiki/West_Midland_Bird_Club","/wiki/Brambling","/wiki/Yellowhammer","/wiki/Eurasian_Bullfinch","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items","/wiki/Heathland","/wiki/Calluna","/wiki/Bracken","/wiki/Birch","/wiki/Vaccinium","/w/index.php?title=Vaccinium_%C3%97intermedium&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Sudden_Oak_Death","#cite_note-WMBC-SOD-2","/wiki/Waymarking","/wiki/Heart_of_England_Way","/wiki/Staffordshire_Way","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Shugborough_Hall","/wiki/Earl_of_Lichfield","/wiki/Castle_Ring","/wiki/Iron_Age","/wiki/Hill_fort","/wiki/Glacial_erratic","/wiki/Glaciation","/wiki/File:Katyn_Memorial_Cannock.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Katyn_Memorial_Cannock.jpg/200px-Katyn_Memorial_Cannock.jpg","/wiki/File:Katyn_Memorial_Cannock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/War_memorial","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_German_war_cemetery","/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission","/wiki/Katyn_Massacre","/wiki/Great_Dane","/wiki/New_Zealand_Rifle_Brigade_(Earl_of_Liverpool%27s_Own)","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Forestry_Commission","/wiki/Forest_Tour","/wiki/The_Zutons","/wiki/The_Feeling","/wiki/Status_Quo_(band)","/wiki/Jools_Holland","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_murders","/wiki/A34_road","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Walsall","/wiki/Stafford","/wiki/Life_imprisonment","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#In_popular_culture","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Cannock_Chase&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Black_dog_(ghost)","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Werewolf","#cite_note-8","/wiki/British_big_cats","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Bigfoot","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Folklore","/wiki/Labi_Siffre","/wiki/Crying_Laughing_Loving_Lying","/wiki/Dogging_(sexual_slang)","/wiki/Stan_Collymore","/wiki/News_of_the_World","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Cannock_Chase&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Beaudesert_(house)","/wiki/Cannock_Chase_German_war_cemetery","/wiki/Castle_Ring","/wiki/Valley_coal_mine","/w/index.php?title=Cannock_Chase&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cannockchasehistory.org.uk/_Bilberry.htm","#cite_ref-WMBC-SOD_2-0","http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/staffordshire/cannockchase/sudden-oak-death","#cite_ref-3","http://www.thegoodlife.uk.net/out-and-about/route-to-health","#cite_ref-4","http://www.chasetrails.co.uk/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2005/09/08/child-killer-should-rot-in-prison-97319-15944998/","#cite_ref-6","http://www.murderuk.com/child_killers_raymond_morris.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.chasepost.net/news-in-cannock/cannock-burntwood-news/2009/03/12/hellhound-stalking-cannock-chase-93633-23130526/","#cite_ref-8","http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2009/09/29/werewolves_in_staffs_feature.shtml","#cite_ref-9","http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2009/08/20/the-beast-of-cannock-chase-is-back-mystery-deepens-66331-2448
