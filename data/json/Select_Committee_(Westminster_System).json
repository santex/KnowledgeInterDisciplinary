{"cursor":"5441","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nUK Parliamentary Select Committees can be appointed from the House of Commons,\nlike the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, from the House of Lords, like the\nDelegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, or as a \"Joint Committee\"\ndrawn from both, such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Committees may\nexist as \"sessional\" committees - i.e. be near-permanent - or as \"ad-hoc\"\ncommittees with a specific deadline by which to complete their work, after which\nthey cease to exist, such as the recent Lords Committee on Public Service and\nDemographic Change. http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-\nselect/public-services-committee/\n\nThe Commons Select Committees are generally responsible for overseeing the work\nof government departments and agencies, whereas those of the Lords look at\ngeneral issues, such as the constitution, considered by the Constitution\nCommittee, or the economy, considered by the Economic Affairs Committee. Both\nHouses have their own committees to review drafts of European Union directives:\nthe European Union Committee in the House of Lords, and the European Scrutiny\nCommittee in the House of Commons.\n\nNote that the Intelligence and Security Committee is not a Select Committee,\nthough it contains members from both Houses. It is a unique committee of\nparliamentarians appointed by the Prime Minister and reporting to him or her,\nnot Parliament.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Select_Committee_(Westminster_System)","recorded":1375067212,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Select_Committee_(Westminster_System)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Select_committee","#Select_Committees_in_the_House_of_Commons","#Select_Committees_in_the_House_of_Lords","#Non-parliamentary_Select_Committees","#Rules_regarding_the_work_of_Select_Committees","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Select_Committee","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Delegated_Powers_and_Regulatory_Reform_Committee","/wiki/Joint_Committee","/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights","#cite_note-1","/wiki/British_constitution","/wiki/Constitution_Committee","/wiki/Economic_Affairs_Committee_(House_of_Lords)","/wiki/European_Union_directive","/wiki/European_Union_Committee","/wiki/European_Scrutiny_Committee","/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/United_Kingdom","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)","/wiki/Public_bill_committee","/wiki/Standing_Committee_(UK)","/wiki/Administration_Committee","/w/index.php?title=Domestic_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/House_of_Commons_Library","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/European_Union_Committee","/wiki/Constitution_Committee","/wiki/Economic_Affairs_Committee_(House_of_Lords)","/wiki/Science_and_Technology_Committee_(House_of_Lords)","/wiki/Communications_Select_Committee","/wiki/European_Union_Committee","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Overview_and_Scrutiny","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Osmotherly_Rules","#cite_note-parlo-5","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/List_of_Committees_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/public-services-committee/","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2010/06/results-of-elections-for-select-committee-chairs-announced/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmrefhoc/1117/111706.htm#a10","#cite_ref-parlo_5-0","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&section=7","http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/","/wiki/UK_Parliament","http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/sc/sc_0408.htm","http://www.selectcommittees.co.uk/","http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Central_Lobby#Select_Committees/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&oldid=561874577","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Select_Committees_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Select+committees+of+the+Parliament+of+the+United+Kingdom&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Select+committees+of+the+Parliament+of+the+United+Kingdom","/wiki/Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Talk:Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","#","/wiki/Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Select_committees_of_the
