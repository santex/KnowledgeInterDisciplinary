{"cursor":"18669","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". The aptamer surface and backbone are shown in yellow. Biotin (spheres) fits\n  snugly into a cavity of the RNA surface]] 'Aptamers' (from the Latin aptus -\n  fit, and Greek meros - part) are oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules that\n  bind to a specific target molecule. Aptamers are usually created by selecting\n  them from a large random sequence pool, but natural aptamers also exist in\n  riboswitches. Aptamers can be used for both basic research and clinical\n  purposes as macromolecular drugs. Aptamers can be combined with ribozymes to\n  self-cleave in the presence of their target molecule. These compound molecules\n  have additional research, industrial and clinical applications.\n\nMore specifically, aptamers can be classified as:\n* DNA or RNA or XNA aptamers. They consist of (usually short) strands of\n  oligonucleotides.\n* Peptide aptamers. They consist of a short variable peptide domain, attached at\n  both ends to a protein scaffold.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Aptamer","recorded":1362484146,"links":22,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nucleic acids","Peptides","Biotechnology","Medical research"],"headings":["Nucleic Acid aptamers","Peptide aptamers","AptaBiD","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Aptamer_biotin.png/220px-Aptamer_biotin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/9/c89d1b73fe2a34e7090c88a815bbb6ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/b/05b67910ff6293e645913cf8c0bad96d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/2/012c9658df074b45cd889a3be80c8968.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ligand","biochemistry"]],"members":["ligand"],"related":["Oligonucleotide","Peptide","Sequencing","Riboswitch","Ribozyme","Deoxyribonucleic_acid","Ribonucleic_acid","Nucleic_acid_analogues","Peptide","Nucleic_acid","Systematic_evolution_of_ligands_by_exponential_enrichment","Biotechnology","Antibody","Immunogenicity","Ligand_(biochemistry)","DNA_polymerase","Gilead_Sciences","Sol_Spiegelman","Bacteriophage_Qβ","Gerald_Joyce","University_of_Texas_at_Austin","SomaLogic","Ronald_Breaker","Riboswitch","RNA_world_hypothesis","Lysozyme","Thrombin","Hemin","Interferon_γ","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Dopamine","Smart_aptamers","Smart_ligands","Kinetic_capillary_electrophoresis","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Macugen","OSI_Pharmaceuticals","Nuclease","Schering_AG","Pyrimidines","Polyethylene_glycol","Half-life","Spiegelmers","Aptamer_plasma_proteomics","Aptamer_Database","Protein-protein_interaction","Amino_acid","Solubility","Compacity","Bacterial_protein","Thioredoxin","Cysteine","Yeast","Two-hybrid_system","Scaffold_protein","Protein_trimer","Rapamycin","Phage_display","MRNA_display","Ribosome_display","Bacterial_display","Yeast_display","Biopanning","Mimotope","MimoDB","Biomarker","Mass_spectrometry","Small_interfering_RNA"]}
