These techniques are meant to provide\n basic necessities for human life: water, food, , habitat, the ability to think\n straight, to signal for help, to navigate safely, to avoid unpleasant\n interactions with animals and plants, and cure any present injuries. Survival\n skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancient humans have used for\n thousands of years. Hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, hunting and\n many other outdoor activities all require basic wilderness survival skills to\n handle an emergency situation. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often\n self-implemented, but require many of the same skills.\n","title":"Survival%20skills","headings":["First aid","Shelter","Water","Food","Navigation","Mental preparedness","Important survival items","Survival manuals","Common myths","See also","References","External links",""]},"micro-relation":["2: Infection","1: Panama_Canal","1: Neil_Armstrong","1: John_H._Glenn,_Jr.","1: L._Gordon_Cooper","1: Pete_Conrad","1: Natural_disaster","1: Basic_human_needs","1: Water","1: Food","1: Habitat","1: Calmness","1: Smoke_signal","1: Bushcraft","1: Primitive_skills","1: First_aid","1: Wilderness_first_aid","1: Bite","1: Bone_fractures","1: Burn","1: Headache","1: Heart_attack","1: Hemorrhage","1: Hypothermia","1: Hyperthermia","1: Poison","1: Poisonous_plants","1: Fungi","1: Sprains","1: Ankle","1: Wound","1: Cave","1: Snow_cave","1: Tarpaulin","1: Tent","1: Longhouses_of_the_indigenous_peoples_of_North_America","1: Tinder","1: Solar_Spark_Lighter","1: Fire_piston","1: Heat","1: CamelBak","1: Perspiration","1: Dehydration","1: Lethargy","1: Headaches","1: Dizziness","1: Confusion","1: Endurance","1: Concentration","1: Chlorine_dioxide","1: Root_vegetable","1: List_of_culinary_fruits","1: Edible_mushrooms","1: List_of_nuts","1: List_of_plants_with_edible_leaves","1: Edible_moss","1: Edible_cacti","1: Culinary_algae","1: Animal_trapping","1: Hunting","1: Fishing","1: Celestial_navigation","1: Map","1: Compass","1: GPS","1: Dead_reckoning","1: Juliane_Koepcke","1: Distress_signal","1: Mini_survival_kit","1: Survivalism","1: Woodcraft","1: Yad_Vashem"]}
