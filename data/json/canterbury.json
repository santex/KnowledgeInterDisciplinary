It lies on the River Stour.\n\nOriginally a Brythonic settlement called *Durou̯ernon (composed of the ancient\nBritish roots *duro- \"stronghold\", *u̯erno- \"alder tree\"), it was renamed\nDurovernum Cantiacorum by the Roman conquerors in the 1st century AD. After it\nbecame the chief Jutish settlement, it gained its English name Canterbury,\nitself derived from the Old English 'Cantwareburh' (\"Kent people's stronghold\").\nAfter the Kingdom of Kent's conversion to Christianity in 597, St Augustine\nfounded an episcopal see in the city and became the first Archbishop of\nCanterbury, a position that now heads the Church of England and the worldwide\nAnglican Communion (though the modern-day Province of Canterbury covers the\nentire south of England). Thomas Becket's murder at Canterbury Cathedral in 1170\nled to the cathedral becoming a place of pilgrimage for Christians worldwide.\nThis pilgrimage provided the theme for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century literary\nclassic [[The Canterbury Tales]]. The literary heritage continued with the birth\nof the playwright Christopher Marlowe in the city in the 16th century.\n\nParts of the city have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many\nhistorical structures remain, including a city wall founded in Roman times and\nrebuilt in the 14th century, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey and a Norman\ncastle, and perhaps the oldest school in England, The King's School. Modern\nadditions include the University of Kent, Canterbury Christ Church University,\nthe University College for the Creative Arts, the Marlowe Theatre, and the St\nLawrence Ground, home to Kent County Cricket Club. The city lies at the heart of\nthe City of Canterbury, a local government district.\n\nCanterbury is a popular tourist destination: consistently one of the most-\nvisited cities in the United Kingdom,<ref></ref> the city's economy is heavily\nreliant upon tourism. There is also a substantial student population, brought\nabout by the presence of three universities. Canterbury is, however, a\nrelatively small city, when compared with other British cities.\n","title":"canterbury","headings":["History","Governance","Geography","Demography","Economy","Culture","Transport","Education","Local media","Notable people","International relations","See
