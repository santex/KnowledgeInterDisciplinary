      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\nA 'victimless crime' is a term used to refer to actions that have been ruled\nillegal but do not directly violate or threaten the rights of any other\nindividual. It often involves consensual acts in which two or more persons agree\nto commit a criminal offence in which no other person is involved. For example,\nin the United States current victimless crimes include prostitution, gambling,\nand illicit drug use. Edwin Schur and Hugo Bedau state in their book Victimless\nCrimes: Two sides of a Controversy “some of these laws produce secondary crime,\nand all create new ‘criminals’ many of whom are otherwise law abiding citizens\nand people in authority.” This is an issue in the United States where prison\nrates keep increasing even though it already has the highest prison\npopulation<ref name=WorldPrisonBrief>[http://www.prisonstudies.org/info/worldbr-\nief/wpb_stats.php?area=all&category=wb_poprate Entire world - Prison Population\nRates per 100,000 of the national population. Highest to Lowest Rates]. For more\ndetails about the figures of any country, click on the name of that country.\n[http://www.prisonstudies.org/info/worldbrief World Prison Brief]. International\nCentre for Prison Studies. See\n[http://www.prisonstudies.org/info/worldbrief/wpb_stats.php this page] for\nbreakdowns by region, whole world, prison population total, prison population\nrate, percentage of pre-trial detainees / remand prisoners, percentage of female\nprisoners, percentage of foreign prisoners, and occupancy rate.</ref> out of any\ncountry. The term \"victimless crime\" is not used in jurisprudence, but is rather\nused to cast doubt onto the efficacy of past, existing and proposed legislation;\nor to highlight the unintended consequences of the same. In politics, for\nexample, a lobbyist might use this word with the implication that the law in\nquestion should be abolished.<ref name=\"SchurEdwin\"></ref>\n",
