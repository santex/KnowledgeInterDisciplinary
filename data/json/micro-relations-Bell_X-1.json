(1,600 km/h) in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A,\nhaving greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded\n1,600 m.p.h. (2,575 km/h) in 1954. The X-1 was the first\nairplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the\nso-called X-planes, an American series of experimental rocket planes designated\nfor testing of new technologies and often kept secret.\n","linknr":646,"url":"Bell_X-1","recorded":1362267819,"links":65,"instances":["aircraft","rower"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025896_2010028361.pdf","http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080107-018.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/monograph31.pdf"],"categories":["Edwards
