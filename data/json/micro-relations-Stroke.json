This can be due to\nischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial\nembolism), or a hemorrhage. As a result, the affected area of the\nbrain cannot function, which might result in an inability to move one or more\nlimbs on one side of the body, inability to understand or formulate speech, or\nan inability to see one side of the visual field.\n\nA stroke is a medical emergency and can cause permanent neurological damage and\ndeath. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, previous\nstroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco\nsmoking and atrial fibrillation. High blood pressure is the\nmost important modifiable risk factor of stroke. It is the\nsecond leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nAn ischemic stroke is occasionally treated in a hospital with thrombolysis (also\nknown as a \"clot buster\"), and some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from\nneurosurgery. Treatment to recover any lost function is termed stroke\nrehabilitation, ideally in a stroke unit and involving health professions such\nas speech and language therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy.\nPrevention of recurrence may involve the administration of antiplatelet drugs\nsuch as aspirin and dipyridamole, control and reduction of high blood pressure,\nand the use of statins. Selected patients may benefit from carotid\nendarterectomy and the use of anticoagulants.\n","linknr":1655,"url":"Stroke","recorded":1362482096,"links":103,"instances":["medicine","epidemiology","medical","medical","human","circulatory","medical","tests","medicine","eyelid","united_kingdom","menopause","tests","stroke","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=71128&typ=pdf","http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=71128&typ=pdf","http://www.stroke.scot.nhs.uk/docs/UseOfAnkle-FootOrthosesFollowingStroke.pdf"],"categories":["Stroke|"],"headings":["Classification","Signs
