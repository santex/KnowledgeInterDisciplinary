Located on the Greenwich\nPeninsula in South East London, England, the exhibition was open to the public\nfrom 1 January to 31 December 2000. The project and exhibition was the subject\nof considerable political controversy as it failed to attract the number of\nvisitors anticipated, with recurring financial problems. All of the original\nexhibition and associated complex has since been demolished. The dome still\nexists, and it is now a key exterior feature of The O2. The Prime Meridian\npasses the western edge of the Dome and the nearest London Underground station\nis North Greenwich on the Jubilee Line.\n","linknr":484,"url":"Millennium_Dome","recorded":1362898015,"links":40,"instances":["london","tv_presenter","uk","london_sub_region","london","architects","millennium_dome","charity","united_kingdom","uk","the_amazing_race","london","architect"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cultural
