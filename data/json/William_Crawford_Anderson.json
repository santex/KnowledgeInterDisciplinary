{"cursor":"5786","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'William Crawford Anderson' (1877 – 25 February 1919) was a British\nsocialist politician.\n\nBorn on 13 February 1877 at Findon, Aberdeenshire, the name Crawford in fact\ndoes not appear on his birth certificate. His father Francis Anderson was a\nblacksmith, who married in 1868, Barbara Cruickshank, an ardent radical; she\nbeing responsible for Andersonâs education. At the age of sixteen he was\napprenticed in Aberdeen as a manufacturing chemist and began to attend meetings\nof the local Social Democratic Federation (SDF), at this time he also followed\nTom Mannâs campaign for the by-election in 1896.\n\nAfter listening to an eloquent speech by Carrie Martyn at an SDF meeting, he\nbecame intent on improving himself and began to read rigorously; he read\neverything from Dickens, Ruskin, Thackeray and Hardy, to name but a few. Robert\nBlatchfordâs [[Merrie England (book)|Merrie England]] had a profound effect upon\nAnderson although he did not at this point consider himself to be a socialist,\nbut advocated Land Nationalism.\n\nThe most influential figure in his transition to Socialism was A. E. Fletcher,\nthe editor of [[The New Age]]. Fletcher was running in the Glasgow elections\nsupported by the Independent Labour Party (ILP). In 1900 Anderson moved to\nGlasgow and volunteered to help Fletcher in the election; he in turn joined the\nGlasgow branch of the ILP and also the Shop Assistants Union, then moved to the\nManufacturing Chemists. The transition from radical to socialist politics was\ncompleted after Anderson's move to Glasgow, where he contested the Camlachie\nseat in the 1900 khaki election on a pro-Boer platform, supported by the ILP. He\nwas elected chairman of the Union after just three months. In 1902 he was the\ndelegate of the ILP to the Manchester Conference. By 1903 he had become an\norganiser and official of the union with the aim of strengthening local branches\nand creating new ones, and was a major figure in the vigorous campaign of 1907\nto improve the conditions of shop managers, before he left the union that year.\nIn the same year he attended his first ILP conference and reinforced his\nreputation as a public speaker; he addressed audiences on a number of subjects\nranging from Tariff reform, National Service, and key political issues. During\nhis many addresses it is rumoured he was forced to do an encore by the audience,\nso he repeated part of his speech again. Still only in his early thirties, he\nwas one of the best known leaders of the ILP. To reinforce this, he was elected\nto the National Administration Council of the ILP in 1908. His aim was to avoid\na particular faction. It was noted in 1910 by Fenner Brockway, whom Anderson\ninfluenced to take the job of editor of the Labour Leader, that Anderson was an\nâinfluential member of the NAC, who stood midway between Snowden and MacDonald\nin their quarrels. He wanted to work with the Labour Party to smooth suspicions\nwith which it regarded the ILP.â\n\nIn 1910 he was elected chair of the ILP, a position he held until 1913. In\nSeptember 1911 he was appointed to the Chair of the committee to set up a new\nLabour newspaper, which became the Daily Citizen. He acted as the Vice Chairman\nand leader writer. The paper was launched in 1912 but never flourished; Anderson\nleft before it failed.\n\nIn 1913 he was the speaker for the special conference on the Public Transport\nStrike and in 1914 was a supporter of the Anti-War stance. The National\nCouncil of the ILP met to formulate a manifesto; Anderson read a draft which\nthe council chose above Hardie's or Glasier's. Finally in 1914 on his third\nattempt he entered parliament; however he lost his seat in 1918 due to his\nopposition to war.\n\nIn 1919 he caught a chill which developed into influenza and he died not long\nafter. He was cremated at Golders Green. Anderson was survived by his wife (whom\nhe married in 1911; she d. 1921) and his daughter Nancy.\n\nGlasierâs opinion of him was: âMost naturally gifted parliamentarian born front\nbench, and maybe Prime Minister. Neither a prophet nor a pioneer.â\n","linknr":149,"url":"William_Crawford_Anderson","recorded":1375075265,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Socialist","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Findon,_Aberdeenshire","/wiki/Social_Democratic_Federation","/wiki/Tom_Mann","/wiki/Robert_Blatchford","/wiki/Merrie_England_(book)","/wiki/The_New_Age","/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party","/wiki/Camlachie","/wiki/Khaki_election","/wiki/Tariff_reform","/wiki/National_Service","/wiki/Fenner_Brockway,_Baron_Brockway","/wiki/Philip_Snowden,_1st_Viscount_Snowden","/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald","/wiki/Influenza","/wiki/Golders_Green","/wiki/John_Bruce_Glasier","/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=edit&section=1","http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUanderson.htm","/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=edit&section=2","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-william-anderson","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Joseph_Pointer","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Sheffield_Attercliffe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918","/wiki/Thomas_Worrall_Casey","/wiki/Frederick_William_Jowett","/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party","/wiki/Keir_Hardie","/wiki/Template:Independent_Labour_Party","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Independent_Labour_Party&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Independent_Labour_Party&action=edit","/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party","/wiki/Keir_Hardie","/wiki/Bruce_Glasier","/wiki/Philip_Snowden","/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald","/wiki/Frederick_William_Jowett","/wiki/Keir_Hardie","/wiki/Frederick_William_Jowett","/wiki/Philip_Snowden","/wiki/Richard_Wallhead","/wiki/Reginald_Allen,_1st_Baron_Allen_of_Hurtwood","/wiki/James_Maxton","/wiki/Fenner_Brockway","/wiki/James_Maxton","/wiki/C._A._Smith","/wiki/John_McGovern_(politician)","/wiki/Robert_Edwards_(politician)","/wiki/David_Gibson_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Fred_Barton_(politician)","/wiki/Annie_Maxton","/w/index.php?title=Fred_Morel&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Emrys_Thomas&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/James_Shaw_Maxwell","/wiki/Tom_Mann","/w/index.php?title=John_Penny_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Francis_Johnson_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=John_Taylor_(ILP_politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Paton_(UK_politician)","/wiki/Fenner_Brockway","/wiki/John_McNair_(UK_politician)","/wiki/John_Lister_(UK_politician)","/wiki/France_Littlewood","/w/index.php?title=T._D._Benson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Philip_Snowden","/wiki/George_Benson_(politician)","/wiki/Charles_Roden_Buxton","/wiki/Frederick_William_Jowett","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&oldid=495265036","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1877_births","/wiki/Category:1919_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kincardine_and_Mearns","/wiki/Category:Independent_Labour_Party_MPs","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Politics_of_Sheffield","/wiki/Category:Scottish_socialists","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1910%E2%80%931918","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Crawford+Anderson&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Crawford+Anderson","/wiki/William_Crawford_Anderson","/wiki/Talk:William_Crawford_Anderson","#","/wiki/William_Crawford_Anderson","/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Crawford_Anderson&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Com
