It is\nnamed after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\n\nThe Devonian period experienced the first significant adaptive radiation of\nterrestrial life. Since large vertebrate terrestrial herbivores had not yet\nappeared, free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming\nextensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian,\nseveral groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of\nthe period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial\narthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial\ndiversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \"'Age of\nFish'\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the\nplacoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment.\n\nThe ancestors of all tetrapods began adapting to walking on land, their strong\npectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs\n.

The first ammonite\nmollusks appeared. Trilobites, the mollusk-like brachiopods and the great coral\nreefs, were still common. The Late Devonian extinction severely affected marine\nlife, killing off all placoderms, and all trilobites, save for a few species of\nthe order Proetida.\n\nThe paleogeography was dominated by the supercontinent of Gondwana to the south,\nthe continent of Siberia to the north, and the early formation of the small\ncontinent of Euramerica in between.\n","linknr":751,"url":"Devonian_period","recorded":1362482654,"links":90,"instances":["continent","biology","stratigraphy"],"pdf":["http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/precambrian/Gradstein_Ogg_2004.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Devonian|","Geology
