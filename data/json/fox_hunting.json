      "text" : "\n\n in Devon, England, with the hounds in front.]] 'Fox hunting' is an activity\n involving the tracking, chase, and sometimes killing of a fox, traditionally a\n red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a group of unarmed\n followers led by a master of foxhounds, who follow the hounds on foot or on\n horseback.<ref name=\"burns\"></ref>\n\nFox hunting originated in the form practised until recently in the United\nKingdom in the 16th century, but is practised all over the world, including in\nAustralia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy and the United States.<ref></ref><ref\nname=\"BBC1\"></ref> In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes\nwith firearms similar to spotlighting or deer hunting. In much of the world\nhunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g.,\ndeer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, \"hunting\" without\nqualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds-\nbeagling, stag hunting, mink hunting, drag hunting or hunting the clean boot) as\ndescribed here.\n\nThe sport is controversial, particularly in the UK, where it was banned in\nScotland in 2002, and in England and Wales in November 2004 (law enforced from\nFebruary 2005),<ref name=BBCNov192004></ref> though shooting foxes as vermin\nremained legal. Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural\nculture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control,<ref name=\"MFH-\nsocial\"></ref><ref name=MFH-conservation></ref><ref name=MFH-pest></ref> while\nopponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary.<ref name=LACS-morality></ref>\n",
