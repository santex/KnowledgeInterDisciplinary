The Tar\nRiver becomes the tidal Pamlico River once it underpasses the U.S. Highway 17\nBridge in Washington, North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina was originally a naval stores colony--that is, the blanket of\nlong leaf pines that covered the coastal plain was used by the British Navy for\nships' masts and the pine pitch was used to manufacture tar caulking for\nvessels. The river derives its name from its historic use as a major route for\ntar-laden barges as they headed to the sea. The city of Tarboro is on the banks\nof the river. Recent research conducted by East Carolina University, Greenville\nand Pitt County historians has uncovered documentation noting that before the\nCivil War, the North Carolina Legislature had appropriated funds to construct\ndams and locks on the Tar River in an attempt to facilitate almost year round\nnavigation for the farm products and naval stores shipping plus passenger boats\nwhich were travelling between Tarboro, through Greenville to Washington.\n\n Among the towns and cities along its\ncourse are Louisburg, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, and Greenville. The village of\nOld Sparta was formerly an important riverport on the Tar, but has declined\nin the 20th century.\n\nOne account of the significance of the river's name comes from the Civil War.\n\"It may have been inspired by an incident back in North Carolina. As the\nConfederates prepared to evacuate Washington, NC, in March 1862, they sent\nsquads up and down the Tar River to destroy all the stocks of cotton and naval\nstores which had been prepared by the small farms along the river, to prevent\nthem from falling into the hands of the Union soldiers. At Taftâs store they\nfound over 1,000 barrels of turpentine and tar. The amount was too large to\nburn, as it would take several houses with it. So the barrels were rolled into\nthe river, where the hoops were cut in two and the contents dumped into the\nriver. Three months later, in June, four hundred Union prisoners of war were\nsent from Salisbury, NC to Washington, NC, to be exchanged for Confederate\nprisoners. Before coming into Washington, the soldiers asked permission to bathe\nin the river and clean themselves up. Guards were posted along the river banks,\nand the prisoners were allowed to strip then wade into the river to wash.\nInstead, they stirred up the river bottom so much that the tar smeared their\nbodies completely, each man coming out of the water with a stick to scour the\ntar off their bodies and legs. One Confederate yelled out, âHello boys, whatâs\nthe matter?â The reply from the disgusted Yankee soldier was, âWe have heard of\nTar River all our lives but never believed that there really was any such place,\nbut damned if we havenât found it, the whole bed of it is tar!â J. D.\nMeyers. âHow the Yankees Found the Tar River.â Carolina and the Southern Cross.\nVolume 1 (7), September 1913. Page 5.\n\nThe river was strongly affected by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and caused much\nflooding in the area. The Tar River suffered the worst flooding from the\nhurricane, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested\n24 feet (7.3 m) above flood stage. When the river flooded in 1999, the height in\nGreenville was approximately 30ft.\n\nThere is also a Tar River in Montserrat, West Indies, a river Tar in Ireland,and\na Tar River in south Kyrgyzstan.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Tar_River","recorded":1375080144,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Pamlicorivermap.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Pamlicorivermap.png/300px-Pamlicorivermap.png","/wiki/River","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/Estuary","/wiki/Pamlico_Sound","/wiki/Pamlico_River","/wiki/U.S._Route_17","/wiki/Washington,_North_Carolina","/wiki/File:Floyd_Tar_River_Flooding.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Floyd_Tar_River_Flooding.jpg","/wiki/File:Floyd_Tar_River_Flooding.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Louisburg,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Rocky_Mount,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Tarboro,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Greenville,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Confederate_States_Army","/wiki/Turpentine","/wiki/Tar","/wiki/Salisbury,_NC","/wiki/Washington,_NC","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd","/wiki/Montserrat","/wiki/West_Indies","/wiki/River_Tar","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Kyrgyzstan","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit&section=2","http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1024343","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Tar_River&params=35_33_9_N_77_5_5_W_","/wiki/File:Flag-map_of_North_Carolina.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Flag-map_of_North_Carolina.svg/40px-Flag-map_of_North_Carolina.svg.png","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit","/wiki/Template:NorthCarolina-geo-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:NorthCarolina-geo-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NorthCarolina-geo-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&oldid=540074137","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Rivers_of_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:North_Carolina_geography_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tar+River&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tar+River","/wiki/Tar_River","/wiki/Talk:Tar_River","#","/wiki/Tar_River","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tar_River","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tar_River","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&oldid=540074137","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q841725","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Tar_River&id=540074137","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Tar+River","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Tar+River&oldid=540074137&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Tar_River&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_River","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_River","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%80_(%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q841725#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Cr
