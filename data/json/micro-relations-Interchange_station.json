{"cursor":"3444","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, United Kingdom.]]\n\nAn 'interchange station' (in the UK, most Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong\n[http://mtr.hk365day.com/images/TKOL/LOAN.jpg Photo of a \"Public transport\ninterchange\" sign] taken in LOHAS Park Station of Hong Kong's MTR and\nIreland) or a 'transfer station' (in Canada and the USA) is a train station for\nmore than one railway route in a public transport system, and allows passengers\nto change from one route to another.\n\nTransfer may occur within the same mode, or between rail modes, or to buses (for\nstations with bus termini attached). Such stations usually have more platforms\nthan single route stations. They may be required to pay extra fare for the\ninterchange if they leave a paid area.\n\nIn most rapid transit, an 'interchange station' is a stop at which a passenger\ncan change from one line to another without incurring another full fare or\nhaving to leave the station proper.\n\nSome interchange stations offer only transfer between routes and do not have the\nability for passengers to enter or exit the network, for instance Cornbrook on\nthe Manchester Metrolink light rail system in Manchester, United Kingdom\n(although passenger entrances and exits for the station were established in\n2005), and Shing Mun Tunnels Bus Interchange in the New Territories, Hong Kong.\nManhattan Transfer (PRR station) on the Pennsylvania Railroad was located\noutside Newark, New Jersey.\n\nSometimes cross-platform interchange is offered between mainline railways and\ncity metro systems, such as Barking station and Stratford station in London,\nEngland, United Kingdom, and Nam Cheong Station in New Kowloon, Hong Kong.\n\nIn some cases, no dedicated underground passage or footbridge is provided, and\ntherefore passengers have to transfer between two parts of a station through\ncity streets. Examples include Kuramae Station of Toei in Tokyo, Japan,\nLexington Avenue/59th Street/Lexington Avenueâ63rd Street stations in New York\nCity, United States, and Xizhimen, Fuxingmen, Jianguomen and Dongzhimen stations\nin Beijing, People's Republic of China.\n\nThere are also bus interchanges, where people can change between different bus\nroutes with no extra fare or only the differences of the fares of the two\nroutes. Examples include Tai Lam Tunnel Bus Interchange and Shing Mun Tunnel Bus\nInterchange in the New Territories, Hong Kong, and in the downtown of Lafayette,\nIndiana, United States.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Interchange_station","recorded":1362478019,"links":27,"instances":["prr_station","new_york_city_subway","rapid_transit","new_york_city_subway"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Railway stations"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Jewellery_Quarter_railway_station_train_and_tram_-_Birmingham_-_2005-10-14.jpg/220px-Jewellery_Quarter_railway_station_train_and_tram_-_Birmingham_-_2005-10-14.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Train_station.svg/50px-Train_station.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/BSicon_BUS.svg/30px-BSicon_BUS.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subway","rapid_transit"],["manhattan_transfer","prr_station"],["lexington_avenue_/_59th_street","new_york_city_subway"],["lexington_avenue_–_63rd_street","new_york_city_subway"]],"members":["manhattan_transfer","subway"],"related":["United_Kingdom","British_English","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Hong_Kong","LOHAS_Park_Station","Hong_Kong","MTR","Ireland","Canadian_English","American_English","Train_station","Railway","Public_transport","Passenger","Bus","Bus_terminus","Railway_platform","Fare","Paid_area","Subway_(rapid_transit)","Cornbrook_Metrolink_station","Manchester_Metrolink","Light_rail","Shing_Mun_Tunnels_Bus_Interchange","Manhattan_Transfer_(PRR_station)","Pennsylvania_Railroad","Newark,_New_Jersey","Cross-platform_interchange","Barking_station","Stratford_station","London","Nam_Cheong_Station","New_Kowloon","Kuramae_Station","Toei","Tokyo","Lexington_Avenue_/_59th_Street_(New_York_City_Subway)","Lexington_Avenue_–_63rd_Street_(New_York_City_Subway)","New_York_City","Xizhimen","Fuxingmen","Jianguomen","Dongzhimen","Beijing","Bus_interchange","Tai_Lam_Tunnel_Bus_Interchange","Shing_Mun_Tunnels_Bus_Interchange","New_Territories","Lafayette,_IN","Indiana","Cross-platform_interchange","Railway_station_layout"]}
