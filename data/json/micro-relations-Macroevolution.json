In Eugenie Scott and Glenn\nBranch, [[List of works on intelligent design#Anthologies 2|Not in Our\nClassrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools]], Beacon Press,\nBoston ISBN 0807032786 Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that\noccurs at or above the level of species, in contrast with\nmicroevolution, which refers to smaller evolutionary changes\n(typically described as changes in allele frequencies) within a species or\npopulation. Contrary to claims by creationists, macro\nand microevolution describe fundamentally identical processes on different time\nscales.\n\nThe process of speciation may fall within the purview of either, depending on\nthe forces thought to drive it. Paleontology, evolutionary developmental\nbiology, comparative genomics and genomic phylostratigraphy contribute most of\nthe evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as\nmacroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers\nduring the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs.\n\nAbrupt transformations from one biologic system to another, for example the\npassing of life from water into land or the transition from invertebrates to\nvertebrates, are rare. Few major biological types have emerged during the\nevolutionary history of life and most of them survive till today. When lifeforms\ntake such giant leaps, they meet little to no competition and are able to\nexploit a plethora of available niches, following a pattern of adaptive\nradiation. This can lead to convergent evolution, where unrelated populations\ndisplay similar adaptations. Introduction to Ecology\n(1983) - J.C. Emberlin, chapter 8\n\nThe evolutionary course of Equidae (wide family including all horses and related\nanimals) is often viewed as a typical example of macroevolution. The earliest\nknown genus, [[Hyracotherium]] (now reclassified as a palaeothere), was a\nherbivore animal resembling a dog that lived in the early Cenozoic. As its\nhabitat transformed into an open arid grassland, selective pressure required\nthat the animal become a fast grazer. Thus elongation of legs and head as well\nas reduction of toes gradually occurred, producing the only extant genus of\nEquidae, [[Equus (genus)|Equus]].\n","linknr":485,"url":"Macroevolution","recorded":1362483395,"links":41,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Origin of the term","Macroevolution and the modern evolutionary synthesis","Research topics","Misuse","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["development","biology"]],"members":["development"],"related":["Evolution","Gene_pool","Nick_Matzke","Paul_R._Gross","Eugenie_Scott","Glenn_Branch","Species","Microevolution","Allele_frequency","Creationism","Speciation","Paleontology","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Comparative_genomics","Genomic_phylostratigraphy","Theropod","Evolutionary_history_of_life","Ecological_niche","Adaptive_radiation","Convergent_evolution","Equidae","Palaeothere","Cenozoic","Extant_taxon","Entomology","Yuri_Filipchenko","Richard_Goldschmidt","Otto_Schindewolf","Dobzhansky","Bernhard_Rensch","Ernst_Mayr","Neo-Darwinian","Dobzhansky","Ernst_Mayr","Bernhard_Rensch","Richard_Goldschmidt","Otto_Schindewolf","John_Maynard_Smith","Richard_Dawkins","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Ernst_W._Mayr","Polyploidy","Development_(biology)","Adaptive_radiation","Cambrian_explosion","The_Evolution_of_the_Genome","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Extinction_event","Speciation","Extinction","Punctuated_equilibrium","Gradualism","Heterochrony","Phenotypic_plasticity","Creation-evolution_controversy","Speciation","Creation_science","Genus","Taxonomy","Scientific_community","Earth","Scientific_community","Common_descent","Evolution_as_theory_and_fact","TalkOrigins_Archive","Douglas_Futuyma","Nicholas_Matzke","Paul_R._Gross","Creationism","Moving_the_goalposts","List_of_transitional_fossils","Transitional_fossil","Microevolution","Speciation"]}
