A diagnosis of periodontitis is established by inspecting the\nsoft gum tissues around the teeth with a probe (i.e., a clinical examination)\nand by evaluating the patient's X-ray films (i.e. a radiographic examination),\nto determine the amount of bone loss around the teeth. Specialists in\nthe treatment of periodontitis are periodontists; their field is known as\n\"periodontology\" or \"periodontics\".\n\nThe word \"periodontitis\" comes from the Greek peri, \"around\", odous (genitive\nodontos), \"tooth\", and the suffix -itis, in medical terminology \"inflammation\".\n","linknr":965,"url":"Periodontitis","recorded":1362500920,"links":48,"instances":["tooth"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Inflammations","Periodontal disorders"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Prevention","Management","Prognosis","Epidemiology","In other animals","See also","Further reading","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Paro1.JPG/230px-Paro1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Periodontalboneloss.JPG/220px-Periodontalboneloss.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Overhangs.jpg/275px-Overhangs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Generalized_perio_-touched_up.jpg/220px-Generalized_perio_-touched_up.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Periodontal_disease_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/220px-Periodontal_disease_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Dentistry_stub.svg/14px-Dentistry_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molar","tooth"]],"members":["molar"],"related":["Disease","Periodontium","Tooth","Alveolar_bone","Tooth_loss","Microorganism","Immune","Gingiva","Periodontal_probe","Radiograph","Periodontist","Greek_Language","Genitive_case","Gingivitis","Chronic_periodontitis","Aggressive_periodontitis","Periodontitis_as_a_manifestation_of_systemic_disease","Necrotizing_periodontal_diseases","Abscesses_of_the_periodontium","Combined_periodontic-endodontic_lesions","Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry","Periodontal_ligament","Dental_plaque","Tooth","Dental_floss","Halitosis","Gingival_and_periodontal_pockets","Collagenases","Occlusal_trauma","Inflammation","C-reactive_protein","Interleukin-6","Stroke","Myocardial_infarction","Atherosclerosis","Impaired_fasting_glucose","Diabetes_mellitus","Blood","Glucose","Epidemiology","Erectile_dysfunction","Periodontium","Gingiva","Cementum","Dental_alveolus","Periodontal_ligament","Connective_tissue","Human_mandible","Periodontal_ligament","Premolar","Occlusal_trauma","Etiology","Oral_hygiene","Mycosis","Dental_plaque","Nutrition","Diabetes","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Gingival_fibers","Periodontal_pocket","Health_effects_of_tobacco","Ehlers–Danlos_syndrome","Papillon-Lefèvre_syndrome","Dental_calculus","Down_syndrome","Mycosis","Oral_hygiene","Toothbrush","Flossing","Mouthwash","Chlorhexidine_gluconate","Oral_hygiene","Tooth","Cancer","Furcation_defect","Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry","Saliva","Oral_hygiene","Toothbrush","Flossing","Interdental_brush","Arthritis","Local_anesthesia","Molar_(tooth)","Furcation_defect","Surgery","Dental_calculus","Hydrogen_peroxide","Periostat","Periodontal_probe","Minocycline","Sri_Lanka","Dental_decay","United_States","Prevalence","Israel","Yemen","Africa","South_Asia","Mediterranean","Europe","Dog","Kidney","Liver","Heart","Endocarditis","Bronchitis","Fibrosis","Chronic_periodontitis","Dental_implant","Dental_plaque","Edentulism","Epidemiology_of_periodontal_diseases","Gingivitis","Gum_graft","Head_and_neck_anatomy","LANAP","Oral_microbiology","Osteoimmunology","Periodontist","Tooth_loss"]}
