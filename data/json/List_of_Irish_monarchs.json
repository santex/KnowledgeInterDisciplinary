He was\narguably the first undisputed full king of Ireland. He was also the only Gaelic\none, as the events of the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 undid Gaelic\nefforts at establishing an all-island united kingdom of Ireland. King RuaidrÃ­\ndied at Cong in 1198, and was buried at Clonmacnoise. He was the last fully\nrecognised Gaelic monarch of Ireland. Later claimants such as Brian Ua Neill\n(died 1260) and Edward Bruce (died 1318) were not recognised as such even among\nthe native Irish.\n\n\nFrom Lordship of Ireland to British monarchy\n\nIn 1177, as the leader of the Norman invasion of Ireland, King Henry II of\nEngland created the title of Lord of Ireland for his youngest son John, who was\nnot then expected to succeed to any other title. John became king in 1199, and\nthe title was held thereafter by the monarchs of England. Under the Crown of\nIreland Act 1542 The Lordship of Ireland was raised into the Kingdom of Ireland.\nThe Kingdom of Ireland continued after the Acts of Union 1707 which united the\nkingdoms of England and Scotland.\n* From King John (of the House of Plantagenet) to King Henry VIII (of the House\n  of Tudor), English monarchs were also Lords of Ireland.\n* From King Henry VIII to Queen Anne (of the House of Stuart), English monarchs\n  were also King or Queen of Ireland.\n* From Queen Anne to King George III (of the House of Hanover), British monarchs\n  were also King or Queen of Ireland. *Note: In 1506 Lambert Simnel, an English\n  pretender to the throne, was crowned Edward VI of Ireland During the reign of\n  George III of the United Kingdom the Kingdoms of Great Britain and of Ireland\n  merged to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by the terms\n  of the Act of Union 1800.\n\nBritish monarchy to Irish monarchy\n\nWith the passage in 1931 of the Statute of Westminster, the British monarch\n(that is, King George V in his British council, parliament, and courts) ceased\nto have dominion over Ireland; only the monarch in right of Ireland had\nsovereignty over that realm, advised by Irish ministers and acting in his Irish\nparliament and courts only, though the monarch of Ireland\nand the monarch of the United Kingdom (and the monarch of all the Dominions and\nlater Commonwealth realms) were the same person. This arrangement lasted through\nthe reigns of George V, Edward VIII, and George VI.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Act proclaimed Ireland a republic in 1949 by removing\nthe remaining duties of the monarch. Ireland consequently withdrew from the\nBritish Commonwealth.\n\nNorthern Ireland continues as a constituent part of United Kingdom of Great\nBritain and Northern Ireland.\n\nReferences\n","linknr":155,"url":"List_of_Irish_monarchs","recorded":1375073848,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/List_of_Irish_queens_and_consorts","#Early_medieval_kings_in_Ireland","#High_Kings_of_Ireland_846.E2.80.931198","#From_Lordship_of_Ireland_to_British_monarchy","#British_monarchy_to_Irish_monarchy","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Early_Medieval_Ireland","/wiki/Gaelic_kingdoms_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Irish_kings","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland#Historical_High_Kings_of_Ireland","/wiki/Mael_Sechnaill_mac_Maele_Ruanaid","/wiki/Ruaidr%C3%AD_Ua_Conchobair","/wiki/File:Rory_O%27Connor_Stone_Carving.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Rory_O%27Connor_Stone_Carving.jpg/220px-Rory_O%27Connor_Stone_Carving.jpg","/wiki/File:Rory_O%27Connor_Stone_Carving.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Ruaidr%C3%AD_Ua_Conchobair","/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","/wiki/Cong,_County_Mayo","/wiki/Clonmacnoise","/wiki/Brian_Ua_Neill","/wiki/Edward_Bruce","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs","/wiki/List_of_British_monarchs","/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","/wiki/Henry_II_of_England","/wiki/Lordship_of_Ireland","/wiki/John_of_England","/wiki/Crown_of_Ireland_Act_1542","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs#House_of_Plantagenet","/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs#House_of_Tudor","/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs#House_of_Stuart_.28restored.29","/wiki/List_of_British_monarchs#House_of_Hanover","/wiki/Lambert_Simnel","/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Act_of_Union_1800","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Monarchy_in_the_Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931","/wiki/George_V","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Commonwealth_realm","/wiki/Personal_union","/wiki/Edward_VIII","/wiki/George_VI","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Ireland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.generalmichaelcollins.com/Fine_Gael/Saorstat_Eireann.html","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.ca/books?id=Zn22MvnyW2QC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-84603-270-7","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-333-80265-9","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Irish_monarchs&oldid=559019327","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Lists_of_Irish_monarchs","/wiki/Category:Irish_kings","/wiki/Category:Monarchs_in_the_British_Isles","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_April_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+Irish+monarchs&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+Irish+monarchs","/wiki/List_of_Irish_monarchs","/wiki/Talk:List_of_Irish_monarchs","#","/wiki/List_of_Irish_monarchs","/w/index.php?title=List_of_
