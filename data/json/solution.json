The solvent does the dissolving. The\nsolution more or less takes on the characteristics of the solvent including its\nphase, and the solvent is commonly the major fraction of the mixture. The\nconcentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of how much of that solute\nis dissolved in the solvent.\n",
