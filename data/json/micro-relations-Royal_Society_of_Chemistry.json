At its inception the Society had a combined membership of\n34,000 in the UK and a further 8,000 abroad. The headquarters of the\nSociety are at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. It also has offices in\nThomas Graham House in Cambridge where RSC Publishing is based. The Society has\noffices in the United States at the University City Science Center,\nPhiladelphia, in both Beijing and Shanghai, China and Bangalore,\nIndia.\n\nThe organisation carries out research, publishes journals, books and\ndatabases, as well as hosting conferences, seminars and workshops. It is the\nprofessional body for chemistry in the UK, with the ability to award the\nstatus of Chartered Chemist (CChem)and, through the\n[http://www.sciencecouncil.org Science Council] the awards of\n[http://www.charteredscientist.org Chartered Scientist] (CSci),\n[http://www.sciencecouncil.org/professional_registers Registered Scientist]\n(RSci) and [http://www.sciencecouncil.org/professional_registers Registered\nScience Technician] )RScTech) to suitably qualified candidates. The\ndesignation FRSC is given to a group of elected Fellows who have made major\ncontributions to chemistry. The names of Fellows are published each year in\n[[The Times]] (London).\n","linknr":420,"url":"Royal_Society_of_Chemistry","recorded":1362510052,"links":27,"instances":["chemist","chemist","scientist","london","chemist","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.rsc.org/images/GraduateQualificationsChemistry_tcm18-94249.pdf"],"categories":["Organizations established in 1980","Learned societies of the United Kingdom","Learned societies","Science and technology in the United Kingdom","Chemistry societies","Chemical education","Royal Society of Chemistry|","1980 establishments in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["President","Membership grades and post-nominals","Divisions and forums","Local sections","Publications","Chemistry Centre","Library and information centre","Prizes and awards","Other Resources","Arms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/RSC.svg/200px-RSC.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/RoySocChem_5770.jpg/200px-RoySocChem_5770.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/ChemistryCentreLondon.jpg/250px-ChemistryCentreLondon.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/RSC_Arms.svg/200px-RSC_Arms.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["richard_norman","chemist"],["rex_richards","scientist"],["chemical_science","journal"],["rex_richards","scientist"],["helen_fielding","chemist"],["jonathan_reid","chemist"],["chemistry_centre","london"]],"members":["helen_fielding","jonathan_reid","rex_richards","chemistry_centre","richard_norman","chemical_science"],"related":["Learned_society","London","Lesley_Yellowlees","Learned_society","Professional_association","United_Kingdom","Chemistry","Chemical_Society","Royal_Institute_of_Chemistry","Faraday_Society","Society_for_Analytical_Chemistry","Burlington_House","Piccadilly","London","Cambridge","United_States","University_City_Science_Center","Philadelphia","Beijing","Shanghai","People's_Republic_of_China","Bangalore","India","Academic_journal","Chartered_Chemist","Lelsey_Yellowlees","Ewart_Jones","John_Cadogan","Richard_Norman_(chemist)","Jack_Lewis,_Baron_Lewis_of_Newnham","John_Mason_Ward","Rex_Richards_(scientist)","Charles_Wayne_Rees","John_Howard_Purnell","Edward_William_Abel","Anthony_Ledwith","Steven_V._Ley","Harry_Kroto","Simon_Campbell","James_Feast","Post-nominal_letters","Science_Council","Chartered_Scientist","European_Communities_Chemistry_Council","Public_Analyst","Royal_Institute_of_Chemistry","Analytical_chemistry","John_Dalton","Inorganic_chemistry","Chemistry_education","Michael_Faraday","Physical_chemistry","Organic_chemistry","Republic_of_Ireland","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Not_for_profit","Scientific_journals","Chemical_Science_(journal)","Chemistry_World","Chris_Smith,_The_Naked_Scientist","The_Naked_Scientists","Faraday_Society","Piccadilly","London","W_postcode_area","London","Royal_Society_of_Chemistry","Burlington_House","Green_Park_tube_station","Piccadilly_Circus_tube_station","Philip_Ball","Antony_John_Williams","John_Emsley","Michael_Faraday","Harrison-Meldola_Memorial_Prizes","Corday-Morgan_medal","Meldola_Medal_and_Prize","Christopher_Kelk_Ingold","Cyril_Norman_Hinshelwood","Derek_Harold_Richard_Barton","Sir_Ronald_Sydney_Nyholm","Frederick_Sanger","John_Cornforth","Rex_Richards_(scientist)","George_Porter","Marlow_Award","Physical_chemistry","Chemical_physics","Andrew_Orr-Ewing","Jonathan_A._Jones","Helen_Fielding_(Chemist)","Jonathan_Essex","Daren_Caruana","Jonathan_Reid_(chemist)","Julie_Macpherson","Fred_Manby","Alessandro_Troisi","Chemistry_Centre_(London)","Society_of_Chemical_Industry","Société_Chimique_de_France","Gesellschaft_Deutscher_Chemiker","American_Chemical_Society","Chemical_Society_of_Japan"]}
