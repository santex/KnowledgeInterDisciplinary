The great majority are\nopen-ended at the front, although many seem designed for near-permanent wear and\nwould have been difficult to remove. Smaller torcs worn around the wrist are\ncalled bracelets instead. Torcs are found in the Scythian, Illyrian The\nIllyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, page 223, \"Illyrian chiefs\nwore heavy bronze torques\" Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the\nEuropean Iron Age from around the 8th century BC to the 3rd\ncentury AD. The Celtic torc disappears in the Migration Period, but during\nthe Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces came back into fashion.
