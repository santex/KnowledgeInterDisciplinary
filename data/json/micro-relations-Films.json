A film is created by photographing actual\nscenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature\nmodels using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer\nanimation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other\nvisual effects. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry.\n\nFilms usually include an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the\nspoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs\nalong a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.\n\nFilms are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those\ncultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art\nform, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educatingâor\nindoctrinatingâcitizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of\ncommunication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using\ndubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer.\n\nThe individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection,\na rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved\ninto position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions\nbecause of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a\nvisual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The\nperception of motion is due to a psychological effect called beta movement.\n\nThe name \"film\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called\nfilm stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion\npictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including\npicture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay and flick. The most common term\nin the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Terms for the\nfield in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies and\ncinema; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays,\nespecially by European writers. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes\nused instead of screen.\n","linknr":1024,"url":"Films","recorded":1362553206,"links":182,"instances":["aficionado","film","optics","signal","disambiguation","filming","filmmaking","performing_arts","movie","filming","sense","theatre","music","philosophy","photography","theatre"],"pdf":[],"categories":["French
