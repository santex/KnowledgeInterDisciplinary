Some naturally occurring proteins have a relatively small number of\nsubunits and therefore described as oligomeric, for example hemoglobin or DNA\npolymerase. Others may consist from a very large number of subunits and\ntherefore described as multimeric, for example microtubules and other\ncytoskeleton proteins. The subunits of a multimeric protein may be identical,\nhomologous or totally dissimilar and dedicated to disparate tasks. In some\nprotein assemblies, one subunit may be referred to as a \"regulatory subunit\"\nand another as a \"catalytic subunit.\" An enzyme composed of both regulatory\nand catalytic subunits when assembled is often referred to as a holoenzyme.\nOne subunit is made of one polypeptide chain. A polypeptide chain has one\ngene coding for it â meaning that a protein must have one gene for each\nunique subunit.\n\nA subunit is often named with a Greek or Roman letter, and the numbers of this\ntype of subunit in a protein is indicated by a subscript. For example, ATP\nsynthase has a type of subunit called α. Three of these are present in the\nATP synthase molecule, and is therefore designated α 3. Larger\ngroups of subunits can also the specified, like α 3β 3-\nhexamer and c-ring.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Protein_subunit","recorded":1362534896,"links":24,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein structure"],"headings":["Vaccines","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/HLA-A11.png/274px-HLA-A11.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Binding_pocket","Structural_biology","Polypeptide_chain","Protein_complex","Hemoglobin","DNA_polymerase","Microtubule","Cytoskeleton","Homology_(biology)","Holoenzyme","Polypeptide","Gene","ATP_synthase","Antigen","Recombinant_vaccine","Ebola","HIV","Vi_capsular_polysaccharide_vaccine","Typhoid","Quaternary_structure","Allostery","Cooperative_binding"]}
