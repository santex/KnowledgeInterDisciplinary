It was scored by\nStewart Copeland, a member of The Police.\n\nMarketed as a hip hop 'hood film, Fresh went relatively unnoticed by the public,\nbut won critical acclaim. An emotional coming of age story, it offers a\nrealistic glimpse of the dangerous life in New York City's projects during the\ncrack epidemic. \"There's shocking resonance to the notion of a grade-school boy\nwho's become a criminal out of sheer pragmatism,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's\nOwen Gleiberman.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Fresh_(1994_film)","recorded":1362675597,"links":17,"instances":["actor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1994 films","Miramax Films films","Hood films","1990s drama films","Sundance Film Festival award winners","American crime drama films","Directorial debut films","Films about chess","Films set in New York City","Films directed by Boaz Yakin"],"headings":["Plot","Reception","Soundtrack","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Fresh_movie_90s.jpg/220px-Fresh_movie_90s.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sean_nelson","actor"],["sean_nelson","actor"]],"members":["sean_nelson"],"related":["Boaz_Yakin","Sean_Nelson_(actor)","Giancarlo_Esposito","Samuel_L._Jackson","N'Bushe_Wright","Boaz_Yakin","Stewart_Copeland","Miramax_Films","Lawrence_Bender","Crime_film","Boaz_Yakin","Lawrence_Bender","Cameo_appearance","Film_score","Stewart_Copeland","The_Police","Hip_hop_culture","Hood_film","Crack_epidemic","Entertainment_Weekly","Owen_Gleiberman","Sean_Nelson_(actor)","Giancarlo_Esposito","Chess","Samuel_L._Jackson","N'Bushe_Wright","Rotten_Tomatoes","Weighted_mean","Janet_Maslin","Owen_Gleiberman","James_Berardinelli","Roger_Ebert","Sundance_Film_Festival","Independent_Spirit_Awards","RCA_Records","Wu-Tang_Clan","Old_school_hip_hop","The_Cold_Crush_Brothers","Whodini","Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five","Allmusic"]}
