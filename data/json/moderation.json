If you pour more water, it\n becomes inclined again.]] 'Moderation' is the process of eliminating or\n lessening extremes. It is used to ensure normality throughout the medium on\n which it is being conducted. Common uses of moderation include: *Ensuring\n consistency and accuracy in the marking of student assessments. *A moderator\n may remove unsuitable contributions from the website, forum or IRC channel they\n represent in accordance with their moderation system. *A more proactive nuance\n is found in the Methodist church's use of the term for the heads of its\n conferences. *A neutron moderator is used to slow down neutrons in a nuclear\n reactor. *A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not\n indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation. *A lifestyle choice by\n which many college students abide so as not to become alcoholics.\n\n'Moderation' is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of\nApollo at Delphi bore the inscription Meden Agan (μηδὲν ἄγαν) - 'Nothing in\nexcess'. Doing something \"in moderation\" means not doing it excessively. For\ninstance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food\ngroups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to\nharmless levels. Similarly in Christianity, moderationism is the position that\ndrinking alcoholic beverages temperately is permissible, though drunkenness is\nforbidden (see Christianity and alcohol). Moderation is a characteristic of the\nSwedish national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym\nLagom. Moderate Muslims adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way\nto grasp meaning from the Quran.\n",
