It is separated into compartments by membranes. For\nexample, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into compartments.\n\nThe contents of a eukaryotic cell within the cell membrane, excluding the cell\nnucleus and other organelles (e.g. mitochondria, plastides, lumen of ER etc.),\nare referred to as the cytoplasm. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions\nof metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or\nin the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still\noccur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.\n\nThe cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although\nwater forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure and properties\nwithin cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as\nsodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular\nfluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as\nosmoregulation and cell signaling. The cytosol also contains large amounts\nof macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through\nmacromolecular crowding.\n\nAlthough once thought to be a simple solution of molecules, multiple levels of\norganization exist in the cytosol. These include concentration gradients of\nsmall molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to\ncarry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and\ncarboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.\n","linknr":771,"url":"Cytosol","recorded":1362685646,"links":52,"instances":["biology","chemistry","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/roy.goodacre/learning/metabprof/Goodacre-TibTech2004.pdf","http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/roy.goodacre/learning/metabprof/Goodacre-TibTech2004.pdf","http://webusers.physics.illinois.edu/~alek/598PNM/hw/IntRevCytol.pdf","http://webusers.physics.illinois.edu/~alek/598PNM/hw/IntRevCytol.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/mar2006/137.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/mar2006/137.pdf","http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000002765/znw00107000025.pdf","http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000002765/znw00107000025.pdf"],"categories":["Cell anatomy"],"headings":["Definition","Properties and composition","Organization","Function","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Crowded_cytosol.png/300px-Crowded_cytosol.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Animal_Cell.svg/300px-Animal_Cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Carboxysome.png/400px-Carboxysome.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["activity","chemistry"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","activity","transcription","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Mitochondrial_matrix","Mitochondrion","Eukaryotic_cell","Cell_membrane","Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Prokaryotes","Metabolism","Periplasmic_space","Metabolic_pathway","Ion","Sodium","Potassium","Extracellular_fluid","Osmoregulation","Cell_signaling","Macromolecule","Macromolecular_crowding","Diffusion","Calcium","Enzyme","Metabolic_pathway","Protein_complex","Proteasome","Carboxysome","Ultracentrifuge","Vacuole","Molecular_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Metabolite","Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","Water","Intracellular_fluid","PH","Viscosity","Diffusion","Macromolecule","Brine_shrimp","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Water_cluster","Hydrogen_bond","Solvation","Osmosis","Extracellular_fluid","Molar_concentration","Molar_concentration","Potassium","Sodium","Chloride","Bicarbonate","Amino_acid","Magnesium","Calcium","Osmoregulation","Osmosis","Macromolecule","Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase","Membrane_potential","Potential_difference","Osmoprotectant","Betaines","Trehalose","Cryptobiosis","Calcium","Second_messenger","Calcium_signaling","Hormone","Action_potential","Calmodulin","Protein_kinase_C","Cell_membrane","Cytoskeleton","Saponin","Microtrabecular_lattice","Genome","Nucleoid","DNA","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA_replication","Chromosome","Plasmid","Cell_nucleus","Nuclear_pore","Nanometre","Macromolecular_crowding","Activity_(chemistry)","Reaction_rate","Chemical_equilibrium","Dissociation_constant","Protein_complex","DNA-binding_protein","Genome","Diffusion","Calcium_channel","Micrometre","Millisecond","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","Mitochondrion","Protein_complex","Substrate_channeling","Bacterial_microcompartment","Electron_microscope","Proteasome","Protease","Ubiquitin","Bacterial_microcompartments","Nanometre","Carboxysome","Carbon_fixation","RuBisCO","Cytoskeleton","Nanometre","Ribosome","Actin","Ribosome","Signal_transduction","Cell_nucleus","Cytokinesis","Nuclear_membrane","Mitosis","Hydrophobe","Fatty_acid","Sterol","Endocytosis","Secretion","Vesicle_(biology)","Motor_protein","Protein_biosynthesis","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Glycolysis","Gluconeogenesis","Chloroplast","Apicoplast","Apicomplexa"]}
