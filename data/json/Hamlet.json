Set in the Kingdom of Denmark, the play\ndramatizes the revenge Prince Hamlet exacts on his uncle Claudius for murdering\nKing Hamlet, Claudius's brother and Prince Hamlet's father, and then succeeding\nto the throne and taking as his wife Gertrude, the old king's widow and Prince\nHamlet's mother. The play vividly portrays both true and feigned madness â from\noverwhelming sorrow to seething rage â and explores themes of treachery,\nrevenge, incest, and moral corruption and family.\n\nHamlet is Shakespeare's longest play and among the most powerful and influential\ntragedies in all literature, with a story capable of \"seemingly endless\nretelling and adaptation by others\". Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 74).\nThe play was one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime and still ranks among his most-performed, topping the Royal\nShakespeare Company's performance list since 1879. Crystal and Crystal\n(2005, 66). It has inspired writers from Goethe and Dickens to Joyce and\nMurdoch, and has been described as \"the world's most filmed story after\n[[Cinderella]]\". Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 17).\n\nIt has been theorized that Hamlet is based on the legend of Amleth, preserved by\n13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his [[Gesta Danorum]] as\nsubsequently retold by 16th-century scholar FranÃ§ois de Belleforest. Shakespeare\nmay also have drawn on or perhaps written an earlier (hypothetical) Elizabethan\nplay known today as the [[Ur-Hamlet]]. He almost certainly created the title\nrole for Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. See Taylor (2002, 4); Banham (1998, 141); Hattaway asserts that\n\"Richard Burbage ... played Hieronimo and also Richard III but then was the\nfirst Hamlet, Lear, and Othello\" (1982, 91); Peter Thomson argues that the\nidentity of Hamlet as Burbage is built into the dramaturgy of several moments of\nthe play: \"we will profoundly misjudge the position if we do not recognise that,\nwhilst this is Hamlet talking about the groundlings, it is also Burbage talking\nto the groundlings\" (1983, 24); see also Thomson on the first player's beard\n(1983, 110). In the 400 years since, the role has been performed by highly\nacclaimed actors and actresses from each successive age.\n\nThree different early versions of the play are extant, the First Quarto (Q1,\n1603), the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604), and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each\nversion includes lines, and even entire scenes, missing from the others. The\nstructure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny.\nOne such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill\nhis uncle, which some see as a mere plot device to prolong the action, but which\nothers argue is a dramatization of the complex philosophical and ethical issues\nthat surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More\nrecently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, and\nfeminist critics have re-evaluated and rehabilitated the often maligned\ncharacters of Ophelia and Gertrude.\n","linknr":1624,"url":"Hamlet","recorded":1362669905,"links":129,"instances":["character","narrative","theatre","actor","poet","rhetoric","shakespeare","epigrammatist","english_literature_scholar","character","theater","arts","poet","actor","columbia_college","psychology","manhattan","office","dramatist","actor","material","1996_film","manque","hamlet","1850","poetry","cultural_studies","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hamlet|*","1600s
