In a narrower sense, analogy is an inference or\nan argument from one particular to another particular, as opposed to deduction,\ninduction, and abduction, where at least one of the premises or the conclusion\nis general. The word analogy can also refer to the relation between the source\nand the target themselves, which is often, though not necessarily, a , as in the\nbiological notion of analogy. 's model of the atom made an analogy between the\natom and the solar system.]]\n\nAnalogy plays a significant role in problem solving such as, decision making,\nperception, memory, creativity, emotion, explanation and communication. It lies\nbehind basic tasks such as the identification of places, objects and people, for\nexample, in face perception and facial recognition systems. It has been argued\nthat analogy is \"the core of cognition\". Hofstadter in Gentner et al.\n2001. Specific analogical language comprises exemplification, comparisons,\nmetaphors, similes, allegories, and parables, but not metonymy. Phrases like and\nso on, and the like, as if, and the very word [[like]] also rely on an\nanalogical understanding by the receiver of a message including them. Analogy is\nimportant not only in ordinary language and common sense (where proverbs and\nidioms give many examples of its application) but also in science, philosophy\nand the humanities. The concepts of association, comparison, correspondence,\nmathematical and morphological homology, homomorphism, iconicity, isomorphism,\nmetaphor, resemblance, and similarity are closely related to analogy. In\ncognitive linguistics, the notion of conceptual metaphor may be equivalent to\nthat of analogy.\n\nAnalogy has been studied and discussed since classical antiquity by\nphilosophers, scientists and lawyers. The last few decades have shown a renewed\ninterest in analogy, most notably in cognitive science.\n","linknr":537,"url":"Analogy","recorded":1362480312,"links":68,"instances":["anatomy","grammar","philosophy","biology","linguistics","linguistics","mathematics","philosophy","computer_scientist","mathematics","physiology","psychology","mathematics","mathematics","semantics","legal_system","philosophy","philosopher","biology","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/faculty/mas/LOGIC.pdf","http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/faculty/mas/LOGIC.pdf","http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf","http://consc.net/papers/highlevel.pdf","http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf","http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~jehummel/pubs/DORA_PR_2008.pdf","http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/gentner/papers/Gentner83.pdf","http://www.psych.northwestern.edu/psych/people/faculty/gentner/newpdfpapers/ForbusGentner98.pdf","http://reasoninglab.psych.ucla.edu/KH%20pdfs/hummel&holyoak_cdips_2005.pdf","http://www.cs.hut.fi/Opinnot/T-93.850/2005/Papers/juthe2005-analogy.pdf","http://nbu.bg/cogs/personal/kokinov/ambr94.pdf","http://nbu.bg/cogs/personal/kokinov/Analogy&Memory(2002).pdf","http://eksl.cs.umass.edu/~clayton/publications/CogSci95/SM-v-HLP.pdf","http://www.lri.fr/~antoine/Papers/JFA96-final-osX.pdf"],"categories":["Philosophical
