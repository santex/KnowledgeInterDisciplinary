The watt-second is the energy\nequivalent to the power of one watt sustained for one second. While the watt-\nsecond is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some\ncontexts in which the watt-second is used instead of joule.\n\nThe kilowatt hour (kWh) is equivalent to 3,600,000 watt-seconds and is a unit\nused in the electricity market, and by producers of electricity.\n\nThe distinction between joule and watt-second is not analogous to the usage of\nnewton meter for torque despite being an equivalent unit to the joule.\n",
