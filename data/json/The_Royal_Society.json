The German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina ([http://www.leopoldina-\nhalle.de/cms/en.html Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]) lays claim\nto being the oldest continuously existing learned society, because the\ncontemporary organisation traces its roots back to the 1652 creation of what was\ncalled the Academia Naturae Curiosorum; the Royal Society was chartered by the\ncrown in 1660, and the Leopoldina was not officially chartered until 1687.\nFounded in November 1660, it was granted a Royal Charter by King Charles II as\nthe \"Royal Society of London\". The Society today acts as a scientific advisor to\nthe British government, receiving a parliamentary grant-in-aid. The Society acts\nas the UK's Academy of Sciences, and funds research fellowships and scientific\nstart-up companies.\n\nThe Society is governed by its Council, which is chaired by the Society's\nPresident, according to a set of Statutes and Standing Orders. The members of\nCouncil and the President are elected from and by its Fellows, the basic members\nof the Society, who are themselves elected by existing Fellows. There are\ncurrently 1,314 Fellows, allowed to use the postnominal title FRS (Fellow of the\nRoyal Society), with 44 new Fellows appointed each year. There are also Royal\nFellows, Honorary Fellows and Foreign Fellows, the last of which are allowed to\nuse their postnominal title ForMemRS (Foreign Member of the Royal Society). The\ncurrent Royal Society President is Sir Paul Nurse, who took up the position on\n30 November 2010.\n\nSince 1967, the Society has been based at 6â9 Carlton House Terrace, a Grade I\nlisted building in central London.\n","recorded":1362124538,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"743","instances":["scientist","politician","antiquary","painter","diplomat","modern","disambiguation","bbc_radio_4","journal","architect","academic","horace","journal","organic_chemist","united_kingdom","architect","minerologist","universities","mineralogist","united_kingdom","mathematician","botanist"],"pdf":["http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/about-us/fellowship/Fellows1660-2007.pdf"],"categories":["National
