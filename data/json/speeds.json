For air and marine travel the knot is commonly used.\n\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according\nto special relativity, is the speed of light in a vacuum c = 299,792,458 metres\nper second, approximately 1079 million kilometres per hour\n(671,000,000&nbsp;mph). Matter cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this\nwould require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept\nof rapidity replaces the classical idea of speed.\n","title":"Speed","headings":["Definition","Units","Examples of different speeds","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Time","3: Speed_of_light","3: Speedometer","3: Mach_number","3: V_speeds","2: Distance","2: Velocity","2: Miles_per_hour","2: Speed_of_sound","2: Muzzle_velocity","1: Kinematics","1: Time_derivative","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Length","1: International_System_of_Units","1: Metre_per_second","1: Kilometre_per_hour","1: Special_relativity","1: Matter","1: Rapidity","1: Galileo_Galilei","1: Derivative","1: Slope","1: Tangent_line","1: Merry-go-round","1: Turntable","1: Tangent_lines_to_circles","1: Circumference","1: Rotational_speed","1: Omega","1: Planet","1: Metres_per_second","1: SI_derived_unit","1: Kilometres_per_hour","1: Nautical_mile","1: Foot_per_second","1: Dimensionless","1: Natural_units","1: Continental_drift","1: Snail","1: Walk","1: Sprint_runner","1: Taipei_101","1: Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale#Category_1","1: Autoroutes_of_France","1: Sam_Whittingham","1: Recumbent_bicycle","1: Paintball_marker","1: Boeing_747-8","1: Land_speed_record","1: Kelvins","1: AK47","1: Assault_rifle","1: Bullet","1: Flight_airspeed_record","1: Space_shuttle","1: Escape_velocity","1: Earth","1: Vacuum","1: Metre","1: Aircraft","1: Air_speed","1: Land_speed","1: List_of_vehicle_speed_records","1: Projectile#Typical_projectile_speeds","1: Richard_Feynman","1: The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics","1: Addison-Wesley"]}
