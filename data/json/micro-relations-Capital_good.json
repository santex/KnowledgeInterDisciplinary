Samuelson and William D.\nNordhaus (2004). [[Economics (textbook)|Economics]], 18th ed., [end] Glossary of\nTerms, \"Capital (capital goods, capital equipment).\"    â¢\nDeardorff's Glossary of International Economics, [http://www-\npersonal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#capital Capital.] Capital\ngoods are acquired by a society by saving wealth which can be invested in the\nmeans of production.\n\nIndividuals, organizations and governments use capital goods in the production\nof other goods or commodities. Capital goods include factories, machinery,\ntools, equipment, and various buildings which are used to produce other products\nfor consumption. Capital goods, then, are products which are not produced for\nimmediate consumption; rather, they are objects that are used to produce other\ngoods and services. These types of goods are important economic factors because\nthey are the key to developing a positive return from manufacturing other\nproducts and commodities.\n\nManufacturing companies also use capital goods. Capital goods help their company\nmake functional goods to sell individuals valuable services. As a result,\ncapital goods are sometimes referred to as 'producersâ goods' or 'means of\nproduction.' An important distinction should also be made between capital goods\nand consumer goods, which are products directly purchased by consumers for\npersonal or household use.\n\nFor example, cars are generally considered consumer goods because they are\nusually bought by an individual for personal use. Dump trucks, however, are\nusually considered capital goods, because they are used by construction and\nmanufacturing companies to haul various materials in order to make other\nproducts such as roads, bridges, dams, and buildings. A chocolate bar is a\nconsumer good, but the machines used to produce the chocolate bar are considered\ncapital goods.\n\nCapital goods are generally man-made. Natural resources such as land or\nminerals, or human capitalâthe intellectual and physical skills and labor\nprovided by human workersâare not capital goods.\n\nThe economic term 'capital goods' is not to be confused with the financial\nor accounting usage of 'capital', which may mean simply wealth or\nfinancial capital.\n","linknr":207,"url":"Capital_good","recorded":1362483603,"links":23,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Capital","Economics terminology","Factors of production"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capital","economics"],["capital","economics"]],"members":["capital"],"related":["Capital_(economics)","Economics","Manufacturing","Means_of_production","Paul_A._Samuelson","William_Nordhaus","Consumer_goods","Natural_resources","Human_capital","Wealth","Financial_capital","Capital_(economics)","Factors_of_production","Financial_capital","Marginal_efficiency_of_capital","Means_of_production","Progressive_theory_of_capital","Real_capital","University_of_North_Carolina"]}
