Lovern E.\n(Nov 13, 2000) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6375/is_/ai_n25535702\n\"Accreditation gains attention.\"] Modern Healthcare 30(47):46. Providing\nhealthcare, especially of an adequate standard, is a complex and challenging\nprocess. Healthcare is a vital and emotive issueâits importance pervades all\naspects of societies, and it has medical, dental, social, political, ethical,\nbusiness, and financial ramifications. In any part of the world healthcare\nservices can be provided either by the public sector or by the private sector,\nor by a combination of both, and the site of delivery of healthcare can be\nlocated in hospitals or be accessed through practitioners working in the\ncommunity, such as general medical practitioners and dentists.\n\nThis is occurring in most parts of the developed world in a setting in which\npeople are expressing ever-greater expectations of hospitals and healthcare\nservices. This trend is especially strong where socialised medical systems\nexist. For example, in the European Union \"... patients have ever-greater\nexpectations of what health systems ought to deliver,\" although there has been a\n\"... continuous rise in costs of services determined by scientific and\ntechnological innovation.\" Office for International Public Health and Social\nAffairs. [http://www.ec.europa.eu/health/ph_overview/Documents/refl/ev20041015_-\nco_187_en.pdf \"Contribution to the Reflection Process for a New EU Health\nStrategy.\"] Venice Italy: Regional Health and Social Department. And in\none particular EU member state, the United Kingdom, \"... People are going to\nincrease demand and they have also got an increased expectation of what the NHS\ncan deliver.\" UK Parliament Select Committee on Health (9 February 2006).\n[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhealth/815/602091-\n5.htm Minutes of Evidence]. Examination of Witnesses Bernie Hurn and Michael\nHall (Questions 520 - 530)]. Interestingly, the USA manifests some\ndifferences here, and is an unusual and distinct oddity among developed Western\ncountries. In 2007, 45.7 million of the overall US population (i.e. 15.3%) had\nno health insurance whatsoever Sherman, A., R. Greenstein, and S. Parrott\n(August 26, 2008). [http://www.cbpp.org/8-26-08pov.htm \"Poverty and Share of\nAmericans Without Healthcare Were Higher in 2007...\"]. Washington: Centre for\nBudget and Policy Priorities. yet in 2007 the USA spent nearly $2.3\ntrillion on healthcare, or 16% of the country's gross domestic product, more\nthan twice as much per capita as the OECD average. Because of this,\nsome US citizens are having to look outside of their country to find affordable\nhealthcare, through the medium of medical tourism, also known as \"Global\nHealthcare\" (see below).\n\nApart from using hospitals and healthcare services to regain their health if it\nhas become impaired, or to prevent ill health occurring in the first place,\npeople the world over may also use them for a wide variety of other services,\nfor example âimproving upon natureâ (e.g. cosmetic surgery, gender re-assignment\nsurgery  or acquiring help to overcome difficulties with becoming a\nparent (e.g. infertility treatment).\n","linknr":250,"url":"International_healthcare_accreditation","recorded":1375073269,"links":["/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Healthcare","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Standard_of_care","/wiki/Society","/wiki/Medical","/wiki/Dentistry","/wiki/Social","/wiki/Political","/wiki/Ethical","/wiki/Business","/wiki/Financial","/wiki/Public_sector","/wiki/Private_sector","/wiki/Hospitals","/wiki/Socialized_medicine","/wiki/European_Union","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery","/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Infertility","#cite_note-7","#Healthcare_and_hospital_accreditation","#Background","#Consumers","#Umbrella_organizations","#Accreditation_services","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hospital_accreditation","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/World_Health_Organisation","/wiki/Patient_safety","#cite_note-9","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/USA","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Clinical_governance","/wiki/Audit","/wiki/Research","/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine","/wiki/Standardization","/wiki/Medical_ethics","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Hospital_accreditation","/wiki/Community_Health_Accreditation_Program","/wiki/Joint_Commission","/wiki/Accreditation_Commission_for_Health_Care","/wiki/The_Compliance_Team","/wiki/Healthcare_Quality_Association_on_Accreditation","/wiki/Governance","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","/wiki/Singapore","/wiki/Thailand","/wiki/India","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/wiki/Malaysia","/wiki/Philippines","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","http://www.american.edu/ted/medical-tourism.htm","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/wiki/Global_Healthcare","/wiki/HIV/AIDS","/wiki/Infertility","/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","/wiki/Chaga%27s_disease","/wiki/Partners_Harvard_Medical_International","/wiki/Medical_tourism","/w/index.php?title=Global_healthcare&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Medical_tourism","http://www.medtripinfo.com/articles/News%2Band%2Bblogs","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Medical_ethics","/wiki/Trent_Accreditation_Scheme","/wiki/UK","/wiki/Europe","http://www.union.org/new/english/about_us/mission.htm","http://www.qha-international.co.uk","http://www.imtj.com/news/?EntryId82=206991","http://www.imtjonline.com/articles/2011/qha-trent-international-hospital-accreditation-30100/","/wiki/Joint_Commission_International","/wiki/USA","http://www.jointcommission.org/","/wiki/Australia","http://www.achs.org.au/ACHSI/","/wiki/Canada","http://www.accreditation.ca","/w/index.php?title=La_Haute_Autorit%C3%A9_de_Sant%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.has-sante.fr","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit&section=4","http://www.isqua.org/","/wiki/United_Kingdom_Accreditation_Forum","/wiki/United_Kingdom_Accreditation_Forum","http://www.ukaf.org.uk/","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Locations_of_bases_of_int_accred_schemes.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/Locations_of_bases_of_int_accred_schemes.jpg/220px-Locations_of_bases_of_int_accred_schemes.jpg","/wiki/File:Locations_of_bases_of_int_accred_schemes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://www.imtjonline.com/news/india-accreditation-a-must","/wiki/JCI","http://www.imtjonline.com/news/india-accreditation-a-must","http://joint-commission.blogspot.com/2008/02/jci-how-much-do-they-charge-hospitals.html","/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization","/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization","/w/index.php?title=International_healthcare_accreditation&a
