This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be\nfound again by browsing or searching. Tags are generally chosen informally and\npersonally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system.\n\nTagging was popularized by websites associated with Web 2.0 and is an important\nfeature of many Web 2.0 services. It is now also part of some desktop software.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Tag_(metadata)","recorded":1362575038,"links":50,"instances":["information_science","world_wide_web","colour","machine_learning","punctuation","website"],"pdf":["http://www.belkcollege.uncc.edu/jpfoley/Readings/artic07.pdf","http://www.belkcollege.uncc.edu/jpfoley/Readings/artic07.pdf","http://www2007.org/papers/paper635.pdf"],"categories":["Collective intelligence","Computer jargon","Information retrieval","Knowledge representation","Metadata","Reference","Web 2.0"],"headings":["History and context","Examples","Special types","Advantages and disadvantages","Syntax","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Web_2.0_Map.svg/250px-Web_2.0_Map.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bookmark","world_wide_web"],["classification","machine_learning"],["delicious","website"],["delicious","website"],["delicious","website"],["orange","fruit"],["orange","colour"],["space","punctuation"],["ontology","information_science"]],"members":["ontology","bookmark","orange","classification","space","delicious"],"related":["Web_2.0","Information_system","Index_term","Bookmark_(World_Wide_Web)","Computer_file","Metadata","Web_2.0","Classification_(machine_learning)","Online_identity","Social_bookmarking","Delicious_(website)","Joshua_Schachter","Flickr","Social_software","YouTube","Technorati","Last.fm","Gmail","Social_bookmarking","Delicious_(website)","Flickr","YouTube","Technorati","StumbleUpon","ITunes","Winamp","Index_term","Jumper_2.0","Open_source","Web_2.0","Collaborative_search_engine","Knowledge_capture","Tag_cloud","Hierarchy","Taxonomy","Blog","Web_link","Controlled_vocabulary","Categorization","Syntax","Semantic","Namespace","Longitude","Resource_Description_Framework","Delicious_(website)","Flickr","Aaron_Straup_Cope","Flickr","Binomial_nomenclature","Metadata","Document","Digital_image","Database_table","Web_page","Index_term","Metadata","Semantics","Hyperdata","Hyperlinks","Knowledge_management","Enterprise_2.0","Knowledge_management","Knowledge","Tacit_knowledge","Semantics","Folksonomy","Controlled_vocabulary","Homonym","Synonym","Orange_(fruit)","Orange_(colour)","Linux_kernel","Inflection","Stemming","Complex_system","Self-organization","Power_law","Correlation","Folksonomy","YouTube","Text_box","Tokenize","Space_(punctuation)","Comma","Quotation_mark","Escape_character","Web_widget","HTML","Microformat","Rel_attribute","Collective_intelligence","Concept_map","Enterprise_2.0","Enterprise_bookmarking","Explicit_knowledge","Folksonomy","Information_ecology","Knowledge_representation","Knowledge_transfer","Metaknowledge","Ontology_(information_science)","Organisational_memory","Semantic_web","Tag_cloud","Web_2.0","Collective_unconscious","Human-computer_interaction","Social_network_aggregation","Enterprise_social_software","Expert_system","Knowledge","Knowledge_base","Knowledge_worker","Management_information_system","Microformats","Social_network","Social_software","Sociology_of_knowledge","Tacit_Knowledge"]}
