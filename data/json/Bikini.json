One part of the\n attire covers the breasts and the other part covers the groin and part of or\n the entire buttocks, leaving an uncovered area between the two.\n\n[[MerriamâWebster]] describe the bikini as \"a woman's scanty two-piece bathing\nsuit\" or \"a man's brief swimsuit.\" It is\noften worn in hot weather, while swimming or sunbathing. The shapes of both\nparts of a bikini resemble women's underwear, and the lower part can range from\nrevealing thong or g-string to briefs.\n\nIn 1946, the term bikini was coined by Louis RÃ©ard, who\nnamed the swimsuit after Bikini Atoll, where testing on the atomic bomb took place.\nReard chose the name bikini because he believed the suit's revealing style would\ncreate a stir among people similar to their shock and surprise in response to\nAmericaâs atomic bombing of Japan the previous summer.
