Similar regulations cover driving or\n operating certain types of machinery while affected by drinking alcohol or\n taking other drugs, including, but not limited to prescription drugs. This is a\n criminal offense in most nations. Convictions do not necessarily involve actual\n driving of the vehicle.<ref></ref>\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a quantitative measurement such as a blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) in excess of a specific threshold level, such as 0.05% or 0.08%,\ndefines the offense with no need to prove impairment or intoxication. In some\njurisdictions, there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher BAC\nlevel, such as 0.12%. In most countries, anyone who is convicted of injuring or\nkilling someone while under the influence of alcohol or drugs can be heavily\nfined, as in France, in addition to being given a lengthy prison sentence. Many\nemployers or occupations have their own rules and BAC limits; for example, the\nUnited States Federal Railroad Administration has a 0.04% limit for train\ncrew.<ref></ref> Certain large corporations have their own rules; for example,\nUnion Pacific Railroad has their own BAC limit of 0.02%<ref></ref> that, if\nviolated during a random test or a for-cause test&nbsp;—&nbsp;for example, after\na traffic accident&nbsp;—&nbsp;can result in termination of employment with no\nchance of future re-hire. Some jurisdictions have multiple levels of BAC for\ndifferent categories of drivers; for example, the state of California has a\ngeneral 0.08% BAC limit, a lower limit of 0.04% for commercial operators, and a\nlimit of 0.01% for drivers who are under 21 or on probation for previous DUI\noffenses.<ref></ref>\n\nMany states in the U.S. and the Federal government of Canada have adopted truth\nin sentencing laws that enforce strict guidelines on sentencing, differing from\nprevious practice where prison time was reduced or suspended after sentencing\nhad been issued. Some jurisdictions have judicial guidelines requiring a\nmandatory minimum sentence. DUI convictions can result in multi-year jail terms\nand other penalties ranging from expensive fees to forfeiture of one's license\nplates and vehicle.<ref></ref> Some jurisdictions require that drivers convicted\nof DUI offenses use special license plates that are easily distinguishable from\nregular plates. These plates are known in popular parlance as \"party plates\"<re-\nf>http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/01/cuyahoga_county_councils_final.html</-\nref> or \"whiskey plates\".<ref></ref>\n\n, Canada]] The specific criminal offense may be called, depending on the\njurisdiction, driving under the influence [of alcohol or other drugs] (DUI),\ndriving under intense influence (DUII), driving while intoxicated (DWI),\n\"operating vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs\" (OVI), operating\nunder the influence (OUI) operating while intoxicated (OWI), operating a motor\nvehicle while intoxicated (OMVI), driving under the combined influence of\nalcohol and/or other drugs, driving under the influence per se or drunk in\ncharge [of a vehicle]. Many such laws apply also to motorcycling, boating,\npiloting aircraft, use of motile farm equipment such as tractors and combines,\nriding horses or driving a horse-drawn vehicle, or bicycling, possibly with\ndifferent BAC level than driving. In some jurisdictions there are separate\ncharges depending on the vehicle used, such as BWI (bicycling while\nintoxicated), which may carry a lighter sentence.\n\nIn the United States, local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests\nnationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1996, compared to 1.9\nmillion such arrests during the peak year in\n1983.<ref>[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/press/AC.PR Four in Ten Criminal\nOffenders Report Alcohol as a Factor in Violence: But Alcohol-Related Deaths and\nConsumption in Decline], April 5, 1998, United States Bureau of Justice\nStatistics.</ref> In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DWI offenders were in prison or\njail, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in\n1986.<ref>[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/dwiocs.pdf DWI Offenders\nunder Correctional Supervision], June 1999, United States Bureau of Justice\nStatistics.</ref>\n","title":"Driving%20under%20the%20influence","headings":["Blood alcohol content (BAC)","Field sobriety testing","Drunk driving law by country","See also","Footnotes","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Blood_alcohol_content","2: United_States_Bureau_of_Justice_Statistics","1: Motor_vehicle","1: Ethanol","1: Alcoholic_beverage","1: Psychoactive_drug","1: Criminal_offense","1: Conviction","1: France","1: United_States_Federal_Railroad_Administration","1: Union_Pacific_Railroad","1: California","1: United_States","1: Canada","1: Truth_in_sentencing","1: Mandatory_sentencing","1: License_plates","1: Boating","1: Prison","1: Jail","1: Per_mille","1: Open_container","1: Medical_Psychological_Assessment","1: London_Taxi","1: Cab_driver","1: Shillings","1: United_States_Department_of_Transportation","1: Breathalyzer","1: Driving_license","1: Drunk_drivers","1: Drunk_walking","1: DWI_court","1: Expungement","1: Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving","1: National_Motorists_Association","1: Remove_Intoxicated_Drivers","1: Sobriety_checkpoints","1: Ignition_interlock_device","1: MedlinePlus"]}
