{"cursor":"7016","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn musical notation, a 'bar' (or 'measure') is a segment of time defined by a\ngiven number of beats, each of which are assigned a particular note value.\nDividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pin point\nlocations within a piece of music. It also makes written music easier to follow,\nsince each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch. Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same\nlength, and in modern musical notation the number of beats in each bar is\nspecified at the beginning of the score by the top number of a time signature\n(such as 3/4), while the bottom number indicates the note value of the beat (the\nbeat has a quarter note value in the 3/4 example).\n\nThe word bar is more common in British English, and the word measure is more\ncommon in American English, although musicians generally understand both usages.\nIn American English, although the words bar and measure are often used\ninterchangeably the correct use of the word 'bar' refers only to the vertical\nline itself, while the word 'measure' refers to the beats contained between\nbars. Read, Gardner. (1979) Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice, 2nd\ned., New York: Taplinger Publishing Company, p.183. In international\nusage, it is equally correct to speak of bar numbers and measure numbers, e.g.\nâbars 9â16â or âmm. 9â16â. Along the same lines, it is wise to reserve the\nabbreviated form âbb. 3â4â etc. for beats only; bars should be referred to by\nname in full.\n\nThe first metrically complete measure within a piece of music is called âbar 1â\nor âm. 1â. When the piece begins with an anacrusis (an incomplete measure at the\nhead of a piece of music), âbar 1â or âm. 1â is the following measure.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Bar_(music)","recorded":1362565062,"links":51,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhythm","Musical notation"],"headings":["Bar","History","Hypermeasure","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Barlines.svg/400px-Barlines.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Hypermeter.png/550px-Hypermeter.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg/80px-Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["beat","music"],["metre","music"],["accent","music"],["phrase","music"],["meter","music"],["meter","music"],["beat","music#hyperbeat"],["phrase","music"],["tala","music"]],"members":["tala","meter","beat","accent","phrase","metre"],"related":["Musical_notation","Beat_(music)","Modern_musical_symbols","Time_signature","British_English","American_English","Anacrusis","Musical_form","Metre_(music)","Accent_(music)","Time_signature","Hugo_Distler","Rhythm","Phrase_(music)","Vihuela","Meter_(music)","Hypermeasure","Meter_(music)","Hypermeter","Edward_T._Cone","Phrase_(music)","Bar-line_shift","Mensurstrich","Tala_(music)","Wazn"]}
