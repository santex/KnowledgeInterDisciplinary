Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background,\ntheories and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a\nbusinessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. Usually\nthe lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant\nto the lecture's content.\n\nThough lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not\nyet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their\ncourses. Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of\ncommunication that does not involve significant audience participation.\nTherefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered\nby talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have\nsurvived in academia as a quick, cheap and efficient way of introducing large\nnumbers of students to a particular field of study.\n\nThe criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally\nmisattributed to Mark Twain:\n. This source suggests that Edwin Slosson is more likely the original\n  writer.</ref>}}\n\nLectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and\nscientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic\nconferences often center around \"keynote addresses\", i.e., lectures. The public\nlecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls,\nfor instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a\nwide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries,\nmuseums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their\nmissions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of\noral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media.\n","title":"Lecture","headings":["Etymology","History","Research","Other forms","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: University","2: Active_learning","2: Public_lecture","2: Tutorial","1: Helsinki_University_of_Technology","1: University_of_KwaZulu-Natal","1: Presentation","1: College","1: Teacher","1: Communication","1: Academia","1: Mark_Twain","1: Edwin_Slosson","1: Keynote","1: Social_movement","1: Union_hall","1: Church_Body","1: Community_center","1: Library","1: Museum","1: Oral_tradition","1: Latin","1: Education","1: Medieval_university","1: Ferdinand_de_Saussure","1: Multimedia","1: Microsoft_PowerPoint","1: Edward_Tufte","1: Massive_open_online_courses","1: Khan_Academy","1: Engraving","1: Social_loafing","1: Evaluation_apprehension_model","1: Audience_response_system","1: Graduate_student","1: Tutor","1: Teaching_Assistant","1: Fellows","1: Discussion","1: Recitation","1: Seminar","1: Workshop","1: Observation","1: Case_example","1: Case_study","1: Experiential_learning","1: Computer","1: School","1: Lesson","1: Parlor","1: British_Commonwealth_of_Nations","1: United_States_of_America","1: Donald_A._Bligh","1: San_Francisco","1: Jossey-Bass","1: Konrad_Paul_Liessmann","1: Vienna","1: Edward_R._Tufte","1: Cheshire,_Connecticut","1: Graphics_Press"]}
