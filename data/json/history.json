The term includes cosmic,\n geologic, and organic history, but is often generically implied to mean human\n history. Scholars who write about history are called historians.\n\nHistory can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to\nexamine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the\npatterns of cause and effect that determine them.<ref\nname=\"evans1\"></ref><ref></ref>\n\nHistorians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by\ndiscussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of\nproviding \"perspective\" on the problems of the present.<ref name=\"evans1\"/><ref\nname=Tosh1>p 52</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nStories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources\n(such as the tales surrounding King Arthur) are usually classified as cultural\nheritage or legends, because they do not support the \"disinterested\ninvestigation\" required of the discipline of history.<ref></ref><ref\nname=\"Low1\"></ref> Events occurring prior to written record are considered\nprehistory.\n\nHerodotus, a 5th-century B.C. Greek historian is considered within the Western\ntradition to be the \"father of history\", and, along with his contemporary\nThucydides, helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history.\nTheir work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture-focused\nHerodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or\napproach in modern historical writing. In the Eastern tradition, a state\nchronicle the Spring and Autumn Annals was known to be compiled from as early as\n722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.\n\nAncient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of\nhistory which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The\nmodern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific\nregions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical\ninvestigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary\neducation, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in\nUniversity studies.\n",
