Combined with the\nhydrolysis of the aza-ylide to produce a phosphine oxide and an amine, this\nreaction is a mild method of reducing an azide to an amine. Triphenylphosphine\nis commonly used as the reducing agent, yielding triphenylphosphine oxide as the\nside product in addition to the amine.\n\nThe reaction was invented by and named after Hermann Staudinger.\n\nAn example of a Staudinger reduction is the organic synthesis of this pinwheel\ncompound:\n\n:\n","linknr":165,"url":"Staudinger_reduction","recorded":1362371453,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic redox reactions","Carbohydrate chemistry","Name reactions"],"headings":["Reaction mechanism","Staudinger ligation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/An_example_of_Staudinger_reaction.png/400px-An_example_of_Staudinger_reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Reaction_mechanism_of_Staudinger_reaction.png/700px-Reaction_mechanism_of_Staudinger_reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/StaudingLigationApplication.png/500px-StaudingLigationApplication.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Azide","Phosphine","Phosphite","Iminophosphorane","Hydrolysis","Phosphine_oxide","Amine","Organic_reduction","Triphenylphosphine","Reducing_agent","Triphenylphosphine_oxide","Hermann_Staudinger","Organic_synthesis","Reaction_mechanism","Iminophosphorane","Nucleophilic_addition","Phosphine","Amine","Triphenylphosphine_oxide","Carolyn_R._Bertozzi","Chemical_trap","Methyl_ester","Amide","Chemical_biology","Nucleoside","Fluorescent","Deoxyuridine","Coumarin","HOBT"]}
