It is set in Baile Beag (Ballybeg), a Donegal village in 19th century\nagricultural Ireland. Friel has said that Translations is \"a play about language\nand only about language\", but it deals with a wide range of issues, stretching\nfrom language and communication to Irish history and cultural imperialism. Friel\nresponds strongly to both political and language questions in modern-day\nNorthern Ireland. He said that his play \"should have been written in Irish\" but,\ndespite this fact, he crafted carefully the verbal action in English which makes\nthe dynamics of the play come alive, and brings its political questions into\ntrue focus.<ref></ref>\n\nBaile Beag (\"Small Town\") is a fictional village, created by Friel as a setting\nfor several of his plays,<ref name=\"Sternlicht2005\"></ref> although there are\nmany real places called Ballybeg throughout Ireland.\n","title":"translations","headings":["Performance and publication","Plot","Historical references","Notes"]},"micro-relation":["2: Stephen_Rea","2: New_York_City","2: Anglicise","2: Irish_language","2: Hedge_school","2: Ordnance_Survey","1: Playwright","1: Brian_Friel","1: Ballybeg","1: Ireland","1: Guildhall,_Derry","1: Northern_Ireland","1: Field_Day_Theatre_Company","1: Mick_Lally","1: Liam_Neeson","1: Ray_McAnally","1: Shaun_Scott","1: Manhattan_Theatre_Club","1: Barnard_Hughes","1: Broadway_theatre","1: Brian_Dennehy","1: McCarter_Theatre","1: Princeton,_New_Jersey","1: Biltmore_Theatre","1: Garry_Hynes","1: Faber_and_Faber","1: Samuel_French_Inc.","1: Leaving_Certificate","1: United_Kingdom","1: Welsh_language","1: Elan_Closs_Stephens","1: Wales","1: Gwasg_Carreg_Gwalch","1: Radio_play","1: BBC_Radio_4","1: County_Donegal","1: Dublin","1: Cartography","1: Orthography","1: Love_triangle","1: Royal_Engineers","1: Thomas_Frederick_Colby","1: William_Yolland","1: ISSN","1: Thomas_Larcom","1: United_States","1: Potato_blight","1: Daniel_O'Connell","1: Anglicisation","1: 1798_rebellion"]}
