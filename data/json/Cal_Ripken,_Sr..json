He played in the Orioles' farm\nsystem beginning in 1957, and later served as manager of the parent club, on\nwhich his sons Cal Jr. and Billy played.\n\nRipken's 13-plus years in the Baltimore farm system was the longest tenure of\nany minor league manager in Orioles history. As a manager in the minor leagues\nfor 13 years, Ripken won 964 games, and later compiled a 68-101 record managing\nthe Orioles. Several of his students, including Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and\nmost prominently his son Cal Jr., went on to Hall of Fame careers.\n\nIn 1987, Ripken became the first — and only — father to manage two\nsons simultaneously in the majors. After the Orioles lost six consecutive games\nto begin the 1988 season, Ripken was fired; the move deeply hurt and alienated\nhis superstar son, but he worked through it and would remain with the team for\n13 more seasons. After being replaced by Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, the\nOrioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the\nlongest losing streak to start a season. However, Ripken stayed on with the\nOrioles organization, and until 1992 he served as Baltimore's third-base coach.\n\nHe was a 1996 honoree into the Orioles Hall of Fame, inducted with Jerry\nHoffberger and Billy Hunter. These three men are so well thought of in Baltimore\nthat a crowd of 400 showed up at the luncheon at the Sheraton Inner Harbor\nHotel. Badger, Sylvia.
