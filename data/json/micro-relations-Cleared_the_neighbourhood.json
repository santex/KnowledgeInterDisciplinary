{"cursor":"13690","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" \"'Clearing the neighbourhood' of its orbit\" is a for a\ncelestial body to be considered a planet in the Solar System. This was one of\nthe three criteria adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in its\n2006 definition of planet.\n\nIn the end stages of planet formation, a planet will have \"cleared the\nneighbourhood\" of its own orbital zone, meaning it has become gravitationally\ndominant, and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its own\nsatellites or those otherwise under its gravitational influence. A large body\nwhich meets the other criteria for a planet but has not cleared its\nneighbourhood is classified as a dwarf planet. This includes Pluto, which shares\nits orbital neighbourhood with Kuiper belt objects such as the plutinos. The\nIAU's definition does not attach specific numbers or equations to this term, but\nall the planets have cleared their neighbourhoods to a much greater extent than\nany dwarf planet, or any candidate for dwarf planet.\n\nThe phrase may be derived from a paper presented to the general assembly of the\nIAU in 2000 by Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison. The authors used several\nsimilar phrases as they developed a theoretical basis for determining if an\nobject orbiting a star is likely to \"clear its neighboring region\" of\nplanetesimals, based on the object's mass and its orbital period.\n\nClearly distinguishing \"planets\" from \"dwarf planets\" and other minor planets\nhad become necessary because the IAU had adopted different rules for naming\nnewly discovered major and minor planets, without establishing a basis for\ntelling them apart. The naming process for Eris stalled after the announcement\nof its discovery in 2005, pending clarification of this first step.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Cleared_the_neighbourhood","recorded":1362665468,"links":27,"instances":["dwarf_planet","planet","dwarf_planet","dwarf_planet","dwarf_planet","letter","astrophysics"],"pdf":["http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/planet_def.pdf","http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/planet_def.pdf"],"categories":["Planetary science","Planets","Definition of planet","Pluto's planethood","Dynamics of the Solar System"],"headings":["Details","Disagreement","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/0/7/d0716f7731c7514deefd45951b25b97e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/TheKuiperBelt_75AU_All.svg/400px-TheKuiperBelt_75AU_All.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Solar_System_Template_Final.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eris","dwarf_planet"],["accretion","astrophysics"],["mu","letter"],["mercury","planet"],["ceres","dwarf_planet"],["eris","dwarf_planet"],["makemake","dwarf_planet"],["haumea","dwarf_planet"]],"members":["ceres","mercury","haumea","makemake","eris","mu","accretion"],"related":["Celestial_body","Planet","Solar_System","International_Astronomical_Union","IAU_definition_of_planet","Nebular_hypothesis","Planet","Natural_satellite","Dwarf_planet","Pluto","Kuiper_belt","Plutino","Alan_Stern","Harold_F._Levison","Star","Planetesimal","Mass","Orbital_period","Minor_planet","Eris_(dwarf_planet)","Protoplanet","Planetary_orbit","Gravitation","Astronomical_objects","Accretion_(astrophysics)","Satellite","Orbital_resonance","Orbital_resonance","Jupiter","Trojan_asteroid","Earth","3753_Cruithne","Neptune","Plutinos","Lambda","Hubble_time","Steven_Soter","Mu_(letter)","Astronomical_unit","Earth","Venus","Jupiter","Saturn","Mars","Mercury_(planet)","Uranus","Neptune","Ceres_(dwarf_planet)","Dwarf_planet","Eris_(dwarf_planet)","Dwarf_planet","Pluto","Dwarf_planet","Makemake_(dwarf_planet)","Dwarf_planet","Haumea_(dwarf_planet)","Dwarf_planet","NASA","Earth","Mars","Near-Earth_asteroid","Trojan_asteroid","Kuiper_Belt_Objects","List_of_Solar_System_objects","List_of_Solar_System_objects_in_hydrostatic_equilibrium","List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size","List_of_notable_asteroids","Mesoplanet","Ottawa_Citizen"]}
