{"cursor":"1387","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Mature [[messenger RNA]]', often abbreviated as 'mature mRNA' is a eukaryotic\nRNA transcript that has been spliced and processed and is ready for translation\nin the course of protein synthesis. Unlike the eukaryotic RNA immediately after\ntranscription known as precursor messenger RNA, it consists exclusively of\nexons, with all introns removed.\n\nMature mRNA is also called \"mature transcript\", \"mature RNA\" or \"mRNA\".\n\nThe production of a mature mRNA molecule occurs in 3 steps:\n\n# During capping, a 7-methylguanosine residue is attached to the 5'-terminal end\n# of the primary transcripts. This is otherwise known as the GTP or 5' Cap, and\n# is used for the stability and attachment point for ribosomes. In\n# polyadenylation, a poly-adenosine tail of about 200 adenylate residues is\n# added by a nuclear polymerase post-transcriptionally. This is known as a Poly-\n# A tail and is used for stability and guidance, so that the mRNA can exit the\n# nucleus and find the ribosome. RNA splicing removes the non-coding RNA introns\n# leaving behind the coding sequences exons, which are then spliced and joined\n# together to form the final mRNA.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Mature_messenger_RNA","recorded":1362373948,"links":12,"instances":["genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["splicing","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["splicing","translation","transcription"],"related":["Eukaryotic","Splicing_(genetics)","MRNA","Translation_(genetics)","Protein_synthesis","Eukaryote","Transcription_(genetics)","Precursor_messenger_RNA","Exons","Introns","5'_cap","7-methylguanosine","Polyadenylation","Adenosine","RNA_splicing","Intron","Exon"]}
