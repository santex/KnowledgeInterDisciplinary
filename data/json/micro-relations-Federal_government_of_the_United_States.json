{"cursor":"43876","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'government of the United States of America' is the federal government of\nthe constitutional republic of fifty states that constitute the United States,\nas well as one capitol district, and several other territories. The federal\ngovernment is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive and\njudicial, which powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress, the\nPresident, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively;\nthe powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress,\nincluding the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the\nSupreme Court.\n\nThe full name of the republic is \"The United States of America\". No other name\nappears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in\ntreaties, and in legal cases to which it is a party (e.g., [[Schenck v. United\nStates|Charles T. Schenck v. United States]]). The terms \"Government of the\nUnited States of America\" or \"United States Government\" are often used in\nofficial documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the\nstates collectively. In casual conversation or writing, the term \"Federal\nGovernment\" is often used, and the term \"National Government\" is sometimes used.\nThe terms \"Federal\" and \"National\" in government agency or program names\ngenerally indicates affiliation with the federal government (e.g., Federal\nBureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, etc.).\nBecause the seat of government is in Washington, D.C., \"Washington\" is commonly\nused as a metonym for the federal government.\n","linknr":1041,"url":"Federal_government_of_the_United_States","recorded":1362267764,"links":71,"instances":["us","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states_congress","representative"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-936.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-936.pdf","http://www.mcvpr.com/CM/CurrentEvents/CEOsummitarticle.pdf","http://www.jct.gov/x-24-06.pdf","http://www.cbpp.org/10-22-03sfp4.pdf","http://www.cbpp.org/10-22-03sfp4.pdf"],"categories":["Government
