There are infinite variations in human phenotypes, though society\nreduces the variability to distinct categories. Physical appearance of humans,\nin particular those attributed which are regarded as important for physical\nattractiveness, are believed by anthropologists to significantly affect the\ndevelopment of personality and social relations. Humans are acutely sensitive to\ntheir physical appearance, some theorize for reasons of evolution. Some\ndifferences in human appearance are genetic, others are the result of age,\nlifestyle or disease, and many are the result of personal adornment.\n\nSome people have traditionally linked some differences in personal appearance\nsuch as skeletal shape with ethnicity, such as prognathism or elongated stride.\nDifferent cultures place different degrees of emphasis on physical appearance\nand its importance to social status and other phenomena.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Human_physical_appearance","recorded":1362371284,"links":30,"instances":["injury","orthopedic","hair","fashion","sociology","classification_of_human_beings","skin_marking"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human appearance|*","Aesthetics","Biological anthropology"],"headings":["Factors affecting physical appearance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Human_Body.jpg/220px-Human_Body.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifestyle","sociology"],["race","classification_of_human_beings"],["mole","skin_marking"],["burn","injury"],["wig","hair"],["hairpin","fashion"],["cast","orthopedic"]],"members":["burn","cast","wig","hairpin","lifestyle","race","mole"],"related":["Phenotype","Physical_attractiveness","Anthropologist","Social_relations","Genetics","Senescence","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Disease","Adornment","Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","Prognathism","Human_height","Body_weight","Human_skin_tone","Body_hair","Sexual_organ","Mole_(skin_marking)","Birthmark","Freckle","Hair_color","Hair_texture","Eye_color","Human_eye","Eye_fold","Human_nose","Nasal_bridge","Ear","Earlobes","Body_shape","Amputation","Scar","Burn_(injury)","Wound","Senescence","Hair_loss","Blushing","Crying","Fainting","Hiccup","Yawning","Laughing","Stuttering","Sexual_arousal","Sweating","Shivering","Nose_bleeding","Sun_tanning","Sunlight","Frost","Clothing","Clothing","Headgear","Footwear","Corset","Brassiere","Footwear","High-heeled_footwear","Haircut","Mohawk_hairstyle","Dreadlocks","Braid","Ponytail","Wig_(hair)","Hairpin_(fashion)","Facial_hair","Beard","Moustache","Cosmetics","Body_painting","Permanent_makeup","Body_modification","Body_piercing","Tattoo","Scarification","Plastic_surgery","Jewelry","Necklace","Bracelet","Finger_ring","Earring","Tooth_braces","Bandage","Cast_(orthopedic)","Hearing_aids","Cervical_collar","Crutches","Contact_lens","Glasses","Gold","Teeth","Cape","Cigarette","Cigar","Pipe_smoking","Electronics","Personal_digital_assistant","Mobile_phone","Digital_audio_player","Goggles","Hair","Hat","Cap","Headdress","Headphones","Bluetooth","Jewelry","Mask","Prosthetic_limb","Sunglasses","Watch","Weapon","Beauty","Body_image","Clothing","Eigenface","Erotic_capital","Face_perception","Facial_symmetry","Fashion","Hair_coloring","Nudity","Physical_attractiveness","Recognition_of_human_individuals","Sexual_attraction","Sexual_selection","Social_aspects_of_clothing","Social_role_of_hair","Somatotype","Ugliness","Vanity"]}
