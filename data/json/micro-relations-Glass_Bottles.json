Glass bottles can vary\n  in size considerably, but are most commonly found in sizes ranging between\n  about 10ml and 5 litres.\n\nThe history of glass can be traced back to at least 12,000 BC where glass coated\nobjects have been found.\n\nMillions of glass bottles are created worldwide every day. In the US, there is\nan average of at least two bottle-making factories in each county. It is a\nhighly mechanized process, and bottles in use today are no longer hand blown as\nthey were in the past.\n\nA glass bottle is 100% recyclable with many new bottles containing glass which\nwas created over 20 years ago. Less energy is used in recycling a glass bottle\nthan creating the glass from raw materials, helping the environment.\n\nWhen a glass bottle filled with liquid is dropped or subjected to shock, the\nwater hammer effect may cause hydrodynamic stress, breaking the\nbottle. {{cite journal\n  | last = Saitoh first = S title = Water hammer breakage of a glass container\n  | journal = International glass journal volume = issue = pages = publisher =\n  | Faenza Editrice, date = 1999 url = issn = 1123-5063 accessdate = }}\n {{cite book\n  | last = Brandt RC first = coauthors = Tressler RE title = Fractography\n  | of Glass publisher = Plenum Press url =http://books.google.com/?id=oS6-\n  | nR9729XUC&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=bottle+water+hammer date = 1994 isbn =\n  | 0-306-44880-7}}\n\n\nGlass bottle manufacturing takes place over several stages. To briefly outline\nthe processes from beginning to end: raw material, melting, forming, annealing,\nphysical inspection, machine & laser inspection, secondary physical inspection,\nquality control, and finally packing.\n\nGlass bottles are sometimes reinforced through lamination. Laminated safety\nglass is made by coating a glass surface with a layer of plastic. When a\nstandard glass bottle is dropped, the glass breaks and scatters. When a\nlaminated bottle is dropped, the glass still breaks but the layer of plastic\nremains intact, keeping the glass pieces together.\n\nOnce made, bottles may suffer from internal stresses as a result of unequal, or\ntoo rapid cooling. An annealing oven, or 'lehr' is used to cool glass containers\nslowly to prevent stress and make the bottle stronger. \n","linknr":308,"url":"Glass_Bottles","recorded":1362481621,"links":18,"instances":["bottle"],"pdf":["http://www.jarsandbottles-store.co.uk/skin/frontend/default/blank/images/fact-sheet.pdf","http://www.jarsandbottles-store.co.uk/skin/frontend/default/blank/images/fact-sheet.pdf"],"categories":["Glass bottles|"],"headings":["See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Cocacolacollection.JPG/220px-Cocacolacollection.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Bouteilles_bieres.jpg/220px-Bouteilles_bieres.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Perfume_set_from_Sovjetunio_cca_1965.jpg/220px-Perfume_set_from_Sovjetunio_cca_1965.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["boston_round","bottle"]],"members":["boston_round"],"related":["Bottle","Glass","Litre","Anno_Domini","Water_hammer","Hydrodynamic","Boston_round_(bottle)","Glass_container_industry","Mason_Jar","List_of_bottle_types,_brands_and_companies"]}
