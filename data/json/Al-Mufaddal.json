{"cursor":"3183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Al-Mufaá¸á¸al al-á¸abbÄ«' () was a contemporary of Hammad Ar-Rawiya and Khalaf al-\nAhmar, the famous collectors of ancient Arab poetry and tradition, and was\nsomewhat the junior of Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala', the first scholar who\nsystematically set himself to preserve the poetic literature of the Arabs. He\ndied about fifty years before Abu Ubaida and al-Asma'i, to whose labours\nposterity is largely indebted for the arrangement, elucidation and criticism of\nancient Arabian verse; and his anthology was put together between fifty and\nsixty years before the compilation by Abu Tammam of the [[Hamasah]].\n\nAl-Mufaddal was a careful and trustworthy collector both of texts and\ntraditions, and is praised by all authorities on Arabian history and literature\nas in this respect greatly the superior of Hammad and Khalaf, who are accused\n(especially the latter) of unscrupulous fabrication of poems in the style of the\nancients. He was a native of Kufa, the northernmost of the two great military\ncolonies founded in 638 by the caliph Umar for the control of the wide\nMesopotamian plain. In Kufah and Basra were gathered representatives of all the\nArabian tribes who formed the fighting force of the Islamic Empire, and from\nthese al-Mufaddal was able to collect and record the compositions of the poets\nwho had celebrated the fortunes and exploits of their forefathers. He, no doubt,\nlike al-Asma'i and Abu Ubaida, also himself visited the areas occupied by the\ntribes for their camping grounds in the neighbouring desert; and adjacent to\nKufah was al-Hira (modern al-Kufah), the ancient capital of the Lakhmids kings,\nwhose court was the most celebrated centre in pre-Islamic Arabia, where, in the\ncentury before the preaching of the Prophet, poets from the whole of the\nnorthern half of the peninsula were wont to assemble. There is indeed a\ntradition that a written collection ([[diwan (poetry)|diwan]]) existed in the\nfamily of Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, the last Lakhmid king, containing a number\nof poems by the fuhul, or most eminent poets of the pagan time, and especially\nby those who had praised the princes of the house, and that this collection\npassed into the possession of the Umayyad caliphs of the house of Marwan; to\nthis, if the tradition is to be believed, al-Mufaddal probably had access.\n\nThe date of al-Mufaddal's birth is unknown; but he lived for many years under\nthe caliphs of the Umayyad line until their overthrow by the Abbasids in 749. In\n762 he took part in the rising led by Ibrahim Ibn Abdallah, the Alid, called\n\"The Pure Soul\", against the caliph al-Mansur, and after the defeat and death of\nIbrahim was cast into prison. Al-Mansur, however, pardoned him on the\nintercession of his fellow tribesman Musayyab ibn Zuhair of Dabba, and appointed\nhim the instructor in literature of his son, afterwards the caliph al-Mahdi. It\nwas for this prince that, at al-Mansur's instigation, al-Mufaddal compiled the\n[[Mufaddaliyat]].\n","linknr":105,"url":"Al-Mufaddal","recorded":1375069375,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Hammad_Ar-Rawiya","/w/index.php?title=Khalaf_al-Ahmar&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Abu_%27Amr_ibn_al-%27Ala%27","/wiki/Abu_Ubaida","/wiki/Al-Asma%27i","/wiki/Abu_Tammam","/wiki/Hamasah","/wiki/Hammad_Ar-Rawiya","/w/index.php?title=Khalaf_al-Ahmar&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kufa","/wiki/Caliph","/wiki/Umar","/wiki/Mesopotamia","/wiki/Basra","/wiki/Arabia","/wiki/Lakhmids","/wiki/Diwan_(poetry)","/wiki/Nu%27man_III_ibn_al-Mundhir","/wiki/Umayyad","/wiki/Marwan","/wiki/Abbasid","/wiki/Ibrahim_Ibn_Abdallah","/wiki/Al-Mansur","/wiki/Al-Mahdi","/wiki/Mufaddaliyat","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&oldid=546290743","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:8th-century_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Arabic-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Al-Mufaddal&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Al-Mufaddal","/wiki/Al-Mufaddal","/wiki/Talk:Al-Mufaddal","#","/wiki/Al-Mufaddal","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Al-Mufaddal","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Al-Mufaddal","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&oldid=546290743","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4702928","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Al-Mufaddal&id=546290743","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Al-Mufaddal","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Al-Mufaddal&oldid=546290743&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Al-Mufaddal&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4702928#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mufaddal","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["8th-century
