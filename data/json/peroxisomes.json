{"cursor":"16012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n cells during mitosis.]]\n\n'Peroxisomes' (also called 'microbodies') are organelles found in virtually all\neukaryotic cells. They are involved in the\ncatabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, D-amino\nacids, polyamines, and biosynthesis of plasmalogens, i.e. ether phospholipids\ncritical for the normal function of mammalian brains and lungs. They also contain approximately 10% of the total\nactivity of two enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for\nenergy metabolism. It is vigorously debated if\nperoxisomes are involved in isoprenoid and cholesterol synthesis in animals. Other known peroxisomal functions include the glyoxylate\ncycle in germinating seeds (\"glyoxysomes\"), photorespiration in\nleaves, glycolysis in trypanosomes (\"glycosomes\"), and methanol\nand/or amine oxidation and assimilation in some yeasts.\n\nPeroxisomes were identified as organelles by the Belgian cytologist Christian de\nDuve in 1967 after they had been first described\nby a Swedish doctoral student, J. Rhodin in 1954.\n","linknr":499,"url":"peroxisomes","recorded":1362901512,"links":58,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles","Metabolism"],"headings":["Metabolic functions","Peroxisome assembly","Associated medical conditions","Genes","Evolutionary origins","Other related organelles","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Peroxisome.svg/300px-Peroxisome.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/7/a/c7a4c62dc3187ea4ac7614583be17fe3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/7/b/97bd4bb7c16740df748d0e39bf1b8a84.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/2/76293f81d95d11ba1710e86a5b5ee86b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mitosis","Organelle","Eukaryotic","Catabolism","Very_long_chain_fatty_acid","Branched_chain_fatty_acids","D-amino_acids","Polyamine","Plasmalogens","Ether_phospholipid","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Isoprenoid","Cholesterol","Glyoxylate_cycle","Glyoxysomes","Photorespiration","Glycolysis","Trypanosomes","Glycosome","Methanol","Christian_de_Duve","Fatty_acids","Beta-oxidation","Plasmalogen","Myelin","Neuron","Peroxisomal_disorders","Bile","Enzyme","Catalase","D-amino_acid_oxidase","Uric_acid_oxidase","Gout","Hydrogen_peroxide","Phenols","Formic_acid","Formaldehyde","Alcohol","Ethanol","Acetaldehyde","Ascorbate-glutathione_cycle","Superoxide","Nitric_oxide","Glucosinolate","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Peroxisomal_targeting_signal","Peroxin","Cytosol","Cytosol","Ubiquitination","Peroxisomal_disorders","X-linked","Adrenoleukodystrophy","Peroxisome_biogenesis_disorders","PEX1","PEX2","PXMP3","PEX3","PEX5","PEX6","PEX7","PEX10","PEX11A","PEX11B","PEX11G","PEX12","PEX13","PEX14","PEX16","PEX19","PEX26","PEX28","PEX30","PEX31","Endosymbiotic_theory","Proteome","Endoplasmic_Reticulum_Associated_Protein_Degradation","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Mitochondria","Actinobacteria","Microbody","Glyoxysome","Plant","Filamentous_fungi","Glycosome","Kinetoplastid","Woronin_body","Filamentous_fungi"]}
