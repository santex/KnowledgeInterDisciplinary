{"cursor":"3230","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'geologic period' is a time unit subdivision of geologic time defined as a\nspan of years into which the larger era time units are divided into smaller\ntimeframes, as Era's divide the Eon. In the Earth Sciences rocks and especially\nthe sequences of rocks called stratum (plural: strata) arrayed in an ordered\n\"rock column\" occurring during a timespan are the focus of study so the time\nunits are paired with corresponding Rock strata units whose characteristics\ndefine such points elsewhere that occurred concurrently as the local rock layers\nwere laid down as sediments. For the 'Geological Period' the paired rock strata\nterm, a geologic stage is used to denote the corresponding rock layers of both\nthe geologic record and the fossil record; thus the rocks of the Devonian System\nwere laid down during the Devonian Period, and such equivalent units exist at\neach level of refinement of geological chronology and biogeological or\nstratigraphic classification.\n\nEach unit, of strata no matter how interrupted the record recorded in the local\nrock column is mapped into the overall geologic record and classified carefully\ninto chronological units of geologic time based on world wide efforts of the\nInternational Commission on Stratigraphy working to correlate the world's local\nstratigraphic record into one uniform planet wide benchmarked system, in a\nsteady effort ongoing since 1974. While paleontologists often refer to faunal\nstages rather than geologic periods, they are often used in popular\npresentations of paleontology or plate reconstructions.\n\nAs illustrated in the article on the geologic time scale, most periods are\nsubdivided into smaller units called epochs. In 2004 the International Union of\nGeological Sciences (I.U.G.S.) recognized the Ediacaran period of the\nNeoproterozoic era, the first such newly-designated period in 130 years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!
