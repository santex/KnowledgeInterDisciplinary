In humans, catechol-O-\nmethyltransferase protein is encoded by the 'COMT' gene. As the regulation of catecholamines is impaired in a\nnumber of medical conditions, several pharmaceutical drugs target COMT to alter\nits activity and therefore the availability of catecholamines. COMT was first discovered by the biochemist Julius\nAxelrod in 1957.\n","linknr":638,"url":"Catechol-O-methyl_transferase","recorded":1362668408,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.1.1"],"headings":["Function","Genetics in humans","Nomenclature","COMT inhibitors","See also","Additional images","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Catechol-O-methyl_transferase_3bwm.png/250px-Catechol-O-methyl_transferase_3bwm.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/PBB_GE_COMT_208818_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_COMT_208818_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/PBB_GE_COMT_208817_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_COMT_208817_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/PBB_GE_COMT_213981_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_COMT_213981_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Noradrenaline_breakdown.svg/350px-Noradrenaline_breakdown.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Dopamine_degradation.svg/120px-Dopamine_degradation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Catecholamine","Dopamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Gene","Biochemist","Julius_Axelrod","Catecholamine","Neurotransmitter","Dopamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Methyl","S-adenosyl_methionine","Levodopa","Entacapone","Parkinson's_disease","Dopamine","3-Methoxytyramine","DOPAC","Homovanillic_acid","Norepinephrine","Normetanephrine","Epinephrine","Metanephrine","Dihydroxyphenylethylene_glycol","Methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol","3,4-Dihydroxymandelic_acid","Vanillylmandelic_acid","Dopamine_transporter","Prefrontal_cortex","Val158Met","Rs737865","Rs165599","Personality_traits","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Valine","Methionine","Rs4680","Frontal_lobe","Cognitive","Executive_function","Schizophrenia","Sophia_Frangou","Pleiotropy","Experience_sample_monitoring","Gene","Oxygen","COMT_inhibitor","Tolcapone","Entacapone","Parkinson's_disease","Dopamine","Schizophrenia","Methyltransferase"]}
