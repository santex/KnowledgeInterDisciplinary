As part of a chain of\ncause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop, the event is said to \"feed back\"\ninto itself.\n\nRamaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as \"information about the gap\nbetween the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter which is\nused to alter the gap in some way\", emphasising that the information by itself\nis not feedback unless translated into action.
