{"cursor":"60091","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}}\n\n'Marriageable age' (or 'marriage age') is the age at which a person is allowed\nto marry, either as a right or subject to parental or other forms of consent.\nAge and other requirements vary between countries, but generally is set at 18.\nMost jurisdictions allow marriage at slightly younger ages with parental and/or\njudicial approval, or in case of pregnancy. The marriage age should not be\nconfused with the age of majority or the age of consent, though in some places\nthey may be the same. In many developing countries, the official age\nprescriptions are only meant to be attainable guidelines.\n\n55 countries are parties to the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age\nfor Marriage, and Registration of Marriages, which requires them to specify a\nminimum marriage age by statute law, thus overriding customary, religious and\ntribal laws.\n\nWhen the marriageable age under a law of a religious community is lower than\nthat under the law of the land, the state law prevails. However, some religious\ncommunities do not accept the supremacy of state law in this respect.\n","linknr":724,"url":"Marriageable_age","recorded":1362486306,"links":38,"instances":["south_africa","australia","jurist","fiqh_uses_of_the_term","south_africa"],"pdf":["http://www.humanrights.ge/files/crcreport.pdf","http://www.humanrights.ge/files/crcreport.pdf","http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/report205.pdf","http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-19910704-047-eng.pdf","http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-19910704-047-eng.pdf"],"categories":["Marriage","Age and society","Statutory law","Sexuality and age","Minimum ages"],"headings":["History and social attitudes","By country","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Tongshan-County-village-house-9886.jpg/220px-Tongshan-County-village-house-9886.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gratian","jurist"],["wali#legal","fiqh_uses_of_the_term"],["marriage_act,_1961","south_africa"],["minister_of_home_affairs","south_africa"],["georgia","country"],["georgia","country"],["georgia","u.s._state"],["washington","u.s._state"],["marriage_act_1961","australia"]],"members":["marriage_act_1961","gratian","georgia","washington","minister_of_home_affairs"],"related":["Marriage","Age_of_majority","Age_of_consent","Convention_on_Consent_to_Marriage,_Minimum_Age_for_Marriage,_and_Registration_of_Marriages","Religious_law","Law_of_the_land","Law","Menstruation","Germanic_peoples","Tacitus","Aristotle","Visigothic_Code","Gratian_(jurist)","Canon_law","Medieval","Hajnal_line","Canterbury","Algeria","Angola","Egypt","Ethiopia","Kenya","Libya","Madagascar","Madagascar","Mali","Malian_Family_Code","Morocco","Niger","Nigeria","Senegal","Somalia","South_Africa","Marriage_Act,_1961_(South_Africa)","Age_of_majority","Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(South_Africa)","Civil_Union_Act,_2006","Recognition_of_Customary_Marriages_Act,_1998","Sudan","South_Sudan","Tanzania","Tunisia","Zimbabwe","Afghanistan","Azerbaijan","Bangladesh","Brunei","People's_Republic_of_China","Georgia_(country)","Hong_Kong","India","Indonesia","Iran","Iraq","Saddam_Hussein","Israel","Japan","Jordan","Kazakhstan","Korea","Kuwait","Kyrgyzstan","Lebanon","Malaysia","Maldives","Nepal","Pakistan","Palestinian_territories","Mongolia","Philippines","Russia","Saudi_Arabia","Singapore","Sri_Lanka","Quazi","Syria","Republic_of_China","Thailand","Turkey","Uzbekistan","Vietnam","Yemen","Nujood_Ali","Albania","Armenia","Austria","Belarus","Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Cyprus","Czech_Republic","Denmark","24_year_rule","Estonia","Finland","France","Georgia_(country)","Germany","Gibraltar","Greece","Hungary","Iceland","Ireland","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","Norway","Malta","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey","Ukraine","United_Kingdom","England_and_Wales","Scotland","Northern_Ireland","Vatican_City","Canada","Marriage_in_Canada","Mexico","Puerto_Rico","United_States","Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","District_of_Columbia","Florida","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New_Hampshire","New_Jersey","New_Mexico","New_York","North_Carolina","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode_Island","South_Carolina","South_Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington_(U.S._state)","West_Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming","Australia","Marriage_Act_1961_(Australia)","New_Zealand","Papua_New_Guinea","Argentina","Brazil","Chile","Colombia","Paraguay","Peru","Venezuela","Ecuador","Arranged_marriage","Child_marriage","Convention_on_Consent_to_Marriage,_Minimum_Age_for_Marriage,_and_Registration_of_Marriages","Legal_status_of_polygamy","Mature_minor_doctrine","Polygamy","Teen_marriage"]}
