The conductivity\nof a semiconductor increases with increasing temperature, behaviour opposite to\nthat of a metal. B.G. Yacobi, Semiconductor Materials: An\nIntroduction to Basic Principles, Springer 2003 ISBN 0306473615, pp. 1-3\nSemiconductors can display a range of useful properties such as passing current\nmore easily in one direction than the other. Because the conductive properties\nof a semiconductor can be modified by controlled addition of impurities or by\nthe application of electrical fields or light, semiconductors are very useful\ndevices for amplification of signals, switching, and energy conversion.\nUnderstanding the properties of semiconductors relies on quantum physics to\nexplain the motions of electrons through a lattice of atoms.\n\nCurrent conduction in a semiconductor occurs via free electrons and \"holes\",\ncollectively known as charge carriers. Adding impurity atoms to a semiconducting\nmaterial, known as \"doping\", greatly increases the number of charge carriers\nwithin it. When a doped semiconductor contains excess holes it is called \"p-\ntype\", and when it contains excess free electrons it is known as \"n-type\". The\nsemiconductor material used in devices is doped under highly controlled\nconditions to precisely control the location and concentration of p- and n-type\ndopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have multiple p- and n-type regions;\nthe p-n junctions between these regions have many useful electronic properties.\n\nSemiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics, including radio,\ncomputers, and telephones. Semiconductor-based electronic components include\ntransistors, solar cells, many kinds of diodes including the light-emitting\ndiode (LED), the silicon controlled rectifier, photo-diodes, and digital and\nanalog integrated circuits. Increasing understanding of semiconductor materials\nand fabrication processes has made possible continuing increases in the\ncomplexity and speed of semiconductor devices, an effect known as Moore's Law.\n","linknr":558,"url":"Semiconductor","recorded":1362538823,"links":104,"instances":["electricity","semiconductors","semiconductor","scientist","electronics","semiconductors"],"pdf":["http://www.nit.eu/czasopisma/JTIT/2010/1/3.pdf","http://zinnov.com/pdfFiles/1330022518orv_Semiconductor_Hubs_2012.pdf"],"categories":["Semiconductors|","Concepts
