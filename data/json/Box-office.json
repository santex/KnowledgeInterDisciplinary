{"cursor":"5434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Maui, Hawaii.]] , Alberta]] A 'box office' is a place where tickets are\nsold to the public for admission to an event. Patrons may perform the\ntransaction at a countertop, through an unblocked hole through a wall or\nwindow, or at a wicket.\n\nBy extension, the term is frequently used, especially in the context of the film\nindustry, as a synonym for the amount of business a particular production, such\nas a film or theatre show, receives. The term can also mean factors which may\ninfluence this amount, as in the phrases \"good box office\" and \"bad box office\".
