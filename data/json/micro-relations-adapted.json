{"cursor":"50885","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'adaptation' in biology is a trait with a current functional role in the life\nhistory of an organism that is maintained and evolved by means of natural\nselection. An adaptation refers to both the current state of being adapted and\nto the dynamic evolutionary process that leads to the adaptation. Adaptations\ncontribute to the fitness and survival of individuals. Organisms face a\nsuccession of environmental challenges as they grow and develop and are equipped\nwith an adaptive plasticity as the phenotype of traits develop in response to\nthe imposed conditions. The developmental norm of reaction for any given trait\nis essential to the correction of adaptation as it affords a kind of biological\ninsurance or resilience to varying environments.\n","linknr":1016,"url":"adapted","recorded":1362672636,"links":87,"instances":["biology","mammalian_reproduction","biology","biology","publisher","biology","biology","ecology","biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-5-17.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-5-17.pdf","http://pages.uoregon.edu/pphil/courses/genarch/orr2005.pdf","http://pages.uoregon.edu/pphil/courses/genarch/orr2005.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf","http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf","http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary
