{"cursor":"50273","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n is an example of futures studies; it is a statistical collection of past and\n present trends with the goal of accurately extrapolating future trends.]]\n 'Futures studies' (also called 'futurology') is the study of postulating\n possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that\n underlie them. There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or\n science. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the social sciences\n and parallel to the field of history. In the same way that history studies the\n past, futures studies considers the future. Futures studies (colloquially\n called \"futures\" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what\n is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline\n thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present,\n and to determine the likelihood of future events and\n trends. [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=futurology futurology].\n Wordnet.princeton.edu. Unlike the physical sciences where a narrower,\n more specified system is studied, futures studies concerns a much bigger and\n more complex world system. The methodology and knowledge are much less proven\n as compared to natural science or even social science like sociology,\n economics, and political science.\n","linknr":764,"url":"Futurology","recorded":1362581208,"links":57,"instances":["futurist","artist","book_series","divination","book","foresight_research","semiotics"],"pdf":["http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/11-2/4wildcard-hiltunen.pdf","http://www.swinburne.edu.au/business/research/our-research/documents/monographs/Monograph5.pdf","http://integral-review.org/documents/Gidley,%20Evolution%20of%20Consciousness%20as%20Planetary%20Imperative%205,%202007.pdf","http://www.swinburne.edu.au/business/research/our-research/documents/monographs/Monograph5.pdf","http://www.rene-rohrbeck.de/documents/Rohrbeck-et-al_(2009)_Benchmarking-Report_Strategic-Foresight.pdf"],"categories":["Anticipatory
