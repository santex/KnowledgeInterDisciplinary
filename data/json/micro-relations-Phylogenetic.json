{"cursor":"17797","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn biology, 'phylogenetics' () is the study of evolutionary relationships among\ngroups of organisms (e.g. species, populations), which are discovered through\nmolecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices. The term\nphylogenetics derives from the Greek terms phylÃ© (ÏÏÎ»Î®) and phylon (Ïá¿¦Î»Î¿Î½),\ndenoting \"tribe\", \"clan\", \"race\" and the adjectival form, genetikÃ³s\n(Î³ÎµÎ½ÎµÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ), of the word [[wikt:genesis|genesis]] (Î³Î­Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï) \"origin\", \"source\",\n\"birth\". The result of phylogenetic studies is a hypothesis about the\nevolutionary history of taxonomic groups: their 'phylogeny'.\n\nEvolution is regarded as a branching process, whereby populations are altered\nover time and may split into separate branches, hybridize together, or terminate\nby extinction. This may be visualized in a phylogenetic tree, a hypothesis of\nthe order in which evolutionary events are assumed to have occurred.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses have become essential in researching the evolutionary\ntree of life. The overall goal of National Science Foundation's Assembling the\nTree of Life activity (AToL) is to resolve evolutionary relationships for large\ngroups of organisms throughout the history of life, with the research often\ninvolving large teams working across institutions and disciplines.\nInvestigators are typically supported for projects in data acquisition,\nanalysis, algorithm development and dissemination in computational\nphylogenetics and phyloinformatics. For example, RedToL aims at reconstructing\nthe Red Algal Tree of Life.\n\nTaxonomy, the classification, identification, and naming of organisms, is\nusually richly informed by phylogenetics, but remains methodologically and\nlogically distinct. The degree to which taxonomy depends on\nphylogenies differs between schools of taxonomy: numerical taxonomy ignored\nphylogeny altogether, trying to represent the similarity between organisms\ninstead; phylogenetic systematics tries to reproduce phylogeny in its\nclassification without loss of information; evolutionary taxonomy tries to find\na compromise between them in order to represent stages of evolution.\n","linknr":556,"url":"Phylogenetic","recorded":1362483180,"links":72,"instances":["science","psychoanalysis","phylogenetics","psychoanalysis","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.unm.edu/~moret/poincare.pdf"],"categories":["Phylogenetics|"],"headings":["Construction of a phylogenetic tree","Limitations and workarounds","The role of fossils","History of phylogenetics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Haeckel_arbol_bn.png/250px-Haeckel_arbol_bn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["tree_of_life","science"],["maximum_parsimony","phylogenetics"],["ontogeny","psychoanalysis"],["phylogeny","psychoanalysis"]],"members":["tree_of_life","phylogeny","maximum_parsimony","ontogeny","hybrid"],"related":["Biology","Evolution","Organism","Species","Population","Molecular_sequencing","Hybrid_(biology)","Extinction","Phylogenetic_tree","Tree_of_life_(science)","National_Science_Foundation","RedToL","Taxonomy","Organism","Numerical_taxonomy","Cladistics","Evolutionary_taxonomy","Evolutionary_grade","Computational_phylogenetics","Cladistics","Maximum_parsimony_(phylogenetics)","Maximum_likelihood","Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo","Bayesian_inference","Mathematical_model","Molecular_phylogenetics","Nucleotide","Amino_acid","Phenetics","Distance_matrix","Maximum_likelihood","Bayesian_inference","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Prokaryote","Antibiotic_resistance","Parsimony","Molecular_biology","Mitochondrial","Long_branch_attraction","Extant_taxon","Stratocladistics","Ernst_Haeckel","Recapitulation_theory","Ontogeny","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Bauplan","Bioinformatics","Biomathematics","Cladistics","Evolutionary_taxonomy","Coalescent_theory","Computational_phylogenetics","EDGE_of_Existence_Programme","Language_family","Maximum_parsimony","Molecular_phylogeny","PhyloCode","Joe_Felsenstein","Systematics","Phylogenetic_tree","Phylogenetic_network","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","List_of_phylogenetics_software","Phylogenetic_tree_viewers","Phylogenomics","Phylogeography","Phylodynamics","Phylogenetic_comparative_methods","Microbial_phylogenetics","Ontogeny_(psychoanalysis)","Ontogeny","Phylogeny_(psychoanalysis)","Sydney_Brenner","PhylomeDB"]}
