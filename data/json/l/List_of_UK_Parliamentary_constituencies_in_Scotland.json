{"cursor":"16887","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Scottish Westminster constituencies' were Scottish constituencies of the\nHouse of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain, normally at the Palace\nof Westminster, from 1708 to 1801, and have been constituencies of the House\nof Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, also at Westminster,\nsince 1801. Constituency boundaries have changed on various occasions, and\nare now subject to both periodical and ad hoc reviews of the Boundary\nCommission for Scotland.\n\nSince 1950 each Scottish constituency has been either a burgh constituency or a\ncounty constituency, defined by geographic boundaries and representing a seat\nfor one Member of Parliament (MP). More historically there have been university\nconstituencies and constituencies representing two or three parliamentary seats.\n\nScottish local government counties and burghs were abolished in 1975. A burgh\nconstituency is now one with a predominantly urban electorate, and a county\nconstituency is one with more than a token rural electorate.\n\nCounties and burghs were replaced with two-tier regions and districts and\nunitary islands council areas, and the regions and districts were replaced with\nunitary council areas in 1996.\n\nThe history of constituency boundaries can be divided into eleven distinct\nperiods, as below, each starting with the date of a general election when a new\nset of boundaries was first used.\n","linknr":305,"url":"List_of_UK_Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Scotland","recorded":1375076253,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=List_of_UK_Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Scotland&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1708_to_1832","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1832_to_1868","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1868_to_1885","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1885_to_1918","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1918_to_1950","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1950_to_1955","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1955_to_1974","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1974_to_1983","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1983_to_1997","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1997_to_2005","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_from_2005","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Constituencies","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Boundary_Commission_for_Scotland","/wiki/Burgh_constituency","/wiki/County_constituency","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/University_constituencies","/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland","/wiki/Counties_of_Scotland","/wiki/Burgh","/wiki/Regions_and_districts_of_Scotland","/wiki/Islands_council_areas_of_Scotland","/wiki/Council_areas_of_Scotland","/wiki/General_election","#1708_to_1832","#1832_to_1868","#1868_to_1885","#1885_to_1918","#1918_to_1950","#1950_to_1955","#1955_to_1974","#1974_to_1983","#1983_to_1997","#1997_to_2005","#2005_to_present","#Notes_and_references","/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1708_to_1832","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/British_general_election,_1708","/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland","/wiki/Edinburgh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Districts_of_burghs","/wiki/Parliament_of_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1802","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1806","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1807","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1812","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1818","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1820","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1826","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1830","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1831","/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1832_to_1868","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1832","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Scotland)_Act_1832","/wiki/Edinburgh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Glasgow_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_elections","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1835","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1837","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1841","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1847","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1852","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1857","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1859","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1865","/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Westminster_constituencies&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Scottish_Westminster_constituencies_1868_to_1885","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1868","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_(Scotland)_Act_1868","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_elections","/wiki/England","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1867","/wiki/Edinburgh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Dundee_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Glasgow_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1874","/wiki/United_Kingdom_ge
