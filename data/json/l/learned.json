The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals and\nsome machines. Progress over time tends to follow learning curves. Learning is\nnot compulsory; it is contextual. It does not happen all at once, but builds\nupon and is shaped by what we already know. To that end, learning may be viewed\nas a process, rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge.\nLearning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are\nrelatively permanent.<ref name=\"Schacter\"></ref>\n\nHuman learning may occur as part of education, personal development, schooling,\nor training. It may be goal-oriented and may be aided by motivation. The study\nof how learning occurs is part of neuropsychology, educational psychology,\nlearning theory, and pedagogy. Learning may occur as a result of habituation or\nclassical conditioning, seen in many animal species, or as a result of more\ncomplex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.<r-\nef>[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle\nGyms: The Evolution of Animal\nPlay]</ref><ref>[http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php What behavior can\nwe expect of octopuses?]</ref> Learning may occur consciously or without\nconscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor\nescaped is called learned helplessness.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-\nhelplessness]</ref> There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally,\nin which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation,\nindicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed\nfor learning and memory to occur very early on in development.<ref>Sandman,\nWadhwa, Hetrick, Porto & Peeke.

Child Development, 68,\n1031â€“1040.</ref>\n\nPlay has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning.\nChildren experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact\nthrough play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's\ndevelopment, since they make meaning of their environment through play. 85\npercent of brain development occurs during the first five years of a child's\nlife.<ref name=\"His Highness The Aga Khan IV\"></ref> The context of conversation\nbased on moral reasoning offers some proper observations on the responsibilities\nof parents.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Learning","headings":["Types of learning","Domains of learning","Transfer of learning","Active learning","Further reading","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Behavior","2: Pedagogy","2: Habituation","2: Classical_conditioning","2: Stimulation","2: Predator","1: Knowledge","1: Skill","1: Preference","1: Information","1: Machine_learning","1: Learning_curve","1: Education","1: Personal_development","1: Training","1: Goal-oriented","1: Motivation","1: Neuropsychology","1: Educational_psychology","1: Conscious","1: Prenatal","1: Gestation","1: Central_nervous_system","1: Developmental_psychology","1: Lev_Vygotsky","1: Owl","1: Proboscis_extension_reflex","1: Operant_conditioning","1: Relational_Frame_Theory","1: John_B._Watson","1: Little_Albert","1: Psychology","1: Ethology","1: Observation","1: Dance","1: Mammal","1: Bird","1: Orca","1: Injury","1: Infection","1: Energy","1: Physical_fitness","1: Problem-solving","1: Enculturation","1: Acculturation","1: Episodic_memory","1: Semantic_memory","1: Multimedia_learning","1: Dual-coding_theory","1: Electronic_learning","1: Internet","1: Computer_network","1: Mobile_learning","1: Cellular_phone","1: Augmented_learning","1: Minimally_Invasive_Education","1: Memorizing","1: Recollection","1: Teaching","1: Rubik's_Cube","1: Muscle_memory","1: Benjamin_Bloom","1: Cognitive","1: Psychomotor","1: Affective","1: Chess","1: History_of_chess","1: Metacognition","1: Oswego_Movement","1: Epistemology","1: Instructional_theory","1: Androgogy","1: Heutagogy","1: Neuroscience"]}
