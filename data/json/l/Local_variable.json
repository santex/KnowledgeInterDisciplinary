{"cursor":"5356","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer science, a 'local variable' is a variable that is given local\n[[scope (programming)|scope]]. Such a variable is accessible only from the\nfunction or block in which it is declared. In programming languages with only\ntwo levels of visibility, local variables are contrasted with global variables.\nOn the other hand, many ALGOL-derived languages allow any number of levels of\nnested functions with private variables, functions, constants and types hidden\nwithin them.\n\nIn most languages, local variables are automatic variables stored on the call\nstack directly. This means that when a recursive function calls itself, local\nvariables in each instance of the function are given distinct addresses. Hence\nvariables of this scope can be declared, written to, and read, without any risk\nof side-effects to functions outside of the block in which they are declared.\n\nProgramming languages that employ [[call by value]] semantics provide a called\nsubroutine with its own local copy of the arguments passed to it. In most\nlanguages, these local parameters are treated the same as other local variables\nwithin the subroutine. In contrast, [[call by reference]] and [[call by name]]\nsemantics allow the parameters to act as aliases of the values passed as\narguments, allowing the subroutine to modify variables outside its own scope.\n\nVariables of local scope are used to avoid issues with side-effects that can\noccur with global variables.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Local_variable","recorded":1362574099,"links":21,"instances":["computer_science","programming_language","programming","programming_language","computer_science","programming","programming"],"pdf":["http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf"],"categories":["Variable (computer programming)"],"headings":["Static local variables","<code>local</code> in Perl","Local variables in Ruby","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variable","programming"],["block","programming"],["recursion","computer_science"],["side-effect","computer_science"],["side-effect","computer_science"],["c","programming_language"],["scope","programming"],["scope","programming"],["ruby","programming_language"]],"members":["recursion","c","variable","ruby","block","scope"],"related":["Computer_science","Variable_(programming)","Subroutine","Block_(programming)","Programming_language","Global_variables","ALGOL","Nested_function","Automatic_variable","Call_stack","Recursion_(computer_science)","Memory_address","Side-effect_(computer_science)","Function_argument","Side-effect_(computer_science)","Global_variable","C_(programming_language)","C++","Visual_Basic","Visual_Basic_.NET","Static_memory_allocation","Scope_(programming)","Static_variable","Perl","Scope_(programming)","Ruby_(programming_language)","Global_variable","Non-local_variable"]}
