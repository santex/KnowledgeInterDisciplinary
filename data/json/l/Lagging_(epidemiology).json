It may be motivated by that the\nactual outcome had actually occurred before the registration of it, and that the\nlast exposure before registration did not contribute to the case.

Protopathic bias is a potential bias when there is a lag time from\nthe first symptoms and start of treatment before actual diagnosis.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Lagging_(epidemiology)","recorded":1362902860,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epidemiology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Epidemiology","Risk_factor","Protopathic_bias"]}
