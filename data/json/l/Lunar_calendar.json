{"cursor":"5296","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'lunar calendar' is a calendar that is based on cycles of the lunar phase.\nBecause there are about twelve lunations (synodic months) in a solar year, this\nperiod (354.37 days) is sometimes referred to as a 'lunar year'.\n\nA common purely lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar or Hijri Qamari\ncalendar. A feature of the Islamic calendar is that a year is always 12\nmonths, so the months are not linked with the seasons and drift each solar\nyear by 11 to 12 days. It comes back to the position it had in relation to the\nsolar year approximately every 33 Islamic years. It is used mainly for\nreligious purposes, and in Saudi Arabia it is the official calendar. In other\nsystems, a lunar calendar may include extra months added that synchronize it\nwith the solar calendar.\n","linknr":610,"url":"Lunar_calendar","recorded":1362268729,"links":66,"instances":["timekeeping"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~belenka/Newton-calendar.pdf"],"categories":["Calendars","Specific calendars"],"headings":["Lunisolar calendars","Start of the lunar month","Length of the lunar month","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/MontreGousset001.jpg/32px-MontreGousset001.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intercalation","timekeeping"]],"members":["intercalation"],"related":["Calendar","Lunar_phase","Synodic_month","Islamic_calendar","Tropical_year","Saudi_Arabia","Lunisolar_calendar","Intercalation_(timekeeping)","Hebrew_calendar","Chinese_calendar","Hindu_calendar","Lunation","Banks_Islands","Palolo_worm","India","China","Korea","Japan","Vietnam","Nepal","Diwali","Chinese_New_Year","Táº¿t","Mid-Autumn_Festival","Chuseok","Nepal_Sambat","New_moon","Lunar_phase","Continued_fraction","Computus","Isaac_Newton","Tabular_Islamic_calendar","Lunar_phase","Islamic_calendar","Persian_calendar","Celtic_calendar","Hindu_calendar","Epact","Hebrew_calendar"]}
