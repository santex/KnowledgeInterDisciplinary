This North American diocese (known by a number of names throughout its\nhistory) was ruled by a bishop or archbishop assigned by the Russian Church.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, communication between the Russian\nOrthodox Church and the churches of North America was almost completely cut off.\nIn 1920, Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches\noutside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously until regular communication\nand travel could be resumed. As a result, many Orthodox communities with a non-\nRussian background turned to Churches in their respective homelands for pastoral\ncare and governance.\n\nAfter declaring the autonomy of the North American Diocese (known as the\n\"Metropolia\") in February 1924, Archbishop Platon (Rozhdestvensky) became the\nfirst Metropolitan of All America and Canada. Since that time, the primate of\nthe OCA has been known as Metropolitan of All America and Canada, in addition to\nhis role as the archbishop of an OCA diocese. When the OCA (then known as the\nRussian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in North America) was granted autocephaly\nby the Russian Church in 1970 (an act not recognized by all Orthodox\njurisdictions), it was renamed the Orthodox Church in America, and the ruling\nMetropolitan was granted the additional title of His Beatitude.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!Name !Place of birth !Birth name !Jurisdiction !Dates of rule !Notes\n|-\n|Joasaph (Bolotov) |Strazhkov, Kashinsky District |Ivan Ilyich Bolotov |Bishop\nof Kodiak, Auxiliary of the Irkutsk Diocese\n|1799\n|Joasaph was elected bishop in 1796, but news did not reach him until 1798.
