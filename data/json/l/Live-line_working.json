{"cursor":"15898","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn electrical engineering, 'live-line working' is the maintenance of electrical\nequipment, often operating at high voltage, while the equipment is energised.\nThe first techniques for live-line working were developed in the early years of\nthe 20th century, and both equipment and work methods were later refined to deal\nwith increasingly higher voltages. In the 1960s, methods were developed in the\nlaboratory to enable field workers to come into direct contact with high voltage\nlines. Such methods can be applied to enable safe work at the highest\ntransmission voltages.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Live-line_working","recorded":1362538175,"links":23,"instances":["electrical","electricity","electrical","occupation"],"pdf":["http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/public/000000000001008746.pdf","http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/public/000000000001008746.pdf","http://www.simson.net/ref/1988/IEEE_Working_Live.pdf","http://www.simson.net/ref/1988/IEEE_Working_Live.pdf","http://www.vde-kongress.de/NR/rdonlyres/0B8B61EF-2ACC-4C29-8E66-1CFF652E1BEB/20815/etg_1_09.pdf","http://www.vde-kongress.de/NR/rdonlyres/0B8B61EF-2ACC-4C29-8E66-1CFF652E1BEB/20815/etg_1_09.pdf","http://www.vde-kongress.de/NR/rdonlyres/5D1FB137-884E-41F0-88E2-B257717C84F6/20907/etg_3_12.pdf","http://www.vde-kongress.de/NR/rdonlyres/5D1FB137-884E-41F0-88E2-B257717C84F6/20907/etg_3_12.pdf"],"categories":["Electric power","Electrical safety"],"headings":["Background","Methods","General precautions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Lineman_changing_transformer.jpg/280px-Lineman_changing_transformer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lineman","occupation"],["ground","electricity"],["fuse","electrical"],["insulator","electrical"],["lineman","occupation"]],"members":["insulator","ground","fuse","lineman"],"related":["Electrical_engineering","High_voltage","Lineman_(occupation)","Electric_shock","Fibrillation","Respiratory_failure","Lyon","France","Electric_field","Electrical_breakdown","Electric_arc","Ground_(electricity)","Electric_utility","Power_outage","Radial","Electrical_load","Economic_dispatch","Hot_stick","Electric_potential","Mutual_inductance","Fuse_(electrical)","Fibreglass","Socket_wrench","American_Electric_Power","Electric_potential","Insulator_(electrical)","Stockbridge_dampers","Rope_splicing","Faraday_suit","Faraday_cage","Russia","Autorecloser","Circuit_breaker","Short_circuit","Surge_diverter","Electric_arc","Ultraviolet","Arc_eye","Blindness","Lineman_(occupation)"]}
