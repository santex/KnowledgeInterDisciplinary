{"cursor":"8513","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has had occurrences of actors\nand actresses nominated for two different Academy Awards in acting categories in\na single year, with the first instance in 1938. Provided that they receive\nenough votes from the Academy in both categories to earn a nomination, there are\nno restrictions on actors being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor\nand Best Supporting Actor or actresses being nominated for the Academy Award for\nBest Actress and Best Supporting Actress in any given year. The sole rule with regard to multiple nominations is that an\nactor or actress cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance.\nThis rule was introduced in 1944 after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor\nnomination and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in [[Going\nMy Way]].\n\nAs of 2013, 11 actors and actresses have been nominated for two different\nAcademy Awards in the same year. The first of these actors and actresses was Fay\nBainter, who received nominations for her performances in [[White Banners]] and\n[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]] at the 11th Academy Awards. The most recent\noccurrence was during the 80th Academy Awards, in which Cate Blanchett received\nnominations for [[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]] and [[I'm Not There]]. Seven of these actors and actresses received an Academy Award\nin one of the categories they were nominated in, and none have won two Academy\nAwards in the same year. Four did not receive an Academy Award in either\ncategory: Sigourney Weaver (nominations for [[Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of\nDian Fossey|Gorillas in the Mist]] and [[Working Girl]]), Emma Thompson (nominations for [[The Remains\nof the Day]] and [[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the\nFather]]), Julianne Moore (nominations\nfor [[Far from Heaven]] and [[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]), and Cate Blanchett (nominations for Elizabeth: The\nGolden Age and I'm Not There).\n","linknr":408,"url":"List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year","recorded":1375087845,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Academy_Awards","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","#cite_note-Rule6-1","/wiki/Barry_Fitzgerald","/wiki/Going_My_Way","#cite_note-ActorList-2","/wiki/Fay_Bainter","/wiki/White_Banners","/wiki/Jezebel_(film)","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/80th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Cate_Blanchett","/wiki/Elizabeth:_The_Golden_Age","/wiki/I%27m_Not_There","#cite_note-ActorList-2","/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver","/wiki/Gorillas_in_the_Mist:_The_Story_of_Dian_Fossey","/wiki/Working_Girl","#cite_note-MoviefoneWeaverAwards-3","/wiki/Emma_Thompson","/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day","/wiki/In_the_Name_of_the_Father_(film)","#cite_note-MoviefoneThompsonAwards-4","/wiki/Julianne_Moore","/wiki/Far_from_Heaven","/wiki/The_Hours_(film)","#cite_note-NYTMooreAwards-5","#cite_note-NYTBlanchettAwards-6","#Nominees","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1938_in_film","/wiki/11th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Fay_Bainter","/wiki/White_Banners","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","/wiki/Jezebel_(film)","/wiki/1942_in_film","/wiki/15th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Teresa_Wright","/wiki/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees","/wiki/Mrs._Miniver_(film)","/wiki/1944_in_film","/wiki/17th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Barry_Fitzgerald","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor","/wiki/Going_My_Way","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor","/wiki/1982_in_film","/wiki/55th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Jessica_Lange","/wiki/Frances","/wiki/Tootsie","/wiki/1988_in_film","/wiki/61st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver","/wiki/Gorillas_in_the_Mist:_The_Story_of_Dian_Fossey","/wiki/Working_Girl","/wiki/1992_in_film","/wiki/65th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Al_Pacino","/wiki/Scent_of_a_Woman_(1992_film)","/wiki/Glengarry_Glen_Ross_(film)","/wiki/1993_in_film","/wiki/66th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Holly_Hunter","/wiki/The_Piano","/wiki/The_Firm_(1993_film)","/wiki/Emma_Thompson","/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)","/wiki/In_the_Name_of_the_Father_(film)","/wiki/2002_in_film","/wiki/75th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Julianne_Moore","/wiki/Far_from_Heaven","/wiki/The_Hours_(film)","/wiki/2004_in_film","/wiki/77th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Jamie_Foxx","/wiki/Ray_(film)","/wiki/Collateral_(film)","/wiki/2007_in_film","/wiki/80th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Cate_Blanchett","/wiki/Elizabeth:_The_Golden_Age","/wiki/I%27m_Not_There","/w/index.php?title=List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Video-x-generic.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Video-x-generic.svg/28px-Video-x-generic.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Film","/wiki/List_of_actors_nominated_for_Academy_Awards_for_foreign_language_performances","/w/index.php?title=List_of_actors_nominated_for_two_Academy_Awards_in_the_same_year&action=edit&section=3","http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/actingtwoinone.html","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","#cite_ref-Rule6_1-0","http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule06.html","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#text_ignored","#cite_ref-ActorList_2-0","#cite_ref-ActorList_2-1","http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/actingtwoinone.html","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","#cite_ref-MoviefoneWeaverAwards_3-0","http://www.moviefone.com/celebrity/sigourney-weaver/1137055/awards","/wiki/Moviefone","#cite_ref-MoviefoneThompsonAwards_4-0","http://www.moviefone.com/celebrity/emma-thompson/2158709/awards","/wiki/Moviefone","#cite_ref-NYTMooreAwards_5-0","http://movies.nytimes.com/person/50325/Julianne-M
