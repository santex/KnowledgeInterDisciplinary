Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases. In\nturn, it is part of the even broader group of diseases affecting the blood, bone\nmarrow, and lymphoid system, which are all known as hematological neoplasms.\n\nIn 2000 approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world developed\nsome form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. About 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults. {{cite web\n| url = http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html#incidence-mortality\n| title = SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Leukemia year = 2011
