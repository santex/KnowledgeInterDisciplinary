In this process, light energy is converted into chemical energy, in\nthe form of the energy-carrying molecules ATP and NADPH. In the [[light-\nindependent reactions]], the formed NADPH and ATP drive the reduction of to more\nuseful organic compounds, such as glucose. However, although light-independent\nreactions are, by convention, also called dark reactions, they are not\nindependent of the need of light, for they are driven by ATP and NADPH, products\nof light. They are often called the Calvin Cycle or C3 Cycle.\n\nThe light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membrane inside a\nchloroplast. The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and\noutside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent\nreactions take place. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane\nprotein complexes that catalyze the light reactions. There are four major\nprotein complexes in the thylakoid membrane: Photosystem I (PSI), Photosystem II\n(PSII), Cytochrome b6f complex, and ATP synthase. These four complexes work\ntogether to ultimately create the products ATP and NADPH.\n\nThe two photosystems absorb light energy through pigments - primarily the\nchlorophylls, which are responsible for the green color of leaves. The light-\ndependent reactions begin in photosystem II. When a chlorophyll ''a''\nmolecule within the reaction center of PSII absorbs a photon, an electron in\nthis molecule attains a higher energy level. Because this state of an\nelectron is very unstable, the electron is transferred from one to another\nmolecule creating a chain of redox reactions, called an electron transport\nchain (ETC). The electron flow goes from PSII to cytochrome b6f to PSI. In\nPSI, the electron gets the energy from another photon. The final electron\nacceptor is NADP. In [[Photosynthesis#Overview|oxygenic photosynthesis]],\nthe first electron donor is water, creating oxygen as a waste product. In\n[[Photosynthesis#Overview|anoxygenic photosynthesis]] various electron\ndonors are used.\n\nCytochrome b6f and ATP synthase work together to create ATP. This process is\ncalled photophosphorylation, which occurs in two different ways. In non-cyclic\nphotophosphorylation, cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons from PSII to\npump protons from the stroma to the lumen. The proton gradient across the\nthylakoid membrane creates a proton-motive force, used by ATP synthase to form\nATP. In cyclic photophosphorylation, cytochrome b6f uses the energy of electrons\nfrom not only PSII but also PSI to create more ATP and to stop the production of\nNADPH. Cyclic phosphorylation is important to create ATP and maintain NADPH in\nthe right proportion for the light-independent reactions.\n\nThe net-reaction of all light-dependent reactions in oxygenic\nphotosynthesis is:\n\n'2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NADP|+}} + 3ADP + 3P i â {{chem|O|2}} +\n2NADPH + 3ATP'\n\nThe two photosystems are protein complexes that absorb photons and are able to\nuse this energy to create an electron transport chain. Photosystem I and II are\nvery similar in structure and function. They use special proteins, called light-\nharvesting complexes, to absorb the photons with very high effectiveness. If a\nspecial pigment molecule in a photosynthetic reaction center absorbs a photon,\nan electron in this pigment attains the excited state and then is transferred to\nanother molecule in the reaction center. This reaction, called [[photoinduced\ncharge separation]], is the start of the electron flow and is unique because it\ntransforms light energy into chemical forms.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Light-dependent_reactions","recorded":1362893175,"links":31,"instances":["chemistry","biochemist","fluid","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Light reactions|"],"headings":["The reaction center","Photosynthetic electron transport chains in chloroplasts","Photosynthetic electron transport chains in bacteria","History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Thylakoid_membrane.png/500px-Thylakoid_membrane.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"],["stroma","fluid"],["stroma","anatomy"],["dimer","chemistry"],["ferredoxin—nadp(+_reductase"],["stroma","fluid"],["robin_hill","biochemist"]],"members":["dimer","robin_hill","stroma","lumen"],"related":["Photosynthesis","Plant","Energy","Sunlight","Chemical_energy","Adenosine_triphosphate","NADPH","NADPH","Adenosine_triphosphate","Glucose","Calvin_Cycle","Thylakoid","Chloroplast","Lumen_(anatomy)","Stroma_(fluid)","Integral_membrane_protein","Photosystem_I","Photosystem_II","Cytochrome_b6f_complex","ATP_synthase","Pigment","Chlorophylls","Chlorophyll_a","Reaction_center","Photon","Electron","Energy_level","Redox","Electron_transport_chain","Water","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","Photophosphorylation","Protons","Stroma_(anatomy)","Thylakoid_lumen","Light-independent_reactions","Photosystem","Protein","Photons","Electron_transport_chain","Light-harvesting_complex","Reaction_center","Electron","Excited_state","Molecule","Dimer_(chemistry)","Chlorophyll","P680","P700","Electron","Resonance_energy_transfer","Photoinduced_charge_separation","Picosecond","Electron","Photoinhibition","Electron_acceptor","Ångström","Ångström","Exergonic_reaction","Marcus_theory","NADPH","Photosynthesis","Chloroplasts","Electron","P680","PSII","Excited","Electron_acceptor","Redox","Electron_transport_chain","PS_I","Excited","Z-scheme","Redox","Plastoquinol","Cytochrome_b6f","Plastocyanin","Ferredoxin—NADP(+)_reductase","Stroma_(fluid)","NADPH","Protons","Proton","ATP_synthase","Photons","Solid-state_physics","Water-splitting_complex","Cytochrome_b6f_complex","Iron-sulfur_protein","Precambrian","Colin_Flannery","Joseph_Priestley","Cornelius_Van_Niel","Robin_Hill_(biochemist)","Photosystem","Light-independent_reaction","Photosynthetic_reaction_centre","Photosystem_II","Compensation_point"]}
