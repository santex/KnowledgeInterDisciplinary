{"cursor":"3936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Loci Theologici' was a term applied by Melanchthon to Evangelical systems of\ndogmatics and retained by many as late as the seventeenth century.\n\nThe word was borrowed, as he himself says, from the usage of the classic\nrhetoricians, in whose works [[wiktionary:topoi|topoi]] or\n[[wiktionary:loci|loci]], denote the places or sources from which proofs are\ndeduced. Various systematized indexes of these loci were made from the days of\nAristotle, and mere formal categories, such as \"person,\" \"nature,\" or \"fortune,\"\nwere also reckoned under this head. It was the particular task of the\nrhetorician, however, to trace the concrete case, or \"hypothesis,\" to the\ngeneral, or \"thesis.\" Thus were evolved loci communes, or arguments which could\nbe applied to many specific cases. The humanistic rhetoricians frequently\nconfused loci communes with simple loci, or general basal concepts. This was\nespecially true of Melanchthon, as is clear from his De rhetorica libritres\n(Cologne, 1519), in which he sought to train students for disputation.\n\nHe accordingly advised them to prepare lists of all possible loci communes, and\nto enter under the proper rubrics (capita) any examples gathered in the course\nof their reading. Among theological loci communes he lists \"faith,\" \"destruction\nof the body,\" \"Church,\" \"word of God,\" \"patience,\" \"sin,\" \"law,\" \"grace,\"\n\"love,\" and \"ceremony.\" Elsewhere he defines loci communes as \"certain general\nrules of living, of which men are persuaded by nature, and which I might not\nunjustly call the laws of nature.\" These two definitions, however, are not\nclearly distinguished and the discussion of the loci communes is consequently\nsomewhat vague.\n\nThis criticism applies also to the loci theologici of his famous [[Loci\nCommunes|Loci communes rerum theologicarum]] (1521), which are primarily basal\nconcepts appearing in the science of theology, to which all in it must be\nreferred. He accordingly begins with his favorite list \"God,\" \"one,\"\n\"triple,\" and \"creation,\" and closes with \"condemnation \" and \"beatitude.\"\nAlthough this list was derived from Peter Lombard,\n\nMelanchthon's treatment is not only more clear than that of his predecessor, but\nhe draws his examples from the Bible instead of from the Church Fathers, and\nunder Pauline influence deduces, in addition to loci communes, certain loci\ncommunissimi, such as \"sin,\" \"grace,\" and \"law.\" In view of the long and\npowerful influence of this book, the result of his failure to give a methodical\nproof of his series of loci was that Lutheran dogmatics was slow in reaching\ninherent unity. The term loci theologici gradually came to denote the content,\nand thus the chief passages of the Bible as included in the individual loci.\n\nFor Lutheran theology, Melanchthon's book had the same importance which the work\nof Peter Lombard possessed for scholasticism. His loci were the subject of\ncommentary as late as Leonhard Hutter, and the term loci communes came to\nconnote any work dealing with the sum of Christian doctrine. Among the Reformed\nthe phrase loci communes was accepted by Wolfgang Musculus (Basel, 1560), Peter\nMartyr (London, 1576), Johannes Maccovius (Franeker, 1639), and Daniel Chamier\n(Geneva, 1653). After the middle of the seventeenth century, however, with the\nrise of a more systematic treatment of dogmatics the term fell into disuse.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Loci_Theologici","recorded":1363436293,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Melanchthon","/wiki/Protestant","/wiki/Dogmatic_theology","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/topoi","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loci","/wiki/Aristotle","/wiki/Melanchthon","/wiki/Faith_in_Christianity","/wiki/Christian_Church","/wiki/Sin","/wiki/Ten_Commandments","/wiki/Divine_grace","/wiki/Love_(religious_views)","/wiki/Ceremony","/wiki/Loci_Communes","#cite_note-1","/wiki/God","/wiki/Creation_myth","/wiki/Peter_Lombard","/wiki/Bible","/wiki/Church_Fathers","/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus","/wiki/Lutheran","/wiki/Bible","/wiki/Peter_Lombard","/wiki/Scholasticism","/wiki/Leonhard_Hutter","/wiki/Reformed","/wiki/Wolfgang_Musculus","/wiki/Johannes_Maccovius","/wiki/Daniel_Chamier","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Loci_Communes","/wiki/Lutheran_scholasticism","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Loci_Theologici","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/New_Schaff%E2%80%93Herzog_Encyclopedia_of_Religious_Knowledge#External_links","/wiki/New_Schaff%E2%80%93Herzog_Encyclopedia_of_Religious_Knowledge","http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc07/htm/ii.ii.htm","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&oldid=505988866","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:History_of_Lutheranism","/wiki/Category:Lutheran_theology","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_Schaff-Herzog_with_no_title_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_Schaff-Herzog","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Loci+Theologici&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Loci+Theologici","/wiki/Loci_Theologici","/wiki/Talk:Loci_Theologici","#","/wiki/Loci_Theologici","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Loci_Theologici","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Loci_Theologici","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&oldid=505988866","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Loci_Theologici&id=505988866","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Loci+Theologici","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Loci+Theologici&oldid=505988866&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Loci_Theologici&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loci_Theologici","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=
