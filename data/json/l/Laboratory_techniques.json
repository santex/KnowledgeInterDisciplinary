{"cursor":"8308","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (Taiwan)]]\n\nA 'laboratory' ( or ; informally, 'lab') is a facility that provides controlled\nconditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be\nperformed.\n\nLabs used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing\nrequirements of specialists in the various fields of science. A physics lab\nmight contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy lab\ncould have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their\nstrength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a\npsychologist's lab might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in\nwhich to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by\ncomputer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either\nsimulations or the analysis of data collected elsewhere. Scientists in other\nfields will use still other types of laboratories.\n\nDespite the great differences among laboratories, some features are common. The\nuse of workbenches or countertops at which the scientist may choose to either\nsit or stand is a common way to ensure comfortable working conditions for the\ncabinets for the storage of laboratory equipment is quite common. It is\ntraditional for a scientist to record an experiment's progress in a laboratory\nnotebook, but modern labs almost always contain at least one computer\nworkstation for data collection and analysis.\n\nScientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in industry,\nin government or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft. A\nlaboratory might offer work space for just one to more than thirty researchers\ndepending on its size and purpose. Recently, a new type of laboratory called\nOpen Laboratory has emerged. Its format allows the sharing of space, equipment,\nsupport staff between different research groups and also fosters information\nexchange through communications across fields.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Laboratory_techniques","recorded":1362479198,"links":78,"instances":["metalworking","glassware","furniture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratories|"],"headings":["History of laboratories","Laboratory techniques","Laboratory equipment","Specialised types of laboratory","Laboratory safety","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CICB%27s_Laboratory_.jpg/350px-CICB%27s_Laboratory_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Chemistry_Laboratory_-_Bench.jpg/220px-Chemistry_Laboratory_-_Bench.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Chemielabor_des_18._Jahrhunderts%2C_Naturhistorisches_Museum_Wien.jpg/120px-Chemielabor_des_18._Jahrhunderts%2C_Naturhistorisches_Museum_Wien.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Edison_in_his_NJ_laboratory_1901.jpg/115px-Edison_in_his_NJ_laboratory_1901.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Fotothek_df_n-09_0000024.jpg/118px-Fotothek_df_n-09_0000024.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Lab_glassware.jpg/250px-Lab_glassware.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/2008-07-02_Eye_wash_station.jpg/220px-2008-07-02_Eye_wash_station.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["casting","metalworking"],["cabinet","furniture"],["beaker","glassware"]],"members":["casting","beaker","cabinet"],"related":["Taiwan","Science","Research","Experiment","Measurement","Research","Physics","Particle_accelerator","Vacuum","Metallurgy","Casting_(metalworking)","Refining","Strength_of_materials","Chemistry","Biology","Wet_laboratory","Psychology","Computer_scientist","Computer","Supercomputer","Computer_simulation","Data_analysis","Data","Workbench","Countertop","Scientist","Cabinet_(furniture)","Laboratory_notebook","School","University","Industry","Government","Military","Ship","Spacecraft","Chemistry","Antoine_Lavoisier","Thomas_Edison","Natural_sciences","Chemistry","Biology","Physics","Scientific_method","Laboratory_glassware","Erlenmeyer_flask","Graduated_cylinder","Volumetric_flask","Bunsen_burner","Microscope","Operant_conditioning_chamber","Spectrophotometer","Calorimeter","Laboratory_glassware","Beaker_(glassware)","Reagent_bottle","Thermometer","Experiment","Measurement","Data","Scientific_instrument","Film_laboratory","Darkroom","Clandestine_chemistry","Illegal_drug","Computer_lab","Crime_lab","Crime_scene","Media_lab","Medical_laboratory","Public_health_laboratory","Poison","Infectious_agent","Flammable","Explosive","Radioactive","Machinery","Temperatures","Laser","Magnetic_field","High_voltage","Safety","Safety_equipment","Emergency","Contamination_control","ISO/IEC_17025","Lab_website","Workshop","Hackspace"]}
