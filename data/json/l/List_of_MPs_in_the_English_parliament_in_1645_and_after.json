{"cursor":"52814","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThis is a 'list of [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the second half of the\n[[Long Parliament]]' which began in the reign of King Charles I and continued\ninto the Commonwealth.\n\nThe fifth and last Parliament of Charles I began at Westminster 3 November 1640\nand continued sitting till 20 April 1653, when it was dissolved. By 1645 a\nconsiderable proportion of the house had been removed, being expelled for\nvarious reasons, disabled for supporting the King, killed in the Civil War or\nlost through natural causes. Their seats were left vacant for several years and\nwere filled by new elections after around 1645, so that new MPs supplemented\nthose that had survived since 1640.\n\nIn December 1648 the army imposed its will on parliament and large numbers of\nMPs were excluded under Pride's Purge, creating the Rump Parliament. Many who\nwere not officially excluded did not participate in the affairs of the house.\nAlthough the parliament was dissolved in 1653 and four intervening parliaments\nwere called, the Long Parliament was reconvened in 1659 for another dissolution.\n\nThis list contains details of the MPs in the house after 1645. For the original\nmembership of the House of Commons in 1640 see List of MPs elected to the\nEnglish parliament in 1640 (November).\n","linknr":1038,"url":"List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after","recorded":1375076255,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1603-1649).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg/150px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg.png","/w/index.php?title=9th_Parliament_of_Elizabeth_1&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1597","/w/index.php?title=Final_parliament_of_Elizabeth_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1601","/w/index.php?title=1st_parliament_of_King_James_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1604","/wiki/Addled_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1614","/w/index.php?title=3rd_parliament_of_King_James_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1621","/wiki/Happy_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1624","/wiki/Useless_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1625","/wiki/2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1626","/wiki/3rd_parliament_of_King_Charles_I","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1628","/wiki/Short_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(April)","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_not_excluded_from_the_English_parliament_in_1648","/wiki/Barebone%27s_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_nominated_to_the_English_parliament_in_1653","/wiki/First_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1654","/wiki/Second_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1656","/wiki/Third_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1659","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_not_excluded_from_the_English_parliament_in_1648","/wiki/Convention_Parliament_(1660)","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_Parliament_in_1660","/wiki/Cavalier_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_Parliament_in_1661","/wiki/List_of_Parliaments_of_England","/wiki/Template:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679","/wiki/Template_talk:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679&action=edit","/wiki/Members_of_Parliament","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)","#List_of_constituencies_and_MPs","#Bedfordshire","#Berkshire","#Buckinghamshire","#Cambridgeshire","#Cheshire","#Cornwall","#Cumberland","#Derbyshire","#Devon","#Dorset","#Essex","#Gloucestershire","#Hampshire","#Herefordshire","#Hertfordshire","#Huntingdonshire","#Kent_.28see_also_Cinque_Ports.29","#Lancashire","#Leicestershire","#Lincolnshire","#Middlesex","#Monmouthshire","#Norfolk","#Northamptonshire","#Northumberland","#Nottinghamshire","#Oxfordshire","#Rutland","#Salop","#Somerset","#Staffordshire","#Suffolk","#Surrey","#Sussex","#Warwickshire","#Westmorland","#Wiltshire","#Worcestershire","#Yorkshire","#Cinque_Ports","#Wales","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg/170px-Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg","/wiki/File:Oliver_Cromwell_by_Samuel_Cooper.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:FrancisRous.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/FrancisRous.jpg/170px-FrancisRous.jpg","/wiki/File:FrancisRous.jpg","//b
