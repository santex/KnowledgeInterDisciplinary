It measures 8.5 by 11 inches ().\n\nRonald Reagan made this the paper size for U.S. federal forms in the early\n1980s; previously, the smaller \"official\" Government letter size, (), was\nused.\n\nIn the U.S., paper density is typically measured in \"pounds per ream\" (of 500\nsheets). Typical letter paper has a basis weight of 20 or 24 pounds (9 or\n11 kg) â the weight of 500 sheets (a ream) of paper at 70Â° F (21.11Â°C) and\nat 50% humidity. Blocksma, Mary. Reading the Numbers. New York: Penguin\nBooks, 1989. One ream of 20-pound letter-sized paper weighs 5 pounds, and\na single letter-sized sheet of 20-pound paper weighs 0.16 ounces (4.54 g),\nwhich is equivalent to 72 g/m 2 (72gsm) The common density of\nA4 paper is 80gsm.\n\nUnlike the A4 (210 Ã 297 mm) international standard (ISO) paper\nsizes which are used in most countries in the world today, the origin of the\ndimensions of letter size paper are lost in tradition. The American Forest and\nPaper Association argues that the dimension originates from the days of manual\npaper making, and that the 11-inch length of the page is about a quarter of \"the\naverage maximum stretch of an experienced vatman's arms\".\nHowever, this does not explain the width or aspect ratio.\n\nThe related paper size known as half letter, statement, or organizer L is\nexactly one half of the US letter size (8.5 Ã 5.5 in).\n","linknr":123,"url":"Letter_(paper_size)","recorded":1362569962,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Standards","Stationery"],"headings":["See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Letterpaper.jpg/250px-Letterpaper.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Comparison_paper_sizes.svg/350px-Comparison_paper_sizes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Nuvola_apps_kruler.png/35px-Nuvola_apps_kruler.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Paper_size","United_States","Canada","Mexico","Bolivia","Colombia","Venezuela","Philippines","Chile","Ronald_Reagan","Paper_ream","Fahrenheit","A4_paper","American_Forest_&_Paper_Association","ANSI/ASME_Y14.1","ISO_216"]}
