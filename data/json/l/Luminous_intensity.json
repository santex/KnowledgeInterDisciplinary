{"cursor":"4974","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn photometry, 'luminous intensity' is a measure of the wavelength-weighted\npower emitted by a light source in a particular direction per unit solid angle,\nbased on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the\nhuman eye. The SI unit of luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI\nbase unit.\n\nPhotometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human\neyes. The human eye can only see light in the visible spectrum and has\ndifferent sensitivities to light of different wavelengths within the spectrum.\nWhen adapted for bright conditions (photopic vision), the eye is most\nsensitive to greenish-yellow light at 555 nm. Light with the same radiant\nintensity at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity. The curve which\nmeasures the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard, known\nas the luminosity function. This curve, denoted V(λ) or\n\\textstyle \\overline{y}(\\lambda) , is based on an average of\nwidely differing experimental data from scientists using different measurement\ntechniques. For instance, the measured responses of the eye to violet light\nvaried by a factor of ten.\n\nLuminous intensity should not be confused with another photometric unit,\nluminous flux, which is the total perceived power emitted in all directions.\nLuminous intensity is the perceived power per unit solid angle. Luminous\nintensity is also not the same as the radiant intensity, the corresponding\nobjective physical quantity used in the measurement science of radiometry.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Luminous_intensity","recorded":1362556923,"links":51,"instances":["mass","physics","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities","Photometry"],"headings":["Units","Usage","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/6/456d0322b192e9144932fc00724fdb18.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/6/ee6bc3c401af4848196c829a054c3466.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/6/456d0322b192e9144932fc00724fdb18.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/2/d328f03ec0460dfa86ce4f56029923fe.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["photometry","optics"],["power","physics"],["grain","mass"]],"members":["grain","power","photometry"],"related":["Photometry_(optics)","Wavelength","Power_(physics)","Light_source","Solid_angle","Luminosity_function","Human_eye","SI","Candela","SI_base_unit","Visible_spectrum","Light","Photopic_vision","Radiant_intensity","Luminosity_function","Luminous_flux","Radiant_intensity","Physical_quantity","Radiometry","Operational_definition","Watt","Steradian","Radiant_flux","England","Candlepower","Spermaceti","Grain_(mass)","Hefnerkerze","Hefner_lamp","Jules_Violle","Luminosity_function","Spectrum","Radiance","Brightness"]}
