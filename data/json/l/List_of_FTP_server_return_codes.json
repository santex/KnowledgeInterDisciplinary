{"cursor":"9483","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"FTP server return codes always have three digits, and each digit has a special\nmeaning. RFC 959 The first digit denotes whether the response is good,\nbad or incomplete:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px\" | Range Purpose\n|- valign=\"top\" | 1xx Positive Preliminary reply\nThe requested action is being initiated; expect another reply before proceeding\nwith a new command. (The user-process sending another command before the\ncompletion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP processes\nshould queue any commands that arrive while a preceding command is in progress.)\nThis type of reply can be used to indicate that the command was accepted and the\nuser-process may now pay attention to the data connections, for implementations\nwhere simultaneous monitoring is difficult. The server-FTP process may send at\nmost, one 1xx reply per command.\n|- valign=\"top\" | 2xx Positive Completion reply\nThe requested action has been successfully completed. A new request may be\ninitiated.\n|- valign=\"top\" | 3xx Positive Intermediate reply\nThe command has been accepted, but the requested action is being held in\nabeyance, pending receipt of further information. The user should send\nanother command specifying this information. This reply is used in command\nsequence groups.\n|- valign=\"top\" | 4xx Transient Negative Completion reply\nThe command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place, but\nthe error condition is temporary and the action may be requested again. The user\nshould return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any. It is difficult\nto assign a meaning to \"transient\", particularly when two distinct sites (Server-\nand User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation. Each reply in the 4xx\ncategory might have a slightly different time value, but the intent is that the\nuser-process is encouraged to try again. A rule of thumb in determining if a\nreply fits into the 4xx or the 5xx (Permanent Negative) category is that replies\nare 4xx if the commands can be repeated without any change in command form or in\nproperties of the User or Server (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the\nsame arguments used; the user does not change his file access or user name; the\nserver does not put up a new implementation.)\n|- valign=\"top\" | 5xx Permanent Negative Completion reply\nThe command was not accepted and the requested action did not take place. The\nUser-process is discouraged from repeating the exact request (in the same\nsequence). Even some \"permanent\" error conditions can be corrected, so the human\nuser may want to direct his User-process to reinitiate the command sequence by\ndirect action at some point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been\nchanged, or the user has altered his directory status.)\n|- valign=\"top\" | 6xx Protected reply\nThe RFC 2228 introduced the concept of protected replies to increase security\nover the FTP communications. The 6xx replies are Base64 encoded protected\nmessages that serves as responses to secure commands. When properly decoded,\nthese replies fall into the above categories.\n|}\n\nThe second digit is a grouping digit and encodes the following information:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px\" | Range Purpose\n|- valign=\"top\" | x0x Syntax\nThese replies refer to syntax errors, syntactically correct commands that don't\nfit any functional category, unimplemented or superfluous commands.\n|- valign=\"top\" | x1x Information\nThese are replies to requests for information, such as status or help.\n|- valign=\"top\" | x2x Connections\nReplies referring to the control and data connections.\n|- valign=\"top\" | x3x Authentication and accounting\nReplies for the login process and accounting procedures.\n|- valign=\"top\" | x4x Unspecified as of RFC 959. - valign=\"top\" |\n| x5x File system\nThese replies indicate the status of the Server file system vis-a-vis the\nrequested transfer or other file system action.\n|}\n\nBelow is a list of all known return codes that may be issued by an FTP server.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px\" | Code Explanation\n|- 100 Series 'The requested action is being initiated, expect\n|another reply before proceeding with a new command.' - 110\n|Restart marker replay .
