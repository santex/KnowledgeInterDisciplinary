His contribututions to the\ndevelopment of cell biology made it possible to sort viable cells by their\nspecific properties.\n\nBorn in New York City, U.S.A., Herzenberg received his bachelors degree in 1952\nfrom Brooklyn College in biology and chemistry. In 1955, he received his Ph.D.\nfrom California Institute of Technology in biochemistry with a specialization in\nimmunology. After school he was a postdoctoral fellow at the American Cancer\nSociety, working in France at the Pasteur Institute. He returned to the United\nStates in 1957 and worked for the National Institutes of Health as an officer in\nthe Public Health Service department. He started working at Stanford in 1959. He\neventually earned the title Professor of Genetics.\n\nIn 1970 Herzenberg developed the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) which revolutionized immunology and cancer biology, and is\nthe basis for purification of adult stem cells.\n\nHerzenberg and his wife, Leonore (\"Lee\"), run the Herzenberg Laboratory at\nStanford. Their daughter Janet \"Jana Herzen\", is a singer-songwriter and the\nfounder of MotÃ©ma Music.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Leonard_Herzenberg","recorded":1362576100,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1931 births","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","Living people","American immunologists","American geneticists","Jewish American scientists","Stanford University School of Medicine faculty","California Institute of Technology alumni","Smithsonian Institution Archives related"],"headings":["Awards","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8e/LenHerzenberg.jpg/220px-LenHerzenberg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/10px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["New_York_City","New_York","Immunology","Genetics","Stanford_University","Brooklyn_College","California_Institute_of_Technology","Fluorescent-activated_cell_sorting","Kyoto_Prize","Immunologist","Geneticist","Stanford_University","Cell_biology","New_York_City","United_States","Brooklyn_College","California_Institute_of_Technology","American_Cancer_Society","Pasteur_Institute","National_Institutes_of_Health","Fluorescent-activated_cell_sorting","Stem_cell","Jana_Herzen","Motéma_Music","Kyoto_Prize","Cell_biology","New_York_City","New_York"]}
