{"cursor":"4320","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThis is a list of cheerleading jumps. \n\n; X Jump/Spread Eagle : You simply prep, swing, and jump with your arms in a\nhigh V and your legs spread apart. Just jump off the ground and it will look\nlike an X. This jump is generally used to practice group timing and snapping\nlegs down from a jump. ; Pencil/T/Straight Jump : This jump is probably the most\nsimple jump. It involves jumping completely straight with your arms in T-motion\nor in a point above your head. This jump is usually the first you would learn.\nMainly used for correcting the body position for the main jumps. ; Toe-Touch :\nIn this jump, the legs are straddled and straight, parallel to the ground, toes\npointed, knees are back, and your hands are in fists or blades and arms in a \"T\"\nmotion. Despite its name, you do not touch your toes during a toe touch, you\nreach out farther in front of your legs. keep your back straight and bring your\nlegs up to you. This is the most common cheer jump. ; Tuck : A jump in which the\ncheerleader uses stomach muscles to pull the legs up with thighs as close to the\nchest as possible, knees facing upward as if in a tucked position. ; Hurdler :\nThe straight leg is either forward (a front hurdler) with arms in candlesticks,\nor out to the side (a side hurdler) with arms in a T. The bent knee faces the\ncrowd in a side hurdler and the ground in a front hurdler. ;Right hurdler: a\nright hurdler is basically the same as a hurdler you're just facing the right,\nand the same with left side. ; Pike : This jump is among the most difficult of\njumps. Both legs are straight out, knees locked. Arms are in a touchdown motion\nout in front to create a folded position in the air, this motion is also called\n\"candlesticks\". This is often performed at a ninety-degree angle to the audience\nin order to show off the air position. ; Around the World : The Around the\nWorld, or the pike-out, is a jump where the performer hits a pike and then whips\nhis or her legs quickly back around into a toe touch. This jump is regarded as\ndifficult to accomplish, because two positions must be reached in the very short\ntime while the jumper is in the air. Not commonly used. ; Herkie : Named for\nLawrence R. Herkimer, the founder of the National Cheerleaders Association, this\njump is similar to a side-hurdler, except that instead of both arms being in a\n\"T\" shaped motion, both arms are opposite of what the leg beneath them is doing.\nExample of this would be the straight arm would be on the side of the bent leg,\nand the bent arm is on the side of the straight leg. One other variation of this\nincludes the bent leg is pointing straight down, instead of out like the side-\nhurdler. The jump is speculated to have been invented because Herkie was not\nable to do an actual side-hurdler. Left Side: the leg to the audience is tucked\nin while the other is out. Right side: same as left also turn the left/right\nwhile approaching the jump Cheer leader jump: This jump is commonly used in\ncheer leading and on a dance team, you typically will have your arms up in a \"V\"\nabove your head and then rotate one of your arms backwards and right after kick\none of your legs up and pointed straight in the direction of your face. ; Double\nHook : A jump where the legs are in the \"cheer sit\" position. ; Double Jump :\nThis is the name for when one performs any jump twice in a row. ; Triple Jump:\nThis is the name for any jump with three jumps in a row connected by the\n\"swing\". This is most commonly used among the elite divisions. ; Jump\ncombination: The official name for a series of jumps. ; Power Jump : A jump\nwhere there is no swinging of the arms in preparation for the jump. All the\npower for the jump comes from the legs. This jump is also known as a \"Dip Jump.\"\n\nJump Tumbling: Depending on the level is how to determine the difficulty of the\ntumbling element out of the jump. Toe-touch to back handspring, back tuck,\nstanding full. Or to front walkover, front handspring, aerial, etc. There are\nmultiple elements to be chosen out of a jump. Level 4 from USASF is the first\nlevel that includes a jump to back tuck.\n","linknr":87,"url":"List_of_cheerleading_jumps","recorded":1374541694,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Cheerleading","/wiki/National_Cheerleaders_Association","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_cheerleading_stunts","/wiki/Cheerleading","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&oldid=556136819","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Cheerleading","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_September_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+cheerleading+jumps&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=List+of+cheerleading+jumps","/wiki/List_of_cheerleading_jumps","/wiki/Talk:List_of_cheerleading_jumps","#","/wiki/List_of_cheerleading_jumps","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/List_of_cheerleading_jumps","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_cheerleading_jumps","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&oldid=556136819","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6609367","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&id=556136819","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=List+of+cheerleading+jumps","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=List+of+cheerleading+jumps&oldid=556136819&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=List_of_cheerleading_jumps&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6609367#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cheerleading_jumps","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cheerleading|"],"headings":["See
