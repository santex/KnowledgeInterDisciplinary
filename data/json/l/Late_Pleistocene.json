The age represents\nthe end of the Pleistocene epoch and is followed by the Holocene epoch.\n\nMuch of the Late Pleistocene age was dominated by glaciation (the Wisconsin\nglaciation in North America and corresponding glacial periods in Eurasia). Many\nmegafauna became extinct over this age, a trend that continued into the\nHolocene. Also, human species other than modern humans died out during the\nPleistocene. Humanity spread to every continent except for Antarctica during the\nLate Pleistocene.\n","linknr":360,"url":"Late_Pleistocene","recorded":1362373506,"links":27,"instances":["genus","stratigraphy","geology","stratigraphy"],"pdf":["https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/references/HoloceneGSSP_JQuatSci090.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Pleistocene"],"headings":["References","Paleoclimatology stages","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Geological_time_spiral.png/34px-Geological_time_spiral.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epoch","geology"],["stage","stratigraphy"],["series","stratigraphy"],["homo","genus"]],"members":["homo","stage","epoch","series"],"related":["Pleistocene","Epoch_(geology)","Stage_(stratigraphy)","Series_(stratigraphy)","Eemian_interglacial","Holocene","Wisconsin_glaciation","North_America","Eurasia","Megafauna","Homo_(genus)","Human","Continent","Antarctica","Younger_Dryas","Allerød_oscillation","Older_Dryas","Bølling_oscillation","Oldest_Dryas","North_American_Land_Mammal_Ages","Rancholabrean"]}
