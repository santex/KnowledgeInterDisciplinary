{"cursor":"7687","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, riding his celestial chariot. ]] In mythology, a 'lunar deity' is a god or\ngoddess associated with or symbolizing the moon. These deities can have a\nvariety of functions and traditions depending upon the culture, but they are\noften related to or an enemy of the solar deity. Even though they may be\nrelated, they are distinct from the solar deity. Lunar deities can be either\nmale or female, and are usually held to be of the opposite sex of the\ncorresponding solar deity. Male lunar deities are somewhat more common\nworldwide, although female deities are better known in modern times due to\nthe influence of classical Greek and Roman mythology, which held the moon to\nbe female.\n","linknr":393,"url":"Lunar_deity","recorded":1362268732,"links":32,"instances":["mythology","goddess","mythology","mythology","deity","god","neopaganism","deity","male_deity","deity","deity","mythology","hawaiian_mythology","mythology","goddess","deity","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lunar deities|","Comparative mythology","Mythological archetypes","Lists of deities","Deities in the Hebrew Bible","Moon myths"],"headings":["Moon in mythology","List of lunar deities","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Chandra_graha.JPG/200px-Chandra_graha.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["god","male_deity"],["phoebe","mythology"],["sin","mythology"],["mani","god"],["triple_goddess","neopaganism"],["huitaca","deity"],["chía","goddess"],["pah","deity"],["jaci","deity"],["ari","deity"],["sin","mythology"],["phoebe","mythology"],["mani","god"],["mano","mythology"],["chang'e","mythology"],["anumati","deity"],["hina","goddess"],["lona","hawaiian_mythology"],["mahina","mythology"],["marama","mythology"],["triple_goddess","neopaganism"],["triple_goddess","neopaganism"]],"members":["mahina","hina","phoebe","mano","ari","mani","triple_goddess","jaci","god","pah","anumati","sin","lona","marama","chía","huitaca"],"related":["Mythology","God_(male_deity)","Goddess","Moon","Solar_deity","Menstrual_cycle","Language_family","Phoebe_(mythology)","Artemis","Selene","Hecate","Chang'e","Lunar_god","Sin_(mythology)","Mesopotamia","Mani_(god)","Germanic_tribes","Tsukuyomi","Solar_deity","Hinduism","Chandra","Karwa_Chauth","Witchcraft","Madonna_Oriente","Neopagan","Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)","Moon_in_art_and_literature","Astrology","Coyolxauhqui","Aztec_mythology","Metztli","Tecciztecatl","Metztli","Menily","Cahuilla_mythology","Huitaca_(deity)","Chibcha_mythology","Chía_(goddess)","Colombian_mythology","Incan_mythology","Mama_Quilla","Incan_mythology","Ka-Ata-Killa","Alignak","Inuit_mythology","Igaluk","Tarqiup_Inua","Awilix","K'iche'_people","Maya_mythology","Ixbalanque","Yoolgai_Asdza´a´","Diné_Bahane'","Navajo_people","Pah_(deity)","Pawnee_mythology","Jaci_(deity)","Tupi_people","Ari_(deity)","Tupi_people","Ta'lab","Wadd","Nikkal","Yarikh","Canaanite_mythology","Napir","Elamite_mythology","Kaskuh","Hittite_mythology","Kusuh","Hurrian_mythology","Sin_(mythology)","Mesopotamian_mythology","Aglibol","Palmarene_mythology","Selardi","Urartian_mythology","Ilargi","Basque_mythology","Losna","Etruscan_mythology","Kuu","Finnish_mythology","Achelois","Greek_mythology","Phoebe_(mythology)","Artemis","Selene","Hecate","Elatha","Ataegina","Lusitanian_mythology","Mani_(god)","Norse_mythology","Mano_(mythology)","Sami_shamanism","Jarilo","Slavic_mythology","Bendis","Thracian_mythology","Chup_Kamui","Ainu_mythology","Chang'e_(mythology)","Chinese_mythology","Tsukuyomi","Japanese_mythology","Anumati_(deity)","Hindu_mythology","Chandra","Soma","Dewi_Shri","Indonesian_mythology","Silewe_Nazarate","Mayari","Philippine_mythology","Dae-Soon","Korean_mythology","Gleti","Dahomean_mythology","Khonsu","Egyptian_mythology","Hathor","Iah","Thoth","Arebati","Mbuti_mythology","Kalfu","West_African_Vodun","Yemaya","Yoruba_mythology","Kidili","Mandjindja_mythology","Papare","Orokolo_mythology","Avatea","Polynesian_mythology","Fati","Hina_(goddess)","Lona_(Hawaiian_mythology)","Mahina_(mythology)","Marama_(mythology)","Australian_Aboriginal_astronomy","Yolngu","Solar_deity","Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)","Man_in_the_Moon","Moon_idol","Moon_rabbit","Nature_worship","The_White_Goddess","Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)"]}
