It is also often a\ncuring process as well that produces a hard, durable finish. This finish can be\nof any sheen level from ultra matte to high gloss, and it can be further\npolished as required. It is also used for \"lacquer paint\", which typically\ndenotes a paint that dries to a more than usually hard and smooth surface.\n\nThe term lacquer originates from the Sanskrit word laksha (à¤²à¤à¥à¤·) meaning \"one\nhundred thousand\", which was used for both the Lac insect (because of their\nenormous number) and the scarlet resinous secretion it produces that was used as\nwood finish in ancient India and neighbouring areas. In terms of modern products, lac-based finishes are\nreferred to as shellac, while lacquer refers to other polymers dissolved in\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as nitrocellulose, and later acrylic\ncompounds dissolved in lacquer thinner, a mixture of several solvents typically\ncontaining butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. While both lacquer and shellac\nare traditional finishes, lacquer is more durable than shellac.\n\nIn terms of the decorative arts, lacquerware refers to variety of techniques\nused to decorate wood, metal or other surfaces, some involving carving into deep\ncoatings of many layers of lacquer.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Lacquer","recorded":1362481449,"links":31,"instances":["material_appearance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Decorative arts","Chinese art","Japanese art","Korean art","Paints|","Coatings","Resins","Chinese inventions","Traditional Chinese objects","Arabic words and phrases","French words and phrases"],"headings":["Etymology","Urushiol-based lacquers","Nitrocellulose lacquers","Acrylic lacquers","Water-based lacquers","Japanning","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/MS-PerlmuttlackP%C3%A4oniendose16Jh.JPG/260px-MS-PerlmuttlackP%C3%A4oniendose16Jh.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Red_lacquer_tray%2C_Song_Dynasty.jpg/220px-Red_lacquer_tray%2C_Song_Dynasty.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Freer_002.jpg/220px-Freer_002.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Colouredwhisles.JPG/220px-Colouredwhisles.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Lacquer.jpg/220px-Lacquer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Chu_State_Lacquer_Coffin2.JPG/220px-Chu_State_Lacquer_Coffin2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Urushiol.png/100px-Urushiol.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gloss","material_appearance"],["gloss","material_appearance"]],"members":["gloss"],"related":["Mother_of_pearl","Ming_Dynasty","Wood_finish","Gloss_(material_appearance)","Gloss_(material_appearance)","Sanskrit","Lac","Shellac","Polymers","Volatile_organic_compound","Nitrocellulose","Polymethyl_methacrylate","Butyl_acetate","Xylene","Toluene","Decorative_arts","Lacquerware","French_language","Portuguese_language","Arabic","Persian_language","Sanskrit","Lac","Hindustani_language","Lacquerware","Urushiol","Oxidation","Polymerization","Evaporation","Urushiol","Shang_Dynasty","Lacquerware","Neolithic","Jōmon_period","Hemudu_culture","Han_Dynasty","Han_Dynasty","Tang_Dynasty","Song_Dynasty","Korea","Japan","Channapatna","Karnataka","India","Urushiol-induced_contact_dermatitis","Middle_East","Cinnabar","Melanorrhoea_usitata","Iron_oxide","Guqin","State_of_Chu","Nitrocellulose","Japan_Black","Oakland_automobile","DuPont","Duco","Acrylic_resin","Thermoplastic","Acrylic_acid","Enamel_paint","Polyurethane","Health","Porcelain","Lacquerware","Japanning","Mrs_Mary_Delaney","Lacquerware","Varnish","Acetate_disc"]}
