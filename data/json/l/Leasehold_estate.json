{"cursor":"17425","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'leasehold estate' is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or\nproperty in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some\nform of title from a lessor or landlord. Although a tenant does hold rights to\nreal property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property.\n\n'Leasehold' is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the\nright to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a\nlegal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A\nleasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a\nproperty is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length\nof time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a\nperiodic basis such as weekly or monthly.\n\nUntil the end of the lease period (often measured in decades or centuries; a 99\nyear lease is quite common) the leaseholder has the right to remain in\noccupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner. Terms of the\nagreement are contained in a lease, which has elements of contract and property\nlaw intertwined.\n\nThe term 'estate for years' may occasionally be used. This refers to a leasehold\nestate for any specific period of time (the word \"years\" is misleading). An\nestate for years is not automatically renewed.\n\nColloquially, \"lease\" and \"[[leasing]]\" are often a formalization of a longer,\nspecific period as compared with a \"rental\" that created a tenancy at will,\nterminable or renewable at the end of a short period.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Leasehold_estate","recorded":1362900266,"links":21,"instances":["law","law","law","law","law","property","property","property"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landlordâ€“tenant law","Real estate","Real property law","Scots law legal terms","Renting"],"headings":["History","Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years","Periodic tenancy","Lease expiration","Duties of participants","Effects of condemnation","Effects of tenancy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["title","property"],["freehold","law"],["causation","law"],["waste","law"],["assignment","law"],["covenant","law"],["english_rule","property"],["american_rule","property"],["waste","law"]],"members":["covenant","assignment","causation","waste","freehold","american_rule","title","english_rule"],"related":["Lease","Real_property","Title_(property)","Landlord","Land_tenure","Freehold_(law)","Fee_simple","Lease","Tenancy_at_will","Code_of_Hammurabi","Common_law","England","Middle_Ages","Feudal","Agrarian","Lord_of_the_Manor","Socage","Burgage","Renting","Consideration","Feudalism","Vassals","Commonwealth_Realms","Crown_land","Australian_Capital_Territory","Co-op","Rural_tenancy","Rural_tenancy","England_and_Wales","Statute_of_frauds","Leasehold","Notice","Lease","Consideration","Causation_(law)","Operation_of_law","Life_estate","Fee_simple","Operation_of_law","Waste_(law)","Assignment_(law)","Trespasser","Eviction","England_&_Wales","Demise","Landlord_and_Tenant_Act_1954","Covenant_(law)","English_rule_(property)","American_rule_(property)","Licensees","Invitees","Apartment_building","Waste_(law)","Eminent_domain","Rural_tenancy","Housing_cooperative","Landlord_and_Tenant_Act","Landlord_harassment","Leasehold_valuation_tribunal","Rental_agreement","Tenant_farmer"]}
