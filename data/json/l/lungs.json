{"cursor":"24135","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nLunge}}\n\n\n'', 20th ed. 1918. ]]\n\n\nThe 'lung' is the essential respiration organ in many air-breathing animals,\nincluding most tetrapods, a few fish and a few snails. In mammals and the more\ncomplex life forms, the two lungs are located near the backbone on either side\nof the heart. Their principal function is to transport oxygen from the\natmosphere into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the\nbloodstream into the atmosphere. This exchange of gases is accomplished in the\nmosaic of specialized cells that form millions of tiny, exceptionally thin-\nwalled air sacs called alveoli.\n\nTo completely explain the anatomy of the lungs, it is necessary to discuss the\npassage of air through the mouth to the alveoli. Once air progresses through the\nmouth or nose, it travels through the oropharynx, nasopharynx, the larynx, the\ntrachea, and a progressively subdividing system of bronchi and bronchioles until\nit finally reaches the alveoli where the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and\noxygen takes place. Wienberger, Cockrill, Mandel. Principles of Pulmonary\nMedicine. Elsevier Science.\n\nThe drawing and expulsion of air (ventilation) is driven by muscular action; in\nearly tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via\nbuccal pumping, whereas in reptiles, birds and mammals a more complicated\nmusculoskeletal system is used.\n\nMedical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, such as in the\n(adjectival form: ) or from the Latin pulmonarius (\"of the lungs\"), or with pneumo-\n(from Greek ÏÎ½ÎµÏÎ¼ÏÎ½
