{"cursor":"27798","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'list of Atlantic Coast Conference football champions' includes 11 distinct\nteams that have won the college football championship awarded by the Atlantic\nCoast Conference (ACC) since its creation in 1953. Thirteen different teams have\ncompeted in the conference since that year. Just twoâMiami and Boston\nCollegeâhave never won an ACC football championship, while one team that is no\nlonger a member of the leagueâSouth Carolinaâholds one championship.\n\nBetween 1953 and 2003, the championship was normally earned in round-robin regular-\nseason play among all conference members, although in earlier years league teams\ndid not typically play every possible ACC opponent. The league did not employ\ntiebreaking procedures, such as head-to-head results, to determine a single\nchampion, and thus it was not unusual for a season to end with \"co-champions.\"\nWith a 2004 expansion of the league to include Miami and Virginia Tech, round-\nrobin play became impossible due to an NCAA limit on the number of games a team\nmay play during the season and the unwillingness of the league to hold more than\neight conference games per season per team. NCAA rules also forbade a\nchampionship game due to the league having only 11 members.\n\nA 2005 expansion that admitted Boston College gave the ACC the required 12\nmembers needed for divisional play and a championship game. The ACC Championship\nGame has been held annually since that year, featuring the regular-season\nwinners of the Atlantic and Coastal divisions in a game to determine the\nconference champion. During the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons, the championship\ngame was held at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2008 and 2009, the\nchampionship was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. In 2010 and\n2011, the venue switched to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North\nCarolina, and on December 2, 2011 the ACC announced that the 2012 and 2013 ACC\nChampionship Games would again be played in Charlotte.
