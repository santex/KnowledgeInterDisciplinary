The eight band members, all\nfrom the Leahy family of eleven siblings, are from Lakefield, Ontario and have\nbeen actively touring Canada and internationally since the early 1980s when they\nwere known as 'The Leahy Family'. In 1985, they were the subject of a short film\nentitled Leahy: Music Most of All which received an Academy Award in the\ncategory of \"Best Foreign Student Film\".\n\nThe line-up of the group varies depending upon the availability of its members\nwho come and go due to marriage, raising children, and other commitments. During\nthe 1980s and early 1990s, the band recorded a number of privately released LPs\nand cassettes (most of which used the same title, The Leahy Family) which were\nsold at their concerts and they were frequent guests at the Big Valley Jamboree\nconcerts in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nIn 1997 the band resumed recording with their \"relaunch\" album, [[Leahy\n(album)|Leahy]] which also introduced the group's new branding. Leahy was an\ninstrumental album, but the band also includes vocal performances in their live\nperformances and subsequent albums have included both vocals and instrumentals.\n\nDespite their already-established history, they were awarded two Juno awards in\n1998, for Best New Group and Best Instrumental Artist The following\nyear, Leahy took a third Juno Award, for Best Country Group or Duo. Also in\n1998, Leahy were added as the opening act for Canadian country singer Shania\nTwain's 1998 Come on Over Tour and were featured in two television specials from\nthe tour, [[Live (Shania Twain DVD)|Live]] and [[The Specials (Shania Twain\nDVD)|The Specials]], performing with Twain on the song \"Don't Be Stupid (You\nKnow I Love You)\".\n\nThe group's members are both instrumentalists and dancers, with several members\nskilled in fiddle-playing (most notably the group's best-known member, Donnell\nLeahy). The female members of the band often perform step-dancing-style\nroutines, and it is generally the female members of the group who sing.\n","linknr":136,"url":"leahy","recorded":1364043436,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Leahy_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Leahy.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Leahy.jpg/220px-Leahy.jpg","/wiki/Lakefield,_Ontario","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Folk_music","/wiki/Country_music","/wiki/Celtic_music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Virgin_Records","/wiki/Shania_Twain","http://www.leahymusic.com/","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Folk_music","/wiki/Lakefield,_Ontario","/wiki/Academy_Awards","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Big_Valley_Jamboree","/wiki/Saskatchewan","/wiki/Alberta","/wiki/Leahy_(album)","/wiki/Juno_Awards_of_1998","/wiki/Juno_Award_for_New_Group_of_the_Year","/wiki/Juno_Award_for_Instrumental_Album_of_the_Year","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Juno_Award_for_Country_Recording_of_the_Year","/wiki/Shania_Twain","/wiki/Come_on_Over_Tour","/wiki/Live_(Shania_Twain_DVD)","/wiki/The_Specials_(Shania_Twain_DVD)","/wiki/Don%27t_Be_Stupid_(You_Know_I_Love_You)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Step-dancing","#Members","#Discography","#Albums","#Singles","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Natalie_MacMaster","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Leahy_(album)","/wiki/A%26B_Sound","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf","http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy","http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy","#cite_ref-3","http://www.amazon.com/Shania-Twain-Specials-Winter-Break/dp/product-description/B00005RIIO","/wiki/The_Specials_(Shania_Twain_DVD)","/wiki/Shania_Twain","http://www.amazon.com/Shania-Twain-Specials-Winter-Break/dp/product-description/B00005RIIO","#cite_ref-4","http://www.trentu.ca/convocation/honorarydegree_2008leahy.php","http://www.trentu.ca/convocation/honorarydegree_2008leahy.php","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit&section=6","http://leahymusic.com/news.php","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leahy&oldid=544014188","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Canadian_country_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Canadian_folk_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Juno_Award_winners","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leahy&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leahy","/wiki/Leahy","/wiki/Talk:Leahy","#","/wiki/Leahy","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Leahy","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Leahy","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&oldid=544014188","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Leahy&id=544014188","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Leahy","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Leahy&oldid=544014188&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Leahy&printable=yes","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%92","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Leahy","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/
