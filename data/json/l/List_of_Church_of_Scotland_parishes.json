{"cursor":"56789","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe Church of Scotland, the national church of Scotland, divides the country\ninto presbyteries, which are subdivided into parishes, each served by a parish\nchurch, usually with its own minister. Unions and readjustments may however\nresult in a parish having more than one building, or several parishes sharing a\nminister. There are currently 43 presbyteries in Scotland, and around 1500\nparishes. In addition, the Church of Scotland has three presbyteries outwith\nScotland: the Presbytery of England, the Presbytery of Europe and the\nPresbytery of Jerusalem. These presbyteries have \"gathered congregations\"\nrather than parishes.\n\nWhat follows is a list those Church of Scotland parishes, congregations and\nplaces of worship. Use for an alphabetical index of parishes with Wikipedia\narticles. A complete list of parishes with statistical data will be found in the\nChurch of Scotland Yearbook (known as the Red Book). See also List of Church of\nScotland synods and presbyteries.\n","linknr":796,"url":"List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","recorded":1375066486,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/National_church","/wiki/Presbytery_(church_polity)","/wiki/Parish","/wiki/Minister_of_religion","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Europe","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland_Yearbook","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_synods_and_presbyteries","#Presbytery_of_Aberdeen","#Aberdeen_City_Parishes","#Outlying_Parishes","#Presbytery_of_Abernethy","#Presbytery_of_Angus","#Presbytery_of_Annandale_and_Eskdale","#Presbytery_of_Ardrossan","#Presbytery_of_Argyll","#Presbytery_of_Ayr","#Presbytery_of_Buchan","#Presbytery_of_Caithness","#Presbytery_of_Dumbarton","#Presbytery_of_Dumfries_and_Kirkcudbright","#Presbytery_of_Dundee","#Presbytery_of_Dunfermline","#Presbytery_of_Dunkeld_and_Meigle","#Presbytery_of_Duns","#Presbytery_of_Edinburgh","#Presbytery_of_Falkirk","#Presbytery_of_Glasgow","#Presbytery_of_Gordon","#Presbytery_of_Greenock_and_Paisley","#Presbytery_of_Hamilton","#Presbytery_of_Inverness","#Presbytery_of_Irvine_and_Kilmarnock","#Presbytery_of_Jedburgh","#Presbytery_of_Kincardine_and_Deeside","#Presbytery_of_Kirkcaldy","#Presbytery_of_Lanark","#Presbytery_of_Lewis","#Presbytery_of_Lochaber","#Presbytery_of_Lochcarron-Skye","#Presbytery_of_Lothian","#Presbytery_of_Melrose_and_Peebles","#Presbytery_of_Moray","#Presbytery_of_Orkney","#Presbytery_of_Perth","#Presbytery_of_Ross","#Presbytery_of_St_Andrews","#Presbytery_of_Shetland","#Presbytery_of_Stirling","#Presbytery_of_Sutherland","#Presbytery_of_Uist","#Presbytery_of_Wigtown_and_Stranraer","#Presbytery_of_West_Lothian","#Outwith_Scotland","#Presbytery_of_England","#Presbytery_of_Europe","#Presbytery_of_Jerusalem","#Other_Church_of_Scotland_buildings_and_institutions","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Aberdeen","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=1","http://www.aberdeenpresbytery.org.uk/","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Saint_Columba","http://www.gilcomston.org/","/wiki/St._Machar%27s_Cathedral,_Aberdeen","/wiki/Saint_Machar","/wiki/Saint_George","/wiki/John_the_Apostle","/wiki/Saint_Mark","/wiki/Saint_Mary","http://www.kirk-of-st-nicholas.org.uk/home/Default.asp","/wiki/Saint_Nicholas","/wiki/Saint_Nicholas","/wiki/Saint_Stephen","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Abernethy","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=4","http://www.alvieandinshchurch.org.uk/","/wiki/Saint_Andrew","/wiki/Saint_Columba","/wiki/Saint_Bride","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=5","http://www.anguspresbytery.org.uk/","http://www.arbirlotandcarmylliechurches.org.uk/","/wiki/Thomas_Becket","http://www.arbroathstandrews.org.uk/","/wiki/Saint_Andrew","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=6","http://www.presbyteryofannandaleandeskdale.com/","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=7","http://www.ardrossanpresbytery.org.uk/","http://www.brodickchurch.org/","http://lamlashkilmorychurch.co.uk/","http://lamlashkilmorychurch.co.uk/","http://lochranzachurch.org.uk/","http://stmoliosshiskine.org.uk/","http://www.baronystjohns.co.uk/","/wiki/Beith_High_Church","/wiki/Beith_Trinity_Church","http://stmargaretsdalry.weebly.com/","http://www.dalrytrinity.co.uk/","http://www.fairlieparish.co.uk/","/wiki/Kilbirnie_Auld_Kirk","http://www.stcolumbaskilbirnie.co.uk/","http://kilwinningmansefieldtrinity.org/","http://www.largscolumba.com/","http://www.stjohnslargs.co.uk/","http://www.newtrinity.co.uk/","http://www.saltcoatsnorth.co.uk/","http://www.highkirk.com/","http://westkilbrideparishchurch.org.uk/","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes&action=edit&section=8","http://www.argyllchurchofscotland.co.uk/","/wiki/Kilarrow_Parish_Church","/wiki/Islay","/wiki/Portnahaven","/wiki/St.
