{"cursor":"6383","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, the 'law of definite proportions', sometimes called 'Proust's\nLaw', states that a chemical compound always contains exactly the same\nproportion of elements by mass. An equivalent statement is the 'law of constant\ncomposition', which states that all samples of a given chemical compound have\nthe same elemental composition by mass. For example, oxygen makes up about\n8 /9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while\nhydrogen makes up the remaining 1 /9 of the mass. Along\nwith the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the\nbasis of stoichiometry. Zumdahl, S. S. âChemistryâ Heath, 1986: Lexington,\nMA.
