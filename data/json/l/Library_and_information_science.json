(eds.). (2010).\nEncyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. Vol. 1-7. CRC Press, Boca\nRaton, USA. Also available as an electronic source. Library and\nInformation Sciences is name used in Dewey Decimal Classification for class 20\nfrom 18th. edition (1971) to 22th edition (2003). is a merging of the two\nfields library science and information science. The phrase \"library and\ninformation science\" is associated with schools of library and information\nscience (abbreviated to \"SLIS\"), which generally developed from professional\ntraining programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during\nthe second half of the twentieth century. In the last part of 1960s schools of\nlibrarianship began to add the term \"information science\" to their names. The\nfirst school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964. Galvin,\nT. J. (1977). Pittsburgh. University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Library\nand Information Sciences. IN: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science\n(Vol. 22). Ed. by A. Kent, H. Lancour & J.E.Daily. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n(pp. 280â291) More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the\n1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to\ntheir names. The trend was more for the adoption of information technology\nrather than the concept of a science.\n\nA similar development has taken place in large parts of the world. In Denmark,\nfor example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' in 1997 changed its English\nname to The Royal School of Library and Information Science. Another indication\nof this name shift is that Library Science Abstracts in 1969 changed its name to\nLibrary and Information Science Abstracts. Documentation of the nameshift:\nhttp://www.mendeley.com/research/library-information-science-abstracts-first-\ntwo-years/ In spite of this merge are the two original disciplines\n(library science and information science) still by some considered to be\nseparate fields Saracevic, Tefko (1992).

In: In: Conceptions of library and information science. Historical,\nempirical and theoretical perspectives. Edited by Pertti Vakkari & Blaise\nCronin. London: Taylor Graham (pp. 229-252). while the main tendency today\nis to use the terms as synonyms, but with different connotations.\n\nIn some parts of the world the development has been somewhat different. In\nFrance, for example, information science and communication studies form one\ninterdiscipline. Mucchielli, A., (2000), La nouvelle communication :\nÃ©pistÃ©mologie des sciences de lâinformationcommunication. Paris, Armand Colin,\n2000. Collection U. Sciences de la communication In TromsÃ¶, Norway\ndocumentation science is preferred as the name of the field.\n\nIn the beginning of the 21st century one tendency has been to drop the term\n\"library\" and to speak about information departments or [[I-school]]s. There has\nalso been an attempt to revive the concept of documentation and speak of\nLibrary, information and documentation studies (or science). Rayward, W. B.\n(Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International\nColloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library,\nInformation, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press.\n Another tendency, for example in Sweden, is to merge the fields of\nArchival science, Library science and Museology to develop an integrated field:\nArchival, Library and Museum studies.\n","linknr":294,"url":"Library_and_information_science","recorded":1374858564,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Library_science","/wiki/Information_science","/wiki/Library_school","#cite_note-3","/wiki/The_Royal_School_of_Library_and_Information_Science","/wiki/Library_and_Information_Science_Abstracts","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Library_science","/wiki/Information_science","#cite_note-Saracevic-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Synonym","/wiki/Interdiscipline","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Documentation_science","/wiki/I-school","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Documentation","/wiki/Library,_information_and_documentation","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Archival_science","/wiki/Library_science","/wiki/Museology","#Relations_between_library_science.2C_information_science_and_LIS","#Difficulties_defining_LIS","#A_multidisciplinary.2C_interdisciplinary_or_monodisciplinary_field.3F","#A_fragmented_adhocracy","#Scattering_of_the_literature","#The_unique_concern_of_library_and_information_science","#LIS_theories","#Journals","#Conferences","#Common_subfields","#See_also","#Further_reading","#References","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-Saracevic-5","/wiki/Dissertations_Abstracts","/wiki/Documentation_science","/wiki/Bibliographic_database","/wiki/Library_school","#cite_note-Warner-9","/wiki/Information_retrieval","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Cross-disciplinary","/wiki/Pluridisciplinary","/wiki/Multidisciplinarity","/wiki/Interdisciplinarity","/wiki/Transdisciplinarity","/wiki/Academic_discipline","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Interdiscipline","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-Astrom-14","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-Warner-9","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","/wiki/Evidence_Based_Library_and_Information_Practice","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Category:Library_science_journals","/wiki/Journal_Citation_Reports","/wiki/Impact_factor","/wiki/Annual_Review_of_Information_Science_and_Technology","/wiki/Information_Processing_and_Management","/wiki/Information_Research:_An_international_electronic_journal","/wiki/Italian_Journal_of_Library_and_Information_Studies","/wiki/Journal_of_Documentation","/wiki/Journal_of_Information_Science","/w/index.php?title=Journal_of_the_Association_for_Information_Science_and_Technology&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Formerly_Journal_of_the_American_Society_for_Information_Science_and_Technology&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Knowledge_Organization_(journal)","/wiki/The_Library_Quarterly","/wiki/Library_Trends","/wiki/Scientometrics_(journal)","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Library_Science_Abstracts_(ILSA)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Social_Sciences_Citation_Index","/wiki/Library_and_Information_Science_Abstracts","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/American_Society_for_Information_Science_and_Technology","/wiki/Conceptions_of_Library_and_Information_Science","/wiki/I-School","http://informationr.net/isic/index.html","/wiki/International_Federation_of_Library_Associations_and_Institutions","http://conference.ifla.org/","/wiki/International_Society_for_Knowledge_Organization","http://www.isko.org/events.html","/w/index.php?title=Library_and_information_science&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Information_science","/wiki/Outline_of_information_science","/wiki/Information_access","/wiki/Information_architecture","/wiki/Information_management","/wiki/Information_retrieval","/wiki/Information_seeking","/wiki/Information_so
