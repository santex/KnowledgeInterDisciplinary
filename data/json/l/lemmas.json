In English, for example, run, runs, ran and running are forms of the\nsame lexeme, with run as the lemma. Lexeme, in this context, refers to the set\nof all the forms that have the same meaning, and lemma refers to the particular\nform that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme. In lexicography, this\nunit is usually also the citation form or headword by which it is indexed.\nLemmas have special significance in highly inflected languages such as Turkish\nand Czech. The process of determining the lemma for a given word is called\nlemmatisation.\n","title":"Lemma%20%28morphology%29","headings":["Morphology","Lexicography","Pronunciation","Difference between stem and lemma","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Headword","2: Inflection","2: Word_stem","1: Lexicography","1: Word","1: English_language","1: Lexeme","1: Turkish_language","1: Czech_language","1: Lemmatisation","1: Noun","1: Grammatical_number","1: Possessive_adjective","1: Reflexive_pronoun","1: Indefinite_pronoun","1: Grammatical_gender","1: Grammatical_case","1: Verb","1: Infinitive","1: French_language","1: German_language","1: Spanish_language","1: Defective_verb","1: Latin_language","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Modern_Greek","1: Present_tense","1: Ancient_Greek_grammar#Contracted_verbs","1: Japanese_language","1: Markedness","1: Finnish_language","1: Arabic_language","1: Triliteral","1: Hebrew_language","1: Georgian_language","1: Verbal_noun","1: Korean_language","1: Irish_language","1: Irish_initial_mutations","1: Cato_the_Elder","1: Webster's_dictionary","1: Corpus_linguistics","1: Pronunciation","1: Phonetic","1: Weak_and_strong_forms_in_English","1: Function_word","1: Isolation_form","1: Phonology","1: Principal_parts","1: Null_morpheme","1: Uninflected_word","1: Lexical_Markup_Framework"]}
