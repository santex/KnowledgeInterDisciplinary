Invented in 1796 by German author and actor Alois Senefelder as a cheap\nmethod of publishing theatrical works, Meggs, Philip B.\nA History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p 146 ISBN 0-471-29198-\n6 Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic\nDesign: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p\n11 lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other\nsuitable material.\n\nLithography originally used an image drawn (etched) into a coating of wax or an\noily substance applied to a plate of lithographic stone as the medium to\ntransfer ink to a blank paper sheet, and so produce a printed page. In modern\nlithography, the image is made of a polymer coating applied to a flexible\naluminum plate. To print an image lithographically, the flat surface of the\nstone plate is roughened slightlyâetchedâand divided into hydrophilic regions\nthat accept a film of water, and thereby repel the greasy ink; and hydrophobic\nregions that repel water and accept ink because the surface tension is greater\non the greasy image area, which remains dry. The image can be printed directly\nfrom the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be offset,\nby transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and\npublication.\n\nAs a printing technology, lithography is different from intaglio printing\n(gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or stippled to score\ncavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing, and letterpress\nprinting, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images.\nMost types of books of high-volume text are printed with offset lithography, the\nmost common form of printing technology. The word lithography also denotes\nphotolithography, a microfabrication technique used in the microelectronics\nindustry to make integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Lithography","recorded":1362484290,"links":86,"instances":["publishing","graphic_arts","printmaking"],"pdf":["http://fax.libs.uga.edu/NE2420xS475/1f/invention_of_lithography.pdf"],"categories":["Lithography|","Austrian
