      "text" : "\n'Land agent' may be used in at least three different contexts.\n\nTraditionally, a land agent was a managerial employee who conducted the business\naffairs of a large landed estate for a member of the landed gentry in the United\nKingdom,<ref name=Oxford></ref> supervising the farming of the property by farm\nlabourers and/or tenants and collecting rents or other payments. In this context\na land agent was a relatively privileged position and was a senior member of the\nestate's staff. The older term, which continued to be used on some estates, was\nsteward, and in Scotland a land agent was usually referred to as a factor. Today\nthe term estate manager or similar is more common.\n\nA land agent may also be a real estate agent who specialises in land and farm\nsales.<ref name=Oxford/> Land and farm sales differ drastically from sales of\nhouses, therefore there is the need for specialisation. This usage is found in\nthe United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.<ref></ref>\n\nThird, a land agent can be an agent of the oil and mining industry who\nnegotiates with landowners for mineral and surface rights for the\npotential extraction of those minerals. This usage is primarily found in\nthe United States.\n",
