{"cursor":"4942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of lactic acid]] 'Lactic acid fermentation' is a biological process by which\n glucose, fructose, and sucrose are converted into cellular energy and the\n metabolite lactate. It is an anaerobic fermentation reaction that occurs in\n some bacteria and animal cells, such as muscle cells. If oxygen\n is present in the cell, many organisms will bypass fermentation and undergo\n cellular respiration; however, facultative anaerobic organisms will both\n ferment and undergo respiration in the presence of oxygen. Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate\n with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD +.\n\nIn homolactic fermentation, one molecule of glucose is ultimately converted to\ntwo molecules of lactic acid. Heterolactic fermentation, in contrast, yields\ncarbon dioxide and ethanol in addition to lactic acid, in a process called the\nphosphoketolase pathway.\n","linknr":323,"url":"Lactic_acid_fermentation","recorded":1362503431,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fermentation","Metabolic pathways"],"headings":["Applications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg/220px-Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lactic_acid","Glucose","Fructose","Sucrose","Lactic_acid","Anaerobic","Animal_cell","Muscle_cell","Cellular_respiration","Facultative_anaerobic_organism","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Pyruvate","Lactic_acid","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Carbon_dioxide","Ethanol","Phosphoketolase","Genus","Yeast","Yogurt","Milk","PH","Probiotic","Sauerkraut","Pathogen","Alcohol","Hydrocarbon","Ester","Kimchi"]}
