{"cursor":"6041","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lecropt' (Leac Croit in Gaelic) is a rural parish lying to the west of Bridge\nof Allan, Scotland.\n\nThe population of the parish of Lecropt is estimated to be around 75, consisting\nentirely of isolated farms and houses, as well as the Keir Estate owned by the\nlanded Stirling family. Lecropt today contains no town or village, though it\nlies on the outskirts of the village of Bridge of Allan.\n\nHistorically, Lecropt's population was higher and was as high as 500 around the\nyear 1800. The decline in population over the decades can be explained partly,\nbut not wholly, by rural depopulation. However in 1800 Bridge of Allan, then a\ntiny hamlet of no more than 100 people, was included in Lecropt. As Bridge of\nAllan grew during the 19th century, the whole village was eventually brought\nunder the adjacent parish of Logie, reducing Lecropt's population.\n\nThere had also been another village called Lecropt, the site of which was\nfurther north-west, on the other side of the line of the M9 motorway from the\ncurrent parish church. This village hosted the parish church until this was\nmoved to its present site in the early 19th century, on the A9 road. The village\nof Lecropt itself had been abandoned.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Lecropt","recorded":1375066466,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic","/wiki/Parish","/wiki/Bridge_of_Allan","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Keir_House","#Geography","#Lecropt_Kirk","#Famous_people_from_Lecropt","#Locations","#Transport","#References","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Perthshire","/wiki/Stirlingshire","/wiki/Stirling_Council","/wiki/River_Teith","/wiki/River_Forth","/wiki/Allan_Water","/wiki/Scottish_Voice","/wiki/Craigarnhall","/wiki/Doune","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Dunblane","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Lecropt_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1230943.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Lecropt_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1230943.jpg/220px-Lecropt_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1230943.jpg","/wiki/File:Lecropt_Kirk_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1230943.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","http://www.dunblaneweb.co.uk/lecropt/church20.jpg","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/David_Stirling","/wiki/Special_Air_Service","/wiki/Archie_Stirling","/wiki/Scottish_Voice","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/A9_road_(Great_Britain)","/wiki/M9_motorway_(Scotland)","/wiki/Perth,_Scotland","/wiki/Inverness","/wiki/A90_road_(Great_Britain)","/wiki/Dundee","/wiki/Aberdeen","/wiki/M80_motorway","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Glasgow","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/building_full.php?id=M024733","http://www.dunblaneweb.co.uk/lecropt/index.htm","http://www.dgnscrn.demon.co.uk/genuki/STI/Lecropt/index.html","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Lecropt&params=56.157_N_-3.98_E_","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&oldid=559091248","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Lecropt","/wiki/Category:Parishes_of_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Populated_places_in_Stirling_(council_area)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lecropt&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lecropt","/wiki/Lecropt","/wiki/Talk:Lecropt","#","/wiki/Lecropt","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lecropt","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lecropt","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&oldid=559091248","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lecropt&id=559091248","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lecropt","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lecropt&oldid=559091248&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lecropt&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecropt","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11
