{"cursor":"6023","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'live-ball era', also referred to as the 'lively ball era', is the period in\nMajor League Baseball beginning in , following the dead-ball era. During that\nyear offensive statistics rose dramatically in what would be mistakenly\nattributed to the introduction of a new \"lively\" ball. While cork-centered balls\nhad been introduced around 1910 (and proved very hitter-friendly), the\nconstruction of the balls remained consistent between the transition from the\n\"dead-\" to \"live-ball eras.\" More importantly, several rule changes\ngave more advantages to the batter.\n\nPrior to that time, the same ball would be used throughout the game and foul\nballs would be thrown back on the field and reused. The ball would only be\nreplaced if it started to unravel. As games progressed, the ball would become\nincreasingly dirty and worn, making it difficult to see, and its movement\nerratic. Pitchers were able to help this process along by scuffing it, spitting\non it, and since Russ Ford's discovery in 1913, cutting into it with an emery\nboard. The spitball was widely used as well. All of these effects gave the\npitcher a major advantage. The physical wear on the ball from being repeatedly\nhit also made it less elastic as the game progressed, making it increasingly\ndifficult to hit for distance.\n\nThere were also rule changes that contributed to the low-scoring games. In 1901\nthe National League adopted the \"foul strike rule,\" which counted foul balls as\nstrikes. Prior to this rule, batters could safely swing at many marginal\npitches, which not only tired out the pitcher, but allowed for more hits in\ntotal in the case that a \"flukey\" hit landed in play. With the introduction of\nthe foul strike rule the batter had to let many more pitches \"go\" without being\nswung on, dramatically reducing the total number of hits as well. The American\nLeague followed suit in 1903, making the rule universal.\n\nThe dead-ball era came to an end after the fatal beaning of Ray Chapman during\nthe 1920 season. Chapman was killed by a submarine pitch from Carl Mays in the\n5th inning of a twilight game. Witnesses stated that Chapman never moved to get\nout of the way of the ball, and it is assumed he simply couldn't see it. The new\nCommissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, instituted several new rules\nduring that season, both in response to Chapman's death as well as an effort to\nliven up the game. Starting in 1920 balls were replaced at the first sign of\nwear, resulting in a ball that was much brighter and easier for a hitter to see.\nThe other major rule change was the elimination of the spitball. The lively ball\nera was the era in which baseball came back into the picture and exploded with\npopularity.\n\nIn 1920, the game changed from typically low-scoring to high-scoring games, with\na newfound reliance on the home run. During that year Babe Ruth, setting a\nrecord for slugging percentage, hit 54 home runs, smashing his old record of 29.\nIn 1921, he broke his record again, hitting 59 home runs. Six years later, Ruth\npassed his 1921 mark by hitting 60 home runs, a single-season record that stood\nfor 34 years. In 1920 George Sisler also set his long-standing record of 257\nhits in a single season, which would not be eclipsed until 2004 by the Seattle\nMariners' Ichiro Suzuki.\n\nSuccessful hitters like Sisler, Ty Cobb, and Tris Speaker provide further\nevidence that the \"live-ball era\" is a misnomer. The established sluggers of the\n1910s maintained their previous, successful hitting styles into the 1920s,\nchoking up on the bat, striking out less, and generally hitting more doubles\nthan home runs. However, Ruth -- previously a pitcher, which might explain why\nno one tried to \"correct\" his swing -- held the bat lower and swung with an\nuppercut, essentially trying to hit home runs. When he hit 54 home runs in 1920,\nit was a total greater than 14 of the other 15 teams at the time, and it nearly\ntripled Sisler's second-highest total of 19 that season. Seeing his success (and\nhis popularity that followed), young players who debuted in the 1920s such as\nLou Gehrig and Mel Ott followed Ruth's example, and the home run has been a\nsignificant part of baseball since. \n\nThe live-ball era also had a lasting impact on pitchers. Between 1910 and 1920,\nthe last decade of the dead-ball era, eight pitchers had a 30-win season. Since\nthe beginning of the 1921 season, the first full season of the live-ball era,\nonly three pitchers have had 30-win seasons (Lefty Grove in 1931, Dizzy Dean in\n1934, and Denny McLain in 1968).\n","linknr":212,"url":"Live-ball_era","recorded":1375076591,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/1920_in_baseball","/wiki/Dead-ball_era","/wiki/Baseball_statistics","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/Foul_ball","/wiki/Russ_Ford","/wiki/Emery_board","/wiki/Spitball","/wiki/Elastic_collision","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Beanball","/wiki/Ray_Chapman","/wiki/Submarine_(baseball)","/wiki/Carl_Mays","/wiki/Baseball_Commissioner","/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis","/wiki/Spitball","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Babe_Ruth","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/George_Sisler","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Seattle_Mariners","/wiki/Ichiro_Suzuki","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Tris_Speaker","/wiki/Lou_Gehrig","/wiki/Mel_Ott","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Dead-ball_era","/wiki/Lefty_Grove","/wiki/Dizzy_Dean","/wiki/Denny_McLain","/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Dead-ball_era","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=JC4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA67&dq=introduction+of+the+cork-centered+baseball&source=bl&ots=_MorwkUt4g&sig=N_8aFf_kEkLphuDLvdfrdJJL1vE&hl=en&ei=GrprTInvDIT7lwfImKWYAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=hxmQ2W-yGiwC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=thomas+sowell+dead+ball+era&source=bl&ots=TNcsiCIHhF&sig=pfb6HzGDToXhxokP2GCEWoSSCuI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OJdsUdf7LIL28gSiuoGQDA&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=twopage&q&f=true","/w/index.php?title=Live-ball_era&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Template:MLB","/wiki/Template_talk:MLB","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:MLB&action=edit","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/2013_Major_League_Baseball_season","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/American_League_East","/wiki/American_League_Central","/wiki/American_League_West","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/Houston_Astros","/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim","/wiki/New_York_Yankees","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays","/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals","/wiki/Seattle_Mariners","/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays","/wiki/Minnesota_Twins","/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/National_League_East","/wiki/National_League_Central","/wiki/National_League_West","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks","/wiki/Miami_Marlins","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Colorado_Rockies","/wiki/New_York_Mets","/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/San_Diego_Padres","/wiki/Washington_Nationals","/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals","/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions","/wiki/List_of_National_League_pennant_winners","/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/National_League_Division_Series","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game","/wiki/List_of_American_League_pennant_winners","/wiki/American_League_Championship_Series","/wiki/American_League_Division_Series","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/World_Baseball_Classic","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_record_holders","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_awards","/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum","/wiki/Winter_Meetings","/wiki/Hot_stove_league","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Draft","/wiki/Rule_5_draft","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_television_contracts","/wiki/List_of_highest_paid_Major_League_Baseball_players","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_logo","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_seasons","/wi
