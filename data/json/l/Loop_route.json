{"cursor":"19618","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n]]\n\nIn road transportation, a 'special route' [http://www.ncdot.o-\nrg/doh/PRECONSTRUCT/traffic/Safety/resources/teaas/chapter_04.pdf NCDOT -\nFeature Names, Codes, and Secondary Roads] is a prefixed and/or suffixed\nnumbered road that forms a loop or spur of a more dominant route of the same\nroute number and system. The dominant route is generally referred to as the\n\"parent\" or \"mainline\", while special routes are also unofficially or\nneologistically known as 'child routes' or 'auxiliary routes'. [http://www.pahighways.com/us/US422aux.html PA Highways -\nAuxiliary Routes of US 422] Special routes are included in many highway\nsystems in the United States; most are found in the Interstate Highway System,\nU.S. highway system, and various state highway systems. There are numerous types\nof special routes, each possessing generally defined characteristics and having\ndefined relationships with the parent route.\n\nIn the field, the special route is typically distinguished from the parent route\nwith the use of auxiliary words or suffix letters placed on the route shield or\non an adjacent sign, known as a \"banner\" or \"plate\" or according to the Manual\non Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a \"route sign auxiliary\nsign\". [http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/2003r1/part2/part2d1.htm#section2D12\nSection 2D.12: Design of Route Sign Auxiliaries] A common roadfan synonym\nfor special route is \"'bannered highway'\" or \"'bannered route'\", terms coined\nfrom the presence of these companion signs. [http://www.us-\nhighways.com/usban.htm US-Highways: Bannered U.S. Highways] [http://www.wkinsler.com/highways/oklahoma.html WKinsler:\nOklahoma's U.S. Highway History] [http://www.hawaiihighways.com/FAQs-\npage3.htm Hawaii Highways: FAQ Page 3] The term is not all-encompassing\nhowever, as not all special routes have these banners.\n\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)\nsets the nationwide precedent for special routes, particularly for U.S.\nNumbered Highways. As of 2009, the standards organization only advocates four\ntypes of special routes: business, bypass, alternate, and temporary. AASHTO\nsuggests that transportation authorities of the United States decommission\nother types of special routes and/or replace such obsolete designations with\nanother type of route.\n\nSome old alignments of routes may also be informally known as special routes\n(despite some that do not intersect the parent route). These older alignments\nmay be given street names like \"Old U.S. Highway 52\", or in some rare cases, be\nsigned with route shields attached to \"Old\" banners.\n\nIn the case of U.S. state route systems, special routes are generally restricted\nto primary state routes, not secondary state routes, though Missouri has three\nsupplemental routes with short spur routes, and the 500-series county routes in\nNew Jersey have alternate, bypass, spur, and truck routes.\n\nA few rare highways have two special route designations. Some of these doubly\ndesignated special routes are: *Alternate Business US 66 in Springfield,\nMissouri *Business US 1A in downtown Bangor, Maine *Truck Business US 17 in\nElizabeth City, North Carolina *Business US 77 Alternate in Yoakum, Texas\n","linknr":476,"url":"Loop_route","recorded":1362564916,"links":36,"instances":["slope","springfield","road","myrtle_beach","michigan_highway","texas","michigan"],"pdf":["http://www.ncdot.org/doh/PRECONSTRUCT/traffic/Safety/resources/teaas/chapter_04.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/500%20Routes.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/500%20Routes.pdf","http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf","http://cms.transportation.org/sites/route/docs/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf","http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/part2f.pdf","http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/part2f.pdf"],"categories":["Roads
