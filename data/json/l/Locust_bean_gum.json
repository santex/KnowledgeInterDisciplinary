{"cursor":"2727","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Locust bean gum' ('LBG', also known as 'carob gum', 'carob bean gum',\n'carobin', '[[E number|E410]]') is a galactomannan vegetable gum extracted from\nthe seeds of the carob tree, mostly found in the Mediterranean region. The long\npods that grow on the tree are used to make this gum. The pods are kibbled to\nseparate the seed from the pulp. The seeds have their skins removed by an acid\ntreatment. The deskinned seed is then split and gently milled. This causes the\nbrittle germ to break up while not affecting the more robust endosperm. The two\nare separated by sieving. The separated endosperm can then be milled by a roller\noperation to produce the final locust bean gum powder. CyberColloids: [http://www.cybercolloids.net/library/carob/carob-and-locust-bean-gum-\nproduction Locus bean gum production], CyberColloids, Hydrocolloids research and\ndevelopment webpage.\n\nLocust bean gum occurs as a white to yellow-white powder. It consists chiefly of\nhigh-molecular-weight hydrocolloidal polysaccharides, composed of galactose and\nmannose units combined through glycosidic linkages, which may be described\nchemically as galactomannan. It is dispersible in either hot or cold water,\nforming a sol having a pH between 5.4 and 7.0, which may be converted to a gel\nby the addition of small amounts of sodium borate.\n\nLBG is used as a thickening agent and gelling agent in food technology.\n\nThe bean, when made into powder, is sweetâwith a flavor similar to chocolateâand\nis used to sweeten foods and as a chocolate substitute. It is also used in pet\nfoods and inedible products such as mining products, paper making, and to\nthicken textiles. It is used in cosmetics and to enhance the flavor of\ncigarettes. Shoe polish and insecticides also have locust bean gum powder as an\nadditive. Locust Bean Gum Powder [http://www.glyconutritionforlife.org/Scie-\nnce_of_Glyconutrients/Locust_Bean_Gum_Powder.php] It is soluble in hot\nwater.
