{"cursor":"20993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Landmark court decisions' establish new precedents that establish a significant\nnew legal principle or concept, or otherwise substantially change the\ninterpretation of existing law. In Commonwealth countries, a reported decision\nis said to be a leading decision when it has come to be generally regarded as\nsettling the law of the question involved. In 1914, Canadian jurist Augustus\nHenry Frazer Lefroy said \"a 'leading case' [is] one that settles the law upon\nsome important point.\" Augustus Henry Frazer Lefroy, Leading Cases in\nCanadian Constitutional Law. Toronto: Carswell, 1914, p. v.\n\nA leading decision may settle the law in more than one way. It may do so by:\n* distinguishing a new principle that refines a prior principle, thus departing\n  from prior practice without violating the rule of [[stare decisis]];\n* establishing a âtestâ (that is, a measurable standard that can be applied by\n  courts in future decisions), such as the ''Oakes test'' (in Canadian law) or\n  the ''Bolam test'' (in English law).\n* Sometimes, with regard to a particular provision of a written constitution,\n  only one court decision has been made. By necessity, until further rulings are\n  made, this ruling is the leading case. For example, in Canada, â[t]he leading\n  case on voting rights and electoral boundary readjustment is ''Carter''. In\n  fact, Carter is the only case of disputed electoral boundaries to have reached\n  the Supreme Court.â Michael Pal and Sujit Choudry, âIs Every Ballot Equal?\n  Visible Minority Vote Dilution in Canadaâ, IRPP Choices vol. 13, no. 1\n  (January 2007), p. 14. The degree to which this kind of leading case can\n  be said to have \"settled\" the law is less than in situations where many\n  rulings have reaffirmed the same principle.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Landmark_decision","recorded":1362669307,"links":17,"instances":["law","england","political_custom"],"pdf":["http://www.musqueam.bc.ca/pdfs/R_v_Sparrow.pdf"],"categories":["Case
