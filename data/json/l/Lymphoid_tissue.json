The lymphatic\nsystem was first described in the seventeenth century independently by Olaus\nRudbeck and Thomas Bartholin. The lymph system is not a closed system. The circulatory system processes an\naverage of 20 liters of blood per day through capillary filtration which removes\nplasma while leaving the blood cells. Roughly 17 liters of the filtered plasma\nactually get reabsorbed directly into the blood vessels, while the remaining 3\nliters are left behind in the interstitial fluid. The primary function of the\nlymph system is to provide an accessory route for these excess 3 liters per day\nto get returned to the blood. [http://books.google.com/books?id=I9qH3eZ1pP0-\nC&pg=PT401#v=onepage&q&f=false Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems, by\nLauralee Sherwood] Lymph is essentially recycled blood plasma.\n\nLymphatic organs play an important part in the immune system, having a\nconsiderable overlap with the 'lymphoid system'. Lymphoid tissue is found in\nmany organs, particularly the lymph nodes, and in the lymphoid follicles\nassociated with the digestive system such as the tonsils. Lymphoid tissues\ncontain lymphocytes, but they also contain other types of cells for support. The system also includes all the structures\ndedicated to the circulation and production of lymphocytes (the primary cellular\ncomponent of lymph), which includes the spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and the\nlymphoid tissue associated with the digestive system.\n\nThe blood does not directly come in contact with the parenchymal cells and\ntissues in the body, but constituents of the blood first exit the microvascular\nexchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact\nwith the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when\ninterstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system.\nThe lymph is then moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic\ncontractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the\nlymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g. the contractions of skeletal\nmuscles).  The\norganization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body\ninto external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the\nhead, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an external route, and the lymphatic\ndrainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an internal\nroute. Eventually, the lymph vessels empty into the lymphatic ducts,\nwhich drain into one of the two subclavian veins (near the junctions of the\nsubclavian veins with the internal jugular veins).\n","linknr":910,"url":"Lymphoid_tissue","recorded":1362484961,"links":91,"instances":["biology","anatomy","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lymphatic system|*","Anatomy","Angiology"],"headings":["Terminology","Functions","Clinical significance","Organization","Lymphoid tissue","Function of the fatty acid transport system","Diseases of the lymphatic system","Development of lymphatic tissue","Lymphatico-venous communications","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Lymphatic_system.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Illu_lymph_node_structure.png/350px-Illu_lymph_node_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/DH_lymphatic_system.jpg/220px-DH_lymphatic_system.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Galen_detail.jpg/124px-Galen_detail.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Gabriele_Falloppio.jpg/132px-Gabriele_Falloppio.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Bartolomeus_Eustachius.jpg/109px-Bartolomeus_Eustachius.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Olaus_Rudbeck_Sr_%28portrait_by_Martin_Mijtens_Sr%2C_1696%29.jpg/112px-Olaus_Rudbeck_Sr_%28portrait_by_Martin_Mijtens_Sr%2C_1696%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Thomas_bartholin.jpg/118px-Thomas_bartholin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["cortex","anatomy"]],"members":["tissue","organ","cortex","cell"],"related":["Circulatory_system","Lymphatic_vessel","Lymph","Olaus_Rudbeck","Thomas_Bartholin","Blood","Capillary_filtration","Blood_plasma","Blood_cells","Blood_plasma","Organ_(anatomy)","Lymph_node","Lymphoid_follicle","Digestive_system","Tonsil","Lymphocyte","Lymph","Spleen","Thymus","Bone_marrow","Blood","Parenchyma","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Interstitial_fluid","Skeletal_muscle","Lymphatic_vessel","Subclavian_vein","Interstitial_fluid","Fatty_acid","Fat","Chyle","White_blood_cells","Antigen-presenting_cell","Metastasis","Lymph_capillaries","Lymph_vessel","Right_lymphatic_duct","Thoracic_duct","Lymphocyte","White_blood_cell","Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue","Infection","Tumor","Connective_tissue","Lymphocyte","Inflammation","Lymphocyte","Thymus","Bone_marrow","Clonal_selection","Antigen","Lymph_node","Tonsil","Peyer's_patch","Spleen","Adenoid","Skin","Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue","Efferent_lymph_vessel","Lymphatic_vessel","Afferent_lymph_vessel","Efferent_lymph_vessel","Cortex_(anatomy)","Medulla_of_lymph_node","Hilum_of_lymph_node","Germinal_center","Mediastinum","Lymph_vessel","Lacteal","Gastrointestinal_tract","Small_intestine","Portal_vein","Liver","Thoracic_duct","Medium-chain_triglycerides","Small_intestine","Chyle","Liver","Lymphedema","Edema","Elephantiasis","Parasitic_disease","Lymphatic_filariasis","Infection","Infectious_mononucleosis","Cancer","Hodgkin's_lymphoma","Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","Lymphoma","Metastasis","Hodgkin's_disease","Lymphangiomatosis","Lymphangiosarcoma","Soft_tissue_sarcoma","Lymphangioma","Turner_syndrome","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis","Lymphoma","Lymphatic_tissue","Mesoderm","Cisterna_chyli","Spleen","Thymus","Hippocrates","Ephesus","Herophilos","Alexandria","Lacteal","Hepatic_portal_vein","Galen","Gabriele_Falloppio","Fallopian_tube","Bartolomeo_Eustachi","Gaspare_Aselli","Jean_Pecquet","Chyle","Liver","Johann_Veslingius","William_Harvey","Olaus_Rudbeck","Christina,_Queen_of_Sweden","Thomas_Bartholin","Plagiarism","Galen","Gabriele_Falloppio","Bartolomeo_Eustachi","Olaus_Rudbeck","Thomas_Bartholin","American_Society_of_Lymphology","Lymphangiogenesis","Lymphangion","Lymphatic_system_assessment","Manual_lymphatic_drainage","Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"]}
