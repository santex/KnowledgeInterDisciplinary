These systems are maintained by flows of information, energy\nand matter.\n\nSome scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living\nsystems theory is required to explain the nature of life. Cleland and Chyba\nwrote a chapter in Planets and Life: \"In the absence of such a theory, we are in\na position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define\n'water' in the absence of molecular theory.\" [...] \"Without access to living\nthings having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps\nultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of\nliving systems\". Such general theory, arising out of the ecological and\nbiological sciences, attempts to map general principles for how all living\nsystems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down\ninto components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of\ndynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their\nenvironment. {{cite web | title=A short definition of Life: matter as a\nsystem interacts with the surrounding environment taking advantage of its\nresources for its maintenance and perpetuation.
