He\nis best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of\nsocial evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds\nsocieties together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic\ninstitution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family; the idea was\naccepted by most pre-historians and anthropologists throughout the late\nnineteenth century.\n\nAlso interested in what leads to social change, he was a contemporary of the\nEuropean social theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were influenced by\nreading his work on social structure and material culture, the influence of\ntechnology on progress. Morgan is the only American social theorist to be cited\nby such diverse scholars as Marx, Charles Darwin, and Sigmund Freud. Elected as\na member of the National Academy of Sciences, Morgan served as president of the\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in 1879. .\n\nMorgan was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Monroe Co., 2nd\nD.) in 1861, and of the New York State Senate in 1868 and 1869.\n","linknr":682,"url":"Lewis_Henry_Morgan","recorded":1362480780,"links":53,"instances":["weapon","united_states","united_states","station","expert","plymouth_governor"],"pdf":["http://dev.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/052white2.pdf","http://dev.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/052white2.pdf","http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/class_text_105.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/morgan-lewis.pdf"],"categories":["1818
