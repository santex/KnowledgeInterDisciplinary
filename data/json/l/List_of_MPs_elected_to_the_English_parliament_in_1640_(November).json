{"cursor":"60516","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThis is a 'list of [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) elected in 1640' to the Long\nParliament which began in the reign of King Charles I and continued into the\nCommonwealth.\n\nThe fifth and last Parliament of Charles I began at Westminster 3 November 1640\nand continued sitting till 20 April 1653, when it was dissolved. There were five\nadditional constituenceis which were Ashburton, Honiton and Okehampton in Devon,\nand Malton and Northallerton in Yorkshire.\n\nThe length of the parliament and the turbulent times of the civil war resulted\nin a considerable turnover of MPs. At election, several MPs were elected for\nmore than one seat, which resulted in re-elections and possible disputes. Some\nelectoral disputes were never resolved within the term of the parliament. In\nthe first year groups of MPs were lost - some were created peers as Charles I\nwished to strengthen his House of Lords; others were expelled as monopolists or\nfor subversion. As the country plunged into Civil War, the Westminster\nparliament was divided, with over 150 MPs throwing in their lot with the King,\nand meeting at Oxford. These were nearly all disabled as a result. Several MPs\non both sides were killed in action, adding to the normal roll call of deaths\nthrough natural causes. By around 1645 replacements were being elected to\nreplace the disabled members.\n\nIn December 1648 the army imposed its will on parliament and large numbers of\nMPs were excluded under Pride's Purge, creating the Rump Parliament. Many who\nwere not officially excluded did not participate in the affairs of the house.\nAlthough the parliament was dissolved in 1653 and four intervening parliaments\nwere called, the Long Parliament was reconvened in 1659 for another dissolution.\n\nThis list contains details of the MPs elected in 1640 and shortly afterwards.\nFor the second half of the parliament after around 1645 when a new set of MPs\nwere drafted in, see List of MPs in the English parliament in 1645 and after\n","linknr":1157,"url":"List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)","recorded":1375076257,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1603-1649).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg/150px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281603-1649%29.svg.png","/w/index.php?title=9th_Parliament_of_Elizabeth_1&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1597","/w/index.php?title=Final_parliament_of_Elizabeth_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1601","/w/index.php?title=1st_parliament_of_King_James_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1604","/wiki/Addled_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1614","/w/index.php?title=3rd_parliament_of_King_James_I&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1621","/wiki/Happy_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1624","/wiki/Useless_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1625","/wiki/2nd_Parliament_of_King_Charles_I","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1626","/wiki/3rd_parliament_of_King_Charles_I","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1628","/wiki/Short_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(April)","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_not_excluded_from_the_English_parliament_in_1648","/wiki/Barebone%27s_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_nominated_to_the_English_parliament_in_1653","/wiki/First_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1654","/wiki/Second_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1656","/wiki/Third_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1659","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_not_excluded_from_the_English_parliament_in_1648","/wiki/Convention_Parliament_(1660)","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_Parliament_in_1660","/wiki/Cavalier_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_Parliament_in_1661","/wiki/List_of_Parliaments_of_England","/wiki/Template:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679","/wiki/Template_talk:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Parliaments_of_England_1601%E2%80%931679&action=edit","/wiki/Members_of_Parliament","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/Ashburton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Honiton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Okehampton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Malton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_MPs_in_the_English_parliament_in_1645_and_after","#List_of_constituencies_and_MPs","#Bedfordshire","#Berkshire","#Buckinghamshire","#Cambridgeshire","#Cheshire","#Cornwall","#Cumberland","#Derbyshire","#Devon","#Dorset","#Essex","#Gloucestershire","#Hampshire","#Herefordshire","#Hertfordshire","#Huntingdonshire","#Kent_.28see_also_Cinque_Ports.29","#Lancashire","#Leicestershire","#Lincolnshire","#Middlesex","#Monmouthshire","#Norfolk","#Northamptonshire","#Northumberland","#Nottinghamshire","#Oxfordshire","#Rutland","#Salop","#Somerset","#Staffordshire","#Suffolk","#Surrey","#Sussex_-_see_also_Cinque_Ports","#Warwickshire","#Westmorland","#Wiltshire","#Worcestershire","#Yorkshire","#Cinque_Ports","#Wales","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_MPs_elected_to_the_English_parliament_in_1640_(November)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:EdmundVerney.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/EdmundVerney.jpg/170px-EdmundVerney.jpg","/wiki/File:EdmundVerney.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static
