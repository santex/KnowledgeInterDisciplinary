Gary, Sr.'\n(August 20, 1913 - October 27, 1996), was a Democratic politician who served\nfrom 1948 to 1964 as the mayor of Houma, the seat of Terrebonne Parish in south\nLouisiana.\n\nOriginally from Iberia Parish, Gary is a descendant of Juan Garrido (reduced to\n\"Gary\"), who was born c. 1737 in Malaga, Spain. Leon Gary earned his\nlivelihood as a distributor for an oil company and later as a banker. Gary was\nthe president in 1941 of the Houma chapter of Rotary International. During World War II, Gary was a member of the Houma branch of the\nfederal Office of Price Administration. Over a five-year period, the \"ration\nboard\", as it was known, had regulated and stabilized prices on scarce consumer\ngoods. The Houma office closed on November 4, 1946. Gary said that the board was\n\"proud of one thing: We always guided ourselves when issuing critical material\non a high-priority basis. Much pressure was put on us, but as a member of the\nprogram I feel that we gave such material to the people entitled to it. We did\nthe job as well as we possibly could.\"\n\nGary's sixteen years as mayor are remembered for the expansion of the Houma\nelectrical and water systems and mineral development. Four-inch water pipes on\nMain Street were replaced by 8-inch pipes.

The position however went to C. E. \"Cap\" Barham, a\nmember of the Louisiana State Senate from Ruston.\n\nAfter he left the mayoralty, Gary was appointed in 1964 as the director of the\nLouisiana Department of Public Works by incoming Governor John J. McKeithen. He\nsucceeded Claude Kirkpatrick, the DPW director under Jimmie Davis, who had run\nin the 1963 Democratic primary for governor against McKeithen and a large field\nof other candidates. Later, McKeithen shifted Gary to the position of state\nhighway director. From 1957-1958, Gary was president of the\nLouisiana Municipal Association.\n\nMayor Gary was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention, which met\nin Chicago to nominate the Stevenson-Kefauver ticket, the first party slate to\nlose the electoral votes of Louisiana since Reconstruction.\n\nGary was married to the former Lolita Theriot, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.\nErnest Theriot. The couple had three children, Leon J. Gary, Jr. , an attorney\nfrom Baton Rouge and his wife, Rhea Gary, an artist; Lolita M.\n\"Girlie\" Gary of Metairie, and Don Leon Gary (c. 1942-2010), a geography\nprofessor at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux.\n\n\n\n","linknr":151,"url":"Leon_Gary","recorded":1375083798,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Mayor","/wiki/Houma,_Louisiana","/wiki/Terrebonne_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Iberia_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/New_Iberia,_Louisiana","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Houma,_Louisiana","/wiki/Terrebonne_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Louisiana","#cite_note-rotary-1","/wiki/Iberia_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/Malaga,_Spain","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Rotary_International","#cite_note-rotary-1","/wiki/Office_of_Price_Administration","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-booklet-4","/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Louisiana","/wiki/Bill_Dodd","/wiki/C._E._%22Cap%22_Barham","/wiki/Louisiana_State_Senate","/wiki/Ruston,_Louisiana","/wiki/Governor_of_Louisiana","/wiki/John_J._McKeithen","/wiki/Claude_Kirkpatrick","/wiki/Jimmie_Davis","#cite_note-booklet-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/1956_Democratic_National_Convention","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II","/wiki/Estes_Kefauver","/wiki/Electoral_vote","/wiki/Reconstruction_era_in_the_United_States","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Metairie,_Louisiana","/wiki/Nicholls_State_University","/wiki/Thibodaux,_Louisiana","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-rotary_1-0","#cite_ref-rotary_1-1","http://www.houmarotary.org/HoumaRotaryHistory.cfm","#cite_ref-2","http://genforum.genealogy.com/gary/messages/118.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20061122/FEATURES/611220329?p=1&tc=pg","#cite_ref-booklet_4-0","#cite_ref-booklet_4-1","/wiki/Houma,_Louisiana","#cite_ref-5","http://www.lma.org/LMA/About/PastPresidents/LMA/AboutUs/PastPresidents.aspx?hkey=5730bd5b-9fbc-4823-9328-c23913bae9dc","#cite_ref-6","http://politicalgraveyard.com/parties/D/1956/LA.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.rheagary.com/about.cfm","#cite_ref-8","http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20100705/OBITS/100709715","/wiki/Mayor","/wiki/Houma,_Louisiana","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Natchitoches,_Louisiana","/wiki/W._George_Bowdon","/wiki/Alexandria,_Louisiana","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Iberia_Parish,_Louisiana","/wiki/New_Iberia,_Louisiana","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&oldid=551077322","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1913_births","/wiki/Category:1996_deaths","/wiki/Category:Louisiana_Democrats","/wiki/Category:Businesspeople_from_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:Mayors_of_places_in_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:People_from_New_Iberia,_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:People_from_Houma,_Louisiana","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_Spanish_descent","/wiki/Category:American_Roman_Catholics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leon+Gary&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leon+Gary","/wiki/Leon_Gary","/wiki/Talk:Leon_Gary","#","/wiki/Leon_Gary","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Leon_Gary","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Leon_Gary","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&oldid=551077322","/w/index.php?title=Leon_Gary&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6524645","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Leon_Gary&id=551077322","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Leon+Gary","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookc
