The title character, \"Link\", is a super-intelligent yet malicious\n  orangutan who lashes out against his masters when they try to have him put to\n  sleep and sought to become his own master over a young woman. The film also\n  features two chimpanzees, one of which is a baby.\n\nIt was directed by Richard Franklin and written by Everett De Roche from a story\nby Lee David Zlotoff and Tom Ackermann. The score was provided by Jerry\nGoldsmith. It was filmed in St. Abbs, Scotland.\n\nShue and Goldsmith received Saturn Award nominations for their contributions.\n\nAlthough the title primate is clearly an orangutan, he is referred to as a\nchimpanzee through the entire film, and his fur appears to have been dyed black\n(Orangutans have reddish-brown fur).\n","linknr":175,"url":"Link_(film)","recorded":1362485300,"links":26,"instances":["cinematographer","director"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1986 horror films","1986 films","British films","British horror films","Golan-Globus films","Natural horror films","Films directed by Richard Franklin (director)"],"headings":["Cast","Production","Release","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Link_%28film%29.jpg/220px-Link_%28film%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/UKfilm.svg/35px-UKfilm.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Horrorfilm.png/40px-Horrorfilm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["richard_franklin","director"],["richard_franklin","director"],["mike_molloy","cinematographer"],["richard_franklin","director"]],"members":["mike_molloy","richard_franklin"],"related":["Richard_Franklin_(director)","Richard_Franklin_(director)","Lee_David_Zlotoff","Tom_Ackermann","Everett_De_Roche","Elisabeth_Shue","Terence_Stamp","Jerry_Goldsmith","Mike_Molloy_(cinematographer)","Andrew_London","Derek_Trigg","EMI_Films","Cannon_Films","1986_in_film","United_Kingdom","Horror_film","Elisabeth_Shue","Terence_Stamp","Orangutan","Animal_euthanasia","Chimpanzee","Richard_Franklin_(director)","Everett_De_Roche","Lee_David_Zlotoff","Tom_Ackermann","Jerry_Goldsmith","St._Abbs","Scotland","Saturn_Award","Primate","Fur","Elisabeth_Shue","Terence_Stamp","David_O'Hara","Steven_Pinner","Kevin_Lloyd","Linus_Roache","Jane_Goodall","EMI_Films"]}
