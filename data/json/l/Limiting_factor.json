{"cursor":"1827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A limiting factor causes a population to decrease in size. A few limiting\nfactors are food, shelter, water, space. These are not all limited to the\ncondition of the species. Some factors may be increased or reduced based on\ncircumstances. An example of a limiting factor is sunlight in the rain forest,\nwhere growth is limited to all plants in the under story unless more light\nbecomes available. This decreases plants photosynthesis.\n\nA number of potential factors could influence a biological process, but\nimportantly only one is limiting at any one place and time. This recognition\nthat there is always a single limiting factor is vital in ecology; and the\nconcept has parallels in numerous other processes.\n\nSome other limiting factors in biology are water availability, temperature,\nshelter, or predation.
