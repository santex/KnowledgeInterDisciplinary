{"cursor":"24794","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Link aggregation' is a computer networking term to describe various methods of\ncombining ([[wikt:aggregation|aggregating]]) multiple network connections in\nparallel to increase throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain,\nand to provide redundancy in case one of the links fails.\n\nFurther umbrella terms used to describe the method include 'port trunking', 'link bundling', 'Ethernet/network/NIC bonding', or 'NIC teaming'. These umbrella terms not only encompass\nvendor-independent standards such as 'Link Aggregation Control Protocol' (LACP)\nfor Ethernet defined in 'IEEE 802.1ax' or the previous 'IEEE 802.3ad', but also\nvarious proprietary solutions.\n\nAggregation can be implemented at any of the lowest three layers of the OSI\nmodel. Examples of aggregation at layer 1 are power line (e.g. IEEE 1901) and\nwireless (e.g. IEEE 802.11) network devices that combine multiple frequency\nbands. OSI layer 2 (data link layer, e.g. Ethernet frame in LANs or multi-link\nPPP in WANs, Ethernet MAC address) aggregation typically occurs across switch\nports, which can be either physical ports, or virtual ones managed by an\noperating system. Aggregation is also possible at layer 3 in the OSI model using\nround-robin scheduling, or based on hash values computed from fields in the\npacket header, or a combination of these two methods. Regardless of the layer on\nwhich aggregation occurs, the network load is balanced across all links. Most\nmethods provide failover as well.\n\nCombining can either occur such that multiple interfaces share one logical\naddress (i.e. IP) or one physical address (i.e. MAC address), or it can be done\nsuch that each interface has its own address. The former requires that both ends\nof a link use the same aggregation method, but has performance advantages over\nthe latter.\n","linknr":308,"url":"Link_aggregation","recorded":1362482978,"links":32,"instances":["computing","operating_system","hardware","engineering","computing"],"pdf":["http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.1AX-2008.pdf","http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.1AX-2008.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1742-6596/119/4/042015/jpconf8_119_042015.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1742-6596/119/4/042015/jpconf8_119_042015.pdf","http://www.ieee802.org/3/maint/public/maint_open_1106.pdf","http://www.ieee802.org/3/maint/public/maint_open_1106.pdf","http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/network/LAG1855/LAGConsiderationv0.5.pdf","http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/3/hssg/public/apr07/frazier_01_0407.pdf","http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/Whats-New-VMware-vSphere-51-Network-Technical-Whitepaper.pdf"],"categories":["Ethernet","Link protocols","Bonding protocols"],"headings":["Description","IEEE link aggregation","Proprietary link aggregation","Linux bonding driver","Usage","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Link_Aggregation1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["redundancy","engineering"],["computer_port","hardware"],["solaris","operating_system"],["load_balancing","computing"],["bandwidth","computing"],["computer_port","hardware"]],"members":["bandwidth","solaris","computer_port","redundancy","load_balancing"],"related":["Computer_networking","Throughput","Redundancy_(engineering)","Ethernet","OSI_model","Power_line_communication","IEEE_1901","Wireless_LAN","Data_link_layer","Ethernet_frame","MAC_address","Failover","Ethernet","Order_of_magnitude","Megabit","Channel_bonding","Single_point_of_failure","OSI_model","Failover","Link_layer","IEEE_802.3","802.1X","Protocol_stack","802.3","Computer_port_(hardware)","Fiber_media_converter","EtherChannel","Port_Aggregation_Protocol","Multi-link_trunking","Split_Multi-Link_Trunking","R-SMLT","Distributed_Split_Multi-Link_Trunking","FreeBSD","Linux","Solaris_(operating_system)","Network_interface_controller","Linux_distribution","Linux_kernel","Loadable_kernel_module","User_space","Donald_Becker","Beowulf_cluster","Linux","Network_packet","Load_balancing_(computing)","Fault-tolerant_design","MAC_address","Network_interface_controller","Network_switch","XOR","Modulo_operation","Address_Resolution_Protocol","Backbone_network","Bandwidth_(computing)","Computer_port_(hardware)","Throughput","Topology","Computer_cluster","Computer_cluster","Microsoft_Windows","Device_driver","Intel","Nvidia","Hewlett-Packard","Broadcom","Linux","FreeBSD","NetBSD","OpenBSD","Mac_OS_X","OpenSolaris","AIX","Xen","VMware_ESX","Hyper-V","Split_multi-link_trunking","Inter-Switch_Trunk","MC-LAG","Spanning_Tree_Protocol","IEEE_Standards_Association"]}
