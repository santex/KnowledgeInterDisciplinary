The nodes produce white blood cells (lymphocytes) that fight\ninfections. When an infection is present, the lymph nodes swell, produce more\nwhite blood cells, and attempt to trap the organisms that are causing the\ninfection. The lymph nodes also try to trap cancer cells.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Lymph_node_biopsy","recorded":1362510870,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopsy","Lymphatic organ surgery"],"headings":["How the test is performed","Test results","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lymph_node","Microscope","Biopsy","Lymphatic_system","Lymph_vessel","Lymphocytes","Infection","Cancer","Operating_room","Hospital","Outpatient_surgery","Needle_biopsy","Anesthetic","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Bleeding","Sedative","Skin","Anesthetic","General_anesthetic","Surgical_suture","Bandage","Pathology","Infection","Bleeding","Nerve","Paralysis","Paresthesia","Nerve","Lymphadenitis","Tumor","Cancer","Infection","Malignant","Benign","Pathologist","Diagnosis","Hodgkin's_lymphoma","Non-Hodgkin's_lymphoma","Sarcoidosis","Scrofula"]}
