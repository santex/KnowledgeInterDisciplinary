{"cursor":"7664","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'limit point' of a set S in a topological space X is a point x\n(which is in X, but not necessarily in S) that can be \"approximated\" by points\nof S in the sense that every neighbourhood of x with respect to the topology on\nX also contains a point of S other than x itself. Note that x does not have to\nbe an element of S. This concept profitably generalizes the notion of a limit\nand is the underpinning of concepts such as closed set and topological closure.\nIndeed, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points, and\nthe topological closure operation can be thought of as an operation that\nenriches a set by adding its limit points.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Limit_point","recorded":1362585234,"links":34,"instances":["mathematics","topology","topology","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Limit sets|","Topology","General topology"],"headings":["Definition","Types of limit points","Some facts","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["neighbourhood","topology"],["limit","mathematics"],["neighbourhood","mathematics_"],["neighbourhood","topology"],["net","mathematics"],["filter","mathematics"],["closure","topology"]],"members":["filter","neighbourhood","closure","limit","net","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Set_(mathematics)","Topological_space","Neighbourhood_(topology)","Topology","Limit_(mathematics)","Closed_set","Topological_closure","Topological_space","Neighbourhood_(mathematics)_","T1_space","Neighbourhood_(topology)","Sequential_space","Sequence","Limit_of_a_sequence","Sequence","Sequential_space","Net_(mathematics)","Sequence","Filter_(mathematics)","Limit_set","Closure_(topology)","Isolated_point","Discrete_space","Trivial_topology","Adherent_point"]}
