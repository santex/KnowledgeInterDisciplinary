Such sounds are transcribed in the IPA with a superscript\nâ¨lâ©, for example as in English spotless . In English words such as middle in\nwhich, historically, the tongue made separate contacts with the alveolar ridge\nfor the and , , many speakers today make only one tongue contact. That is, the\nis laterally released directly into the : . While this is a minor phonetic\ndetail in English (in fact, it is commonly transcribed as having no audible\nrelease: , ), it may be more important in other languages.\n\nIn most languages (as in English), laterally-released plosives are\nstraightforwardly analyzed as biphonemic clusters whose second element is . For\ncertain languages, however, it is sometimes claimed that laterally-released\nconsonants are unitary phonemes. According to Peter Ladefoged and Ian\nMaddieson, Ladefoged, Peter and Ian Maddieson. The Sounds of the World's\nLanguages. Wiley-Blackwell, 1996. the choice between one or another\nanalysis is purely based on phonological convenienceâthere is no actual acoustic\nor articulatory difference between one language's \"laterally-released plosive\"\nand another language's biphonemic cluster.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Lateral_release_(phonetics)","recorded":1362579790,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Consonants"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Phonetics","Plosive_consonant","Lateral_consonant","IPA","No_audible_release","Phoneme","Peter_Ladefoged","Ian_Maddieson","Nasal_release"]}
