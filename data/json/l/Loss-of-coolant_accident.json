{"cursor":"7154","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA)' is a mode of failure for a nuclear reactor;\nif not managed effectively, the results of a LOCA could result in reactor core\ndamage. Each nuclear plant's emergency core cooling system (ECCS) exists\nspecifically to deal with a LOCA.\n\nNuclear reactors generate heat internally; to remove this heat and convert it\ninto useful electrical power, a coolant system is used. If this coolant flow\nis reduced, or lost altogether, the nuclear reactor's emergency shutdown\nsystem is designed to stop the fission chain reaction. However, due to\nradioactive decay the nuclear fuel will continue to generate a significant\namount of heat. The decay heat produced by a reactor shutdown from full power\nis initially equivalent to about 5 to 6% of the thermal rating of the\nreactor. If all of the independent cooling trains of the ECCS fail\nto operate as designed, this heat can increase the fuel temperature to the\npoint of damaging the reactor.\n* If water is present, it may boil, bursting out of its pipes. (For this reason,\n  nuclear power plants are equipped with pressure-operated relief valves and\n  backup supplies of cooling water.)\n* If graphite and air are present, the graphite may catch fire, spreading\n  radioactive contamination. This situation exists only in AGRs, RBMKs, Magnox\n  and weapons-production reactors, which use graphite as a neutron moderator.\n  (see Chernobyl disaster.)\n* The fuel and reactor internals may melt; if the melted configuration remains\n  critical, the molten mass will continue to generate heat, possibly melting its\n  way down through the bottom of the reactor. Such an event is called a nuclear\n  meltdown and can have severe consequences. The so-called \"China syndrome\"\n  would be this process taken to an extreme: the molten mass working its way\n  down through the soil to the water table (and below) - however, current\n  understanding and experience of nuclear fission reactions suggests that the\n  molten mass would become too disrupted to carry on heat generation before\n  descending very far; for example, in the Chernobyl disaster the reactor core\n  melted and core material was found in the basement, too widely dispersed to\n  carry on a chain reaction (but still dangerously radioactive).\n* Some reactor designs have passive safety features that prevent meltdowns from\n  occurring in these extreme circumstances. The Pebble Bed Reactor, for\n  instance, can withstand extreme temperature transients in its fuel. Another\n  example is the CANDU reactor, which has two large masses of relatively cool,\n  low-pressure water (first is the heavy-water moderator; second is the light-water-\n  filled shield tank) that act as heat sinks. Another example is the Hydrogen\n  Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module, in which the chemical\n  decomposition of the uranium hydride fuel halts the fission reaction by\n  removing the hydrogen moderator. The same\n  principle is used in TRIGA research reactors.\n\nUnder operating conditions, a reactor may passively (that is, in the absence of\nany control systems) increase or decrease its power output in the event of a\nLOCA or of voids appearing in its coolant system (by water boiling, for\nexample). This is measured by the coolant void coefficient. Most modern nuclear\npower plants have a negative void coefficient, indicating that as water turns to\nsteam, power instantly decreases. Two exceptions are the Russian RBMK and the\nCanadian CANDU. Boiling water reactors, on the other hand, are designed to have\nsteam voids inside the reactor vessel.\n\nModern reactors are designed to prevent and withstand loss of coolant,\nregardless of their void coefficient, using various techniques. Some, such as\nthe pebble bed reactor, passively slow down the chain reaction when coolant is\nlost; others have extensive safety systems to rapidly shut down the chain\nreaction, and may have extensive passive safety systems (such as a large thermal\nheat sink around the reactor core, passively-activated backup cooling/condensing\nsystems, or a passively cooled containment structure) that mitigate the risk of\nfurther damage.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Loss-of-coolant_accident","recorded":1363577903,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Nuclear_reactor","/wiki/Emergency_core_cooling_system","/wiki/Coolant","/wiki/SCRAM","/wiki/Nuclear_fission","/wiki/Radioactive_decay","/wiki/Decay_heat","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant","/wiki/Relief_valve","/wiki/Graphite","/wiki/Combustion","/wiki/Radioactive_contamination","/wiki/Advanced_gas-cooled_reactor","/wiki/RBMK","/wiki/Magnox","/wiki/Neutron_moderator","/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster","/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown","/wiki/Water_table","/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster","/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety","/wiki/Pebble_Bed_Reactor","/wiki/CANDU","/wiki/Hydrogen_Moderated_Self-regulating_Nuclear_Power_Module","/wiki/Uranium_hydride","#cite_note-USPatApp11804450-2","/wiki/TRIGA","/wiki/Void_coefficient","/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant","/wiki/RBMK","/wiki/CANDU_reactor","/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor","/wiki/Void_coefficient","/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor","/wiki/Nuclear_safety","/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/SCRAM","/wiki/Light_water_reactors","/wiki/CANDU","/wiki/RBMK","/wiki/Pressurised_heavy_water_reactor","/wiki/Atucha_I_Nuclear_Power_Plant","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Containment_building","/wiki/Nuclear_power","/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor","/wiki/Nuclear_fuel_response_to_reactor_accidents","/wiki/Nuclear_accidents_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Nuclear_safety_in_the_U.S.","/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf#page=125","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf#page=125","#cite_ref-USPatApp11804450_2-0","http://www.google.com/patents?id=_WGoAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=&f=false","http://www.google.com/patents?id=_WGoAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=&f=false","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&oldid=541147201","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Nuclear_reactors","/wiki/Category:Nuclear_safety","/wiki/Category:Civilian_nuclear_power_accidents","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Loss-of-coolant+accident&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Loss-of-coolant+accident","/wiki/Loss-of-coolant_accident","/wiki/Talk:Loss-of-coolant_accident","#","/wiki/Loss-of-coolant_accident","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Loss-of-coolant_accident","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Loss-of-coolant_accident","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&oldid=541147201","/w/index.php?title=Loss-of-coolant_accident&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Loss-of-coolant_accident&id=541147201","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Loss-of-coolant+accident","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bo
