Lassa virus is an\nemerging virus and a select agent, requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent\ncontainment. It is endemic in West African countries, especially Sierra Leone,\nthe Republic of Guinea, Nigeria and Liberia, where the annual incidence of\ninfection is between 300,000 and 500,000 cases, resulting in 5,000 deaths per\nyear. Recent discoveries on the Lassa Virus within the Mano River\nRegion is that evidence has been discovered that will require to expand the\nendemicity zone between the two known Lassa endemic regions indicating that LASV\nis more widely distributed throughout the Tropical Wooded Savanna ecozone in\nWest Africa. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against Lassa\nfever for use in humans.\n","linknr":351,"url":"Lassa_virus","recorded":1362501559,"links":37,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal diseases","Animal virology","Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers","Biological weapons","Hemorrhagic fevers","RNA viruses","Tropical diseases","Viral diseases","Virology","Virus-related cutaneous conditions","Viruses","Zoonoses"],"headings":["Virology","Pathogenesis","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Lassa_virus.JPG/200px-Lassa_virus.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sense","molecular_biology#ambisense"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation","sense"],"related":["Transmission_electron_microscopy","Micrograph","Arenaviridae","Lassa_hemorrhagic_fever","Viral_hemorrhagic_fever","Emerging_infectious_disease","Select_agent","RNA_virus","Zinc_finger","RNA_polymerase","Nucleoprotein","Glycoprotein","Dystroglycan","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Dystroglycan","Extracellular_matrix","Lymphocytic_choriomeningitis_virus","Glycosyltransferase","West_Africa","Machupo","Guanarito","Junin_virus","Brazilian_hemorrhagic_fever","Transferrin_receptor","Amino_acid","Clathrin","Caveolin","Dynamin","Actin","Endosome","GTPase","Rab5","Rab7","Antigen-presenting_cell","Dendritic_cell","Mucosa","CBA/J-ML29","West_Africa"]}
