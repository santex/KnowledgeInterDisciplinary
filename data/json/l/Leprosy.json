Named after physician Gerhard\nArmauer Hansen, leprosy is primarily a granulomatous disease of the peripheral\nnerves and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract; skin lesions are the primary\nexternal sign. Left untreated, leprosy can be\nprogressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.\nContrary to folklore, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off, although\nthey can become numb or diseased as a result of secondary infections; these\noccur as a result of the body's defenses being compromised by the primary\ndisease. Secondary\ninfections, in turn, can result in tissue loss causing fingers and toes to\nbecome shortened and deformed, as cartilage is absorbed into the body. {{cite web |url=http://www.leprosy.org/leprosy-\nfaqs |title=Q and A about leprosy |quote=Do fingers and toes fall off when\nsomeone gets leprosy? No. The bacillus attacks nerve endings and destroys the\nbody's ability to feel pain and injury. Without feeling pain, people injure\nthemselves on fire, thorns, rocks, even hot coffee cups. Injuries become\ninfected and result in tissue loss. Fingers and toes become shortened and\ndeformed as the cartilage is absorbed into the body. |accessdate=2011-01-22\n|publisher=American Leprosy Missions }}\n\nLeprosy has affected humanity for over 4,000 years, and was\nrecognized in the civilizations of ancient China, Egypt and India. In 1995, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated\nthat between 2 and 3 million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy\nat that time. In the past 20 years, 15 million people\nworldwide have been cured of leprosy. Although the\nforced quarantine or segregation of patients is unnecessary in places where\nadequate treatments are available, many leper colonies still remain around the\nworld in countries such as India (where there are still more than 1,000 leper\ncolonies), China, Romania, Egypt,\nNepal, Somalia, Liberia, Vietnam, and Japan. Japan repealed its\n\"Leprosy Prevention Laws\" in 1996 but former patients still reside in\nsanatoriums. and [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070607f2.html Ex-\nHansen's disease patients still struggling with prejudice Japan Times June 7,\n2007]. Leprosy was once believed to be highly contagious and was treated\nwith mercury â all of which applied to syphilis, which was first described in\n1530. It is possible that many early cases thought to be leprosy could have\nactually been syphilis. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578770/s-\nyphilis/253277/Syphilis-through-history#ref252973 Syphilis through history]\nEncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica\n\nThe age-old social stigma associated with the advanced form of\nleprosy lingers in many areas, and remains a major obstacle to self-reporting\nand early treatment. Effective treatment for leprosy appeared in the late 1930s\nwith the introduction of dapsone and its derivatives. Leprosy bacilli resistant\nto dapsone soon evolved and, due to overuse of dapsone, became widespread. It\nwas not until the introduction of multidrug therapy (MDT) in the early 1980s\nthat the disease could be diagnosed and treated successfully within the\ncommunity.\n\nMDT for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine\ntaken over 12 months. Dosages adjusted appropriately for children and adults are\navailable in all primary health centres in the form of blister packages. Single dose MDT for single lesion leprosy consists of\nrifampicin, ofloxacin, and minocycline. The move toward single-dose treatment\nstrategies has reduced the prevalence of disease in some regions, since\nprevalence is dependent on duration of treatment. World Leprosy Day was created\nto draw awareness to leprosy and its sufferers.\n","linknr":1562,"url":"Leprosy","recorded":1362481879,"links":130,"instances":["japan","epidemiology","shape","medicine","genetics","element","medicine","epidemiology","dermatology","state","skin"],"pdf":["http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mandi/45/11/729/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mandi/45/11/729/_pdf","http://www.leprosy-ila.org/leprosyjournal/pdf/72/i0148-916X-72-2.pdf","http://www.leprosy-ila.org/leprosyjournal/pdf/72/i0148-916X-72-2.pdf","http://www.who.int/lep/resources/wer8132.pdf","http://www.who.int/lep/resources/wer8132.pdf","http://hansen.bvs.ilsl.br/textoc/revistas/intjlepr/1994/pdf/v62n3/v62n3edt02.pdf","http://hansen.bvs.ilsl.br/textoc/revistas/intjlepr/1994/pdf/v62n3/v62n3edt02.pdf","http://www.kit.nl/-/INS/24155/(57698)-ILS/KIT-ILS-Dossiers.pdf"],"categories":["Leprosy|","Bacterium-related
