Lactase can be\npurchased as a food supplement, and is added to milk to produce \"lactose-free\"\nmilk products.\n\nLactase (also known as 'lactase-phlorizin hydrolase', or 'LPH'), a part of the\nÎ²-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the\nhydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose\nmonomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of\nthe differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.\n","linknr":568,"url":"Lactase","recorded":1362504698,"links":43,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://public.carnet.hr/ftbrfd/42-121.pdf","http://public.carnet.hr/ftbrfd/42-121.pdf"],"categories":["Food additives","Antiflatulents","EC 3.2.1"],"headings":["Mechanism","Structure and biosynthesis","Genetic expression and regulation","Industrial use","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Lactase_mechanism.png/500px-Lactase_mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Lactase_Processing.png/500px-Lactase_Processing.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Digestive_system","Milk","Lactose","Sugar","Milk","Lactose_intolerance","Β-galactosidase","Enzyme","Glycoside_hydrolase","Hydrolysis","Disaccharide","Lactose","Galactose","Glucose","Monomer","Brush_border","Cell_membrane","Enterocyte","Intestinal_villus","Small_intestine","Gene","Temperature","PH","Phlorizin","Phloretin","Yeast","Fungus","Lactose_intolerance","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Blue_white_screen","Multiple_cloning_site","Plasmid_vector","MCM6","Lactose","Developmental_regulation_of_lactase_expression_in_mammals"]}
