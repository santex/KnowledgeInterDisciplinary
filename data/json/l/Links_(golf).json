{"cursor":"25560","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'links' is the oldest style of golf course, first developed in Scotland. The\nword \"links\" comes via the Scots language from the Old English word hlinc :\n\"rising ground, ridge\" [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_fram-\ne=0&search=links&searchmode=none Links at Online Etmology Dictionary] and\nrefers to an area of coastal sand dunes and sometimes to open parkland. The land\n\"linking\" the sea to the arable farmland is typically characterized by dunes, an\nundulating surface, and a sandy soil unsuitable for farming but which readily\nsupports various indigenous browntop bents and red fescue grasses, that give the\nfirm turf associated with links courses and the 'running 'game. It also retains\nthis more general meaning in the Scottish English dialect. It can be treated as\nsingular even though it has an \"s\" at the end and occurs in place names that\nprecede the development of golf, for example Lundin Links, Fife.\n\nLinks courses tend to be on, or at least very near to, a coast, and the term is\ntypically associated with coastal courses, often amid dunes, with few water\nhazards and few if any trees. This reflects both the nature of the scenery where\nthe sport happened to originate, and the fact that only limited resources were\navailable to golf course architects at the time, and any earth moving had to be\ndone by hand, so it was kept to a minimum. Even today, some links courses do not\nemploy a greens staff, use only basic machinery such as hole cutters without\nboards to ensure that the hole is cut unevenly, and use grazing animals to keep\nthe grass cropped.\n\nThe combination of the sand-based turf, sand dunes, general lack of trees, and\nseaside location means that links courses are frequently exposed to strong\nwinds. As a result, successful links golfers learn to control the trajectory of\ntheir shots by playing a lower ball flight. Greens on links courses tend to be\nfree of fronting hazards, allowing golfers to bounce the golf ball into the\ngreen rather than hitting high approach shots with strong backspin.\n\nAlthough the term links is often considered synonymous with any golf course, few\ngolf courses have all of the design elements of true links courses and are built\non linksland. The presence of a seaside location does not guarantee a links golf\ncourse. Many famous courses that claim to be links do not have all of the\nnecessary characteristics (e.g., Pebble Beach Golf Links, Old Head Golf Links at\nKinsale, The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island). On the other hand, some courses\nlocated hundreds of miles (kilometres) from a coast can have all of the\ncharacteristics of a seaside links except for proximity to water. One notable\nexample of such a course is Sand Hills Golf Club, located in the midst of the\nSand Hills of Nebraska.\n\nLinks courses remain most common in Ireland and also in Great Britain,\nespecially in Scotland. The Open Championship is always played on links courses,\nand this is one of the main features which differentiates it from the three\nmajor championships held in the United States.\n\nThe style of play on a links golf course is considerably different from the\nstyle of play on other types of courses. The challenges of links golf fall into\ntwo categories: Firstly the nature of the courses themselves, which tend to be\ncharacterised by uneven fairways, thick rough and small deep bunkers known as\n\"pot bunkers\"; and secondly, due to their coastal location and lack of trees,\nmany links courses are frequently windy. This affects the style of play\nrequired, favouring players who are able to play low accurate shots. As many\nlinks courses consist literally of an \"outward\" nine in one direction along the\ncoast, and an \"inward\" nine which returns in the opposite direction, players\noften have to cope with opposite wind patterns in each half of their round.\n","linknr":603,"url":"Links_(golf)","recorded":1362485386,"links":18,"instances":["baltray_golf_club","martello_golf_club","barassie_golf_club","golf","nebraska"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Golf
