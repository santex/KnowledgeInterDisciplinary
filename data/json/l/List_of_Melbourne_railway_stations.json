The\nstations make up 16 radial railway lines (and 3 greater metropolitan lines), as\nwell as the central City Loop.\n\nThere are also a further 19 stations on 3 heritage, volunteer-operated, tourist\nrailways. These are not a part of the suburban network.\n\nStations are broken up into 2 Metcard ticketing zones (some stations are in the\noverlap between the two zones, where tickets for either zone may be used), as\nwell as the City Saver area, which is within Zone 1 and covers the central\nbusiness district. On 4 March 2007 zone 3 was abolished by being incorporated\ninto Zone 2. {{cite press release\n| title=Public transport now has just two zones url=http://www.metlinkmelbourne-\n| .com.au/news/media_releases/metropolitan_general/public_transport_now_has_jus-\n| t_two_zones date=3 March 2006 accessdate=2006-03-06 publisher=Metlink\n}}\n\n*Stations listed in 'bold' are terminus stations. On some lines, some trains\nwill be timetabled to terminate before the end of the line. Shuttle trains are\nalso run between terminus stations on some lines.\n\n*Stations listed in italics are \"premium stations\" that are manned the entire\nday by staff who provide extra assistance and information to commuters.\n\n*Stations followed by an asterisk ( * ) are \"host stations\". These\nstations are manned during peak hours only. Some are manned only during morning\npeak, some during both morning and evening peaks.\n\n*Listed in parentheses after each station is that station's 3-letter code. These\ncodes are used internally by the railway control system and can also be entered\ninto the [http://jp.ptv.vic.gov.au/ptv/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en&itdLPxx_v-\niew=advanced PTV] journey
