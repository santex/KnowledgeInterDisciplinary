{"cursor":"3684","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Late Embryogenesis Abundant' proteins ('LEA proteins') are proteins in animals\nand plants that protect other proteins from aggregation from desiccation or\nosmotic stresses associated with low temperature. LEA\nproteins were initially discovered accumulating late in embryogenesis of cotton\nseeds. Although abundant in seeds and pollens, LEA proteins have been\nfound to protect against desiccation, cold, or high salinity in a variety of\norganisms, including the bacterium [[Deinococcus radiodurans]], nematode\n[[Caenorhabditis elegans]], Artemia (Brine shrimp), and\nrotifers.\n\nLEA proteins function by mechanisms which are distinct from those displayed by\nheat shock molecular chaperones. Although the causes of LEA\nprotein induction have not yet been determined, conformational changes in\ntranscription factors or integral membrane proteins due to water loss have been\nsuggested. LEA proteins are particularly protective of mitochondrial\nmembranes against dehydration damage.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Late_Embryogenesis_Abundant_proteins","recorded":1362372930,"links":13,"instances":["protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chaperone","protein"]],"members":["chaperone"],"related":["Protein","Protein_aggregation","Desiccation","Osmotic_shock","Temperature","Embryogenesis","Gossypium","Seed","Cold","Salinity","Bacteria","Nematode","Brine_shrimp","Rotifer","Heat_shock","Chaperone_(protein)","Transcription_factor","Integral_membrane_protein","Mitochondria","Cryptobiosis","Antifreeze_proteins"]}
