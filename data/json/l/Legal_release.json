{"cursor":"3549","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'legal release' is a legal instrument that acts to terminate any legal\nliability between the releasor and the releasee(s), signed by the releasor. A\nrelease may also be made orally in some circumstances. Releases are routinely\nused by photographers, in film production, by documentary filmmakers, or by\nradio and music producers when they photograph, film, video or record the voice\nor performance of individuals to be sure that the person consents or will not\nlater object to the material being used for whatever purpose the releasee (or\nanyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the wishes to\nuse the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording\nmade of the releasor (or property owned by the releasor for which the releasor\nmay claim some other right such as industrial design rights, trademark or trade\ndress rights). This will help in insuring the copyright owner has a clean chain\nof title for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public\ncinema or otherwise made public.\n\nReleases are very often used to ensure that litigation is terminated when a\nsettlement or compromise between the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) is reached. A\ngeneral release may release any claims known or unknown that the releasor may\nhave against the releasee. The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing\nwith specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts.\n\nGenerally a release is of the form:\n\n::For good and valuable [[consideration]], the receipt of which is hereby\n:acknowledged, I, the releasor, release the releasee for any and all claims I\n:may have against the releasee up to the date of the signing of this release\n:[relating to or arising from _____________].\n\n::::/signed/\n\nHowever, most releases are much more detailed in the recitation of what is being\nreleased and the extent of the release (where it is valid, when it become valid\nif there are conditions on its validity, the amount of consideration if it is\nsubstantial) and they are either copied and modified as necessary from various\nform books or drafting manuals used by lawyers or are preprinted forms that are\npurchased from legal form publishers.\n\nReleases should be drafted by a lawyer, solicitor or civil law notary (not in\nthe United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the\nrelease is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations\nthe releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances\nand the releasor may find that the release was too general and released some\nclaim, right or entitlement that the releasor should have retained.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Legal_release","recorded":1363183419,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Legal_instrument","/wiki/Legal_liability","/wiki/Photographer","/wiki/Film_production","/wiki/Documentary_film","/wiki/Filmmaker","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/Music","/wiki/Record_producer","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/releasee","/wiki/Industrial_design_rights","/wiki/Trademark","/wiki/Trade_dress","/wiki/Copyright","/wiki/Chain_of_title","/wiki/Litigation","/wiki/Compromise","/wiki/Plaintiff","/wiki/Defendant","/wiki/Consideration","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/Solicitor","/wiki/Civil_law_notary","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Current_TV","http://current.com/producerResources.htm","/wiki/English_Wikipedia","/wiki/Template:No_rights_reserved","http://www.dpcorner.com/all_about/releases.shtml","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit&section=2","http://photorights.4020.net","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Australia","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&oldid=404275547","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Legal_documents","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Legal+release&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Legal+release","/wiki/Legal_release","/wiki/Talk:Legal_release","#","/wiki/Legal_release","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Legal_release","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Legal_release","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&oldid=404275547","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Legal_release&id=404275547","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Legal+release","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Legal+release&oldid=404275547&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Legal_release&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_release","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal
