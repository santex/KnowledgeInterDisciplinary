It was founded in 1824 by\nGeorge Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, governor of British North America. Its\nheadquarters are still located in Quebec City.\n\nAfter several moves and two fires, the Society settled into the northern wing\nof Quebec City's Morrin College in 1868. The College closed at the turn of the\n20th century but the Society stayed on, eventually taking over the entire\nbuilding in 2004.\n\nThe Society's original aims were encyclopaedic, being founded in the infancy of\nCanada's cultural and intellectual development. The Society gathered historical\ndocuments about Canada and republished many rare manuscripts. Research in all\nfields of knowledge was actively encouraged. Talks were held in the Society's\nreading room, the best of which were published regularly in a quasi-annual\nseries of Transactions from 1824 to 1924.\n\nOver the years, the Society played a part in creating public institutions\nthat would take over many of its traditional roles. For instance, it fostered\nthe foundation of the Public Archives of Canada (today's Library and Archives\nCanada) in 1872. It was also active in the preservation of Canadaâs built and\nnatural heritage, helping to save the Plains of Abraham from developers and\neventually fostering the creation of the Historic Sites and Monuments board\nof Canada.\n\nWith the growth of national public institutions, the Societyâs activities\ngradually became centred on the services of its private lending library,\nproviding access to English-language books in a largely French-speaking city.\n\nRecently, the Society has reassessed its mission and serves as a cultural beacon\nfor Quebec City's small English-speaking community. In 2000, it took on the\nMorrin Centre project, a plan to restore a 200-year old historic site to create\na cultural centre that will showcase Anglophone life in Quebec City.\n","linknr":286,"url":"Literary_and_Historical_Society_of_Quebec","recorded":1375072236,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Literary_and_Historical_Society_of_Quebec&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Literary_and_Historical_Society_of_Quebec&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Learned_society","/wiki/Learned_society","/wiki/George_Ramsay,_9th_Earl_of_Dalhousie","/wiki/British_North_America","/wiki/Quebec_City","/wiki/Morrin_College","/wiki/Library_and_Archives_Canada","/wiki/Plains_of_Abraham","/wiki/National_Historic_Site_of_Canada","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items","/wiki/Quebec_City","/wiki/Morrin_Centre","/wiki/Quebec_City","/w/index.php?title=Literary_and_Historical_Society_of_Quebec&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Francis_Nathaniel_Burton","/w/index.php?title=James_Reid_(judge)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chief_Justice","/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Baddeley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Jonathan_Sewell","/wiki/Chief_Justice","/wiki/Andrew_Stuart_(Canadian_politician)","/w/index.php?title=William_Sheppard_(lumber_merchant)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Skey&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Wilkie&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws","/w/index.php?title=William_Kelly_(doctor)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/w/index.php?title=A.W._Cochrane&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/George-Barth%C3%A9lemy_Faribault","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/John_Charlton_Fisher","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws","/wiki/Edmund_Allen_Meredith","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/wiki/John_Langton_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/w/index.php?title=Edward_David_Ashe&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society","/wiki/Pierre-Joseph-Olivier_Chauveau","/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws","/wiki/James_Douglas_(businessman)","/w/index.php?title=W.J._Anderson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/James_MacPherson_LeMoine","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=James_Stevenson_(lawyer)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/David_Alexander_Ross","/wiki/Q.C.","/wiki/George_Stewart","/wiki/D.C.L.","/wiki/F.R.S.C.","/wiki/F.R.G.S.","/w/index.php?title=Cyrille_Tessier&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=R.W._Norman&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/D.D.","/wiki/Philippe_Baby_Casgrain","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=William_Wood_(lawyer)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/wiki/D.C.L.","/wiki/F.R.S.C.","/w/index.php?title=G.W._Parmelee&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws","/wiki/John_Hamilton","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/wiki/D.C.L.","/wiki/Col.","/w/index.php?title=H._Neilson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/John_Charles_McCorkill","/w/index.php?title=J.M._Harper&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/w/index.php?title=F.E.I.S&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=E.T.D._Chambers&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Michael_O%27Leary&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dominick_Daly_O%27Meara&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=J.C._Sutherland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Esq.","/w/index.php?title=G.F._Gibsone&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=W.H._Petry&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=A.T._Love&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frank_Carrel","/w/index.php?title=M.L.C.&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_de_Bury","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/w/index.php?title=R.C.O.C.&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_R._Peacock&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=R.R.I.&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/w/index.php?title=E.C._Woodley&action=edit&redlink=1","/w
