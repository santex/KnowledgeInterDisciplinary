Litter can also be used as a verb. To\nlitter means to throw (often man-made) objects onto the ground and leave them as\nopposed to disposing of them properly. While most litter is\nassociated with containers, wrappers and paper product; dumped items may include\nfurniture, appliances (white goods), old electronics (e-waste), abandoned\nvehicles or construction materials. These categories of waste often contain\nhazardous materials. The distinction between littering and illegal dumping is\nsometimes defined by volume 'Report littering and illegal dumping' http://w-\nww.derm.qld.gov.au/environmental_management/waste/illegal_dumping_litter.html or the location of the disposed of waste. 'What Is Illegal Dumping And\nHow Can I Report It?' https://www.sandiego.gov/environmental-\nservices/ep/illegal/illegal.shtml. Retrieved 2012-05-15. Illegally dumped\nitems containing hazardous waste can harm the environment and have a potentially\nnegative impact on human health.\n\nLarger hazardous items such as tires, appliances, electronics and large\nindustrial containers are often dumped in isolated locations, such as National\nForests and other public land.\n\nIt is a human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental issue in\nmany countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time\nbefore degrading and be transported large distances into the world's oceans.\nLitter can affect quality of life.\n\nCigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion\ndiscarded annually. Cigarette butts can take up to five years to completely\nbreak down. It is surprising that\nstatistics in 2003 showed metal/aluminum drink cans as the least littered item\nwhen drinks are more of a necessity than cigarettes.\n","linknr":493,"url":"Litter","recorded":1362574238,"links":39,"instances":["hawaii","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/inforesources/pubs/orientat/rom2.pdf","http://erplanning.com/uploads/National_Geographic_Article.pdf","http://erplanning.com/uploads/National_Geographic_Article.pdf","http://www.njclean.org/New-Jersey-Litter-Report.pdf","http://www.njclean.org/New-Jersey-Litter-Report.pdf","http://njclean.org/DOCUMENTS/2010-Northeast-Litter-Survey-Final-Report.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/region5/waste/illegal_dumping/downloads/il-dmpng.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/region5/waste/illegal_dumping/downloads/il-dmpng.pdf","http://www.keeppabeautiful.org/Portals/0/PDFs/IDS/MASTER_yorkIDS.pdf","http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/12061.pdf","http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/12061.pdf","http://www.deq.state.or.us/wmc/solwaste/rethinkrecyc/K-3/RRK-308.pdf","http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/resident/environment/Documents/Fact%20Sheet%20-%20Littering.pdf"],"categories":["Litter|"],"headings":["History","Causes","Life
