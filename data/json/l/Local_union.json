{"cursor":"1882","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'local union', often shortened to 'local', in North America, or a 'union\nbranch' (known as a 'lodge' in some unions) in the United Kingdom and other\ncountries is a locally-based trade union organization which forms part of a\nlarger, usually national, union.\n\nLocal branches are organized to represent the union's members from a\nparticular geographic area, company, or business sector. Locals have their own\ngoverning bodies which represent the interests of the national union while at\nthe same time responding to the desires of their constituents, and organise\nregular meetings for members. Local branches may also affiliate to a local\ntrades council.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, locals are usually numbered (e.g. CWA Local\n2101 [http://www.cwa2101.org/] in Baltimore, Maryland or ILA Local\n273 [http://ilalocal273.com/] in Saint John, New Brunswick). In the\nUnited Kingdom, they are usually named by geographical location (e.g. Manchester\nBranch), but may also have a name and a number (e.g. Manchester No.2 Branch) or\nhave a more specific name (e.g. Manchester Fitters Branch) if there is more than\none branch in a town. Some unions (e.g. Transport and General Workers' Union)\nnumber their branches as well as naming them.\n\nIn the British printing industry, union branches are traditionally divided into\nsub-branches known as \"chapels\", led by the Father of the Chapel. Each chapel\nrepresents members in a single printing works or department of a larger works.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Local_union","recorded":1362574099,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trade unions"],"headings":["Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg/28px-Syndicalism.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg/30px-Syndicalism.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["North_America","United_Kingdom","Trade_union","Trades_council","United_States","Canada","Baltimore,_Maryland","Saint_John,_New_Brunswick","Transport_and_General_Workers'_Union","Printing","Father_of_the_Chapel"]}
