The Lamberts were the principals in a\ndistinguished Madison Avenue jewelry house and were prominent college football\nboosters. The trophy, established in 1936 as the \"Lambert Trophy\" to recognize\nsupremacy in northeastern college football, has since grown to recognize the\nbest team in the Northeast in Division I FBS. A set of parallel trophies\ncollectively known as the 'Lambert Cup' is awarded to teams in Division I FCS\n(formerly I-AA), Division II, and Division III. The New Jersey Sports and\nExposition Authority, operator of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, took over the\nadministration of the Lambert Meadowlands Awards in 1983.\n\nPenn State won the award after the 2009 season for a record 28th time and the\nsecond consecutive year. On January 10, 2011, the NJSEA\nannounced that the University of Connecticut had won the trophy for the very\nfirst time, after winning the Big East and making their first appearance in the\nBCS. Since 1936, there have been 16 different winners in Division I-A/FBS.\n\nTo be eligible for the Lambert Meadowlands Award, a school must be located in\nthe Northeast or play half its schedule against eligible Lambert teams. The\nterritory includes New York, New Jersey, New England and Pennsylvania, while\nteams in the bordering states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia\nand the District of Columbia qualify if half their schedule features eligible\nteams. With the establishment of the Big East Conference as a major football\nconference, members of that conference outside of the Northeast were also made\neligible. While they were members of the Big East Conference, Virginia Tech and\nMiami of Florida were also eligible. Current Big East members Cincinnati,\nLouisville and South Florida are now eligible.\n\nWest Virginia will become ineligible for the trophy once it completes its move\nto the Big 12 Conference.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Lambert-Meadowlands_Trophy","recorded":1375078195,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lambert-Meadowlands_Trophy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lambert-Meadowlands_Trophy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Northeast_United_States","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/New_Jersey_Sports_and_Exposition_Authority","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bearcats_football","/wiki/Northeast_United_States","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Madison_Avenue","/wiki/Trophy","/wiki/New_Jersey_Sports_and_Exposition_Authority","/wiki/Meadowlands_Sports_Complex","/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football","#cite_note-trib-1","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/New_England","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/wiki/Delaware","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/West_Virginia","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Big_East_Conference_(1979%E2%80%932013)","/wiki/Big_East_Conference_(1979%E2%80%932013)","/wiki/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football","/wiki/Miami_Hurricanes_football","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bearcats_football","/wiki/Louisville_Cardinals_football","/wiki/South_Florida_Bulls_football","/wiki/West_Virginia_Mountaineers_football","/wiki/Big_12_Conference","#Lambert_Trophy_winners","#Most_Lambert_Trophies","#Lambert_Cup","#Football_Championship_Subdivision_.28Division_I-AA.29","#Most_FCS_Lambert_Cups","#Division_II","#Most_D-II_Lambert_Cups","#Division_III","#Most_D-III_Lambert_Cups","#References","/w/index.php?title=Lambert-Meadowlands_Trophy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1936_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team","/wiki/1937_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team","/wiki/Carnegie_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/Cornell_Big_Red","/wiki/Boston_College_Eagles_football","/wiki/Fordham_Rams","/wiki/Navy_Midshipmen_football","/wiki/1944_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/1945_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/1946_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football","/wiki/1948_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/1949_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/Princeton_University","/wiki/Syracuse_Orange_football","/wiki/1953_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football","/wiki/1956_Syracuse_Orangemen_football_team","/wiki/1958_Army_Cadets_football_team","/wiki/1960_Navy_Midshipmen_football_team","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/1963_Navy_Midshipmen_football_team","/wiki/Dartmouth_Big_Green","/wiki/1976_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team","/wiki/1979_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team","/wiki/1980_Pittsburgh_Panthers_football_team","/wiki/1982_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1983_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1984_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1984_Boston_College_Eagles_football_team","/wiki/1985_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1986_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1987_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1987_Syracuse_Orangemen_football_team","/wiki/1988_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1988_West_Virginia_Mountaineers_football_team","/wiki/1989_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1990_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1991_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1992_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1993_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1993_West_Virginia_Mountaineers_football_team","/wiki/1994_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1995_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football","/wiki/1996_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1997_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1998_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1999_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/1999_Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football_team","/wiki/2000_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/Miami_Hurricanes_football","/wiki/2001_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/2001_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team","/wiki/2002_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/2002_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team","/wiki/2003_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/2004_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/2005_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","/wiki/2006_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season","/wiki/2006_Louisville_Cardinals_football_team
