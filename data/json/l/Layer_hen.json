As one of the most common and widespread\n domestic animals with a population of more than 24 billion in\n 2003, according to Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds, Ed. Perrins, Christopher.\n Buffalo, N.Y.: Firefly Books, Ltd., 2003. there are more chickens in the\n world than any other species of bird. Humans keep chickens primarily as a\n source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.\n\nThe traditional poultry farming view of the domestication of the chicken is\nstated in EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (2007): \"Humans first domesticated chickens of\nIndian origin for the purpose of cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Very\nlittle formal attention was given to egg or meat production... \" Garrigus, W. P. (2007), [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-\n9111040 \"Poultry Farming\"]. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Recent genetic\nstudies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast, East, and South\nAsia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and\nAfrica originating in the Indian subcontinent. From India the domesticated fowl\nmade its way to the Persianized kingdom of Lydia in western Asia Minor, and\ndomestic fowl were imported to Greece by the fifth century BC.
