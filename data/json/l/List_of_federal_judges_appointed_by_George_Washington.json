{"cursor":"15918","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" and 28 judges to United States district courts.]] was appointed to two non-\n consecutive terms on the Supreme Court by Washington.]] President George\n Washington appointed 38 United States federal judges during his presidency, Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, passim. which\n lasted from April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797. The first group of Washington's\n appointmentsâtwo justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and ten\n district court judgesâbegan service two days after Congress passed the\n Judiciary Act of 1789 to formally establish the federal judiciary.\n Washington's last court appointee received his commission 12 days before the\n end of Washington's presidency.\n\nAs the first President, Washington was responsible for appointing the entire\nSupreme Court; he appointed a record ten Justices, including two Chief Justices\nwho were confirmed from outside the Court and one former Justice named as Chief\nJustice by a recess appointment, but not ultimately confirmed to the position.\nAdditionally, Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to\nserve, and nominated William Cushing for elevation to\nChief Justice, Marcus & Perry, p. 103. who likewise declined. Since\nthere were no sitting justices at the beginning of Washington's term, he had the\nunique opportunity to fill the entire body of federal judges with his\nselections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United\nStates district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary; at the time,\nthere were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each\ndistrict had a single judge assigned to it. Because intermediate federal\nappellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme\nCourt appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial\nappointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10%\nof the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the\njudiciary was much larger, The Biographical Directory of\nFederal Judges lists 358 judges appointed by president Reagan, with\nreappointments and elevations bringing the number to 376. and less than 5%\nof the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. The Biographical Directory of Federal Judges lists close to 800\njudges in active status, with nearly to 500 more in senior status.\n","linknr":360,"url":"List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_Washington","recorded":1375090161,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_Washington&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_Washington&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gilbert_Stuart,_George_Washington_(Lansdowne_portrait,_1796).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Gilbert_Stuart%2C_George_Washington_%28Lansdowne_portrait%2C_1796%29.jpg/220px-Gilbert_Stuart%2C_George_Washington_%28Lansdowne_portrait%2C_1796%29.jpg","/wiki/File:Gilbert_Stuart,_George_Washington_(Lansdowne_portrait,_1796).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/File:John_Rutledge_senate.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/John_Rutledge_senate.jpg/220px-John_Rutledge_senate.jpg","/wiki/File:John_Rutledge_senate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/John_Rutledge","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/United_States_federal_judge","#cite_note-fjcpassim-1","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_district_court","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789","/wiki/United_States_federal_courts","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Letters_patent","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Recess_appointment","/wiki/Robert_H._Harrison","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/William_Cushing","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-7","/wiki/U.S._state","#cite_note-fjcpassim-1","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_judicial_appointments","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices","#District_courts","#Notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_Washington&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_by_seat","/wiki/John_Blair,_Jr.","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/Samuel_Chase","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/William_Cushing","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/Oliver_Ellsworth","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Connecticut","/wiki/James_Iredell","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/John_Jay","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Thomas_Johnson_(jurist)","/wiki/Maryland","#cite_note-Oct31-10","/wiki/William_Paterson_(judge)","/wiki/New_Jersey","#cite_note-12","/wiki/John_Rutledge","/wiki/South_Carolina","/wiki/John_Rutledge","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States","/wiki/South_Carolina","#cite_note-13","/wiki/James_Wilson","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/w/index.php?title=List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_George_Washington&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:1789_Dist._Cts..JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/1789_Dist._Cts..JPG/220px-1789_Dist._Cts..JPG","/wiki/File:1789_Dist._Cts..JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Judge_Richard_Peters.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Judge_Richard_Peters.jpg/220px-Judge_Richard_Peters.jpg","/wiki/File:Judge_Richard_Peters.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Richard_Peters_(Continental_Congress)","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Gunning_Bedford,_Jr.","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Delaware","/wiki/Thomas_Bee","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_South_Carolina","/wiki/Benjamin_Bourne","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Rhode_Island","#cite_note-15","/wiki/David_Brearley","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_New_Jersey","/wiki/Nathaniel_Chipman","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Vermont","/wiki/Joseph_Clay,_Jr.","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Georgia","#cite_note-16","/wiki/William_Drayton,_Sr.","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_South_Carolina","#cite_note-Feb8-17","/wiki/James_Duane","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_New_York","/wiki/Cyrus_Griffin","/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Virginia
