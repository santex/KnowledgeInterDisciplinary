Usually,\nletters are intended for publication. In many publications, letters to the\neditor may be sent either through conventional mail or electronic mail.\n\nLetters to the editor are most frequently associated with newspapers and\nnewsmagazines. However, they are sometimes published in other periodicals (such\nas entertainment and technical magazines), and radio and television stations. In\nthe latter instance, letters are sometimes read on the air (usually, on a news\nbroadcast or on talk radio).\n\nIn academic publishing, letters to the editor of an academic journal are usually\nopen postpublication reviews of a paper, often critical of some aspect of the\noriginal paper. The authors of the original paper sometimes respond to these\nwith a letter of their own. Controversial papers in mainstream journals often\nattract numerous letters to the editor. Good citation indexing services list the\noriginal papers together with all replies. Depending on the length of the letter\nand the journal's style, other types of headings may be used, such as 'peer\ncommentary'. There are some variations on this practice. Some journals request\nopen commentaries as a matter of course, which are published together with the\noriginal paper, and any authors' reply, in a process called open peer\ncommentary. The introduction of the \"epub ahead of print\" practice in many\njournals now allows unsolicited letters to the editor (and authors' reply) to\nappear in the same print issue of the journal, as long as they are sent in the\ninterval between the electronic publication of the original paper and its\nappearance in print.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Letter_to_the_editor","recorded":1362569948,"links":22,"instances":["message"],"pdf":["http://uwp.duke.edu/wstudio/resources/documents/letter_to_editor.pdf","http://uwp.duke.edu/wstudio/resources/documents/letter_to_editor.pdf"],"categories":["Freedom of expression","Letters (message)","Newspaper content","Public opinion"],"headings":["Subject matter","History","Misrepresentation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Freeman%27s_Journal_28_January_1863_Letter_to_the_Editor_by_J._J._McCarthy_and_its_Response.png/200px-Freeman%27s_Journal_28_January_1863_Letter_to_the_Editor_by_J._J._McCarthy_and_its_Response.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["letter","message"]],"members":["letter"],"related":["Abbreviation","Letter_(message)","Publication","Mail","Electronic_mail","Newspapers","Newsmagazines","Periodical","Radio_station","Television_station","Talk_radio","Academic_publishing","Academic_journal","Postpublication_review","Citation_index","Open_peer_commentary","Electronic_article","Editorial","Cato's_Letters","Letters_from_a_Farmer_in_Pennsylvania","John_Peter_Zenger","Astroturfing","Dear_IRS","Wichita_Falls,_Texas","Shill","Paul_Reitsma","Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","Israel","Herut","Menachem_Begin","Prime_Minister_of_Israel","Open_letter","Comic_book_letter_column","Wall_Street_Journal"]}
