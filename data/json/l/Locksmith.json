{"cursor":"9032","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Locksmithing' began as the science and art of making and defeating locks. A\nlock is a mechanism that secures buildings, rooms, cabinets, objects, or other\nstorage facilities. A key is often used to open a lock. Means of opening a lock\nmay include a ''security token'' or two-factor authentication for greater\nsecurity, such as requiring both something a person knows (a combination) and\nsomething they have (a key or keycard).\n\nThe oldest known lock is approximately 4,000 years old and was of Egyptian make.\nThe earliest known key-based lock was built during the Assyrian Empire in\nKhorsabad near Nineveh about 704 BC. It may have been found in the ruins of the\nEmperor Sargon II's palace in Khorsabad . It used the same pin tumbler principle\nemployed by many modern locks. {{cite book\n| last = Phillips first = Bill year = 2005 title = The Complete Book of Locks\n| and Locksmithing location = Chicago publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional isbn\n| = 0-07-144829-2 }}\n","linknr":297,"url":"Locksmith","recorded":1362480242,"links":34,"instances":["lock_pick","process","locksmithing","lock"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Locksmithing|","Metalworking occupations"],"headings":["Terminology","History","Work","Employment","Locks","\"Full disclosure\"","Types of locks","Technical terms in locksmithing","Technical terms in lock-picking","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Mendel_I_072_v.jpg/180px-Mendel_I_072_v.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Ancient_warded_lock_key_transparent.png/100px-Ancient_warded_lock_key_transparent.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/16px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/16px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lock","device"],["key","lock"],["moulding","process"],["shear_line","locksmithing"],["slim_jim","lock_pick"],["lock","device#famous_locksmiths"]],"members":["slim_jim","moulding","lock","shear_line","key"],"related":["Lock_(device)","Key_(lock)","Security_token","Two-factor_authentication","Keycard","Egypt","Khorsabad","Emperor","Sargon_II","Khorsabad","Forge","Moulding_(process)","Electronic_lock","Full_disclosure","A._C._Hobbs","Apprenticeship","Diploma","Engineering","College","Australia","Bitting","Bolt_stump","Change_key","Key_origination","Key_code","Key_blank","Key_relevance","Maison_key_system","Master_keying","Rekey","Shear_line_(locksmithing)","Locksmith","Tubular_lock_pick","Tension_wrench","Slim_Jim_(lock_pick)","Drill_Out","Associated_Locksmiths_of_America","Access_control","Door_security","Locksport","Transponder_car_key"]}
