He also edited the scholarly\nten-volume Sherlock Holmes Reference Library, a heavily annotated edition of the\nentire Sherlock Holmes canon, and The New Annotated Dracula, an annotated\nversion of Bram Stoker's novel.

King The Grand Game, a two-volume\ncollection of classical Sherlockian scholarship, published by The Baker Street\nIrregulars, and A Study in Sherlock, a collection of stories by all-star writers\ninspired by the Sherlock Holmes tales (Random House). The first two volumes of\nThe Annotated Sandman, a four-volume edition of Neil Gaiman's award-winning The\nSandman (Vertigo) comics, for DC Comics, appeared in 2012; the balance will be\npublished in 2014. Klinger is also completing The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft\nfor W. W. Norton, a massive illustrated collection of heavily-annotated stories,\nscheduled for publication in October 2014.\n\nKlinger has also contributed introductions to numerous books of mystery and\nhorror, written book reviews for the [[Los Angeles Times]] and other\nperiodicals, and contributed an essay on vampires and sex, called Love Bites, to\n[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]. He served as a consultant on the 2009\nfilm [[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]] starring Robert Downey,\nJr. and on the sequel, [[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of\nShadows]], released in 2011.\n\nKlinger is a member of the Sherlock Holmes literary club called The Baker Street\nIrregulars, as well as numerous other Sherlockian societies. He served three\nterms as chapter president of the Southern California chapter of the Mystery\nWriters of America. He is a member of Sisters in Crime, the Horror Writers\nAssociation (and currently serves as the Treasurer of HWA), the Dracula Society,\nand the Transylvanian Society of Dracula.\n\nHe was the general editor of a number of books published by the Baker Street\nIrregulars (BSI), including the Manuscript Series, and is currently the general\neditor of the BSI's History Series. He has lectured frequently on Holmes,\nDracula, and the Victorian world and has taught a number of courses for UCLA\nExtension on Sherlock Holmes. He also taught a course on \"Dracula and His World\"\nfor UCLA Extension in November 2009.\n\nIn February 2013, Klinger filed a lawsuit against the Conan Doyle Estate, who\ndemanded a hefty license fee for the use of the Sherlock Holmes characters in a\ncollection of stories In the Company of Sherlock Holmes. The book contains no\ncontent from any copyrighted Sherlock Holmes stories, therefore Klinger is\naccusing the estate of committing copyfraud. Klinger asks the court of Illinois\nto confirm the public domain status of Sherlock Holmes in the United States,\nsince only ten of Conan Doyle's sixty stories are still under copyright and the\ndefinitive story elements (such as Holmes's bohemian habits, deductive reasoning\nand many supporting characters) were fully established in the public domain\nstories, and Klinger states that this is reason enough to allow anybody to use\nthe characters freely in new fiction.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Leslie_S._Klinger","recorded":1375072298,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Literary_editor","/wiki/Mystery_fiction","/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes","/wiki/Dracula","/wiki/The_New_Annotated_Sherlock_Holmes","/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle","/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes","#cite_note-theage-1","/wiki/Edgar_Award","/wiki/Bram_Stoker","/wiki/Dracula","/wiki/Neil_Gaiman","/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times","/wiki/Playboy_(magazine)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_(2009_film)","/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr.","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes:_A_Game_of_Shadows","/wiki/The_Baker_Street_Irregulars","/wiki/Mystery_Writers_of_America","/wiki/Sisters_in_Crime","/wiki/Horror_Writers_Association","/wiki/Dracula_Society","/wiki/Transylvanian_Society_of_Dracula","/wiki/Victorian_era","/wiki/UCLA","/wiki/UCLA","/wiki/Public_domain","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Edgar_Award","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Macavity","/wiki/Anthony_Awards","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Agatha_Award","/wiki/Quill_Award","/wiki/Edgar_Award","/wiki/Macavity_Award","/wiki/Anthony_Award","/wiki/Agatha_Award","/wiki/Bram_Stoker_Award","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley","/wiki/UC_Berkeley_School_of_Law","#cite_note-theage-1","/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Malibu,_California","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-theage_1-0","#cite_ref-theage_1-1","http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/01/26/1106415658832.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.killerfilm.com/articles/read/playboy-sucks-up-the-the-vampire-genre-13514","#cite_ref-3","http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b20240_exclusive_author_leslie_klinger_on.html","#cite_ref-4","http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204731804574388540350472998.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cozy-mystery.com/Edgar-Award-Best-Critical-Biographical.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.bouchercon.info/nominees.html#2005","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/71652881","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&oldid=566173250","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Sherlock_Holmes_scholars","/wiki/Category:American_print_editors","/wiki/Category:Lawyers_from_Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Category:People_from_Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/Category:1946_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leslie+S.+Klinger&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leslie+S.+Klinger","/wiki/Leslie_S._Klinger","/wiki/Talk:Leslie_S._Klinger","#","/wiki/Leslie_S._Klinger","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Leslie_S._Klinger","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Leslie_S._Klinger","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Leslie_S._Klinger&oldid=566173250","/w/index.php?title=Les
