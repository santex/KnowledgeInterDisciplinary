[http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/ \"Argument\", Internet Encyclopedia\nof Philosophy.\"] \"In everyday life, we often use the word \"argument\" to mean a\nverbal dispute or disagreement. This is not the way this word is usually used in\nphilosophy. However, the two uses are related. Normally, when two people\nverbally disagree with each other, each person attempts to convince the other\nthat his or her viewpoint is the right one. Unless he or she merely results to\nname calling or threats, he or she typically presents an argument for his or her\nposition, in the sense described above. In philosophy, \"arguments\" are those\nstatements a person makes in the attempt to convince someone of something, or\npresent reasons for accepting a given conclusion.\" Ralph H. Johnson,\nManifest Rationality: A pragmatic theory of argument (New Jersey: Laurence\nErlbaum, 2000), 46-49. The general structure of an argument in a natural\nlanguage is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements\nor sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion. Ralph H. Johnson,\nManifest Rationality: A pragmatic theory of argument (New Jersey: Laurence\nErlbaum, 2000), 46. The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd Ed.\nCUM, 1995 \"Argument: a sequence of statements such that some of them (the\npremises) purport to give reason to accept another of them, the conclusion\" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-\nclassical/#3 Stanford Enc. Phil., Classical Logic] The structure of some\narguments can also be set out in a formal language, and formally-defined\n\"arguments\" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math,\nlogic and computer science.\n\nIn a typical deductive argument, the premises are meant to provide a guarantee\nof the truth of the conclusion, while in an inductive argument, they are thought\nto provide reasons supporting the conclusion's probable truth. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ded-\nind/ \"Deductive and Inductive Arguments,\" Internet Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy]. The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest\non different or additional criteria than truth, for example, the persuasiveness\nof so-called \"indispensability claims\" in transcendental arguments, hCharles\nTaylor, \"The Validity of Transcendental Arguments\", Philosophical Arguments\n(Harvard, 1995), 20-33. \"[Transcendental] arguments consist of a string of what\none could call indispensability claims. They move from their starting points to\ntheir conclusions by showing that the condition stated in the conclusion is\nindispensable to the feature identified at the startâ¦ Thus we could spell out\nKant's transcendental deduction in the first edition in three stages: experience\nmust have an object, that is, be of something; for this it must be coherent; and\nto be coherent it must be shaped by the understanding through the\ncategories.\" the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the\ndisclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting. Nikolas Kompridis,\n\"World Disclosing Arguments?\" in ''Critique and Disclosure\" (Cambridge: MIT\nPress, 2006), 116-124.\n\nThe standards and criteria used in evaluating arguments and their forms of\nreasoning are studied in logic. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/\n\"Argument\", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\"] Ways of formulating\narguments effectively are studied in rhetoric (see also: argumentation theory).\nAn argument in a formal language shows the logical form of the symbolically-\nrepresented or natural language arguments obtained by its interpretations.\n","linknr":618,"url":"Logical_argument","recorded":1362554189,"links":52,"instances":["linguistics","logic","physics","logic","logic","logic","logic","philosopher"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arguments","Critical thinking","Logical consequence","Reasoning"],"headings":["Formal and informal arguments","Standard argument types","Deductive arguments","Inductive arguments","Defeasible arguments","Argument by analogy","Transitional arguments","Other kinds of arguments","Explanations and arguments","Fallacies and nonarguments","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg/20px-Logical_connectives_Hasse_diagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png/32px-Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["statement","logic"],["sentence","linguistics"],["interpretation","logic"],["corresponding_conditional","logic"],["interpretation","logic"],["tautology","logic"],["motion","physics"],["charles_taylor","philosopher"],["claim","logic"]],"members":["sentence","statement","motion","corresponding_conditional","claim","tautology","interpretation","charles_taylor"],"related":["Logic","Philosophy","Natural_language","Proposition","Statement_(logic)","Sentence_(linguistics)","Formal_language","Deductive_argument","Inductive_argument","Transcendental_arguments","Retroduction","World_disclosure","Reason","Rhetoric","Argumentation_theory","Logical_form","Interpretation_(logic)","Ordinary_language","Discourse","Formal_language","Argumentation","Entailment","Inference","Deductive_reasoning","Truth","Logical_consequence","Inductive_argument","Truthbearer","Logical_truth","Entailment","Corresponding_conditional","Entailment","Argument_form","Counter_argument","Corresponding_conditional_(logic)","Logical_truth","Interpretation_(logic)","Tautology_(logic)","Proof_procedure","Inductive_arguments","Statistical_syllogism","Inductive_inference","Cogency","Inductive_logic","Deductive_logic","Soundness","Mathematical_induction","Problem_of_induction","H.L.A._Hart","Stephen_Toulmin","Defeasible_reasoning","Epistemology","Motion_(physics)","Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)","Transcendental_arguments","Nikolas_Kompridis","World_disclosure","Michel_Foucault","World_disclosure","Ontology","Claim_(logic)","Rhetoric","Critical_thinking","Information_Systems","Logic","Abductive_reasoning","Analogy","Argument_map","Argumentation_theory","Argumentative_dialogue","Belief_bias","Boolean_logic","Deductive_reasoning","Defeasible_reasoning","Evidence","Evidence-based_policy","Fallacy","Dialectic","Formal_fallacy","Inductive_reasoning","Informal_fallacy","Inquiry","Practical_arguments","Soundness_theorem","Soundness","Truth","Validity","Robert_Audi","Vincent_F._Hendricks","Yu._Manin","Chaim_Perelman","Henri_Poincaré","Rob_Grootendorst","K._R._Popper","L._S._Stebbing","Douglas_Walton","Ronald_Loui","T._Edward_Damer","Attacking_Faulty_Reasoning"]}
