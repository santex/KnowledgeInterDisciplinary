{"cursor":"10726","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:\"Lib-Lab(s)\" redirects here. See [[Lib-Lab pact]] for UK Liberal Party-Labour\n:Party agreements and [[LibLab]] for the Norwegian think-tank.\n\nThe 'LiberalâLabour' movement refers to the practice of local Liberal\nassociations accepting and supporting candidates who were financially maintained\nby trade unions. These candidates stood for the British Parliament with the aim\nof representing the working classes, while remaining supportive of the Liberal\nParty in general.\n\nThe first 'LibâLab' candidate to stand was George Odger in the Southwark by-\nelection of 1870.The first LibâLab candidates to be elected were Alexander\nMacDonald and Thomas Burt, both members of the Miners' Federation of Great\nBritain (MFGB), in the 1874 general election. In 1880, they were joined by Henry\nBroadhurst of the Stonemasons' Union and the movement reached its peak in 1885,\nwith twelve MPs elected.\n\nThe candidates generally stood with the support of the Liberal Party, the Labour\nRepresentation League and one or more trade unions. After 1885, decline set in.\nDisillusion grew from the defeat of the Manningham Mills Strike, a series of\ndecisions restricting the activity of unions, culminating in the Taff Vale Case\nand largely unchallenged by the Liberal Party, and the foundation of the\nIndependent Labour Party in 1892 followed by its turn towards trade unionism.\n\nThe formation of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900 followed by the\nLabour Party in 1906, meant that in the House of Commons, there were two groups\nof MPs containing Trade Union sponsored MPs, sitting on either side of the\nchamber. (about 28 took the Labour whip and about 23 took the Liberal whip) The\nTrades Union Congress decided to instruct its affiliate unions to require their\nMPs to stand at the next election as Labour Party candidates and take the Labour\nwhip. Of the 23 Trade Union sponsored Liberal MPs, 15 were sponsored by unions\naffiliated to the Miners Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). When the MFGB\naffiliated to the Labour Party in 1909, most of their MPs joined Labour after\nthe January 1910 general election.\n\nThe Liberal-Labour group finally died out at the 1918 general election, when\nThomas Burt (by then Father of the House) and Arthur Richardson stood down.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Liberal-Labour_(UK)","recorded":1375075250,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Liberal-Labour_(UK)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Liberal-Labour_(UK)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liberal-Labour_(UK)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Lib-Lab_pact","/wiki/LibLab","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Trade_union","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Working_class","/wiki/George_Odger","/wiki/Southwark_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Alexander_Macdonald_(Lib-Lab_politician)","/wiki/Thomas_Burt","/wiki/Miners%27_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1874","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1880","/wiki/Henry_Broadhurst","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1885","/wiki/Labour_Representation_League","/wiki/Trade_union","/w/index.php?title=Manningham_Mills_Strike&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Taff_Vale_Case","/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party","/wiki/British_Labour_Party#Labour_Representation_Committee","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_January_1910","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918","/wiki/Father_of_the_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Arthur_Richardson_(politician)","/w/index.php?title=Liberal-Labour_(UK)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/William_Abraham_(Welsh_politician)","/wiki/Rhondda_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/South_Wales_Miners%27_Federation","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Joseph_Arch","/wiki/North_West_Norfolk_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=National_Agricultural_Labourers%27_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Joseph_Arch","/wiki/North_West_Norfolk_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=National_Agricultural_Labourers%27_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Broadhurst","/wiki/Stoke-upon-Trent_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Stonemasons_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Broadhurst","/wiki/Birmingham_Bordesley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Stonemasons_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Broadhurst","/wiki/Nottingham_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Stonemasons_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Broadhurst","/wiki/Leicester_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Stonemasons_Union&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Burns","/wiki/Battersea_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Amalgamated_Society_of_Engineers","/wiki/Thomas_Burt","/wiki/Morpeth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Northumberland_Miners%27_Association","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/William_Pollard_Byles","/wiki/Shipley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Herbert_James_Craig","/wiki/Tynemouth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Crawford_(Durham_politician)","/wiki/Mid_Durham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Durham_Miners%27_Association","/wiki/Randal_Cremer","/wiki/Haggerston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Randal_Cremer","/wiki/Haggerston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Charles_Durant","/wiki/Stepney_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Enoch_Edwards","/wiki/Hanley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Charles_Fenwick","/wiki/Wansbeck_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Northumberland_Miners%27_Association","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Frederick_Hall_(politician)","/wiki/Normanton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/William_Edwin_Harvey","/wiki/North_East_Derbyshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Miners_Federation_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/George_Howell_(trade_unionist)","/wiki/Bethnal_Green_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Operative_Bricklayers%27_Society","/wiki/John_Hagan_Jenkins","/wiki/Chatham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Associated_Shipwrights%27_Society","/wiki/John_Johnson_(British_politician)","/wiki/Gateshead_
