CERCLA authorized the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a list of such\nlocations, which are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL).\n\nThe NPL guides the EPA in \"determining which sites warrant further\ninvestigation\" for environmental remediation. As of November\n29, 2010, there were 1280 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in the\nUnited States. Sixty-two additional sites have been\nproposed for entry on the list.
