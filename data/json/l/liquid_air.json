To protect it from room temperature, it must be kept in a vacuum\ninsulated flask. Liquid air can absorb heat rapidly and revert to its gaseous\nstate. It is often used for condensing other substances into liquid and/or\nsolidifying them, and as an industrial source of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and\nother inert gases through a process called air separation. Liquid air is also\nreplacing liquid nitrogen for theatrical smoke and fog effects.\n",
