The\nfirst game in the series, [[Myst]], was released in 1993 by brothers Rand and\nRobyn Miller and their video game company Cyan, Inc. [[Riven]], the sequel to\nMyst, was released in 1997, and was followed by three more direct sequels:\n[[Myst III: Exile]] in 2001, [[Myst IV: Revelation]] in 2004, and [[Myst V: End\nof Ages]] in 2005. A spinoff featuring a multiplayer component, [[Uru: Ages\nBeyond Myst]], was released in 2003 and followed by two expansion packs.\n\nMysts story concerns an explorer named Atrus who has the ability to write books\nwhich serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This practice of creating\nlinking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose\nsociety crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an\nunnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to\nother Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new\nAge for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course\nthe civilization will follow.\n\nAfter producing award-winning games for children, the Millers decided their next\nproject would be for adults. Drawing on childhood stories, the brothers spent\nmonths designing the Ages players would investigate. The name Myst came from\nJules Verne's novel [[The Mysterious Island]]. After Riven was released, Robyn\nleft Cyan to pursue other projects and Cyan began developing Uru; developers\nPresto Studios and Ubisoft created Exile and Revelation before Cyan returned to\ncomplete the series with End of Ages. Myst and its sequels were critical and\ncommercial successes, selling more than twelve million copies; the games drove\nsales of personal computers and CD-ROM drives, as well as attracting casual\ngamers with its nonviolent gameplay. The video games' success has led to three\npublished novels in addition to soundtracks, a comic series, television and\nmovie pitches, and a feature film adaptation of the second novel, The Book of\nTi'ana, that is currently in development.\n","linknr":590,"url":"Linking_Book","recorded":1362485322,"links":21,"instances":["person","myst","comedian","programmer","publisher","apple","composer","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Myst (series)","Video game franchises","Series of books","Multimedia works"],"headings":["Story","Games","Development","Music","Adaptations","Reception and impact","Fan conventions","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Myst_logo.png/256px-Myst_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Realmyst_linking_book.png/220px-Realmyst_linking_book.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/D%27ni_Letters_Vs_Numerals.png/220px-D%27ni_Letters_Vs_Numerals.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Myst-soundtrack.png/220px-Myst-soundtrack.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Book-of-myst.png/75px-Book-of-myst.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gehn","d'ni"],["katran","myst"],["ios","apple"],["ios","apple"],["richard_a._watson","programmer"],["jack_wall","composer"],["hyperion","publisher"],["sci_fi_channel","united_states"],["peter_bergman","comedian"],["fan","person"]],"members":["fan","katran","peter_bergman","hyperion","ios","gehn","jack_wall","sci_fi_channel"],"related":["Cyan_Worlds","Presto_Studios","Ubisoft","Brøderbund","Rand_Miller","Robyn_Miller","Microsoft_Windows","Mac_OS","IPhone","Adventure_game","Rand_Miller","Robyn_Miller","Cyan_Worlds","Expansion_pack","Atrus","Jules_Verne","Presto_Studios","Ubisoft","CD-ROM","Gehn_(D'ni)","Atrus","Katran_(Myst)","Sirrus_and_Achenar","Yeesha","Saavedro","Myst","3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer","AmigaOS","CD-i","IOS_(Apple)","Atari_Jaguar_CD","Mac_OS","Nintendo_DS","PlayStation","PlayStation_Portable","Sega_Saturn","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_Mobile","Cyan_Worlds","Brøderbund","Sega_Saturn","Microsoft_Windows","Atari_Jaguar_CD","3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer","CD-i","PlayStation","AmigaOS","PlayStation_Portable","Nintendo_DS","IPhone","Point-and-click","Riven","IOS_(Apple)","Mac_OS","PlayStation","Sega_Saturn","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_Mobile","Mac_OS","Mac_OS_X","PlayStation_2","Microsoft_Windows","Xbox","Presto_Studios","Ubisoft","Microsoft_Windows","Customization_of_avatars","Massively_multiplayer_online_game","Cult_following","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","Xbox","Pre-rendering","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","Rand_Miller","Robyn_Miller","J._R._R._Tolkien","Robert_A._Heinlein","Isaac_Asimov","Jules_Verne","Mattel","Presto_Studios","Motion_capture","Richard_A._Watson_(programmer)","Leitmotif","Virgin_Records","Jack_Wall_(composer)","Peter_Gabriel","Tim_Larkin","Hyperion_(publisher)","David_Wingrove","Dark_Horse_Comics","Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_States)","Mandalay_Entertainment","Columbia_Pictures","Metacritic","Metacritic","Game_Rankings","Game_Rankings","1UP.com","Henry_Jenkins","Lev_Manovich","Women_and_video_games","Peter_Bergman_(comedian)","John_Goodman","Fan_(person)","Spokane,_Washington","Cyan_Worlds"]}
