{"cursor":"1909","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Linkage' was a policy pursued by the United States of America, championed by\nRichard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, during the 1970s period of Cold War DÃ©tente\nwhich aimed to persuade the Soviet Union and Communist China to co-operate in\nrestraining revolutions in the Third World in return for concessions in nuclear\nand economic fields. However, despite this lack of Soviet intervention, a large\nnumber of revolutions still occurred in these third world countries, thereby\nundermining this policy. The premise behind linkage, as a policy, was to connect\npolitical and military issues, thereby establishing a relationship making\nprogress in area \"A\" dependent on progress in area \"B.\"\n\nAn important aspect of this policy was that deviations from respecting the\nrights and interests would go punished. The intent of such action is to bring\nhome to the offending state the limitations of acceptable international\nbehaviour and demonstrate that attempts at expansion (and upsetting\ninternational stability) would go punished. In this way, conflict itself would\ncontribute to stabilizing the international order.\n\nThe Nixon-Kissinger approach did not link foreign and domestic arenas.\n\nSelective relaxation of tensions is an opposing policy to linkage. Then, an\nissue of arms control could be addressed and tension diminished while\nmaintaining the status quo in other strategic areas.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Linkage_(policy)","recorded":1362559710,"links":14,"instances":["kissinger"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Presidency of Richard Nixon","Soviet Union–United States relations","Cold War terminology","China–United States relations","Cold War policies","20th century in international relations"],"headings":["Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Richard_Nixon.jpg/100px-Richard_Nixon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diplomacy","kissinger"]],"members":["diplomacy"],"related":["Policy","Richard_Nixon","Henry_Kissinger","Cold_War","Détente","Soviet_Union","Communist","China","Revolutions","Third_World","Nuclear_weapon","Economics","Diplomacy_(Kissinger)"]}
