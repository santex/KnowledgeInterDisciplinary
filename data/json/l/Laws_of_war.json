The law of war is considered\nan aspect of public international law (the law of nations) and is distinguished\nfrom other bodies of law, such as the domestic law of a particular belligerent\nto a conflict, that may also provide legal limits to the conduct or\njustification of war.\n\nAmongst other issues, modern laws of war address declarations of war, acceptance\nof surrender and the treatment of prisoners of war; military necessity, along\nwith distinction and proportionality; and the prohibition of certain weapons\nthat may cause unnecessary suffering.
