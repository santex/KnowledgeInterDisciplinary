It was the\noriginal form of a capacitor (originally known as a \"condenser\").\n\nIt was invented independently by German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11\nOctober 1745 and by Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden (Leyden)\nin 1745â1746. [http://web.archive.org/web/20090326073456/http://chem.ch.huj-\ni.ac.il/history/musschenbroek.htm Biography, Pieter (Petrus) van\nMusschenbroek] The invention was named for the city.\n\nThe Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and\nits discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of electricity.\nPreviously, researchers had to resort to insulated conductors of large\ndimensions to store a charge. The Leyden jar provided a much more compact\nalternative.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Leyden_jar","recorded":1362485588,"links":43,"instances":["electricity","electricity","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf","http://www.sis.org.uk/bulletin/99/mills.pdf"],"categories":["Capacitors","Dielectrics","Dutch inventions","Energy storage","Glass jars","Historical scientific instruments"],"headings":["History","Design","Storage of the charge","Residual charge","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Early_Layden_jar.png/204px-Early_Layden_jar.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Leydenjar.png/120px-Leydenjar.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Leidse_flessen_Museum_Boerhave_december_2003_2.jpg/170px-Leidse_flessen_Museum_Boerhave_december_2003_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Leyden_jar_cutaway.png/130px-Leyden_jar_cutaway.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Dissectible_Leyden_jar.png/90px-Dissectible_Leyden_jar.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Leyden_unit_jar.png/170px-Leyden_unit_jar.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["ground","electricity"],["jar","unit"]],"members":["ground","battery","jar"],"related":["Static_electricity","Capacitor","Ewald_Georg_von_Kleist","Pieter_van_Musschenbroek","Leiden","Museum_Boerhaave","Ancient_Greeks","Amber","Triboelectric_effect","Dielectric","Otto_von_Guericke","Electrostatic_generator","Sulfur","Electric_charge","Ewald_Georg_von_Kleist","Silver","Pieter_van_Musschenbroek","University_of_Leiden","Daniel_Gralath","Battery_(electricity)","Benjamin_Franklin","Cannon","Spark-gap_transmitter","Electrotherapy","Inductance","Resistance","Radio","Capacitor","Glass","Electrode","Electrostatic_generator","Ground_(electricity)","Wire","Corona_discharge","Dielectric","Voltage","Capacitance","Vacuum","Capacitance","Jar_(unit)","Pint","Farad","Dielectric","Electric_spark","Capacitor","Corona_discharge","Soda_glass","Hygroscopic","Dielectric_absorption","Franklin_bells","Leyden_ball"]}
