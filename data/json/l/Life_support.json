{"cursor":"1633","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Life support' in medicine is a broad term that applies to any therapy used\nto sustain a patient's life while they are critically ill or injured, as\npart of intensive-care medicine. There are many therapies and techniques\nthat may be used by clinicians to achieve the goal of sustaining life. Some\nexamples include:\n* Feeding tube\n* Total parenteral nutrition\n* Mechanical ventilation\n* Heart/Lung bypass\n* Urinary catheterization\n* Dialysis\n* Cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n* Defibrillation\n* Artificial pacemaker\n* Life extension\n\nThese techniques are applied most commonly in the Emergency Department,\nIntensive Care Unit and, Operating Rooms. As various life support technologies\nhave improved and evolved they are used increasingly outside of the hospital\nenvironment. For example a patient who requires a ventilator for survival are\ncommonly discharged home with these devices. Another example includes the now\nubiquitous presence of Automated external defibrillator in public venues which\nallow lay people to deliver life support in a prehospital environment.\n\nThe ultimate goals of life support depend on the specific patient situation.\nTypically life support is used to sustain life while the underlying injury or\nillness is being treated or evaluated for prognosis. Life support techniques may\nalso be used indefinitely if the underlying medical condition cannot be\ncorrected but a reasonable quality of life can still be expected.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Life_support","recorded":1362535150,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicine"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Medicine","Intensive-care_medicine","Feeding_tube","Total_parenteral_nutrition","Mechanical_ventilation","Cardiac_pump","Urinary_catheterization","Dialysis","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Defibrillation","Artificial_pacemaker","Life_extension","Emergency_Department","Intensive_Care_Unit","Operating_Room","Automated_external_defibrillator"]}
