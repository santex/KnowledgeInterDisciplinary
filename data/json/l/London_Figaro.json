It was founded as a daily\npaper in 1870 with the backing of Napoleon III but after a year re-established\nitself as a general interest weekly magazine and is chiefly remembered nowadays\nfor its highly independent drama criticism.\n\nThe first issue was published by James Mortimer on May 17, 1870 from a small\nshop at 199 Strand. It was initially a daily periodical and continued to be\npublished daily until March 18, 1871. At this point it changed format from a\nnewspaper to a weekly magazine owing to the withdrawal of its financial support\nas a result of French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nAmong those who contributed to it were William Archer (writing as Almaviva,\ndrama critic), Ernest Bendall, Faustin Betbeder (Faustin, caricaturist), Percy\nBetts (Cherubino, musical critic), Ambrose Bierce (Passing Showman, Town\nCrier), Edward Bradley (Cuthbert Bede), Aglen Dowty (Young and Happy Husband,\nOPQ Philander Smiff), John Baker Hopkins, Frank Marshall, Edwin Milliken,\nClement Scott (Almaviva, drama critic), and Edward Blanchard (drama critic).\nMortimer was a chess master and so the Figaro had a chess column, which from\n1872 until 1876 was contributed by Johann LÃ¶wenthal and from 1876 to 1882 by\nWilhelm Steinitz.\n\nThe magazine became very popular during the mid-1870s and for several years was\npublished twice a week. Mortimer was very supportive of his writers and in\nparticular strove to shield the identities of his drama critics, Clement Scott,\nand later William Archer, both of whom wrote under the pseudonym, Almaviva.\nMortimer suffered much personal abuse from actors and promoters as a result.\n\nIn 1879 Mortimer was the defendant in a libel case brought against him by\nWilliam Henry Weldon as a result of the serial which the Figaro had run on the\ntopic of Georgina Weldon, his wife, who claimed that she had been unjustly\nconfined under the lunacy laws of the time. Owing to a combination of misfortune\nand bad decisions Mortimer lost the case and was sentenced to three months in\nprison and a heavy fine.\n\nIn 1882 Mortimer sold the Figaro. Writing in Journalistic London later in the\nyear, Joseph Hatton, said, :The Figaro once prospered exceedingly. Its founder,\nMr. James Mortimer, an American with a French training in journalism, first\nintroduced it to London as a daily paper. He was unfortunate in challenging\nattention for a light, chatty, and serio-comic treatment of current news and\nliterature at a time when the public mind was excited with the tragedies of a\ngreat war. Otherwise the daily Figaro might possibly have been alive now. A\nweekly edition reached an enormous circulation. Its chief leader-writer was Mr.\nJohn Baker Hopkins, a journalist who for many years was associated with The Law\nJournal. Mr. Hopkins is the author of \" Nihilism ; or, The Terror Unmasked,\" and\nseveral works of fiction. \"The Smiff Papers \" did much to extend the circulation\nof The Figaro, as did also the dramatic criticisms signed \"Alma Viva.\" Mr.\nDoughty was the author of the first mentioned feature, Mr. Clement Scott of the\nsecond. Recently the paper has been taken over by a limited liability company,\nand Mr. Mortimer appears to be giving more attention to play-writing than to\njournalism.\n\nThe magazine continued in publication for another 15 years. By the late 1890s\nhowever it had lost a lot of its readership and at a shareholders' Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting in December 1897, it was agreed to wind it up.\n","linknr":90,"url":"London_Figaro","recorded":1375054422,"links":["/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Figaro_in_London","/wiki/Napoleon_III","/wiki/James_Mortimer","/wiki/Strand,_London","/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War","/wiki/William_Archer_(critic)","/wiki/Faustin_Betbeder","/wiki/Ambrose_Bierce","/wiki/Edward_Bradley_(writer)","/wiki/Francis_Albert_Marshall","/wiki/Clement_Scott","/wiki/Johann_L%C3%B6wenthal","/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz","/wiki/William_Weldon_(officer_of_arms)","/wiki/Georgina_Weldon","/wiki/Lunacy_Act_1845","/wiki/Joseph_Hatton","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=edit&section=1","http://books.google.com/books?id=9GZMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA467&dq=%22london+figaro%22+napoleon&as_brr=3&ei=j3tfStazGpSuzQT4yYHHBQ","http://www.archive.org/stream/empresseugeniehe00leggiala/empresseugeniehe00leggiala_djvu.txt","http://books.google.com/books?id=q9IOAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=figaro&f=false","http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/issues/26928/pages/188/page.pdf","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&oldid=505266273","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_magazines_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=London+Figaro&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=London+Figaro","/wiki/London_Figaro","/wiki/Talk:London_Figaro","#","/wiki/London_Figaro","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/London_Figaro","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/London_Figaro","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&oldid=505266273","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6670370","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=London_Figaro&id=505266273","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=London+Figaro","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=London+Figaro&oldid=505266273&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=London_Figaro&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6670370#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Figaro","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["officer_of_arms","writer","critic"],"pdf":["http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/issues/26928/pages/188/page.pdf"],"categories":["Defunct
