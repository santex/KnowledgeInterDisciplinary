The modern traveller can be expected to\nhave packages containing clothing, toiletries, small possessions, trip\nnecessities, and on the return-trip, souvenirs. For some, luggage and the style\nthereof is representative of the owner's wealth.\n\nBaggage (not luggage), or baggage train, can also refer to the train of people\nand goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-\nmodern armies on campaign.\n","linknr":427,"url":"Luggage","recorded":1362563015,"links":49,"instances":["furniture","luggage","vehicle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Luggage"],"headings":["Overview","Etymology","Types of luggage","Luggage features","Hold luggage","Hand luggage (carry-on)","Baggage claim/reclaim","Left luggage","Luggage forwarding","Military baggage","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Trunk_1.jpg/220px-Trunk_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Suitcases-1.jpg/220px-Suitcases-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Carpetbag.jpg/220px-Carpetbag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Luggage_compartments_Airbus.JPG/220px-Luggage_compartments_Airbus.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Wikivoyage_favicon.svg/16px-Wikivoyage_favicon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chest","furniture"],["trunk","luggage"],["trunk","luggage"],["coach","vehicle"]],"members":["chest","trunk","coach"],"related":["Travel","Transport","Tourist","Clothing","Souvenir","Fashion","Wealth","Chest_(furniture)","Trunk_(luggage)","Second_World_War","Suitcase","Passenger","Baggage_handler","Ata_300","Trunk_(luggage)","Louis_Vuitton","Goyard","Moynat","M._M._Secor","Suitcase","Holdall","Tote_bag","Duffel_bag","Carpet_bag","Travel_Sentry","Transportation_Security_Administration","Rollaboard","Vehicle","Coach_(vehicle)","Fixed-wing_aircraft","Baggage_handler","Airbus_340-600","Economy_class","North_America","Railroad_car","Baggage_claim","Baggage_carousel","Lost_luggage","Baggage_cart","September_11_attacks","Luggage_Forward","Luggage_Free","Rear_guard","Rearguard","Battle_of_Agincourt","Luggage_scale","Luggage_lock","Okoban","Suitcase","Transportation_Security_Administration","Emotional_baggage"]}
