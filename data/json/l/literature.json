(from Latin litterae (plural); letter) is the art of written work.\nThe word literature literally means \"things made from letters.\" Literature is\ncommonly classified as having two major forms—fiction & non-fiction—and two\nmajor techniques—poetry and prose.\n\nLiterature may consist of texts based on factual information (journalistic or\nnon-fiction), a category that may also include polemical works, biography, and\nreflective essays, or it may consist of texts based on imagination (such as\nfiction, poetry, or drama). Literature written in poetry emphasizes the\naesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound, symbolism, and\nmetre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, ordinary meanings, while\nliterature written in prose applies ordinary grammatical structure and the\nnatural flow of speech. Literature can also be classified according to\nhistorical periods, genres, and political influences. While the concept of genre\nhas broadened over the centuries, in general, a genre consists of artistic works\nthat fall within a certain central theme; examples of genre include romance,\nmystery, crime, fantasy, erotica, and adventure, among others.\n\nImportant historical periods in English literature include Old English, Middle\nEnglish, the Renaissance, the Elizabethan era of the 16th century (which\nincludes the Shakespearean era), the 17th Century Restoration period, the 18th\ncentury Age of Enlightenment, the Romanticism of the early 19th century, the\nlater 19th Century Victorian, and 20th Century Modernism and Post-modernism.\nImportant intellectual movements that have influenced the study of literature\ninclude feminism, post-colonialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, post-\nmodernism, romanticism, and Marxism.\n","title":"literature","headings":["History","Poetry","Essays","Other prose literature","Drama","Oral literature","Other narrative
