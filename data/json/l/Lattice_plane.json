{"cursor":"1264","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In crystallography, a 'lattice plane' of a given Bravais lattice is a plane (or\nfamily of parallel planes) whose intersections with the lattice (or any\ncrystalline structure of that lattice) are periodic (i.e. are described by 2d\nBravais lattices) and intersect the Bravais lattice; equivalently, a lattice\nplane is any plane containing at least three noncollinear Bravais lattice\npoints. Neil W. Ashcroft and N. David Mermin, Solid State Physics\n(Harcourt: New York, 1976). All lattice planes can be described by a set\nof integer Miller indices, and vice versa (all integer Miller indices define\nlattice planes).\n\nConversely, planes that are not lattice planes have aperiodic intersections with\nthe lattice called quasicrystals; this is known as a \"cut-and-project\"\nconstruction of a quasicrystal (and is typically also generalized to higher\ndimensions).
