The award\nis given annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and\nSciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States\nthat contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Best\nForeign Language Film category was not created until 1956; however, between 1947\nand 1955, the Academy presented a non-competitive Honorary Award for the best\nforeign language films released in the United States.\n\nThe Film Federation of India (FFI) appoints a committee to choose one film among\nthose released that year to be submitted as India's official entry to the Oscars\nfor a nomination for Best Foreign Film the following year.\nThe chosen films, along with their English subtitles, are sent to the Academy,\nwhere they are screened for the jury. The 1957 Hindi\nfilm [[Mother India]] was India's first submission. The film made it to the\nfinal shortlist and was nominated alongside four other films in the\ncategory. It came close to winning the Academy Award\nbut lost to [[Nights of Cabiria]] by a single vote. Since 1984, India has not submitted a film on only one occasion; in\n2003, the FFI controversially chose not make an entry as they felt no film would\nbe in a position to compete with films from other nations.\nAs of 2013, only three Indian filmsâMother India, [[Lagaan]]and [[Salaam\nBombay!]]âhave been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language\nFilm. In 2011, the jury of the 58th National Film Awards made a\nrecommendation that movies winning Best Film at the annual National Film Awards\nshould be the official entry. However, in\n2013, [[Barfi!]] was chosen ahead of the 2012 \"Best Film\" winner\n[[Deool]].\n","linknr":637,"url":"List_of_Indian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","recorded":1375073036,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Indian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Indian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_lists","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/14px-Cscr-featured.svg.png","/wiki/File:SatyajitRay.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/63/SatyajitRay.jpg/220px-SatyajitRay.jpg","/wiki/File:SatyajitRay.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Satyajit_Ray","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Feature_length","#cite_note-Rules-2","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","#cite_note-academy-3","/wiki/Film_Federation_of_India","/wiki/Academy_Award","#cite_note-2011nom-4","#cite_note-Ind_express-5","/wiki/Mother_India","#cite_note-30th_Oscars-6","/wiki/Nights_of_Cabiria","#cite_note-Thaindian_1-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Lagaan","/wiki/Salaam_Bombay!","#cite_note-10","/wiki/58th_National_Film_Awards","/wiki/National_Film_Award_for_Best_Feature_Film","/wiki/National_Film_Awards","#cite_note-2011nom-4","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Barfi!","/wiki/Deool","#cite_note-12","#Submissions","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Indian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Tamil_language","/wiki/Bengali_language","/wiki/Marathi_language","/wiki/Malayalam_language","/wiki/Telugu_language","/wiki/Tamil_people","/wiki/Kamal_Haasan","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-Heyram-14","/wiki/Bengali_people","/wiki/Satyajit_Ray","/wiki/30th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Mother_India","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Mehboob_Khan","#cite_note-15","/wiki/31st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Madhumati","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Bimal_Roy","/wiki/32nd_Academy_Awards","/wiki/The_World_of_Apu","/wiki/Bengali_language","/wiki/Satyajit_Ray","/wiki/35th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Sahib_Bibi_Aur_Ghulam","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Urdu_language","/wiki/Abrar_Alvi","/wiki/36th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/The_Big_City_(1963_film)","/wiki/Bengali_language","/wiki/Satyajit_Ray","/wiki/38th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Guide_(film)","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Vijay_Anand_(Hindi_film_maker)","/wiki/39th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Amrapali_(film)","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Lekh_Tandon","/wiki/40th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Aakhri_Khat","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Chetan_Anand_(director)","/wiki/41st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Majhli_Didi","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Hrishikesh_Mukherjee","/wiki/42nd_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Deiva_Magan_(1969_film)","/wiki/Tamil_language","/wiki/A._C._Tirulokchandar","/wiki/44th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Reshma_Aur_Shera","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Sunil_Dutt","/wiki/45th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Uphaar","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Sudhendu_Roy","/wiki/46th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Saudagar_(1973_film)","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Sudhendu_Roy","/wiki/47th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Garm_Hava","/wiki/Urdu_language","/wiki/M._S._Sathyu","/wiki/50th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Manthan","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Shyam_Benegal","/wiki/51st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Shatranj_Ke_Khilari","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Urdu_language","/wiki/Satyajit_Ray","/wiki/53rd_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Payal_Ki_Jhankaar","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Satyen_Bose_(director)","/wiki/57th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Saaransh","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Mahesh_Bhatt","/wiki/58th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Saagar","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Ramesh_Sippy","/wiki/59th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Swati_Mutyam","/wiki/Telugu_language","/wiki/Kasinadhuni_Viswanath","/wiki/60th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Nayakan_(1987_film)","/wiki/Tamil_language","/wiki/Mani_Ratnam","/wiki/61st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Salaam_Bombay!","/wiki/Hindi_language","/wiki/Mira_Nair","#cite_note-17","/wiki/62nd_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Parinda","/wiki/Hind
