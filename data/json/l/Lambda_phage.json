This virus is temperate and may reside within the genome of its host\nthrough lysogeny.\n\nLambda phage consists of a virus particle including a head (also known as a\ncapsid), a tail, and tail fibers. The head contains the phage's double-stranded\ncircular DNA genome. The phage particle recognizes and binds to its host,\n[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], causing DNA in the head of the phage to be ejected\nthrough the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Usually, a \"lytic\ncycle\" ensues, where the lambda DNA is replicated many times and the genes for\nhead, tail and lysis proteins are expressed. This leads to assembly of multiple\nnew phage particles within the cell and subsequent cell lysis, releasing the\ncell contents, including virions that have been assembled, into the environment.\nHowever, under certain conditions the phage DNA may integrate itself into the\nhost cell chromosome in the lysogenic pathway. In this state, the Î» DNA is\ncalled a prophage and stays resident within the host's genome without apparent\nharm to the host. The host can be termed a lysogen when a prophage is present.\n","linknr":418,"url":"Lambda_phage","recorded":1362481865,"links":31,"instances":["biochemistry","virology","biology","genetics","genetics","protein","scientist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caudovirales","Model organisms"],"headings":["Discovery","Anatomy","Lifecycle","Genome structure","Lytic or lysogenic?","Lambda as a genetic tool","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/LambdaPlaques.jpg/300px-LambdaPlaques.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Phage_lambda_virion.svg/250px-Phage_lambda_virion.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Bacteriophage_lambda_genome.png/220px-Bacteriophage_lambda_genome.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Bacteriophage_lambda_genome_insertion.png/220px-Bacteriophage_lambda_genome_insertion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["temperate","virology"],["porin","protein"],["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["transduction","genetics"],["nancy_hopkins","scientist"]],"members":["cofactor","temperate","promoter","transduction","transcription","porin","nancy_hopkins"],"related":["Bacteriophage","Temperate_(virology)","Genome","Lysogeny","Capsid","DNA","Lytic_cycle","Lysis","Lysogenic","Prophage","Genome","Lysogen","Esther_Lederberg","Viral_plaque","Model_organism","Microbial_genetics","Molecular_genetics","Recombinant_DNA","Gateway_Technology","Operon","Recombineering","Porin_(protein)","Maltose","DNA_ligase","DNA_gyrase","Supercoil","Promoter_(biology)","Antiterminator","RNA_polymerase","Multiplicity_of_infection","Endolysin","Theta_structure","Concatemer","Pribnow_box","Starvation","Poisons","Antibiotics","Genetic_recombination","Holliday_junction","Site-specific_recombination","SOS_response","SOS_response","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA_repair","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Excisionase","Repressor","Barbara_J._Meyer","HHMI","CI_protein","Cooperativity","Transduction_(genetics)","Molecular_weight_size_marker","Mark_Ptashne","Nancy_Hopkins_(scientist)","American_Society_for_Microbiology"]}
