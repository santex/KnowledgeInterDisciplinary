{"cursor":"3635","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lao [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]' were first uncovered in 1970 at a construction\nsite at kilometer 3, Thadeua Road in the Vientiane area, Mekong Valley, Laos.\nConstruction was halted only temporarily, and the kiln was hastily and\nunprofessionally excavated over a one-month period. At least four more kilns\nhave been identified since then, and surface evidence and topography indicate at\nleast one hundred more in the Ban Tao Hai (Village of the Jar Kilns) vicinity.\nArchaeologists have labeled the area Sisattanak Kiln Site.\n\nAccording to Honda and Shimozu (The Beauty of Fired Clay: Ceramics from Burma,\nCambodia, Laos, and Thailand, 1997), the Lao kilns are similar to the Siamese\ntypes found at Suphanburi and Si Satchanalai. But Hein, Barbetti and\nSayavongkhamdy (An Excavation at the Sisattanak Kiln Site, Vientiane, Lao\nP.D.R., 1989, 1992) say that the Lao kilns, which are of a cross-draft clay-slab\ntype, differ substantially not only from the Siamese types but all other types\nin Southeast Asia.\n\nBecause only one kiln, VS8, has been excavated, almost no questions regarding\nLao ceramic tradition have been answered. The VS8 kiln though showed no evidence\nof brick construction. It had square chimney foundations, a narrow firebox, and\nwas built partly above ground.\n\nThe Sisattanak Kiln Site lies just outside Vientiane's first city walls, which\nare dated to the 15th century. Radiocarbon dating of the kiln gives a 15th-17th\ncentury timeframe, with an earlier period of that range most likely. This is\nsupported by the evidence of surface finds, which suggest that area kilns at\nhigher elevations show a greater ratio of glazed to unglazed wares. The theory\nis that the kilns were moved up over time and that more glazed wares were fired\nover time. This is supported by the ceramics uncovered at VS8, a lower-elevation\nsite, which were all of a utilitarian and domestic nature. They included pipes,\ndomestic wares and architectural fittings.\n\nThe VS8 excavation uncovered both unglazed and glazed wares. Most of the glazed\nwares were pipes; 1,500 pipe fragments and complete pieces were collected. Their\nquality indicates a well-developed tradition, and their motifs suggest the\npossibility that they were export wares.\n\nFrom the examples collected to date, it can be said that Lao ceramics used one\nkind of clay, with 5% quartz added as a temper. Both the clay and the quartz\nwere finely crushed. The glazed wares were a light, translucent green (like\nceladon) or various shades of brown. There have also been shards showing an olive-\ncolored glaze, not unlike the type found in Thailand.\n\nMany of the glazed wares have ribbed or fluted exteriors, similar to that of the\nsilver bowls ubiquitous in Laos, both the regular silver bowls (\"oh tum\") and\nthe silver stem bowls (\"khan\"). Glazed ceramic stem bowls have been collected as\nsurface finds at the Sisattanak Kiln Site. Decorations to glazed wares show a\ngreat measure of restraint, with simple incisions, stamps and fluting. Unglazed\nwares are similarly austere. They are generally not decorated with incisions or\nstamps, which are common in other Southeast Asian wares.\n\nThe VS8 excavation in 1989 added to an ever-increasing body of evidence that Lao\nceramic tradition is significant. Future excavations are expected to prove that\nLao ceramic production was comparable to that of other countries in the region.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Lao_ceramics","recorded":1375075299,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ceramics_(art)","/wiki/Vientiane","/wiki/Mekong_Valley","/wiki/Laos","/wiki/Kiln","/w/index.php?title=Sisattanak_Kiln_Site&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Burma","/wiki/Cambodia","/wiki/Laos","/wiki/Thailand","/wiki/Suphanburi","/wiki/Si_Satchanalai","/wiki/Quartz","/wiki/Celadon","/wiki/Thailand","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=edit&section=1","http://www.laos.culturalprofiles.net","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&oldid=372215843","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Pottery","/wiki/Category:Laotian_art","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lao+ceramics&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lao+ceramics","/wiki/Lao_ceramics","/wiki/Talk:Lao_ceramics","#","/wiki/Lao_ceramics","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lao_ceramics","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lao_ceramics","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&oldid=372215843","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6487823","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lao_ceramics&id=372215843","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lao+ceramics","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lao+ceramics&oldid=372215843&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lao_ceramics&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6487823#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_ceramics","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pottery","Laotian art|Ceramics"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vientiane","Mekong_Valley","Laos","Kiln","Sisattanak_Kiln_Site","Burma","Cambodia","Laos","Thailand","Suphanburi","Si_Satchanalai","Quartz","Celadon","Thailand"]}
