Its meaning is variable, though it may derive\nfrom the Norman French adjective, large (meaning \"generous\" or \"big\" [as in,\n\"that's big of you\", meaning generous, as well as large in size]), as it is\nfound in the surname \"le Large\" in English records dating back as far as the\n13th century. Harrison's work on English surnames gives the following: \"LARGE\n(adjectival: French, Latin) BIG; GENEROUS [Middle English Old French large;\nLatin larg-us, -a, [meaning] abundant, liberal]\" Some examples of large are but\nnot limited to, Robert Kirker.\n\nHe gives an early citation for the name: Austin Belz from the Hundred Rolls, a\nreference dating to 1273.\n\nHe also provides a quotation showing the word in its older sense of generous,\nfull, liberal or ample in its literary context:\n\nSo'large' of yift [gift] and free was she (from Chaucer's Romance of the\nRose I168)\n\nAnother variant surname, \"de Large\", appears to be continental European rather\nthan English in origin.\n\nHenry Brougham Guppy's survey circa 1881, based on local British directories,\nplaces Large as a surname local to North Wiltshire, and considers it to have\nparticular prevalence among yeoman farmers.(Guppy, 1890)\n\nAccording to the International Genealogical Index, the surname is also found in\nmany other English counties; in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and other English\nlanguage countries; in France and Germany, and, more rarely, in the Scandinavian\ncountries. Large is also found in Latin America countries such as Colombia where\nall families surnamed Large are related.\n\nPeople with the name Large, or one of its variants, include:\n","title":"large","headings":["People","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: England","1: Surname","1: Norman_French","1: Geoffrey_Chaucer","1: Continental_European","1: Henry_Brougham_Guppy","1: Wiltshire","1: Yeoman_farmer","1: International_Genealogical_Index","1: Ireland","1: Scotland","1: Wales","1: English_language","1: France","1: Germany","1: Scandinavian_countries","1: Colombia","1: Andrew_Large","1: Bonnie_Large","1: Brian_Large","1: Lofty_Large","1: Eddie_Large","1: John_Large","1: Josaphat-Robert_Large","1: Robert_Large","1: William_Caxton","1: Storm_Large","1: Robert_\"Large\"_Kirker","1: Robert_C._De_Large"]}
