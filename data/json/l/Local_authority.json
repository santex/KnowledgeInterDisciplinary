{"cursor":"60391","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Local government' is a form of public administration which in a majority of\ncontexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The\nterm is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as\nthe central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal\ngovernment and also to supranational government which deals with governing\ninstitutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers\ndelegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of\ngovernment. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third\n(or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local\ngovernment usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with\ngreater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.\n\nThe question of municipal autonomy is a key question of public administration\nand governance. The institutions of local government vary greatly between\ncountries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often\nvaries. Common names for local government entities include state, province,\nregion, department, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough,\nparish, municipality, shire and village.\n","linknr":657,"url":"Local_authority","recorded":1362570624,"links":32,"instances":["england","israel","palestinian_authority","subnational_entity","lithuania","israel","england","palestinian_authority","polity","israel","wales","finland","israel","administrative_title","northern_ireland"],"pdf":["http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf"],"categories":["Local
