'Foliage' is a mass noun that refers to leaves as a feature\n of plants.<ref>Haupt, Arthur Wing, Plant morphology. Publisher: McGraw-Hill\n 1953.

Furthermore, several structures\nfound in vascular plants look like leaves but are not actually leaves; they\ndiffer from leaves in their structures and origins. Examples include phyllodes,\ncladodes, and phylloclades.<ref name= Maus/>\n","title":"Leaf","headings":["General nature of leaves","Large-scale features (leaf morphology)","Anatomy","Seasonal leaf loss","Morphology","Terminology","Adaptations","Interactions with other organisms","Bibliography","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Microphyll","4: Trichome","3: Plant","3: Fern","2: Photosynthesis","2: Bulb","2: Light","2: Transpiration","2: Phytolith","2: Lignin","2: Tannin","2: Flowering_plant","2: Stipule","2: Xylem","2: Phloem","2: Vascular_tissue","2: Xanthophyll","2: Monocotyledon","2: Poaceae","2: Phyllode","2: Dicotyledon","2: Bract","2: Petal","1: Voxel","1: Vascular_plant","1: Botany","1: Plant_morphology","1: Mass_noun","1: Succulent_plant","1: Pinophyta","1: Cataphyll","1: Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","1: Cotyledon","1: Lichen","1: Cladode","1: Phylloclade","1: Pendent","1: Willow","1: Organelles","1: Chloroplast","1: Carbon_dioxide","1: Stomata","1: Oxygen","1: Water_vapour","1: Atmosphere","1: Ultraviolet","1: Xerophyte","1: Flux","1: Light_intensity","1: Window_plants","1: Fenestraria","1: Haworthia","1: Haworthia_truncata","1: Bulbine","1: Isobilateral","1: Dorsiventral","1: Guttation","1: Food","1: Water","1: Protein","1: Minerals","1: Sugars","1: Animal","1: Human","1: Leaf_vegetable","1: Staple_food","1: Poison","1: Deciduous#Botany","1: Bryophyte","1: Moss","1: Marchantiophyta","1: Non-vascular_plant","1: Devonian_period","1: Lycophytes","1: Gymnosperm","1: Angiosperm","1: Glossary_of_botanical_terms#A","1: Bud","1: Stoma","1: Metabolism","1: Plant_cuticle","1: Monocot","1: Dicot","1: Capillary_action","1: Green","1: Chlorophyll","1: Plastid","1: Carotene","1: Venation","1: Pattern_formation","1: Tensor_field","1: Vascular_bundle","1: Sap","1: Temperate","1: Boreal_ecosystem","1: Deciduous","1: Abscission","1: Autumn_leaf_color","1: Yellow","1: Red","1: Carotenoid","1: Sunlight","1: Anthocyanin","1: Aphids","1: Species","1: Terminology","1: Fronds","1: Conifer","1: Lycopodiophyta","1: Phyllotaxis","1: Decussate","1: Helix","1: Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","1: Fibonacci_sequence","1: Golden_angle","1: Numerator","1: Leaflet","1: Fabaceae","1: Frond","1: Rachis","1: Rose","1: Bean","1: Ochrea","1: Rhubarb","1: Melastomataceae","1: Divergence","1: Maple","1: Plesiomorph","1: Seed_plant","1: Autapomorph","1: Melanthiaceae","1: Beech","1: Chestnut","1: Elm","1: Oak","1: Nettle","1: Holly","1: Thistle","1: Glaucous","1: Microorganisms","1: Phyllosphere","1: Evolution","1: Boundary_layer","1: Wax","1: Succulent","1: CAM_photosynthesis","1: Aromatic_oil","1: Poisons","1: Pheromones","1: Eucalypts","1: Silica","1: Grass","1: Raphides","1: Araceae","1: Cacti","1: Carnivorous_plant","1: Onion","1: Tendril","1: Pea","1: Pseudanthium","1: Spurge","1: Spathe","1: Tettigoniidae","1: Folivore","1: Crypsis","1: Tortricidae","1: Pamphiliidae","1: Attelabidae","1: Mimicry","1: Katydid","1: Ghillean_Tolmie_Prance","1: London","1: Evolution_of_leaves","1: Leaf_Area_Index","1: Leaf_protein_concentrate","1: Leaf_sensor","1: Vernation"]}
