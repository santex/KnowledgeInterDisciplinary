Voting took place in 649 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom\ngeneral election on 6 May 2010. In the remaining constituency, Thirsk and\nMalton, voting was postponed until 27 May due to the death of a\ncandidate.\n\nThe number of seats rose from 646 at the 2005 general election after proposals\nmade by the Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were\nadopted through statutory\ninstruments. Constituencies in\nScotland remained unchanged, with the Boundary Commission for Scotland having\ncompleted a review shortly prior to the 2005 general election.\n\nPrimary legislation provides for the independence of the Boundary Commissions\nfor each of the four parts of the UK, the number of seats for each of the\ncountries, permissible factors to use in departing from any old boundaries and a\nstrong duty to consult. For the 2013 review this is primarily the Parliamentary\nVoting System and Constituencies Act 2011. The Sainte-LaguÃ« formula method is\nused to form groups of seats split between the four parts of the United Kingdom\nand the English Regions (as defined by EU Parliament Elections).
