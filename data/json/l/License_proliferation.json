{"cursor":"7209","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'License proliferation' refers to the problems created when additional software\nlicenses are written for software packages. License proliferation affects the\nfree software community. Often when a software developer would like to merge\nportions of different software programs they are unable to do so because the\nlicenses are incompatible. When software under two different licenses can be\ncombined into a larger software work, the licenses are said to be compatible. As\nthe number of licenses increases, the probability that a Free and open source\nsoftware (FOSS) developer will want to merge software together that are\navailable under incompatible licenses increases. There is also a greater cost to\ncompanies that wish to evaluate every FOSS license for software packages that\nthey use. Strictly speaking no one is in favor of license proliferation. Rather\nthe issue stems from the tendency for organizations to write new licenses in\norder to address real or perceived needs for their software releases.\n","linknr":293,"url":"License_proliferation","recorded":1362560229,"links":24,"instances":["installation","attorney"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Free and open-source software licenses|Proliferation","Free software"],"headings":["Compatible licenses","Vanity licenses","Google's stance","OSI's stance","FSF's stance","FSFE's stance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["software_package","installation"],["lawrence_rosen","attorney"]],"members":["software_package","lawrence_rosen"],"related":["Software_license","Software_package_(installation)","Free_software_community","License_compatibility","Free_and_open_source_software","Free_Software_Foundation","GNU_General_Public_License","Apache_License","Apache_Foundation","David_A._Wheeler","Google_Code","Apache_License","Artistic_License","GNU_General_Public_License","Perl","GNU_General_Public_License","GNU_General_Public_License","GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License","MIT_License","BSD_License","Mozilla_Public_License","Eclipse_Public_License","Open_Source_Initiative","Richard_Stallman","Bradley_M._Kuhn","Ciar√°n_O'Riordan","License_compatibility","Lawrence_Rosen_(attorney)","Eric_S._Raymond"]}
