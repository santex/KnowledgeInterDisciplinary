[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=inanimate Definition of\n  inanimate.] WordNet Search by Princeton University. Biology\n  is the science concerned with the study of life.\n\nAny contiguous living system is called an organism. Organisms undergo\nmetabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to\nstimuli, reproduce and, through natural selection, adapt to their environment in\nsuccessive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through\nvarious means. A diverse array of\nliving organisms can be found in the biosphere of Earth, and the properties\ncommon to these organismsâplants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and\nbacteriaâare a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization\nand heritable genetic information.\n\nScientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth approximately\n3.5 billion years ago. In a National Institutes of Health study,\nthe authors hypothesize that if biological complexity increased exponentially\nduring evolution, life in the universe may have begun \"10 billion years ago\" - more than 5 billion years before the Earth existed.\nNonetheless, the mechanism by which life emerged on Earth is unknown although\nmany hypotheses have been formulated. Since then, life has evolved into a wide\nvariety of forms, which biologists have classified into a hierarchy of taxa.\nLife can survive and thrive in a wide range of conditions. The meaning of\nlifeâits significance, origin, purpose, and ultimate fateâis a central concept\nand question in philosophy and religion. Both philosophy and religion have\noffered interpretations as to how life relates to existence and consciousness,\nand on related issues such as life stance, purpose, conception of a god or gods,\na soul or an afterlife. Different cultures throughout history have had widely\nvarying approaches to these issues.\n\nThough the existence of life is only confirmed on Earth, many scientists believe\nextraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable. Other planets and\nmoons in the Solar System have been examined for evidence of having once\nsupported simple life, and projects such as SETI have attempted to detect\ntransmissions from possible alien civilizations. According to the panspermia\nhypothesis, life on Earth may have originated from meteorites that spread\norganic molecules or simple life that first evolved elsewhere.\n","linknr":1795,"url":"Life_on_Earth","recorded":1362506362,"links":166,"instances":["biology","biology","spirit","number","planet","biology","ecology","biology","cell_biology","geology","physiology","chemistry","biology","chemistry","biology","biology","biology","theoretical_biologist","biophysical","statistical_mechanics"],"pdf":["http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFDirectedPanspermia3JBIS1997Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFDirectedPanspermia3JBIS1997Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/7r10hqn3rp1g1vag/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/7r10hqn3rp1g1vag/fulltext.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf","http://www.etsu.edu/physics/lutter/courses/astr1020/a1020chap12.pdf","http://www.etsu.edu/physics/lutter/courses/astr1020/a1020chap12.pdf","http://www.etsu.edu/physics/lutter/courses/phys2028/p2028exobnotes.pdf","http://www.etsu.edu/physics/lutter/courses/phys2028/p2028exobnotes.pdf","http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf","http://www.jbsdonline.com/mc_images/category/4317/21-trifonov-jbsd_29_4_2012.pdf","http://media.egu2012.eu/media/filer_public/2012/04/05/10_solarsystem_devera.pdf","http://media.egu2012.eu/media/filer_public/2012/04/05/10_solarsystem_devera.pdf","https://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~db45/Studiendekanat/Lehre/Master/Module/Botanik_1/M1401/Evolution_Zellbiologie/Lintilhac%202003.pdf","https://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~db45/Studiendekanat/Lehre/Master/Module/Botanik_1/M1401/Evolution_Zellbiologie/Lintilhac%202003.pdf","http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf","http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/NAS/Kang/BIOL3231/Week3-Pace_2006.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1234/eso1234a.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf"],"categories":["Biological
