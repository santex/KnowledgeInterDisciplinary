{"cursor":"5548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lambert I' (died 880) was the duke and margrave (dux et marchio) of Spoleto on\ntwo occasions, first from 859 to 871 and then from 876 to his death.\n\nLambert was the eldest son of Guy I of Spoleto and Itta, daughter of Sico of\nBenevento. He married Judith, daughter of Eberhard of Friuli.\n\nIn his first year of rule, he joined Gerard, count of the Marsi; Maielpoto,\ngastald of Telese; and Wandelbert, gastald of Boiano, to prevent Sawdan, the\nSaracen emir of Bari, from reentering his city after a campaign against Capua\nand the Lavorno. Despite a bloody battle, he successfully entered Bari.\n\nIn April 860, Lambert joined with Hildebert, count of Camerino, in rebelling\nagainst the Emperor Louis II. Chased by an imperial army into the Marsi, from\nthere they fled to Benevento and took refuge under Prince Adelchis. Louis\nsurrounded the city and pardoned both Lambert and his protector in return for\ntheir loyalty. Hildebert, however, fled further to Bari.\n\nIn 866, Louis unsuccessfully besieged Landulf II, the count-bishop of Capua. He\neven granted Lambert the county of Capua to continue the siege. At that moment,\nthe duchy of Spoleto had reached its greatest extent.\n\nLambert left the siege of Capua and went Rome after the election of Adrian II on\n13 November 867. On 13 December, Lambert plundered Rome during the papal\ncoronation ceremony. He was promptly excommunicated and, as the emperor\nsupported Adrian's pontificate, lost the patronage of Louis. It was three years\nbefore he rebelled a second time, though. In 871, after the emperor greatly\nincreased his power and prestige by taking Bari, Lambert allied with Guaifer of\nSalerno, Sergius II of Naples, and Adelchis of Benevento and entered into open\nrevolt against the emperor. The Saracens, however, landed new forces and\nattacked Salerno. Adelchis, who had imprisoned the emperor while Lambert was\nstaying in Benevento, released his captive to lead the forces against the\ninfidels. The free emperor immediately deposed Lambert from his imperial\nposition and replaced him with Suppo III, a cousin of his wife Engelberga.\n\nLouis returned to the Mezzogiorno in 873, the pope having absolved him from the\noaths he had sworn to Adelchis in return for liberty. He besieged Benevento, but\nfailed to take Lambert. After his death, he was replaced as emperor by his uncle\nCharles the Bald, who reappointed Lambert to his old post in Spoleto (February\nor June 876). He also appointed Lambert's younger brother Guy as margrave of\nCamerino with the job of protecting the pope. On 16 July, at Ponthion, Charles\nconfirmed the donation of a large part of Spoletan territory to the papacy, but\nLambert was still the most powerful lord in the central peninsula and a\npractically independent prince.\n\nIn 877, Charles died and Lambert supported Carloman of Bavaria over Charles'\nheir, Louis the Stammerer, for the kingship of Italy and the emperorship.\nLambert himself entered Rome with the intent of making himself king, but was\ndissuaded by Pope John VIII. In March 878, Lambert and Adalbert I of\nTuscany Adalbert was his brother-in-law, having married his sister\nRotilda. forced the populace to acknowledge Carloman as king. The two then\nbesieged the pope in the Leonine City for thirty days and John fled Rome for\nTroyes. At Troyes, he held a synod in which he offered to crown Louis the\nStammerer emperor, adopted Boso of Arles as his son, and excommunicated his\nItalian enemies (Lambert and Adalbert). The pope even accused Lambert of\ndesiring the imperial crown for himself, which is probable considering the\nsubsequent history of his dynasty.\n\nLambert returned his sights to Capua after this Roman episode. He died besieging\nthat city in 880. He was succeeded by his son Guy II. His brother Guy became\nking and emperor, as did his nephew and namesake Lambert II. The Archbishop of\nRheims Fulk the Venerable, cautioned Lambert II against following his eponymous\nuncle's example.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","recorded":1375082769,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/List_of_Dukes_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Duchy_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Guy_I_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Sico_of_Benevento","/wiki/Eberhard_of_Friuli","/wiki/Marsi","/wiki/Gastald","/wiki/Telese","/wiki/Boiano","/w/index.php?title=Sawdan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Saracen","/wiki/Emir_of_Bari","/wiki/Capua","/wiki/Terra_di_Lavoro","/wiki/Bari","/wiki/Camerino","/wiki/Louis_II_of_Italy","/wiki/Benevento","/wiki/Adelchis_of_Benevento","/wiki/Landulf_II_of_Capua","/wiki/County_of_Capua","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Pope_Adrian_II","/wiki/Guaifer_of_Salerno","/wiki/Sergius_II_of_Naples","/wiki/Salerno","/wiki/Suppo_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Engelberga","/wiki/Mezzogiorno","/wiki/Charles_the_Bald","/wiki/Guy_III_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Camerino","/wiki/Ponthion","/wiki/Carloman_of_Bavaria","/wiki/Louis_the_Stammerer","/wiki/King_of_Italy","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor","/wiki/Pope_John_VIII","/wiki/Adalbert_I_of_Tuscany","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Leonine_City","/wiki/Troyes","/wiki/Boso_of_Provence","/wiki/Guy_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Lambert_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Archbishop_of_Rheims","/wiki/Fulk_(Archbishop_of_Reims)","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Italian_nobility","/wiki/Guy_I_of_Spoleto","/wiki/List_of_Dukes_of_Spoleto#Franks","/wiki/Suppo_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Suppo_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/List_of_Dukes_of_Spoleto#Franks","/wiki/Guy_II_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&oldid=551517395","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dukes_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Category:Marquesses_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Category:Guideschi_dynasty","/wiki/Category:People_excommunicated_by_the_Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Category:9th-century_births","/wiki/Category:880_deaths","/wiki/Category:9th-century_rulers_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:9th-century_Italian_people","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lambert+I+of+Spoleto&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lambert+I+of+Spoleto","/wiki/Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Talk:Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","#","/wiki/Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lambert_I_of_Spoleto","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&oldid=551517395","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1284091","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&id=551517395","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lambert+I+of+Spoleto","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lambert+I+of+Spoleto&oldid=551517395&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lambert_I_of_Spoleto&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82_I_(%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE)","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_I_de_Spoleto","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_Ier_de_Spol%C3%A8te","//gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamberto_I_de_Spoleto","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_I_de_Spoleto","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%
