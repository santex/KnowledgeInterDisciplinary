[http://www.indiegogo.com/rolluptherim Indiegogo],\n\"indiegogo.com\", Retrieved April 4, 2012 McKay was born and raised in the\ntown of Stellarton, Nova Scotia, where he graduated from Stellarton High School\nin 1982. He grew up in the small working class Stellarton neighborhood called\nthe Red Row, a neighborhood made up of hundred-year-old former mining company\nduplexes and the tight-knit community of working-class people who live in them.\nBoth of his parents grew up in the same neighborhood. His mother, Georgina\nBellick, was the daughter of Eastern European immigrants. His father, Leo McKay\nSr., who lived in the Red Row until his death in 2011, was a rivetter at the\nrailcar factory in nearby Trenton before becoming a career labour leader,\nsocial activist, New Democrat politician, and eventually a member of Stellarton\nTown Council.\n\nLeo McKay Jr. studied English at St. Francis Xavier University, French at Laval,\nCreative Writing at the University of British Columbia, and Education at\nDalhousie. He lived in Asia for four years in his young adulthood.\n\n'Social Media Experimenter' McKay became one of the first literary writers who\nhad already achieved a certain amount of acclaim in traditional print media to\nembrace the power of the new, internet based, social media. During the 2010 CBC\nCanada Reads competition, McKay used Facebook, Twitter, and especially YouTube,\nto promote the nomination of his 2003 novel Twenty-six as one of the Best\nCanadian Novels of the previous decade, using an ambitious if uneven series of\nhand-shot, self-produced videos called \"Twenty-six Reasons Why You Should Vote\nfor Twenty-six For Canada Reads 2010\". The novel made the 40 book long list, and\nthat success spurred McKay to further use of social media as a tool to promote\nhis literary work.\n\nIn the Spring of 2012, McKay used an online funding site, Indiegogo.com, to fund\nthe independent publication of a new novel, Roll Up the Rim. That campaign\nraised $10000 dollars in 30 days, and was chosen by Indiegogo.com as an example\nof how to run a successful online funding campaign.\n\nProduction work for Roll Up the Rim is currently underway. Publication is set\nfor the Fall of 2012.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Leo_McKay,_Jr.","recorded":1374779739,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Leo_Mackay,_Jr.","/wiki/File:Leo_McKay_Jr.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Leo_McKay_Jr.jpg/220px-Leo_McKay_Jr.jpg","/wiki/File:Leo_McKay_Jr.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Novelist","/wiki/Short_story","/wiki/Stellarton,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Globe_and_Mail","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Giller_Prize","#cite_note-buk-3","#cite_note-hrmbook-4","/wiki/Twenty-Six_(novel)","#cite_note-buk-3","#cite_note-hrmbook-4","/wiki/English_studies","/wiki/Cobequid_Educational_Centre","/wiki/Truro,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Nova_Scotia","#cite_note-cec-5","/w/index.php?title=Roll_Up_The_Rim&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-indiegogo-6","/wiki/Stellarton,_Nova_Scotia","/w/index.php?title=Stellarton_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Twenty-six_(novel)","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit&section=2","http://www.thebukowskiagency.com/Twenty-Six.htm","http://www.leomckay.com","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-buk_3-0","#cite_ref-buk_3-1","http://www.thebukowskiagency.com/Twenty-Six.htm","#cite_ref-hrmbook_4-0","#cite_ref-hrmbook_4-1","http://www.halifax.ca/bookawards/index.html#winners","#cite_ref-cec_5-0","http://cec.ccrsb.ca/faculty.htm","#cite_ref-indiegogo_6-0","http://www.indiegogo.com/rolluptherim","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&oldid=540348141","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1964_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Canadian_novelists","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_of_Scottish_descent","/wiki/Category:Canadian_short_story_writers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Pictou_County,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Category:People_from_Truro,_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Category:Writers_from_Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leo+McKay%2C+Jr.&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Leo+McKay%2C+Jr.","/wiki/Leo_McKay,_Jr.","/wiki/Talk:Leo_McKay,_Jr.","#","/wiki/Leo_McKay,_Jr.","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Leo_McKay,_Jr.","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Leo_McKay,_Jr.","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&oldid=540348141","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6524045","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Leo_McKay%2C_Jr.&id=540348141","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Leo+McKay%2C+Jr.","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Leo+McKay%2C+Jr.&oldid=540348141&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Leo_McKay,_Jr.&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6524045#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Gener
