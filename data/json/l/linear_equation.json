Linear equations occur with\ngreat regularity in applied mathematics. While they arise quite naturally when\nmodeling many phenomena, they are particularly useful since many non-linear\nequations may be reduced to linear equations by assuming that quantities of\ninterest vary to only a small extent from some \"background\" state. Linear\nequations do not include exponents.\n",
