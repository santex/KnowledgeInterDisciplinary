The total protein concentration is exhibited by a\ncolor change of the sample solution in proportion to protein concentration,\nwhich can then be measured using colorimetric techniques. It is named for the\nbiochemist Oliver H. Lowry who developed the reagent in the 1940s. His 1951\npaper describing the technique is the most-highly cited paper ever in the\nscientific literature, cited over 200,000 times.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Lowry_protein_assay","recorded":1362481318,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v13p045y1990.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v13p045y1990.pdf"],"categories":["Protein methods","Analytical chemistry","Chemical tests"],"headings":["Mechanism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biochemistry","Assay","Protein","Colorimetry","Oliver_Lowry","Peptide_bond","Alkaline","Biuret_test","Oxidation","Protein","Folinâ€“Ciocalteu_reagent","Phosphotungstic_acid","Phosphomolybdic_acid","Aromatic","Tryptophan","Tyrosine","Absorbance","Bicinchoninic_acid_assay","Biuret_test"]}
