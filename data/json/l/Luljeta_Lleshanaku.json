She was educated in literature at the University of Tirana and was editor-in-\nchief of the weekly magazine [[ZÃ«ri i rinisÃ«]] (The Voice of Youth). She then\nworked for the literary newspaper [[Drita]]. In 1996, she received the best book\nof the year award from the Eurorilindja Publishing House. In 1999, she took part\nin the International Writers Program at the University of Iowa. She is the\nauthor of four poetry collections, one volume of which has been translated into\nEnglish: [[Fresco (poems)|Fresco]], available from New Directions. The writer,\ncritic and editor Peter Constantine, in his introduction to Fresco, sums up her\nstyle in this way:\n\nLuljeta Lleshanaku is a pioneer of Albanian poetry. She speaks with\na completely original voice, her imagery and language always unexpected and\ninnovative. Her poetry has little connection to poetic styles past or present in\nAmerica, Europe, or the rest of the world. And, interestingly enough, it is not\nconnected to anything in Albanian poetry either. We have in Lleshanaku a\ncompletely original poet.\"\n\nIn the same introduction, Constantine further elaborates about\nLleshanaku's style:\n\n...one of the elements that distinguishes Luljeta Lleshanaku's\npoetry is the absence of direct social and political commentary. Her poetry's\nremarkable variety of themes, which avoids [sic] simplistic reactions to a\nterrible past and an unstable present and future, is perhaps one of the elements\nthat makes her poems contemporary classics of world literature. The imagery and\nrhythms captured in the masterful translations gathered under these covers make\nher poems as compelling in English as they are in Albanian. She speaks\nindividually to her readers, the mark of a true poet able to transcend time and\nculture.\n\nIn his afterword to Fresco, translator Henry Israeli added:\n\nShe is quiet but tough, and her raw brand of honesty and biting\nhumor can offend as quickly as her innocence and sincerity can draw one back in.\nShe can be as direct, critical, and perversely funny as she is in her poems,\nwhere, for instance, she states that \"our breath disappearing in my lungs / is\nlike lilies dropped into a cesspool.\" \"In her verse, joy lives side by side with\nmelancholy in a kind of symbiotic contradiction. Her lines can be exalting,\nplayful, often bursting with a sense of wonder that is unmistakably youthful,\nand almost naÃ¯ve. Her poems are highly imagistic, the connections between images\nprecociously and precariously intuitive. They are, for the most part, short,\ncontained studies, still lifes [sic] rendered abstractly, yet they soar within\nthe boundless imagination of a speaker who delights in the sensual, the tactile,\nwho \"light as an Indian feather ... can easily reach the moon\" and witnesses\n\"asteroids dying like drones / in ecstasy for their love, their\nqueen.\"\n","linknr":126,"url":"Luljeta_Lleshanaku","recorded":1375056203,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Elbasan","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Poetry","/wiki/Imagism","/w/index.php?title=Fresco_(poems)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ismail_Kadare","/wiki/Elbasan","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Albanian_literature","/wiki/Poetry","/wiki/2009_in_literature","/w/index.php?title=Vilenice_Kristal_prize&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Milan_Kundera","/wiki/Adam_Zagajewski","/wiki/Peter_Handke","/wiki/Zbigniew_Herbert","/wiki/University_of_Tirana","/wiki/Editor-in-chief","/w/index.php?title=Z%C3%ABri_i_rinis%C3%AB&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Drita","/wiki/1996_in_literature","/w/index.php?title=Eurorilindja&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Publishing","/wiki/1999_in_literature","/w/index.php?title=International_Writers_Program&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/University_of_Iowa","/w/index.php?title=Fresco_(poems)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_Directions_Publishing","/wiki/Literary_criticism","/wiki/Editing","/wiki/Peter_Constantine","/wiki/Afterword","/wiki/Translation","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Israeli&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Humor","/wiki/Imagism","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Fresco_(poems)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Translation","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Israeli&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Afterword","/wiki/Peter_Constantine","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=edit&section=2","http://www.amazon.com/Fresco-Selected-Poetry-Luljeta-Lleshanaku/dp/0811215113","/wiki/Amazon.com","http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/albania/lleshl.htm","http://wordswithoutborders.org/article/seven-poems1/","http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_modern1/lleshanaku.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/39291496","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Elbasan","/wiki/Albania","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&oldid=516369857","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Albanian_poets","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1968_births","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Luljeta+Lleshanaku&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Luljeta+Lleshanaku","/wiki/Luljeta_Lleshanaku","/wiki/Talk:Luljeta_Lleshanaku","#","/wiki/Luljeta_Lleshanaku","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Luljeta_Lleshanaku","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Luljeta_Lleshanaku","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&oldid=516369857","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6702813","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&id=516369857","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Luljeta+Lleshanaku","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Luljeta+Lleshanaku&oldid=516369857&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Luljeta_Lleshanaku&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6702813#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikime
