{"cursor":"10764","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Lord Steward 1587–1588, holding the white staff of his office]] The\n'Lord Steward' or 'Lord Steward of the Household', in England, is an important\nofficial of the Royal Household. He is always a peer. Until 1924, he was always\na member of the Government. Until 1782, the office was one of considerable\npolitical importance and carried Cabinet rank.\n\nThe Lord Steward receives his appointment from the Sovereign in person, and\nbears a white staff as the emblem and warrant of his authority. He is the first\ndignitary of the court. In an Act of passed in 1539 for placing of the lords, he\nis described as the grand master or lord steward of the king's most honourable\nhousehold. The House of Lords Precedence Act 1539,\n[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen8/31/10 section IV] He presided at\nthe Board of Green Cloth, until the Board of Green Cloth disappeared in the\nreform of local government licensing in 2004, brought about by the Licensing Act\n2003 (section 195). In his department are the Treasurer of the Household and\nComptroller of the Household, who rank next to him. These officials were usually\npeers or the sons of peers and Privy Councillors. They also sat at the Board of\nGreen Cloth, carry white staves, and belong to the ministry. The offices are now\nheld by Government whips in the House of Commons. The duties which in theory\nbelong to the Lord Steward, Treasurer and Comptroller of the Household are in\npractice performed by the Master of the Household, who is a permanent officer\nand resides in the palace. However by the Coroners Act 1988 the Lord Steward\nstill appoints the Coroner of the Queen's Household. Coroners Act 1988,\nsection 29(1). To be abolished by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009\n\nThe Master of the Household is a white-staff officer and was a member of the\nBoard of Green Cloth but not of the ministry, and among other things he\npresided at the daily dinners of the suite in waiting on the sovereign. He is\nnot named in the Black Book of Edward IV or in the Statutes of Henry VIII, and\nis entered as master of the household and clerk of the green cloth in the\nHousehold Book of Queen Elizabeth. But he has superseded the lord steward of\nthe household, as the lord steward of the household at one time superseded the\nLord High Steward of England.\n\nIn the Lord Steward's department were the officials of the Board of Green Cloth,\nthe Coroner (\"coroner of the verge\", now abolished), and Paymaster of the\nHousehold, and the officers of the Royal Almonry. Other offices in the\ndepartment were those of the Cofferer of the Household, the Treasurer of the\nChamber, and the Paymaster of Pensions, but these, with six clerks of the Board\nof Green Cloth, were abolished in 1782.\n\nThe Lord Steward had formerly three courts besides the Board of Green Cloth\nunder himâthe Lord Steward's Court, superseded in 1541 by the Marshalsea Court,\nand the Palace Court.\n\nThe Lord Steward or his deputies formerly administered the oaths to the members\nof the House of Commons. In certain cases (messages from the sovereign under the\nsign-manual) the lords with white staves are the proper persons to bear\ncommunications between the Sovereign and the Houses of Parliament.\n","linknr":232,"url":"Lord_Steward","recorded":1364170950,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Lord_High_Steward","/wiki/File:Portrait_of_Robert_Dudley_Earl_of_Leicester_(1532-1588).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Portrait_of_Robert_Dudley_Earl_of_Leicester_%281532-1588%29.jpg/220px-Portrait_of_Robert_Dudley_Earl_of_Leicester_%281532-1588%29.jpg","/wiki/File:Portrait_of_Robert_Dudley_Earl_of_Leicester_(1532-1588).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Robert_Dudley,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester","/wiki/England","/wiki/Royal_Household","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Cabinet_rank","/wiki/Monarch","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Board_of_Green_Cloth","/wiki/Licensing_Act_2003","/wiki/Treasurer_of_the_Household","/wiki/Comptroller_of_the_Household","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Master_of_the_Household","/w/index.php?title=Coroners_Act_1988&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Coroner_of_the_Queen%27s_Household","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Master_of_the_Household","/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Lord_High_Steward","/w/index.php?title=Coroner_of_the_verge&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Paymaster_of_the_Household&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_Almonry","/wiki/Cofferer_of_the_Household","/wiki/Treasurer_of_the_Chamber","/wiki/Paymaster_of_Pensions","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward%27s_Court&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Marshalsea_Court","/wiki/Palace_Court","/wiki/Oaths","/wiki/Sign-manual","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","#Lord_Stewards","#15th_century","#16th_century","#17th_century","#18th_century","#19th_century","#20th_century","#21st_century","#References","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Sutton,_1st_Baron_Dudley","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Baron_Tiptoft","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Earl_of_Worcester","/wiki/Thomas_Stanley,_1st_Earl_of_Derby","/w/index.php?title=John_Radcliffe,_9th_Baron_FitzWalter&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Robert_Willoughby,_1st_Baron_Willoughby_de_Broke","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/George_Talbot,_4th_Earl_of_Shrewsbury","/wiki/Robert_Radcliffe,_1st_Earl_of_Sussex","/wiki/Charles_Brandon,_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk","/wiki/William_Paulet,_1st_Marquess_of_Winchester","/wiki/John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland","/wiki/Henry_Fitzalan,_19th_Earl_of_Arundel","/wiki/William_Herbert,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke_(1551_creation)","/wiki/Robert_Dudley,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Charles_Howard,_1st_Earl_of_Nottingham","/wiki/Ludovic_Stuart,_1st_Duke_of_Richmond","/wiki/James_Hamilton,_2nd_Marquess_of_Hamilton","/wiki/William_Herbert,_3rd_Earl_of_Pembroke","/wiki/Thomas_Howard,_2nd_Earl_of_Arundel_and_Surrey","/wiki/James_Stuart,_1st_Duke_of_Richmond","/wiki/James_Butler,_1st_Duke_of_Ormonde","/wiki/William_Cavendish,_1st_Duke_of_Devonshire","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/William_Cavendish,_2nd_Duke_of_Devonshire","/wiki/John_Sheffield,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Normanby","/wiki/John_Poulett,_1st_Earl_Poulett","/wiki/William_Cavendish,_2nd_Duke_of_Devonshire","/wiki/Henry_Grey,_1st_Duke_of_Kent","/wiki/John_Campbell,_2nd_Duke_of_Argyll","/wiki/Lionel_Sackville,_1st_Duke_of_Dorset","/wiki/Philip_Stanhope,_4th_Earl_of_Chesterfield","/wiki/William_Cavendish,_3rd_Duke_of_Devonshire","/wiki/Lionel_Sackville,_1st_Duke_of_Dorset","/wiki/William_Cavendish,_3rd_Duke_of_Devonshire","/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_3rd_Duke_of_Marlborough","/wiki/John_Manners,_3rd_Duke_of_Rutland","/wiki/William_Talbot,_1st_Earl_Talbot","/wiki/Frederick_Howard,_5th_Earl_of_Carlisle","/wiki/Charles_Manners,_4th_Duke_of_Rutland","/wiki/William_Legge,_2nd_Earl_of_Dartmouth","/wiki/James_Brydges,_3rd_Duke_of_Chandos","/wiki/John_Sackville,_3rd_Duke_of_Dorset","/wiki/George_Townshend,_2nd_Marquess_Townshend","/w/index.php?title=Lord_Steward&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/George_Legge,_3rd_Earl_of_Dartmouth","/wiki/Heneage_
