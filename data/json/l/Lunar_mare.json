They were dubbed maria, Latin for \"seas\", by\nearly astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective\nthan the \"highlands\" as a result of their iron-rich compositions, and hence\nappear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16 percent of the lunar\nsurface, mostly on the near-side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far-\nside are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional\nnomenclature for the Moon also includes one oceanus (ocean), as well as features\nwith the names lacus (lake), palus (marsh) and sinus (bay). The latter three are\nsmaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics.\n","linknr":364,"url":"Lunar_mare","recorded":1362268784,"links":48,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Maria on the Moon|","Lunar science"],"headings":["Ages","Distribution of mare basalts","Composition","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Moon_names.svg/500px-Moon_names.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Clementine_albedo_simp750.jpg/500px-Clementine_albedo_simp750.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Basalt","Earth","Moon","Volcanic","Latin","Sea","Radiometric_dating","Crater_counting","Oceanus_Procellarum","Clementine_mission","Equirectangular_projection","Large_igneous_provinces","Near_side_of_the_Moon","Far_side_of_the_Moon","Centrifugal_acceleration","Anorthositic","Far_side_of_the_Moon","South_Pole-Aitken_basin","Oceanus_Procellarum","Synchronous_rotation","Moments_of_inertia","Spherical_harmonic","Tidal_locking","Lunar_Prospector","KREEP","Oceanus_Procellarum","Mare_Imbrium","Lunar_terranes","Tholeiitic","Clementine_mission","Potassium","Rare_earth_elements","Phosphorus","Amphiboles","Phyllosilicates","Apollo_11_landing_site","Mare_Tranquillitatis","Moon","Geology_of_the_Moon","List_of_maria_on_the_Moon","Moon_rock","Selenography"]}
