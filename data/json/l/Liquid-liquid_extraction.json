{"cursor":"23980","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Separation02.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Liquidâliquid extraction', also known as 'solvent extraction' and\n'partitioning', is a method to separate compounds based on their relative\nsolubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water and an organic\nsolvent. It is an of a substance from one liquid phase into another liquid\nphase. Liquidâliquid extraction is a basic technique in chemical laboratories,\nwhere it is performed using a separatory funnel. This type of process is\ncommonly performed after a chemical reaction as part of the work-up.\n\nThe term partitioning is commonly used to refer to the underlying chemical and\nphysical processes involved in liquidâliquid extraction but may be fully\nsynonymous. The term solvent extraction can also refer to the separation of a\nsubstance from a mixture by preferentially dissolving that substance in a\nsuitable solvent. In that case, a soluble compound is separated from an\ninsoluble compound or a complex matrix.\n\nSolvent extraction is used in nuclear reprocessing, ore processing, the\nproduction of fine organic compounds, the processing of perfumes, the production\nof vegetable oils and biodiesel, and other industries.\n\nLiquidâliquid extraction is possible in non-aqueous systems: In a system\nconsisting of a molten metal in contact with molten salts, metals can be\nextracted from one phase to the other. This is related to a mercury electrode\nwhere a metal can be reduced, the metal will often then dissolve in the mercury\nto form an amalgam that modifies its electrochemistry greatly. For example, it\nis possible for sodium cations to be reduced at a mercury cathode to form sodium\namalgam, while at an inert electrode (such as platinum) the sodium cations are\nnot reduced. Instead, water is reduced to hydrogen. A detergent or fine solid\ncan be used to stabilize an emulsion, or third phase.\n","linknr":426,"url":"Liquid-liquid_extraction","recorded":1362511944,"links":27,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","unit","chemistry","element"],"pdf":["http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/activity_rep/ar98/2370-vance.pdf","http://www.cognis.com/NR/rdonlyres/62A4BDA0-2B5F-4579-9761-968114B57A2A/0/thesolve.pdf","http://www.cognis.com/NR/rdonlyres/62A4BDA0-2B5F-4579-9761-968114B57A2A/0/thesolve.pdf"],"categories":["Unit operations","Laboratory techniques","Separation processes","Flavor technology","Articles containing video clips"],"headings":["Measures of effectiveness","Techniques","Kinetics of extraction","Aqueous complexing agents","Industrial process design","Equipment","Extraction of metals","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Coflore_ACX.png/220px-Coflore_ACX.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/1/4510f667fcfb0363f99ee2dbf09c4ee5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/1/4510f667fcfb0363f99ee2dbf09c4ee5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/ChemSepProcDiagram.svg/81px-ChemSepProcDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work-up","chemistry"],["mercury","element"],["amalgam","chemistry"],["stripping","chemistry"],["absorption","chemistry"],["complex","chemistry"],["hydron","chemistry"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["amalgam","complex","absorption","stripping","mole","hydron","mercury"],"related":["Solubility","Miscibility","Solvent","State_of_matter","Separatory_funnel","Work-up_(chemistry)","Nuclear_reprocessing","Organic_compound","Perfume","Vegetable_fats_and_oils","Biodiesel","Molten_salt","Mercury_(element)","Electrode","Amalgam_(chemistry)","Sodium","Cation","Cathode","Sodium_amalgam","Detergent","Solid","Emulsion","Third_phase","Concentration","Solution","Partition_coefficient","Logarithm","Uranium","Neptunium","Zirconolite","Perovskite","Chemical_polarity","Nickel","Silver","Contaminant","Cadmium","Indium","Cadmium","Indium","</nowiki>''Z''<nowiki>","Separating_funnel","Anisole","Mixture","Water","Acetic_acid","Diethyl_ether","Sodium_bicarbonate","Sodium_bicarbonate","Sodium_acetate","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Industry","Metals","Lanthanides","Raffinate","Countercurrent_exchange","Lanthanides","Metals","Stripping_(chemistry)","Noble_gas","Absorption_(chemistry)","Carboxylic_acids","Benzene","'''HA'''<sub>organic</sub>","'''HA'''<sub>aqueous</sub>","Uranium","Plutonium","Thorium","Organophosphate","Tri-n-butyl_phosphate","PUREX","Nuclear_reprocessing","Inert","Hydrocarbon","Kerosene","Complex_(chemistry)","Concentration","Uranyl_nitrate","Reducing_agent","Plutonium","Oxidation_state","Oxidation_state","Nitrate","Solvation","Tributyl_phosphate","NO<sub>3</sub>","Ion_exchange","Ion","Hydrogen_ion","PH","Americium","Terpyridine","Carboxylic_acid","Butyl","Benzene","Terpyridine","Carboxylic_acid","Hydron_(chemistry)","Zinc","Cadmium","Lead","Alkyl","Diluent","Alkane","Polar_molecule","Metal","Lanthanide","Nitric_acid","Pentyl","2,2'-bipyridine","Hexanoic_acid","Butyl","Benzene","Nitrate","Americium","Anionic","Lipophilic","Quaternary_ammonium_salt","Phase_transfer_catalyst","Ion","Kilojoule","Mole_(unit)","Acetate","Sodium_acetate","Benzyl_chloride","Benzyl","Chloride","Nitrobenzene","Equivalent_weight","Tetraalkylammonium","Aqueous_two_phase_system","Polyethylene_glycol","Polysaccharide","Dextran","Centrifugation","Electric_field","Kosmotropic","Ionic_liquids","Palladium","Nickel","Iron","Silver","Carbon_tetrachloride","Iodide","I<sub>2</sub>.<sub>Organic</sub>","I<sup>-</sup>.<sub>Aqueous</sub>","Iodine","Iodide","Polyhalide","Anion","Sodium_carbonate","Aqueous","Benzoic_acid","Benzoate","Benzil","Separatory_funnel","Craig_apparatus","Centrifugal_contactor","Spray_column","Pulsed_columns","Mixer-settler","Hydrochloric_acid","Xylene","Oxime","Cobalt","Nickel","Hexane","Tributyl_phosphate"]}
