{"cursor":"4837","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"This is a list of '[[The Citadel Bulldogs football]]' players who have picked\npicked in the National Football League Draft and American Football League\nDraft.\n\nEach NFL franchise seeks to add new players through the annual NFL Draft. The\ndraft rules were last updated in 2009. The team with the worst record the\nprevious year picks first, the next-worst team second, and so on. Teams that did\nnot make the playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with any\nremaining ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff participants are\nsequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild\ncard, division, conference, and Super Bowl).\n\nBefore the merger agreements in 1966, the American Football League (AFL)\noperated in direct competition with the NFL and held a separate draft. This led\nto a massive bidding war over top prospects between the two leagues. As part of\nthe merger agreement on June 8, 1966, the two leagues would hold a multiple\nround \"Common Draft\". Once the AFL officially merged with the NFL in 1970, the\n\"Common Draft\" simply became the NFL Draft.\n","linknr":264,"url":"List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft","recorded":1375057910,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football","/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization","/wiki/NFL_Draft#Procedure_and_rules","/wiki/Strength_of_schedule","/wiki/NFL_Playoffs","/wiki/Super_Bowl","#cite_note-3","/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/Common_Draft","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft","/w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1939_NFL_Draft","/wiki/History_of_the_Arizona_Cardinals#Chicago_years_.281898.E2.80.931959.29","/wiki/1959_NFL_Draft","/wiki/St._Louis_Rams","/wiki/1960_NFL_Draft","/wiki/St._Louis_Rams","/wiki/History_of_the_Arizona_Cardinals#Chicago_years_.281898.E2.80.931959.29","/wiki/1969_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts","/wiki/1970_NFL_Draft","/wiki/John_Small_(American_football)","/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons","/wiki/1977_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts","/wiki/1981_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Stump_Mitchell","/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals","/wiki/1987_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Greg_Davis_(placekicker)","/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers","/wiki/1995_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Travis_Jervey","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/1998_Pro_Bowl","/wiki/2005_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Nehemiah_Broughton","/wiki/Washington_Redskins","/wiki/2010_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Andre_Roberts_(American_football)","/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals","/wiki/2011_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Cortez_Allen","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/1960_AFL_Draft","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers","/wiki/Paul_Maguire","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/1964_AFL_Draft","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/w/index.php?title=List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_in_the_NFL_Draft&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?abbr=T&collegeName=The+Citadel&abbrFlag=0&type=school","#cite_ref-2","http://catalog.e-digitaleditions.com/title/10811","#cite_ref-3","http://www.webcitation.org/5n4XIGQef","http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4015265","#cite_ref-4","http://www.webcitation.org/5kfaEwiKW","http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/","#cite_ref-5","http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Chronology_2011.pdf","#cite_ref-6","http://www.nfl.com/draft/story?id=09000d5d807e6d6a&template=with-video&confirm=true","/wiki/Template:The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football","/w/index.php?title=College_Park_Stadium&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Johnson_Hagood_Stadium_(1927)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Johnson_Hagood_Stadium","/wiki/1960_Tangerine_Bowl_(December)","/wiki/Military_Classic_of_the_South","/wiki/The_Citadel%E2%80%93Furman_football_rivalry","/wiki/List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_head_football_coaches","/wiki/List_of_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_seasons","/wiki/1905_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1906_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1907_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1908_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1909_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1910_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1911_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1912_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1913_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1914_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1915_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1916_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1917_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1918_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1919_The_Citadel_Bulldogs_football_team","/wiki/1
