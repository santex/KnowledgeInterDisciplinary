{"cursor":"3887","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Lime' is a general term for calcium-containing inorganic materials, in which\ncarbonates, oxides and hydroxides predominate. Strictly speaking, lime is\ncalcium oxide or calcium hydroxide. It is also the name of the natural mineral\n(native lime) of the CaO composition which occurs as a product of coal seam\nfires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic\nejecta. [http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/lime.pdf Lime in Handbook\nof Mineralogy] The word \"lime\" originates with its earliest use as\nbuilding mortar and has the sense of \"sticking or\nadhering.\" http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lime\n\nThese materials are still used in large quantities as building and\nengineering materials (including limestone products, concrete and mortar) and\nas chemical feedstocks, among other uses. Lime industries and the use of many\nof the resulting products date from prehistoric periods in both the Old World\nand the New World. Lime is used extensively for waste water treatment with\nferrous sulfate.\n\nThe rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived, typically\nlimestone or chalk, are composed primarily of calcium carbonate. They may be\ncut, crushed or pulverized and chemically altered. \"Burning\" (calcination)\nconverts them into the highly caustic material quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO)\nand, through subsequent addition of water, into the less caustic (but still\nstrongly alkaline) slaked lime or hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide,\nCa(OH) 2), the process of which is called slaking of lime.\n\nWhen the term is encountered in an agricultural context, it probably refers\nto agricultural lime. Otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime, as the\nmore dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or\nburnt lime.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Lime_(mineral)","recorded":1362481644,"links":44,"instances":["masonry"],"pdf":["http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/lime.pdf"],"categories":["Building materials","Calcium minerals","Oxide minerals","Limestone","Alchemical substances","Plastering"],"headings":["Lime production process","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Limestone_quarry.jpg/400px-Limestone_quarry.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mortar","masonry"]],"members":["mortar"],"related":["Calcium","Inorganic","Carbonate","Oxide","Hydroxide","Calcium_oxide","Calcium_hydroxide","Mineral","Coal_seam_fire","Limestone","Xenolith","Volcanic","Limestone","Concrete","Mortar_(masonry)","Chemical","Prehistoric","Old_World","New_World","Waste_water_treatment","Ferrous_sulfate","Limestone","Chalk","Calcium_carbonate","Calcination","Corrosive_substance","Alkaline","Calcium_hydroxide","Agricultural_lime","Slaked_lime","Quicklime","Limestone","Optical_Granulometry","Lime_kiln","Calcium_carbonate","Calcium_oxide","Carbon_dioxide","Calcium_oxide","Water","Calcium_hydroxide","Gypsum","Hydraulic_lime","Lime_plaster","Lime_mortar","Lime_wash","Plastering","Lime-ash_floor","Sascab","Central_America"]}
