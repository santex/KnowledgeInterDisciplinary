He\nretired as the all time leader in victories at the University of Illinois with\n423 victories and New Mexico State with 289 victories. Overall he had 779\nvictories, putting him in sixth place on the all-time list.\n\nHenson began his coaching career at Las Cruces High School in Las Cruces, New\nMexico. Henson was head coach of the varsity for four seasons, and won state\nchampionships in 1959, 1960, and 1961.\n\nHe started coaching at the college ranks in 1962 at Hardin-Simmons University.\nIn 1966, he took over at his alma mater, New Mexico State University. In his\nfirst season at NMSU, the Aggies rebounded from a 4â22 record in the prior\nseason to finish 15â11 and went to the NCAA Tournament. In 1970, Henson would\nhelp lead the Aggies to the Final Four for the only time in the school's\nhistory. Henson and future NBA players Jimmy Collins, Sam Lacey, and Charlie\nCriss lost in the tournament semifinal to eventual champion UCLA, the third time\nin three years the Aggies lost to UCLA in the tournament. Henson coached at New\nMexico State for nine seasons, with six trips to the NCAA Tournament and four\ntwenty-win seasons.\n\nIn 1975, Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow,\nafter Bartow left Illinois to replace John Wooden at UCLA. He would lead the\nFighting Illini to the 1989 Final Four. In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered\n423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins\nand 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games\nwere the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois,\nHenson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper,\nKen Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve\nBardo, and Kiwane Garris and was known for his trademark, Lou-Do.\n\nIn 1997, Henson was named interim head coach at New Mexico State after Neil\nMcCarthy was abruptly fired before the start of the season. Henson wanted to\ndonate his time, but after being told state law didn't allow it, he accepted a\nnominal salary of $1 USD per month. After a successful season, he was given his\nold job back on a permanent basis. His 1998â99 team won the Big West regular\nseason and tournament titlesânotably, the first time in Henson's career that he\nhad won a conference tournament. He retired for good midway through the 2004â05\nseason due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His second stint allowed him to regain his\nstanding as New Mexico State's all-time winningest coach, passing McCarthy.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Lou_Henson","recorded":1374762915,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Okay,_Oklahoma","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Hardin-Simmons_University","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/College_basketball","/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_University","/wiki/Las_Cruces_High_School","/wiki/Las_Cruces,_New_Mexico","/wiki/Varsity_team","/wiki/Hardin-Simmons_University","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_University","/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship","/wiki/Final_Four","/wiki/Jimmy_Collins_(basketball)","/wiki/Sam_Lacey","/wiki/Charlie_Criss","/wiki/UCLA","/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","/wiki/Gene_Bartow","/wiki/John_Wooden","/wiki/Illinois_Fighting_Illini","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","/wiki/Eddie_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1959)","/wiki/Derek_Harper","/wiki/Ken_Norman","/wiki/Nick_Anderson","/wiki/Kendall_Gill","/wiki/Kenny_Battle","/wiki/Marcus_Liberty","/wiki/Steve_Bardo","/wiki/Kiwane_Garris","/wiki/Comb_over","/wiki/Neil_McCarthy_(basketball)","/wiki/USD","/wiki/Non-Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma","#Health_problems","#Head_coaching_record","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Chemotherapy","/wiki/Champaign,_Illinois","#cite_note-sportsline-1","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Hardin-Simmons_University","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies","/wiki/Missouri_Valley_Conference","/wiki/Illinois_Fighting_Illini","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","/wiki/1977%E2%80%9378_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1978%E2%80%9379_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1981%E2%80%9382_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1985%E2%80%9386_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1986%E2%80%9387_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1987%E2%80%9388_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1988%E2%80%9389_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1991%E2%80%9392_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1992%E2%80%9393_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1993%E2%80%9394_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_Illinois_Fighting_Illini_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies","/wiki/Big_West_Conference","/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_college_men%27s_basketball_coaches_with_600_wins","/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Final_Four_appearances_by_coach","/wiki/Lou_Henson_Award","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-sportsline_1-0","http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/10268977","/w/index.php?title=Lou_Henson&action=edit&section=5","http://newmexicostate.scout.com/2/344959.html","/wiki/Template:New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/New_Mexico_State_Aggies_men%27s_basketball","/w/index.php?title=John_O._Miller&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=V._Kays&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=George_Lain&action=edit
