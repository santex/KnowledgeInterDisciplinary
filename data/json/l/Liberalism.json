Retrieved 2010-02-20. is a political philosophy\nor worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Young, p. 39\nLiberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these\nprinciples, but generally they support ideas such as free and fair elections,\ncivil rights, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free trade, and private\nproperty.\n\nLiberalism first became a distinct political movement during the Age of\nEnlightenment, when it became popular among philosophers and economists in the\nWestern world. Liberalism rejected the notions, common at the time, of\nhereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, and the Divine Right of\nKings. The early liberal thinker John Locke is often credited with founding\nliberalism as a distinct philosophical tradition. Locke argued that each man has\na natural right to life, liberty and property \"All mankind...being all equal\nand independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or\npossessions\", John Locke, Second Treatise of Government and according to\nthe social contract, governments must not violate these rights. Liberals opposed\ntraditional conservatism and sought to replace absolutism in government with\ndemocracy and/or republicanism and the rule of law.\n\nThe revolutionaries in the American Revolution, the French Revolution and other\nliberal revolutions from that time used liberal philosophy to justify the armed\noverthrow of what they saw as tyrannical rule. The nineteenth century saw\nliberal governments established in nations across Europe, Spanish America, and\nNorth America. http://www.amazon.com/New-Liberalism-Matthew-\nKalkman/dp/1926991044/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322719289&sr=8-1 In this\nperiod, the dominant ideological opponent of liberalism was classical\nconservatism.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, liberal ideas spread even further, as liberal\ndemocracies found themselves on the winning side in both world wars. Liberalism\nalso survived major ideological challenges from new opponents, such as fascism\nand communism. In Europe and North America, classical liberalism became less\npopular and gave way to social democracy Mostly in Europe and social\nliberalism. Mostly in the United\nStates.

According to\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica, \"In the United States liberalism is associated with\nthe welfare-state policies of the New Deal program of the Democratic\nadministration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more\ncommonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire\neconomic policies.\" Liberalism, Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nToday, liberal
