It operates under the\n[http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/ Human Exploration and Operations\n(HEO)] Mission Directorate of NASA.\n\nSince 1990, NASA has purchased expendable launch vehicle (ELV) launch services\ndirectly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and\napplications missions. ELVs can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and\naltitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary\nmissions. The Launch Services Program was established at Kennedy Space Center\nfor NASAâs acquisition and program management of ELV missions. A NASA/contractor\nteam is in place to meet the mission of the Launch Services Program, which\nexists to provide leadership, expertise and cost-effective services in the\ncommercial arena to satisfy Agency wide space transportation requirements and\nmaximize the opportunity for mission success.\n\nPrimary launch sites are Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida,\nand Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California. Other launch locations are\nNASA's Wallops Flight Facility, in Virginia, the North Pacificâs Kwajalein Atoll\nin the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Kodiak Island in Alaska.\n\nThe [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/678112main_LSP%20Brochure.pdf\nLaunch Services Program brochure] circa 2012 is now available.
