{"cursor":"5524","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Lethbridge Expos' (formerly the \"Ogden Dodgers\" and \"Ogden Spikers\")\narrived in Lethbridge, Alberta 65 years after the city had last hosted a\nprofessional baseball team. In their debut 1975 season the team went 35â37,\nthird in the four-team Pioneer League, under manager Van Kelly. Steve Ratzer (3-\n4, 5 saves, 2.33 ERA) was third in the league in ERA and second in saves for a\nteam that seemingly played in a high-offense environment (league-high 403 runs\nand 437 runs allowed). First baseman Ray Crowley was second in the league in\naverage and hit .338/~.495/.543. He did not make the All-Star team, but two\noutfielders did â Andy Dyes (.324/~.393/.407, a league-high 58 RBI) and Andre\nDawson (.330/~.389/.553, the league leader with 99 hits, 166 total bases and 13\nhomers and presumably the slugging leader as well).\n\nIn 1976 Walt Hriniak managed the team to a last-place (30-42) finish. They again\nled in runs (449) and allowed 434 (3rd), a positive run differential despite\ntheir bad record. Third baseman John Scoras (.370/~.449/.619) led the league in\nbatting average, hits (101), total bases (169), homers (13) and RBI (63) and\ntied for the doubles lead (17) in winning a Triple Crown, the only one in the\nPioneer League between 1961 and 1997. He was joined on the All-Star team by\ncatcher Doug Simunic (.244/~.371/.413). David Palmer (0-5, 7.20) had a horrible\nyear but went on to the best major-league career from the team.\n\nIn 1977, the Lethbridge Expos of the Pioneer League began an affiliation with\nthe Los Angeles Dodgers and became known as the 'Lethbridge Dodgers'. The team\nwas an instant success, going 44â26 and capturing a championship for manager\nGail Henley in its first season. Michael Zournas hit 21 home runs to lead the\nleague, James Nobles paced the circuit with 9 wins, and catcher Jesse Baez and\nsecond baseman Don LeJohn were All-Stars. Jim Lefebvre took over as the club's\nskipper the next season, and the team fell to fifth place with a 33â35 record.\nStill, pitcher Roberto Alexander won 9 games to lead the league and third\nbaseman German Rivera made the All-Star team.\n\nHenley returned as the team's manager in 1979, and the Dodgers responded by\ngoing 38â30 and capturing another league title. Richard Rodas won the pitching\nTriple Crown with 12 wins, a 1.12 ERA, and 148 strikeouts, and was joined by\nfirst baseman Greg Brock on the All-Star team. Henley remained with the club in\n1980, and they posted a league-best 52â18 record and repeated as champs. Pitcher\nCharles Jones struck out a league-high 115 batters, and first baseman Greg\nSmith, designated hitter Audie Cole, and pitcher Curtis Reade were All-Stars.\n\nGary LaRocque replaced Henley at the helm in 1981, and the Dodgers dropped to\n43â27, missing out on the playoffs. A bright spot for the team was pitcher Sid\nFernandez, who struck out 128 and posted a 1.54 ERA. LaRocque's club fell to\n25â45 the next season, and not one player made the All-Star team. Henley\nreturned for a third go-round as manager in 1983, and the Dodgers improved to\n39â31, narrowly missing out on the postseason. Shortstop Jeff Hamilton and\nsecond baseman Ken Harvey were All-Stars, and pitcher Derek Lee tied for the\nleague lead with 9 wins. However, after the season, the Dodgers relocated to\nIdaho and became the Pocatello Gems.\n\nThe' Pocatello Gems' began play in the Pioneer League in 1984, when the\nLethbridge Dodgers relocated to Pocatello, Idaho, and were members of the\ncircuit for just two seasons. As an independent club in 1984, led by manager Ron\nMihal, they posted the league's worst record (23-47). The next season they\nbecame an Oakland Athletics affiliate and improved slightly to 24â45 under\nmanager Dave Hudgens, who led them to a third place finish out of four clubs in\nthe Southern Division. One bright spot that year was the play of shortstop Walt\nWeiss, who made the league's 1985 All-Star team. However, after the season, the\nGems franchise suspended operations.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Lethbridge_Expos","recorded":1375076018,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Lethbridge,_Alberta","/wiki/Pioneer_Baseball_League","/wiki/Van_Kelly","/wiki/Steve_Ratzer","/w/index.php?title=Ray_Crowley&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Dyes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Andre_Dawson","/wiki/Walt_Hriniak","/w/index.php?title=John_Scoras&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Doug_Simunic&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/David_Palmer_(baseball)","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Steve_Yeager","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Van_Kelly","/wiki/Walt_Hriniak","/wiki/Gail_Henley","/wiki/Jim_Lefebvre","/wiki/Gail_Henley","/wiki/Gail_Henley","/wiki/Gary_LaRocque","/wiki/Gary_LaRocque","/wiki/Gail_Henley","/w/index.php?title=Ron_Mihal&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dave_Hudgens","http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Lethbridge_Expos","/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&oldid=467686955","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Pioneer_Baseball_League_teams","/wiki/Category:Sport_in_Lethbridge","/wiki/Category:Los_Angeles_Dodgers_minor_league_affiliates","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lethbridge+Expos&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lethbridge+Expos","/wiki/Lethbridge_Expos","/wiki/Talk:Lethbridge_Expos","#","/wiki/Lethbridge_Expos","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lethbridge_Expos","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lethbridge_Expos","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&oldid=467686955","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6533305","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lethbridge_Expos&id=467686955","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lethbridge+Expos","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lethbridge+Expos&oldid=467686955&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lethbridge_Expos&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6533305#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge_Expos","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["baseball"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct
