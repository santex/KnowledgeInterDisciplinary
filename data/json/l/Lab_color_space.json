(Proceedings of the Winter Meeting of the Optical Society of\nAmerica) (Proceedings of the Thirty-Third Annual\nMeeting of the Optical Society of America) However, Lab is now more often\nused as an informal abbreviation for the 'CIE 1976 (L*,a*,b*) color space' (or\nCIELAB). The difference between Hunter and CIE color coordinates is that the CIE\ncoordinates are based on a cube root transformation of the color data, while the\nHunter coordinates are based on a square root transformation.\n\nBoth spaces are derived from the \"master\" space CIE 1931 XYZ color space, which\ncan predict which spectral power distributions will be perceived as the same\ncolor (see metamerism), but which is not particularly perceptually\nuniform. [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/UPLab.html A discussion and proposed\nimprovement], Bruce Lindbloom Strongly influenced by the Munsell color\nsystem, the intention of both \"Lab\" color spaces is to create a space which can\nbe computed via simple formulas from the XYZ space, but is more perceptually\nuniform than XYZ. [http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color7.html#CIELUV\nExplanation of this history], Bruce MacEvoy Perceptually uniform means\nthat a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of\nabout the same visual importance. When storing colors in limited precision\nvalues, this can improve the reproduction of tones. Both Lab spaces are relative\nto the white point of the XYZ data they were converted from. Lab values do not\ndefine absolute colors unless the white point is also specified. Often, in\npractice, the white point is assumed to follow a standard and is not explicitly\nstated (e.g., for \"absolute colorimetric\" rendering intent ICC L*a*b* values are\nrelative to CIE standard illuminant D50, while they are relative to the\nunprinted substrate for other rendering intents).\n\nThe lightness correlate in CIELAB is calculated using the cube root of the\nrelative luminance.\n\nThe L*a*b* color space includes all perceivable colors which means that its\ngamut exceeds those of the RGB and CMYK color models. One of the most important\nattributes of the L*a*b*-model is device independence. This means that the\ncolors are defined independent of their nature of creation or the device they\nare displayed on. The L*a*b* color space is used e.g. in Adobe Photoshop when\ngraphics for print have to be converted from RGB to CMYK, as the L*a*b* gamut\nincludes both the RGB and CMYK gamut. Also it is used as an interchange format\nbetween different devices as for its device independency.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Lab_color_space","recorded":1362902832,"links":39,"instances":["tonality","color","color"],"pdf":["http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/TIFF6.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/pdfs/cscolormgmt.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/njded/legal/reader.pdf","http://www.hunterlab.com/appnotes/an09_96a.pdf","http://www.fho-emden.de/~hoffmann/cielab03022003.pdf"],"categories":[],"headings":["Advantages","Differentiation","CIELAB","CIELAB-CIEXYZ conversions","Hunter Lab","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Lab_color_space.png/220px-Lab_color_space.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Example_of_LAB_color_enhancement.jpg/200px-Example_of_LAB_color_enhancement.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/6/006164b74314e2fdcdc34ac9d0aa6fe4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/1/e513d25d50d406bfffb6ed3c854bd8a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/d/54d9032c9eb5ba837cd2a43c280378d7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/9/2/2922c45a5876a0c41742413125b9c0e8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/a/1/6a168936c3532df1f439504ecc9d3b2f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/9/d29f14b5bb6a88f98f761465b4264a60.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/7/0d7ddf751383b99503ddba2374890e8c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/e/8/8e8ed7cdd8bd902cde9ea5344ea007a2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/2/aa209f3ad57ce887197a64fcf4d023d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/1/cb108e5afcbac4112ebe9a4f4f6cc9d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/7/837c9f1adf5d0e370c9a8972e0ccde69.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/7/fa76726ea737e66f66bb6a7d1952abe8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/0/a/30ab96a4da5cb5885560f8b3d59b3c7c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/4/fc4cb39a5f0d2294c0a3e7441c8d6b70.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/7/0d7ddf751383b99503ddba2374890e8c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/f/c/9fc8c2c34182c2e7db5b2d1e57667ad0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/9/4e9358d4dacc0a79bdcff2fc21571298.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/1/df140fedca6c26a2f925683497a072ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/9/b89c5124fe75b1e565f3ad93fb3b5ab5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lightness","color"],["metamerism","color"],["curve","tonality"],["lightness","color"]],"members":["curve","lightness","metamerism"],"related":["Opponent_process","Lightness_(color)","CIE_XYZ_color_space","CIE_1931_color_space","Spectral_power_distribution","Metamerism_(color)","Munsell_color_system","White_point","Rendering_intent","Standard_illuminant","Relative_luminance","RGB_color_model","CMYK_color_model","Helmholtzâ€“Kohlrausch_effect","Curve_(tonality)","Blend_modes","Gamut","Lightness","Colorfulness","Hue","Dan_Margulis","Imaginary_color","Adobe_Photoshop","ICC_profile","TIFF","PDF","Color_space","International_Commission_on_Illumination","Initialism","Color_vision","Color_solid","Gamut","CIELUV","Chrominance","Hue","Color_appearance_phenomena","Color_appearance_model","CIECAM02","Euclidean_distance","RGB_color_model","CMYK_color_model","Absolute_color_space","SRGB_color_space","Adobe_RGB_color_space","CIE_1931_color_space","White_point","Lightness_(color)","Tristimulus","Munsell","Lambert's_law","Munsell","Opponent_color","CIE_Standard_Illuminant_D65","Chromaticity","Adams_chromatic_valence_color_space","Chromaticity","JOSA","Adams_chromatic_valence_color_space"]}
