{"cursor":"35939","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n]] 'Lumber' (also known as 'timber') is wood in any of its stages from felling\nto readiness for use as structural material for construction, or wood pulp for\npaper production.\n\nLumber is supplied either rough or finished. Besides pulpwood, rough lumber is\nthe raw material for furniture-making and other items requiring additional\ncutting and shaping. It is available in many species, usually hardwoods, but it\nis also readily available in softwoods such as white pine, red pine and poplar\ndue to their low cost per board foot. Finished lumber is supplied in standard\nsizes, mostly for the construction industry, primarily softwood from coniferous\nspecies including pine, fir and spruce (collectively known as Spruce-pine-fir),\ncedar, and hemlock, but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring.\n","linknr":624,"url":"Lumber","recorded":1362572214,"links":56,"instances":["building","botany","structure","structural","wood","construction","geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/misc/miscpub_6409.pdf","http://www.woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/Wood-design-structural-properties-performance-fact-sheet.pdf","http://www.cfr.washington.edu/Research/factSheets/11-CINTRAmatsubstitute.pdf","http://www.woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/wood-design-durability-service-life-fact-sheet.pdf","http://feedstockreview.ornl.gov/pdf/billion_ton_vision.pdf","http://www.strongwell.com/PDFfiles/Safdeck%20Safplank/SAFPLANK%20SAFDECK%20Fiberglass%20Decking%20Systems%20Brochure.pdf","http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf","http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf"],"categories":["Forestry","Timber
