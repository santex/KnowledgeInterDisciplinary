Abnormal lymphocytes may divide faster than normal\ncells or they may live longer than they are supposed to. Lymphoma may develop in\nmany parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood or\nother organs and eventually they form a mass of\ncells called a tumor. Tumors grow and invade the space of surrounding tissues\nand organs, depriving them of oxygen and nutrients.\n\nTypically, lymphoma presents as a solid tumor of lymphoid cells. Treatment might\ninvolve chemotherapy and in some cases radiotherapy and/or bone marrow\ntransplantation, and can be curable depending on the histology, type, and stage\nof the disease. These malignant cells often\noriginate in lymph nodes, presenting as an enlargement of the node (a tumor). It\ncan also affect other organs in which case it is referred to as extranodal\nlymphoma. Extranodal sites include the skin, brain, bowels and bone. Lymphomas\nare closely related to lymphoid leukemias, which also originate in lymphocytes\nbut typically involve only circulating blood and the bone marrow (where blood\ncells are generated in a process termed haematopoesis) and do not usually form\nstatic tumors. There are many types of\nlymphomas, and in turn, lymphomas are a part of the broad group of diseases\ncalled hematological neoplasms.\n","linknr":798,"url":"Lymphoma","recorded":1362510769,"links":57,"instances":["epidemiology","hematopoietic","symptom","immunology","biology","protein","histology","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf","http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf"],"categories":["Lymphoma","Hematology","Anatomical
