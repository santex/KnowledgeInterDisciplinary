{"cursor":"25282","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'' - MHNT]] In biology, a 'type' is one particular specimen (or in some cases a\ngroup of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism\nis formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor\nor centralize the defining features of that particular taxon.\n\nA taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like\norganisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a\ndetailed published description (for example a species description) and on the\nprovision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for\nexamination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Lectotype","recorded":1362373244,"links":34,"instances":["biology","zoology","skull","biology","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf","http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf","http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/publications/pdf/bm-tp41.pdf"],"categories":["Biological concepts","Taxonomy","Zoological nomenclature","Botanical nomenclature"],"headings":["Type specimen","Older terminology","Types in botany","Types in zoology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Marocaster_coronatus_MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2_%28Close_up%29.jpg/220px-Marocaster_coronatus_MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2_%28Close_up%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg/220px-JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Mormopterus_acetabulosus_type_illustration.jpg/220px-Mormopterus_acetabulosus_type_illustration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Bufo_bufo_%28Marek_Szczepanek%29.jpg/220px-Bufo_bufo_%28Marek_Szczepanek%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["family","biology"],["calvaria","skull"],["morph","zoology"],["isotype","biology"]],"members":["isotype","morph","calvaria","family","set"],"related":["MHNT","Organism","Scientific_name","Taxon","Set_(mathematics)","Species_description","International_Commission_on_Zoological_Nomenclature","ICBN","Taxonomist","Museum","Herbarium","Scientific_nomenclature","Alpha_taxonomy","Taxonomy","Nomenclature_Codes","Natural_History_Museum","Spotted_Harrier","Holotype","Genera","Family_(biology)","Systematics","Name-bearing_type","Taxa","Botany","Zoology","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Taxon","Botanical_nomenclature","Herbarium","Microscope","Microscope_slide","Dandelion","Infraspecific_taxon","Cloning","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Species","Johann_Karl_Fuhlrott","Calvaria_(skull)","Type_species","Nominal_species","Genus","Subgenus","Type_genus","Nominal_genus","Type_series","Holotype","Lectotype","Name-bearing_type","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Species","Subspecies","Nematoda","Lectotype","Conspecificity","Neotype","Botanical_nomenclature","Zoological_nomenclature","Name-bearing_type","Syntype","Carl_Linnaeus","Protistan","RÃ©union_Parakeet","Bulo_Burti_Boubou","Bushshrike","Morph_(zoology)","Neotype","Allotype","Topotype","Generitype","Isotype_(biology)","Linnaeus","Genetics","Scientific_classification","Nomen_nudum","Nomen_dubium"]}
