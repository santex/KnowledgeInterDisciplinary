{"cursor":"14737","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues| cleanup = December 2008\n| introrewrite = February 2009\n}} A 'list of religion and science scholars' whose works have achieved prominent\nnotice in peer reviewed literature on the subject, particularly those\nprominently featured in [[Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science]], The Oxford\nHandbook of Religion and Science, [[Issues in Science and Religion]], The\nScience and Religion Forum's Reviews in Science and Religion, and scientists who\nhave won the Templeton Prize.\n\n*Gordon W.

Arthur Peacocke, Science and the Christian\nExperiment, Oxford University Press, 1971, in the preface (p.vii) writes \"These\n[issues] have been most magisterially surveyed by I. G.

Ian Barbour in Science and Religion: New Perspectives on the Dialogue\n(1968) (p.xi) writes  \"The problem of Part Two is the relation\nbetween religion and the methods of science. Is the scientific method the only\npath to knowledge? Are theology and science similar enterprises (as Coulson and\nSchilling argue) or are they radically different (as Evans suggests)? Such\nquestions about the relation of religion to science as a way of knowing are more\nbasic than problems arising from particular scientific theories. Many persons\ntoday find that their religious beliefs are challenged not by any specific\nscientific discoveries but by the conviction that assertions in science can be\nproven while those in religion cannot. Science has been one of the influences on\nthe \"death of God\" movement, as Ferre's essay indicates. Both Ferre and Evans\nprovide careful philosophical analyses of the problem of verifying or evaluating\ntheological statements. The central issue of Part Two, then, is the status of\nreligious beliefs in an age of science.  *\"The Similarity of\nScience and Religion\", Charles Coulson, pages 57-77 *\"The Threefold Nature of\nScience and Religion\", Harold K.

Indeed, his\nobseration that the rise of science has led to a loss of tradition throughout\nthe world is a view which is now held very widely as well as being a noted cause\nfor concern.\"  *Arthur Eddington: author of The Nature of the\nPhysical World (1928) and Why I Believe in God: Science and Religion, as a\nScientist Sees It (1930).

Schilling: author of Science\nand Religion (1962). Ian Barbour, [[Issues in Science and\nReligion]] (1966), p. 152 writes \"The scientific community, like any group in\nsociety, has a set of attitudes which are influenced by but not identical with\nthose of the culture at large. Schilling [\"A Human Enterprise\" Science, June 6,\n1958, Vol. 127, p.1324] gives a vivid portrayal:  It has its own\nideals and characteristic way of life; its own standards, mores, conventions,\nsigns and symbols, language and jargon, professional ethics, sanctions and\ncontrols, authority, institutions and organizations, publications; its own\ncreeds and beliefs, orthodoxies and heresies--and effective ways of dealing with\nthe latter. This community is affected, as are other communities, by the usual\nvagaries, adequacies, and shortcomings of human beings. It has its politics, its\npulling and hauling, its pressure groups; its differing schools of thought, its\ndivisions and schisms; its personal loyalties and animosities, jealousies,\nhatreds, and rallying cries; its fads and fashions. Mary\nB. Hesse reviews his book Science and Religion: An Interpretation of Two\nCommunities in Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Volume 3, Issue 1,\n(Autumn, 1963), page 112-113, where she writes \"There remain however\npersistent, half-conscious, impressions among the religious that science is\nsomehow a danger to true spirituality, and among the non-religious that science\nhas once and for all refuted the claims of religion. Professor Schilling's book\nhas the important merit of taking seriously the intellectual and social aspects\nof these half-conscious impressions, and of showing how mis- taken is the belief\nthat science and religion can go their separate ways in utter disregard of each\nother. ...reading this book no one ought to doubt that the stereotypes described\nat the outset are not merely caricatures, but serious distortions. But still the\nsynthetic view which is surely the aim of the book somehow fails to come across\nwith the requisite punch. Is this because yet deeper issues remain to be\ndiscussed? Can the claim of Christianity to be based on experience in a way\nparallel to science really be sustained? And if not, then what is its relation\nto expe- rience? And what about the vexed question of religious language?\"\n *Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: author of Science and Christ\n(1965, English Translation). *Thomas Torrance: author of ''Space, Time and\nIncarnation\", \"Space Time and Resurrection\", and \"Theological Science\", literary\nexecutor for the philosopher and scientist Michael Polanyi, www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/.../TAD24-1-fnl-pg32-38-\npdf.pdf and winner of 1978 Templeton Prize. *B.
