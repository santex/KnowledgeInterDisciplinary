{"cursor":"26224","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Laboratory Information Management System' (LIMS), sometimes referred to as a\n'Laboratory Information System' (LIS) or 'Laboratory Management System' (LMS),\nis a software-based laboratory and information management system that offers a\nset of key features that support a modern laboratory's operations. Those key\nfeatures include â but are not limited to â workflow and data tracking support,\nflexible architecture, and smart data exchange interfaces, which fully \"support\nits use in regulated environments.\" The features\nand uses of a LIMS have evolved over the years from simple sample tracking to an\nenterprise resource planning tool that manages multiple aspects of laboratory\ninformatics.\n\nDue to the rapid pace at which laboratories and their data management needs\nshift, the definition of LIMS has become somewhat controversial. As the needs of\nthe modern laboratory vary widely from lab to lab, what is needed from a\nlaboratory information management system also shifts. The end result: the\ndefinition of a LIMS will shift based on who you ask and what their vision of\nthe modern lab is. Dr. Alan McLelland of the\nInstitute of Biochemistry, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow highlighted this problem in\nthe late 1990s by explaining how a LIMS is perceived by an analyst, a laboratory\nmanager, an information systems manager, and an accountant, \"all of them\ncorrect, but each of them limited by the users' own perceptions.\"\n\nHistorically the LIMS, LIS, and Process Development Execution System (PDES) have\nall performed similar functions. Historically the term \"LIMS\" has tended to be\nused to reference informatics systems targeted for environmental, research, or\ncommercial analysis such as pharmaceutical or petrochemical work. \"LIS\" has\ntended to be used to reference laboratory informatics systems in the forensics\nand clinical markets, which often required special case management tools. The\nterm \"PDES\" has generally applied to a wider scope, including, for example,\nvirtual manufacturing techniques, while not necessarily integrating with\nlaboratory equipment.\n\nIn recent times LIMS functionality has spread even farther beyond its original\npurpose of sample management. Assay data management, data mining, data analysis,\nand electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) integration are all features that have\nbeen added to many LIMS, enabling the\nrealization of translational medicine completely within a single software\nsolution. Additionally, the distinction between a LIMS and a LIS has blurred, as\nmany LIMS now also fully support comprehensive case-centric clinical data.\n","linknr":296,"url":"Laboratory_informatics_system","recorded":1362481260,"links":29,"instances":["computing","united_states","bioinformatics","material"],"pdf":["http://www.starlims.com/Intl/AL-Wood-Reprint-9-07.pdf","http://www.starlims.com/Intl/AL-Wood-Reprint-9-07.pdf","http://www.rsc.org/pdf/andiv/tech.pdf","http://www.rsc.org/pdf/andiv/tech.pdf","http://files.limstitute.com/share/lbgprofiles/findlims.pdf","http://files.limstitute.com/share/lbgprofiles/findlims.pdf","http://www.starlims.com/Intl/AL-Wood-Reprint-9-07.pdf","http://www.starlims.com/Intl/AL-Wood-Reprint-9-07.pdf","http://www.labvantage.com/resources/pdf/whitepapers/ThinClient1101JY21CYL.pdf","http://www.labvantage.com/resources/pdf/whitepapers/ThinClient1101JY21CYL.pdf"],"categories":["Laboratory information management system","Information systems","Health informatics","Healthcare software"],"headings":["History","Technology","Distinction between a LIMS and a LIS","Standards","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Icos_Laboratories.JPG/220px-Icos_Laboratories.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Lab_worker_with_blood_samples.jpg/220px-Lab_worker_with_blood_samples.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sample","material"],["sample","material"],["accession_number","bioinformatics"],["client","computing"],["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"]],"members":["client","food_and_drug_administration","accession_number","sample"],"related":["Software","Laboratory","System","Workflow","Sample_(material)","Laboratory_informatics","Process_Development_Execution_System","Laboratory_equipment","Assay","Data_mining","Electronic_laboratory_notebook","Relational_database","Personal_computers","Wireless_networking","Georeference","XML","Electronic_laboratory_notebook","Software_as_a_service","Sample_(material)","Accession_number_(bioinformatics)","Barcode","Phenotype","CLIA","Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act","Good_Laboratory_Practice","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Electronic_signature","Sequencing","Binary_large_object","Electronic_Data_Interchange","Audit","Barcode","Calibration","Workflow","Client_(computing)","Web_browser","Web_based_LIMS","Software_as_a_service","Warranty","Microsoft",".NET_Framework","Laboratory_information_system","Biology","Wastewater_treatment_plant","Clinical_trial","Good_manufacturing_practice","Food_and_Drug_Administration","HIPAA","Title_21_CFR_Part_11","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","ISO/IEC_17025","ISO_15189","Good_laboratory_practice","List_of_LIMS_software_packages","Laboratory_informatics","Electronic_lab_notebook","21_CFR_11","Data_management","Scientific_management","Process_Development_Execution_System"]}
