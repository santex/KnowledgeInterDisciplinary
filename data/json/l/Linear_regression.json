{"cursor":"57767","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, which has one independent variable]]\n\nIn statistics, 'linear regression' is an approach to modeling the relationship\nbetween a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables\ndenoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called [[simple linear\nregression]]. More than one explanatory variable is multiple linear regression.\n(This in term should be distinguished from [[multivariate linear regression]],\nwhere multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single\nscalar variable.)\n\nIn linear regression, data is modelled using linear predictor functions, and\nunknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called\n[[linear model]]s. Most commonly, linear regression refers to a model in which\nthe conditional mean of y given the value of X is an affine function of X. Less\ncommonly, linear regression could refer to a model in which the median, or some\nother quantile of the conditional distribution of y given X is expressed as a\nlinear function of X. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression\nfocuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on\nthe joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of\nmultivariate analysis.\n\nLinear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied\nrigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is\nbecause models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to\nfit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because\nthe statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\n\nLinear regression has many practical uses. Most applications of linear\nregression fall into one of the following two broad categories:\n* If the goal is prediction, or forecasting, linear regression can be used to\n  fit a predictive model to an observed data set of y and X values. After\n  developing such a model, if an additional value of X is then given without its\n  accompanying value of y, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of\n  the value of y.\n* Given a variable y and a number of variables X 1, ...,\n  X p that may be related to y, linear regression analysis can be\n  applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between y and the\n  X j, to assess which X j may have no relationship with y\n  at all, and to identify which subsets of the X j contain redundant\n  information about y.\n\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but\nthey may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the âlack of fitâ\nin some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by\nminimizing a penalized version of the least squares loss function as in ridge\nregression. Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models\nthat are not linear models. Thus, while the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear\nmodel\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.\n","linknr":914,"url":"Linear_regression","recorded":1362483645,"links":47,"instances":["mathematics","statistics","mathematics","statistics","mathematics","mathematics","economics","probability_theory","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
