{"cursor":"4237","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"South African Football clubs regularly changed their names. Former Premier\nSoccer League (PSL) Chief Executive Trevor Phillips complained that regular name\nchanges and license buy outs was turning the PSL into a \"mumbo-jumbo\"\nleague. Clubs in the top-tier were sometimes bought by businessman\nand renamed to have the same name as a club with previous history. In May 2008,\nthis was partially resolved when governing body FIFA stepped in to prevent clubs\npurchasing licenses to play in a higher league.\n\nIn 2002, the league organises opted to purchase two clubs; Free State Stars (Qwa-\nQwa) and Ria Stars (Polokwane) and dissolve them to reduce fixture congestion.\nEach club was purchased for R8million. Free State Stars were\noriginally known as Qwa Qwa Stars. Another club known as Free State Stars F.C.\nhas been established since. The owner of the original Free State Stars purchased\na club in the lower divisions Maholosiane and renamed it to Free State Stars.\n\nThe club Dynamos sold their PSL license to AmaZulu who were formerly known as\nZulu Royals in 2006. A new team known as Dyanmos F.C. was established in the\nwake of the sale in a lower division.\n\nTembisa Classic sold their PSL license to Maritzburg United\n\nWits University renamed their Premier Soccer League team to Bidvest Wits in time\nfor the 2006/07 season. Bidvest, a major services, distribution and trading\ncompany sponsored the club for several seasons before purchasing naming rights\nto the club.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" !Original Club Name !New Club Name !Date Changed !Reason\nfor change\n|-\n|Khakhu Fast XI |Mapate Silver Stars\n|1998\n|\n|-\n|Mapate Silver Stars |HP Silver Stars\n|2000\n|Larry Brookstone, the owner of Highlands Park, bought the majority of shares.\nDespite the new ownership, the club continued to play at Peter Mokaba Stadium in\nPolokwane.\n|-\n|HP Silver Stars |Silver Stars\n|200x\n|Name was shortened, when the Highlands Park junior team stopped as a nursery\nteam for the club.\n|-\n|Silver Stars |Platinum Stars |May 2007 |Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) entered as\nthe clubs sponsor in 2006 and relocated the team to play at Royal Bafokeng\nStadium in Phokeng.
