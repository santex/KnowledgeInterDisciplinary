The list includes all Indian captains of men's,\nwomen's and youth cricket. India became a full member of the Imperial Cricket\nConference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926. On 25 June\n1932 it became the Test nation after England, Australia, South Africa, the West\nIndies and New Zealand when they took on England at Lord's. They played only\nseven tests, which were all against England, before the Second World War, losing\nfive matches and drawing twice. Their first game against other opposition came\nin 1947â49 when they played Australia.\n\nThe Indian team's greatest successes came in 1983, when they won the Cricket\nWorld Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev, and 2011, when they won the world\ncup again under Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Also, they won the Under-19 World Cup\nthree times under the captaincy of Mohammad Kaif in 2000, 2008 under Virat Kohli\nand in 2012 under Unmukt Chand . Also, under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh\nDhoni, India won the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup. India came runner-up in World\nCup 2003 under Sourav Ganguly who has the record of most number of Indian test\nwins (11) under his leadership in overseas. The record of most number of Indian\ntest wins (24) currently held under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\nMithali Raj led India to its best result in Women's ODI cricket when the team\nadvanced to the finals of the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup. Raj is also one of\nthe three women's captains who have led their side to a victory in women's Test\ncricket, the others being Shantha Rangaswamy and Mamatha Maben.\n\n__TOC__ Where a player has a
