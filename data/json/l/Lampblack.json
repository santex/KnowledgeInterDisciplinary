Carbon black is a\nform of amorphous carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, although\nits surface-area-to-volume ratio is low compared to that of activated carbon. It\nis dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and\nsignificantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon) content. However, carbon black is widely used as a model compound\nfor diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon black is\nused as a pigment and reinforcement in rubber and plastic products.\n\nThe current International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluation is\nthat, \"Carbon black is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)\". Short-term exposure to high concentrations of carbon black dust\nmay produce discomfort to the upper respiratory tract, through mechanical\nirritation.\n","linknr":265,"url":"Lampblack","recorded":1362375316,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.combustion-institute.it/proceedings/MCS-7/papers/RKC/RKC-14.pdf","http://www.combustion-institute.it/proceedings/MCS-7/papers/RKC/RKC-14.pdf","http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Publications/techrep42/TR42-Full.pdf","http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Publications/techrep42/TR42-Full.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0102.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0102.pdf"],"categories":["Pigments","Inorganic pigments","Carbon","Rubber properties","Elastomers","IARC Group 2B carcinogens"],"headings":["Common uses","Reinforcing carbon blacks","Pigment","Surface chemistry","Carcinogenicity studies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Worker_at_carbon_black_plant2.jpg/220px-Worker_at_carbon_black_plant2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Petroleum","Fluid_catalytic_cracking","Coal_tar","Vegetable_fats_and_oils","Amorphous_carbon","Activated_carbon","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer","Carcinogen","List_of_IARC_Group_2B_carcinogens","Upper_respiratory_tract","Polypropylene","Ultraviolet","Radar_absorbent_material","Gum_vulcanizate","Styrene-butadiene","Tensile_strength","MPa","Fumed_silica","Colour_Index_International","Albedo","Bone_char","Artisan","Chemisorption","Carboxyl_group","Quinone","Phenols","Epidemiology","Cohort_studies","Cancer_staging","Personal_protective_equipment","Activated_carbon","Biochar","Kv√¶rner-process","English_language","German_language","International_Carbon_Black_Assosciation","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Handbook_of_Texas"]}
