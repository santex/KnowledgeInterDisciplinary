{"cursor":"3521","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Linkage isomerism' is the existence of co-ordination compounds that have the\nsame composition differing with the connectivity of the metal to a ligand.\n\nTypical ligands that give rise to linkage isomers are: *thiocyanate,\nSCN − *selenocyanate, SeCN − *nitrite,\nNO 2− *sulfite, SO 32−\n\nExamples of linkage isomers are violet-colored [(NH 3) 5Co-\nSCN] 2+ and orange-colored [(NH 3) 5Co-\nNCS] 2+ . The isomerization of the S-bonded isomer to the N-bonded\nisomer occurs intramolecularly. In the complex,\ndichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II), linkage isomerism of dimethyl\nsulfoxide ligands can be observed in the NMR spectrum due to the effect of S vs.\nO bonding on the methyl groups of DMSO. The proper notation for linkage\nisomerism is the kappa notation where the atom directly bonding to the metal is\nproceeded by the lowercase Greek letter kappa; Îº. For example,\nNO 2− is represented as nitrito-Îº-N and nitrito-Îº-O,\nreplacing the old system of trivial names such as nitro and nitroso. IUPAC.\nCompendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed.
