It can also provide flow control and automatic repeat\nrequest (ARQ) error management mechanisms.\n\nThe LLC sublayer acts as an interface between the media access control (MAC)\nsublayer and the network layer.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Logical_link_control","recorded":1362540392,"links":30,"instances":["computing","data"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Logical link control|"],"headings":["Operation","Application examples","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","computing"],["flow_control","data"]],"members":["protocol","flow_control"],"related":["OSI_model","Computer_networking","Protocol_(computing)","Data_link_layer","Multiplexing","Internet_Protocol","IPX","Decnet","Appletalk","Flow_control_(data)","Automatic_repeat_request","Media_access_control","Network_layer","Multiplexing","Media_Access_Control","Transmission_Control_Protocol","IPX","X.25","LAPB","IEEE_802.2","IEEE_802","IEEE_802.3","Ethernet","EtherType","IEEE_802.5","IEEE_802.11","Fiber_distributed_data_interface","Automatic_repeat_request","Ethertype","Ethernet_II_framing","CSMA/CA","IEEE_802.2","High-Level_Data_Link_Control","Cisco_HDLC","Modem","Point-to-Point_Protocol","LAPM","GPRS","SNDCP","Data_link_layer","ITU-T","G.hn","Virtual_Circuit_Multiplexing","Subnetwork_Access_Protocol"]}
