Lignans are\none of the major classes of phytoestrogens, which are estrogen-like chemicals\nand also act as antioxidants. The other classes of phytoestrogens are the\nisoflavones and coumestans. Plant lignans are polyphenolic substances derived\nfrom phenylalanine via dimerization of substituted cinnamic alcohols (see\ncinnamic acid), known as monolignols, to a dibenzylbutane skeleton '2'. This\nreaction is catalysed by oxidative enzymes and is often controlled by\ndirigent proteins.\n\n\n\nMany natural products, known as phenylpropanoids, are built up of C6C3 units (a\npropylbenzene skeleton '1') derived from cinnamyl units just as terpene\nchemistry builds on isoprene units. Structure '3' is a neolignan, a structure\nformed by joining the two propylbenzene residues at other than the Î²-carbon atom\nof the propyl side chain. [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neolignane\nneolignane at en.wiktionary]\n\nSome examples of lignans are pinoresinol, podophyllotoxin, and steganacin.\n\nWhen part of the human diet, some lignans are metabolized to form mammalian\nlignans known as enterodiol ('1') and enterolactone ('2') by intestinal\nbacteria. Lignans that can be metabolized to form mammalian lignans are\npinoresinol, lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol,\nhydroxymatairesinol, syringaresinol and sesamin.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Lignan","recorded":1362375572,"links":23,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lignans|"],"headings":["Food sources","Medicinal Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Lignan.svg/300px-Lignan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Enterodiol_and_Enterlactone.svg/250px-Enterodiol_and_Enterlactone.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dimerization","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["dimerization","radical"],"related":["Chemical_compound","Plant","Phytoestrogen","Estrogen","Antioxidant","Phytoestrogen","Isoflavone","Coumestan","Polyphenol","Phenylalanine","Dimerization_(chemistry)","Cinnamic_acid","Monolignol","Dibenzylbutane","Catalysis","Oxidative_enzyme","Dirigent_protein","Phenylpropanoid","Terpene","Isoprene","Propyl","Pinoresinol","Podophyllotoxin","Steganacin","Enterodiol","Enterolactone","Bacteria","Pinoresinol","Lariciresinol","Secoisolariciresinol","Matairesinol","Hydroxymatairesinol","Syringaresinol","Sesamin","Flax_seed","Sesame_seed","Secoisolariciresinol_diglucoside","Rye","Wheat","Oat","Barley","Soybean","Cruciferous_vegetables","Broccoli","Cabbage","Apricot","Strawberry","Brassica","Estrogen","Radical_(chemistry)","Herbalism","Naturopathic_medicine","Nutrition","Phytonutrients"]}
