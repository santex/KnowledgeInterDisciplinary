As it might be the case for this landscape, some have a visual appeal (being\n  beautiful or picturesque).]]\n\n'Landscape' comprises the visible features of an area of land, including the\nphysical elements of landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water\nbodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover\nincluding indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of\nland use, buildings and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and\nweather conditions.\n\nCombining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human\npresence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect the living synthesis\nof people and place vital to local and national identity. Landscapes, their\ncharacter and quality, help define the self-image of a region, its sense of\nplace that differentiates it from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to\npeople’s lives.\n\nThe Earth has a vast range of landscapes including the icy landscapes of polar\nregions, mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands and\ncoastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal\nforests and tropical rainforests, and agricultural landscapes of temperate and\ntropical regions.\n\nLandscape may be further reviewed under the following specific categories:\nlandscape art, cultural landscape, landscape ecology, landscape planning,\nlandscape assessment and landscape design.\n","title":"landscape","headings":["Etymology","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Landscape_art","2: Cultural_landscape","2: Landscape_ecology","2: Landscape_design","1: Argentina","1: Terrestrial_ecoregion","1: Landform","1: River","1: Lake","1: Sea","1: Land_cover","1: Vegetation","1: Land_use","1: Lighting","1: Weather","1: National_identity","1: Earth","1: Polar_region","1: Mountain","1: Desert","1: Island","1: Coast","1: Forest","1: Wooded","1: Boreal_forests","1: Tropical_rainforests","1: Agricultural","1: Temperate","1: Tropical","1: Landscape_planning","1: Landscape_assessment","1: Kenneth_Olwig","1: Cognitive_semantics#Conceptualization_and_construal","1: Human_Geography","1: Richard_Hartshorne","1: Sky","1: Oceans","1: Perception","1: Carl_Sauer","1: Geography","1: Cultural_landscapes","1: Humanistic_geography","1: Information_processing","1: Environmental_psychology","1: Theatre","1: Picturesque","1: Alexander_Baumgarten","1: Beauty","1: Immanuel_Kant","1: Philosophy","1: Geomorphology","1: Hardscape","1: Landscape_architecture","1: Landscape_history","1: Landscaping","1: Natural_landscape","1: Softscape","1: Taskscape"]}
