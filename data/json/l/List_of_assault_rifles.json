{"cursor":"47554","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" assault rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov and chambered for the\n intermediate 7.62x39mm cartridge. It is the most widely known assault rifle in\n the world.]]\n\nAn assault rifle is a selective fire rifle or carbine typically firing\nammunition with muzzle energies and sizes intermediate between those of handgun\nand more traditional high-powered rifle ammunition. Assault rifles are\ncategorized between light machine guns, intended more for sustained automatic\nfire in a support role, and submachine guns, which fire a handgun cartridge\nrather than a rifle cartridge. Assault rifles are the standard small arms in\nmost modern armed forces, having largely replaced or supplemented larger, more\npowerful rifles, such as the World War II-era M1 Garand and Tokarev SVT. Belt-\nfed weapons or rifles with very limited capacity fixed magazines are generally\nnot considered assault rifles.\n\nSemi-automatic rifles are not always classified as assault rifles as they are\nnot fully automatic and some are not designed for military use. However, in\nmedia firearms reporting the term \"assault rifle\" usually refers to visual\nappearance rather than internal functionality. Similar full sized weapons, with\nfull-auto capabilities chambered in full-sized rifle rounds, are known as Battle\nrifles. Examples of Battle Rifles are the FN FAL, H&K G3 and M14 rifle. For\nthese type of firearms, see List of battle rifles.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! Name !! Year of intro !! Country of origin !! Primary cartridge !!
