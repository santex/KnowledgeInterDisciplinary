{"cursor":"70304","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For units of measure primarily used in countries where English is not the main\nlanguage, see the article specific to that country, a list of which can be found\nin the [[systems of measurement]] article. :For unusual units of measure\ninvented primarily for amusement, see [[List of humorous units of measurement]]\n\nAn 'unusual unit of measurement' is a unit of measurement that does not form\npart of a coherent system of measurement; especially in that its exact quantity\nmay not be well known or that it may be an inconvenient multiple or fraction of\nbase units in such systems. This definition is deliberately not exact since it\nmight seem to encompass units such as the week or the light-year which are quite\n\"usual\" in the sense they are often used; if they are used out of context, they\nmay be \"unusual,\" as demonstrated by the FFF system of units.\n\nUnusual units of measure are sometimes used by scientists, especially physicists\nand mathematicians, and other technicians, engineers and computer programmers,\neither humorously or for real convenience when dealing with objects in the real\nworld whose quantities in more conventional units may be awkward to use.\nScientists studying nuclear reactions use the barn quite frequently; however,\nits use is extremely rare for other scientific disciplines. Unusual units are\nalso employed by journalists and science instructors in an attempt to help\npeople who may not be able to grasp extremely large or small numbers or\nunfamiliar scientific units. \"An area the size of Denmark\" and the banana\nequivalent dose are classic examples. Whether such comparisons actually are\nmeaningful is open to debate, since the comparative quantity itself may not be\nwell known with much accuracy. (e.g., what size and cultivar of the banana is\nthe unit based on?)\n","linknr":1102,"url":"List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement","recorded":1362560277,"links":32,"instances":["time","unit","unit","communications","establishment","unit","length","mass","mass","purity","time","unit","computing","project_management","unit","time","music","length","unit","engineering","geography","linguistics","software"],"pdf":["http://www.routesonthered.ca/pdf/lake_agassiz.pdf","http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf","http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf","http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf","http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf","http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf","http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf"],"categories":["Units
