The\nelectrophilic carbocations produced during ether cleavage react with bisulfite\nions (HSO 3- ) to give sulfonates.\n\n:R-O-R' + H + â R + + R'OH :R + + HSO 3-\n â R-SO 3H\n\nThe primary site for ether cleavage is the Î±-carbon (carbon atom attached to the\naromatic ring) of the propyl (linear three carbon) side chain. The following\nstructures do not specify the structure since lignin and its derivatives are\ncomplex mixtures: the purpose is to give a general idea of the structure of\nlignosulfonates. The groups labeled \"Q\" can be a wide variety of groups found in\nthe structure of lignin. Sulfonation occurs on the side chains, not on the\naromatic rings, like in p-toluenesulfonic acid.\n\nLignosulfonate have very broad ranges of molecular mass (they are very\npolydisperse). A range of from 1000â140,000 da has been reported for softwood\nlignosulfonates with lower values reported for hardwoods.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Lignin_sulfonate","recorded":1362511891,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780471238966/kirk/article/lignlin.a01/current/pdf","http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780471238966/kirk/article/lignlin.a01/current/pdf"],"categories":["Papermaking","Petroleum production","Organic polymers","Polyelectrolytes"],"headings":["Preparation","Uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Lignosulfonate.png/450px-Lignosulfonate.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["CAS_registry_number","Polyelectrolyte","Polymer","Wood_pulp","Sulfite_process","Ether","Lignin","Electrophilic","Carbocations","Propyl","P-toluenesulfonic_acid","Molecular_mass","Polydispersity_index","Atomic_mass_unit","Calcium_hydroxide","Concrete","Cement","Cement_mill","Rawmill","Deflocculant","Viscosity","Plasterboard","Stucco","Drilling_mud","Tannic_acid","Quebracho_tree","Pesticides","Dyes","Carbon_black","Tanning","Leather","Redox","Softwood","Vanillin","Dimethyl_sulfide","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Solvent","Sulfides","Sulfur","Methyl","Ethers","Nitrogen_dioxide"]}
