Liquid water cannot\npersist at the Moon's surface, and water vapour is quickly decomposed by\nsunlight and lost to outer space. However, scientists have since the 1960s\nconjectured that water ice could survive in cold, permanently shadowed craters\nat the Moon's poles.\n\nWater, and the chemically related hydroxyl group (OH), can also exist in forms\nchemically bound to lunar minerals (rather than as free water), and evidence\nstrongly suggests that this is indeed the case in low concentrations over much\nof the Moon's surface. In fact, adsorbed water is\ncalculated to exist at trace concentrations of 10 to 1000 parts per\nmillion.\n\nInconclusive evidence of free water ice at the lunar poles was accumulated from\na variety of observations suggesting the presence of bound hydrogen. In\nSeptember 2009, India's [[Chandrayaan-1]] detected water on the\nMoon and hydroxyl absorption lines in reflected sunlight.\nIn November 2009, NASA reported that its LCROSS space probe had detected a\nsignificant amount of hydroxyl group in the material thrown up from a south\npolar crater by an impactor; {{Cite news\n| first=Jonas last=Dino coauthors=Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite\n| Team authorlink= title=LCROSS Impact Data Indicates Water on Moon\n| date=November 13, 2009 publisher=NASA\n| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/prelim_water_results.html\n| accessdate = 2009-11-14 language = }} this may be attributed to water-\n| bearing materials â what appears to be \"near pure\n| crystalline water-ice\".
