In many preparations,\npieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys, like in mixed grill\nor meurav Yerushalmi. Liver is often made into spreads. Well-known examples\ninclude liver pÃ¢tÃ©, foie gras, chopped liver, and leverpastej. Liver sausages\nsuch as Braunschweiger and liverwurst are also a valued meal. Liver sausages may\nalso be used as spreads. A traditional South African delicacy, namely\nSkilpadjies, is made of minced lamb's liver wrapped in netvet (caul fat), and\ngrilled over an open fire.\n\nAnimal livers are rich in iron and vitamin A, and cod liver oil is commonly used\nas a dietary supplement. Traditionally, some fish livers were valued as food,\nespecially the stingray liver. It was used to prepare delicacies, such as\npoached skate liver on toast in England, as well as the beignets de foie de raie\nand foie de raie en croute in French cuisine.
