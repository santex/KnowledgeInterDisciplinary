The most common type is designed for three-phase electric power,\nin which three isolated inductors are each wired in series with one of the three\nline phases. http://www.cosphi.com/line-load-reactor-applications.html Line\nreactor configurations Line reactors are generally installed in motor\ndriven equipment to limit starting current, and may be used to protect Variable-\nfrequency drives and\nmotors. http://ecmweb.com/mag/electric_line_reactors_vfds/\n","linknr":92,"url":"Line_reactor","recorded":1362538325,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electromagnetic components"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/30px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Inductor","Electric_power","Attenuation","Three-phase_electric_power","Variable-frequency_drive"]}
