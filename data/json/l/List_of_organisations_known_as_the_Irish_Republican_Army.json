{"cursor":"10400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Ira}}\n\n\nThe 'IRA' ('Irish Republican Army') is a name used to describe several armed\nmovements in Ireland in the 20th and 21st centuries, though the first known use\nof the term occurred in the Fenian raids on Canada in the 1860s.\n\nAll claim descent from the original Irish Republican Army, which was formed from\nthe Irish Volunteers. It was the army of the Irish Republic, declared by DÃ¡il\nÃireann in 1919. Most Irish people dispute the claims of more recently created\norganizations that insist that they are the only legitimate descendants of the\noriginal IRA, often referred to as the \"Old IRA\".\n\nThe playwright and former IRA member Brendan Behan once said that the first\nissue on any IRA agenda was \"the split\". For the IRA, that has\nconstantly been the case. The first split came after the Anglo-Irish Treaty in\n1921, with supporters of the Treaty forming the nucleus of the National Army of\nthe newly-created Free State, while the anti-treaty forces continued to use the\nname Irish Republican Army. After the end of the Irish Civil War, the IRA was\naround in one form or another for forty years, when it split into the Official\nIRA and the Provisional IRA in 1969. The latter then had its own breakaways,\nnamely the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, each claiming to be the true\nsuccessor of the Army of the Irish Republic.\n\n* The original IRA (in later years, known as the \"Old\" IRA), recognised by the\n  First DÃ¡il as the legitimate army of the Irish Republic in April 1921, split\n  into pro-Treaty forces (the National Army, also known as the Government forces\n  or the regulars) and anti-Treaty forces (the Republicans, irregulars or\n  Executive forces) after the Treaty. *The Irish Republican Army (1922â1969) -\n  the anti-treaty IRA which fought and lost the civil war and which thereafter\n  refused to recognise either the Irish Free State or Northern Ireland, deeming\n  them both to be creations of British imperialism. It existed in one form or\n  another for over 40 years before splitting in 1969.\n* The Official IRA (OIRA), the remainder of the IRA after the 1969 split with\n  the Provisionals; led by Cathal Goulding and primarily Marxist in its\n  political orientation. It is now inactive in the military sense, while its\n  political wing, Official Sinn FÃ©in, became the Workers' Party of Ireland.\n* The Provisional IRA (PIRA), which broke from the OIRA in 1969 over the\n  latter's failing to protect Catholic communities in Northern Ireland. Though\n  strongly opposed to the OIRA's Marxism, it also has a left-wing orientation\n  and increasing political activity.\n* The Continuity IRA (CIRA), broke from the PIRA in 1986 because the latter\n  ended its policy on abstentionism (thus recognising the authority of the\n  Republic of Ireland).\n* The Real IRA (RIRA), a 1997 breakaway from the PIRA consisting of members\n  opposed to the peace process.\n* In April 2011, former members of the Provisional IRA announced a resumption of\n  hostilities, and that \"they had now taken on the mantle of the mainstream\n  IRA.\" They further claimed \"We continue to do so under the name of the Irish\n  Republican Army. We are the IRA.\" and insisted that they \"were entirely\n  separate from the Real IRA, Oglaigh na hEireann (ONH), and the Continuity\n  IRA.\" They claimed responsibility for the April killing of PSNI constable\n  Ronan Kerr as well as responsibility for other attacks that had previously\n  been claimed by the Real IRA and ONH.\n","linknr":182,"url":"List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army","recorded":1374765371,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ira_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Fenian_raids","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Irish_Volunteers","/wiki/Irish_Republic","/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann","/wiki/Brendan_Behan","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty","/wiki/Irish_Defence_Forces","/wiki/Irish_Civil_War","/wiki/Irish_Republic","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/First_D%C3%A1il","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army_(1922%E2%80%931969)","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Official_IRA","/wiki/Marxist","/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Ireland","/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Continuity_Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Abstentionism","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Real_Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process","/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Ronan_Kerr","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army#endnote_1","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Fine_Gael_Party","/wiki/Irish_Defence_Forces","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Liam_Lynch_(general)","/wiki/Irish_Civil_War","/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)","/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera","/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/S-Plan","/wiki/Northern_Campaign_(IRA)","/wiki/Christmas_Raid","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/IRA_Abwehr_World_War_II","/wiki/Nazi_Germany","/wiki/Abwehr","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Border_Campaign_(IRA)","/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in","/wiki/Marxist","/wiki/Class_struggle","/wiki/The_Troubles","/wiki/Official_IRA","/wiki/Official_Sinn_F%C3%A9in","/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Ireland","/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Socialist_Party","/wiki/Seamus_Costello","/wiki/Irish_People%27s_Liberation_Organisation","/wiki/Democratic_Left_(Ireland)","/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Labour_Party_(Ireland)","/wiki/Provisional_IRA","/wiki/Provisional_Sinn_F%C3%A9in","/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary","/wiki/British_army","/wiki/Garda_S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na","/wiki/General_order","/wiki/Ruair%C3%AD_%C3%93_Br%C3%A1daigh","/wiki/Gerry_Adams","/wiki/Irish_republican_legitimatism","/wiki/Abstentionism","/wiki/D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann","/wiki/Republican_Sinn_F%C3%A9in","/wiki/Continuity_IRA","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Liberation_Army","/wiki/%C3%93glaigh_na_h%C3%89ireann_(CIRA_splinter_group)","/wiki/Real_Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/32_County_Sovereignty_Movement","/wiki/%C3%93glaigh_na_h%C3%89ireann_(Real_IRA_splinter_group)","/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit&section=2","#ref_1","/wiki/Genealogy_of_the_IRA","/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisations_known_as_the_Irish_Republican_Army&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2005/0228/1109422091207.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/former-provos-claim-kerr-murder-and-vow-more-attacks-15146426.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_organisat
