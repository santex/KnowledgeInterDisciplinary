Photo from painting in private collection.'']] Born in 1858\nin Pitcairn, New York, Lucy Bacon attended art school at the Art Students League\nof New York and the National Academy of Design in New York City before leaving\nfor France in 1892. In Paris she enrolled at the AcadÃ©mie Colarossi. However,\nshe was dissatisfied with her studies there and asked expatriate American\npainter Mary Cassatt for advice. Ms. Cassatt introduced her to Camille Pissarro\nand Lucy wound up studying with him.\n\nShe then moved to Ãragny and did some paintings that are clearly\nImpressionistic. By 1898, she was exhibiting Impressionist style paintings such\nas \"A San Jose Garden\" at the San Francisco Art Association. But her letters to\nher family indicate she had ongoing health problems that prevented her from\npainting full-time. Thinking that the climate of California would assuage her\nchronic illness, she moved to San Jose. Unmarried, she taught at Washburn School\nand painted from her home studio.\n\nHer niece, Ruth, married Robert (Bob) Vickery, the son of William Kingston\nVickery, who in 1891 and 1893 organized the first exhibitions of Impressionism\nin San Francisco (acquired, at least in part, through Lucy's connections, along\nwith the help of Mrs. William H. Crocker.) The Vickery family owned Vickery,\nAtkins & Torrey, an important gallery in San Francisco in the 1890s. In 1897,\nLucy Bacon received a painting of Fortifications Ã  la GlaciÃ¨re painted by Paul\nCÃ©zanne. Ms. Bacon bequeathed this painting to her nephew, Bruce Jeremiah Bacon\n(the son of her brother, Albert Bacon and Mary E. Bacon.) This painting has\nremained in the family and been handed down from generation to generation.\n\nIn 1905, while Lucy Bacon renounced her painting career and devoted herself to\nreligion, possibly finding it eased her health problems, she continued to teach\nart. By 1909, she was living in San Francisco where she died in 1932.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Lucy_Bacon","recorded":1375054447,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/California","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Camille_Pissarro","/wiki/Impressionist","/wiki/File:Gennevilliers_-_Lucy_Bacon_%7E1895.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Gennevilliers_-_Lucy_Bacon_~1895.JPG","/wiki/File:Gennevilliers_-_Lucy_Bacon_%7E1895.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Gennevilliers","/wiki/Pitcairn,_New_York","/wiki/Art_Students_League_of_New_York","/wiki/National_Academy_of_Design","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/France","/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Colarossi","/wiki/Mary_Cassatt","/wiki/Camille_Pissarro","/wiki/%C3%89ragny-sur-Epte","/wiki/San_Francisco","/wiki/San_Jose,_California","/wiki/William_Kingston_Vickery","/wiki/William_H._Crocker","/wiki/Vickery,_Atkins_%26_Torrey","/wiki/San_Francisco","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/American_Impressionism","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=edit&section=2","http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&artist=110948","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&oldid=559094835","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1857_births","/wiki/Category:1932_deaths","/wiki/Category:19th-century_American_painters","/wiki/Category:20th-century_American_painters","/wiki/Category:American_women_painters","/wiki/Category:American_Impressionist_painters","/wiki/Category:Artists_from_California","/wiki/Category:People_from_San_Jose,_California","/wiki/Category:People_from_San_Francisco,_California","/wiki/Category:Painters_from_California","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lucy+Bacon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Lucy+Bacon","/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","/wiki/Talk:Lucy_Bacon","#","/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Lucy_Bacon","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Lucy_Bacon","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&oldid=559094835","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q448249","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Lucy_Bacon&id=559094835","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Lucy+Bacon","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Lucy+Bacon&oldid=559094835&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Lucy_Bacon&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%8D%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD,_%D0%9B%D1%8E%D1%81%D0%B8","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q448249#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Bacon","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&mod
