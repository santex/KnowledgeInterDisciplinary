Lithophytes feed off nutrients from rain water and\n nearby decaying plants, including their own dead tissue. grow in fissures in\n rocks where soil or organic matter has accumulated.\n\nExamples of lithophytes include several [[Paphiopedilum]] orchids, ferns, many\nalgae and liverworts. Species which only grow on rock or gravel, are obligate\nlithophytes. Species which not only grow on rocky substrate are facultative\nlithophytes.\n\n, Elkhorn fern, Birds Nest Fern and moss growing on Hawkesbury Sandstone at\nChatswood West, Australia]]\n\nAs nutrients tend to be rarely available to lithophytes or chasmophytes, many\nspecies of carnivorous plants can be viewed as being pre-adapted to life on\nrocks. By consuming prey, these plants can gather more nutrients than non-\ncarnivorous lithophtytes. McPherson, S.R., 2009. Redfern\nNatural History Productions.
