However,\nKnight may have been influenced by another female collie named Lassie,\nfeatured in the 1859 story \"The Half-brothers\" written by British writer\nElizabeth Gaskell.\n\nPublished in 1940, Knight's novel was filmed by MGM in 1943 as [[Lassie Come\nHome]] with a dog named Pal playing Lassie. Pal then appeared with the stage\nname \"Lassie\" in six other MGM feature films through 1951. Pal's owner and\ntrainer Rudd Weatherwax then acquired the Lassie name and trademark from MGM and\nappeared with Pal (as \"Lassie\") at rodeos, fairs, and similar events across\nAmerica in the early 1950s. In 1954, the long-running, Emmy winning television\nseries [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]] debuted, and, over the next 19 years,\na succession of Pal's descendants appeared on the series. The \"Lassie\" character\nhas appeared in radio, television, film, toys, comic books, animated series,\njuvenile novels, and other media. Pal's descendants continue to play Lassie\ntoday.<ref></ref>\n",
