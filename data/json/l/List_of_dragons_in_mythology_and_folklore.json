'Lung 2'\n|in Wade-Giles romanization.) The Chinese dragon, is a creature in Chinese\n|mythology that also appears in other Asian cultures, and is sometimes called\n|the Oriental (or Eastern) dragon. Depicted as a long, snake-like creature with\n|four claws (or five for the imperial dragon), it has long been a potent symbol\n|of auspicious power in Chinese folklore and art. This type of dragon, however,\n|is sometimes depicted as a creature constructed of many animal parts. It might\n|have the fins of some fish, or the horns of a stag. - Indian dragon NÄga A\n|serpentine dragon common to all cultures influenced by Hinduism. They are often\n|hooded like a cobra and may have several heads depending on their rank. They\n|usually have no arms or legs but those with limbs resemble the Chinese dragon.\n|- Indonesian/Malay dragon Naga or Nogo Derived from the Indian nÄga, belief in\n|the Indo-Malay dragon spread throughout the entire Malay Archipelago along with\n|Hinduism. The word naga is still the common Malay/Indonesian term for dragons\n|in general. \"dragon.\" kamus.net. 2010. http://www.kamus.net/result.php?w=en-\n|usa&q=dragon&submit=Search&e=0 (29 June 2011). Like its Indian\n|counterpart, the naga is considered divine in nature, benevolent, and often\n|associated with sacred mountains, forests, or certain parts of the sea. -\n|Japanese dragon 'RyÅ«' Similar to Chinese dragons, with three claws instead of\n|four. They are usually benevolent, associated with water, and may grant wishes.\n|- Khmer Dragon 'Neak' The Khmer dragon, or neak is derived from the Indian\n|nÄga. Like its Indian counterpart, the neak is often depicted with cobra like\n|characteristics such as a hood. The number of heads can be as high as nine, the\n|higher the number the higher the rank. Odd-headed dragons are symbolic of male\n|energy while even headed dragons symbolize female energy. Traditionally, a neak\n|is distinguished from the often serpentine Makar and Tao, the former possessing\n|crocodilian traits and the latter possessing feline traits. A dragon princess\n|is the heroine of the creation myth of Cambodia. - rowspan=\"3\" | Korean dragon\n|'Yong (Mireu)' A sky dragon, essentially the same as the Chinese lÃ³ng. Like the\n|lÃ³ng, yong and the other Korean dragons are associated with water and weather.\n|In pure Korean, it is also known as 'mireu'. - 'Imoogi' A hornless ocean\n|dragon, sometimes equated with a sea serpent. Imoogi literally means, \"Great\n|Lizard\". The legend of the Imoogi says that the sun god gave the Imoogi their\n|power through a human girl, which would be transformed into the Imoogi on her\n|17th birthday. Legend also said that a dragon-shaped mark would be found on the\n|shoulder of the girl, revealing that she was the Imoogi in human form. - 'Gyo'\n|A mountain dragon. In fact, the Chinese character for this word is also used\n|for the imoogi. - Philippine Dragon '[[Bakunawa]]' The Bakunawa appears as a gigantic serpent that lives in the sea. Ancient\n|natives believed that the Bakunawa caused the moon or the sun to disappear\n|during an eclipse. It is said that during certain times of the year, the\n|Bakunawa arises from the ocean and proceeds to swallow the moon whole. To keep\n|the Bakunawa from completely eating the moon, the natives would go out of their\n|houses with pots and pans in hand and make a noise barrage in order to scare\n|the Bakunawa into spitting out the moon back into the sky. Some say that the\n|Bakunawa is known to kill people by imagining their death and remote in eye\n|contact. - Vietnamese dragon 'Rá»ng' or 'Long'\n(Ly dynasty, Daiviet X)\n| These dragons' bodies curve lithely, in sine shape, with 12 sections,\n| symbolising 12 months in the year. They are able to change the weather, and\n| are responsible for crops. On the dragon's back are little, uninterrupted,\n| regular fins. The head has a long mane, beard, prominent eyes, crest on nose,\n| but no horns. The jaw is large and opened, with a long, thin tongue; they\n| always keep a chÃ¢u (gem/jewel) in their mouths (a symbol of humanity, nobility\n| and knowledge). - colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #ffa; text-align:\n| center; font-weight: bold;\" | European dragons - Catalan dragon '[[European\n| dragon#Dragons in Catalan mythology|drac]]' Catalan dragons are serpent-like\n| creatures with two legs (rarely four) and, sometimes, a pair of wings. Their\n| faces can resemble that of other animals, like lions or cattle. They have a\n| burning breath. Their breath is also poisonous, the reason by which dracs are\n| able to rot everything with their stench. A vÃ­bria is a female dragon. -\n| French dragons 'Dragon' Authors tend often to present the dragon legends as\n| symbol of Christianity's victory over paganism, represented by a harmful\n| dragon. The French representation of dragons spans much of European history,\n| and has even given its name to the dragoons, a type of cavalry. - Sardinian\n| dragon '[[scultone]]' The dragon named \"scultone\" or \"ascultone\" appears in\n| legends in Sardinia, Italy. It had the power to kill human beings with its\n| gaze. It was a sort of basilisk, lived in the bush and was immortal. -\n| Scandinavian & Germanic dragons '[[Lindworm]]' Lindworms are serpent-like\n| dragons with either two or no legs. In Nordic and Germanic heraldry, the\n| lindworm looks the same as a wyvern. The dragon Fafnir was a lindworm. -\n| English dragons '[[Wyvern]]' Wyverns are common in medieval heraldry. Their\n| usual blazon is statant. Wyverns are normally shown as dragons with two legs\n| and two wings. - Welsh dragons '[[Y Ddraig Goch]]' In Welsh mythology, after a\n| long battle (which the Welsh King Vortigern witnesses) a red dragon defeats a\n| white dragon; Merlin explains to Vortigern that the red dragon symbolizes the\n| Welsh, and the white dragon symbolizes the Saxons â thus foretelling the\n| ultimate defeat of the English by the Welsh. The ddraig goch appears on the\n| Welsh Â¬ -\n|The worm hill dragon\n|\n|700 AD the Anglo-Saxons settled and called it \"Wruenele\" this translates as\n|\"Wruen\" worm, reptile or dragon and \"ele\" hill. According to local folklore the\n|hill at Knotlow was the lair of a dragon and the terraces around it were made\n|by the coils of its tail. Knotlow is an ancient volcanic vent and this may\n|explain the myth. - The Bignor hill dragon\n|\n|There is a brief mention of a Dragon on Bignor Hill south of the village of\nBignor near the famous Roman Villa, apparently \"A Large dragon had its den on\nBignor Hill, and marks of its folds were to be seen on the hill\". Similar\nlegends have been told of ridges around other hills, such as at Wormhill in\nDerbyshire.\n|-\n|Zomok\n|\n| A giant winged snake, which is in fact a full-grown zomok. It often serves as\n| flying mount of the garabonciÃ¡s (a kind of magician). The sÃ¡rkÃ¡nykÃ­gyÃ³ rules\n| over storms and bad weather. - 'sÃ¡rkÃ¡ny'\n|\n| A dragon in human form. Most of them are giants with multiple heads. Their\n| strength is held in their heads. They become gradually weaker as they lose\n| their heads.\nIn contemporary Hungarian the word sÃ¡rkÃ¡ny is used to mean all kinds of dragons.\n|- Slavic dragons 'zmey', 'zmiy', 'Å¼mij', 'Ð·Ð¼ÐµÐ¹', or 'zmaj', or 'drak',\n|or 'smok'\n\n| Similar to the conventional European dragon, but multi-headed. They breathe\n| fire and/or leave fiery wakes as they fly. In Slavic and related tradition,\n| dragons symbolize evil. Specific dragons are often given Turkic names (see\n| Zilant, below), symbolizing the long-standing conflict between the Slavs and\n| Turks. However, in Serbian and Bulgarian folklore, dragons are defenders of\n| the crops in their home regions, fighting against a destructive demon Ala,\n| whom they shoot with lightning. {{cite book last = ÐÐµÑÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ first =\n| Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð´Ð°Ð½ title = ÐÐ¸ÑÑÐºÐ° Ð±Ð¸ÑÐ° ÑÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸Ñ Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´Ð°ÑÐ° publisher = \"ÐÑÐº ÐÐ°ÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ñ\" :\n| ÐÑÐ½Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ Ð¼ÑÐ·ÐµÑ year = 1981 location = Belgrade}} (A book in Serbian about\n| mythical creatures of Serbian traditions) {{cite web\n |last = ÐÐµÐ½Ð¾Ð²ÑÐºÐ°-Ð¡ÑÐ±ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð° |first = ÐÐ¸Ð»ÐµÐ½Ð° |title = ÐÐ¼ÐµÐ¹ |publisher = Ð Ð¾Ð´Ð¾Ð²Ð¾\n ÐÐ°ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ |url = http://bgrod.org/Vjara/index.php?p=bogove&page=zmej\n |accessdate = 2007-08-13}} (An extract from the book ÐÐ¼ÐµÑÑ Ð² Ð±ÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð»ÐºÐ»Ð¾Ñ\n (The Dragon in Bulgarian Folklore), in Bulgarian)\n|-\n|Armenian dragon\n| '[[Vishap]]' Related to European dragons -\n|Siberian dragon\n| '[[YilbegÃ¤n]]' Related to European Turkic and Slavic dragons - Romanian\n| dragons '[[Balaur]], [[Zburator]]' Balaur are very similar to the Slavic zmey:\n| very large, with fins and multiple heads. - Chuvash dragons '[[Vere Celen]]'\n|Chuvash dragons represent the pre-Islamic mythology of the same region.\n|- Asturian and Leonese dragons '[[CuÃ©lebre]]' In Asturias and LeÃ³n mythology\n|the CuÃ©lebres are giant winged serpents, which live in caves where they guard\n|treasures and kidnapped xanas. They can live for centuries and, when they grow\n|really old, they use their wings to fly. Their breath is poisonous and they\n|often kill cattle to eat. Leonese language term Cuelebre comes from Latin\n|colÅ­bra, i.e., snake. - rowspan=\"3\" | Albanian Dragons 'Bolla'\n\n\n| In the Albanian mythology '[[Bolla]]' (also known as Bullar in South Albania),\n| is a type of serpentic dragon (or a demonic dragon-like creature) with a long,\n| coiled, serpentine body, four legs and small wings in ancient Albanian\n| folklore. This dragon sleeps throughout the whole year, only to wake on Saint\n| George's Day, where its faceted silver eyes peer into the world. The Bolla\n| does this until it sees a human. It devours the person, then closes its eyes\n| and sleeps again. Lurker, Manfred (1984). The Routledge Dictionary of Gods\n| and Goddesses, Devils and Demons, Taylor & Francis e-Library. p.35 Bolla\n| was worshiped as the deity Boa by the ancestors of Albanians, Illyrians. -\n| [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3J96wSxMaeYC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=illyrian-\n| +boa&source=bl&ots=qZxCl58_z7&sig=MdIlR5PeFUTeDj3nCZlw5yAo4aw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K-\n| SLfUIbmEozP0AXdkoCQAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=illyrian%20boa&f=false]\n| Bolla appears in the coat of arms of the House of Bua Shpata. -\n| '[[Kulshedra]]' In its twelfth year, the bolla evolves by growing nine\n| tongues, horns, spines and larger wings. At this time it will learn how to use\n| its formerly hidden fire-breathing abilities, and is now called a kulshedra or\n| 'kuÃ§edra' (hydra). The kuÃ§edra causes droughts and lives off human sacrifices.\n| Kulshedras are killed by '[[Drangue]]', Albanian winged warriors with\n| supernatural powers. Thunderstorms are conceived as battles between the\n| drangues and the kulshedras.\n|- 'Dreq' Dreq is the dragon (draco) proper. It was demonized by Christianity\n|  and now is one of the Albanian names of the devil. - Portuguese dragons\n|  '[[Cuco|Coca]]' In Portuguese mythology coca is a female dragon that fights\n|  with Saint George. She loses her strength when Saint George cuts off one of\n|  her ears. - Greek dragons 'DrÃ¡kÅn' - Î´ÏÎ¬ÎºÏÎ½ Cadmus fighting the Ismenian\n|  dragon (which guarded the sacred spring of Ares) is a legendary story from\n|  the Greek lore dating to before ca. 560â550 B.C. Greek dragons commonly had a\n|  role of protecting important objects or places. For example, the Colchian\n|  dragon watched the Golden Fleece and the Nemean dragon guarded the sacred\n|  groves of Zeus. [http://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/dragons.html]\n|  The name comes from the Greek \"drakeÃ®n\" meaning \"to see clearly\". [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O27-\n|  dragon.html] - Tatar dragons '[[Zilant]]' Really closer to a wyvern or\n|  cockatrice, the Zilant is the symbol of Kazan. Zilant itself is a Russian\n|  rendering of Tatar yÄ±lan, i.e., snake. - Turkish dragons 'Ejderha' or 'Evren'\n|  The Turkish dragon secretes flames from its tail, and there is no mention in\n|  any legends of its having wings, or even legs. In fact, most Turkish (and\n|  later Islamic) sources describe dragons as gigantic snakes. - Lithuanian\n|  Dragons 'Slibinas' This dragon is more of a hydra with multiple heads, though\n|  sometimes it does appear with one head. }\n\n* Aido Wedo, the Rainbow Serpent of Dahomey mythology\n* Apalala, a mythical river dragon who was converted to Buddhism\n* Apep or Apophis the giant snake or serpent from Egyptian mythology\n* Azazel is described as a dragon in the Apocalypse of Abraham\n* Azhi Dahaka in Avestan mythology.\n* Qinglong (or SeiryÅ«) in Chinese mythology, one of the Four Symbols (Chinese\n  constellation)\n* Bolla (also \"Bullar\"), the sleeping dragon of Albanian mythology\n* Brnensky drak (The dragon of Brno), the dragon killed nearby Moravian\n  city (legend)\n* Con rit is a water dragon from Vietnamese mythology\n* Dragon Kings, from Chinese mythology\n* The Dragon of Loschy Hill, of Yorkshire folklore\n* The Dragons of St. Leonard's Forest, of Sussex folklore\n* Fafnir, transformed dragon (Germanic mythology)\n* The Green Dragon of Mordiford, of Herefordshire folklore\n* Gorynych, Zmei, the most famous of Russian dragons\n* The Graoully of Metz, symbol of christianization over paganism.\n* Guivres from Medieval France\n* Huanglong, the Yellow Dragon of the Center, in Chinese mythology\n* JÃ¶rmungandr, the sea serpent or dragon in Norse mythology\n* The Knucker from Lyminster in Sussex\n* LagarfljÃ³tsormurinn, a lake monster or dragon living in the LagarfljÃ³t, near\n  EgilsstaÃ°ir, Iceland.\n* The Hydra, also called the Lernaean Hydra, from Greek Mythology is described\n  as a dragon-like animal\n* Illuyankas from Hittite mythology\n* Ladon from Greek mythology\n* The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh, of Northumbrian legend\n* The Lambton Worm, of Northumbrian legend\n* The Worm of Linton, of Scottish legend\n* The Ljubljana dragon, the protector dragon of Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia\n* The Longwitton dragon, of Northumbrian legend\n* Lotan/Leviathan from Levantine mythology and Hebrew scriptures, a demonic\n  dragon reigning the waters\n* The Meister Stoor Worm of Orkney legend\n* Mushussu, musrussu or sirrush, the Babylonian dragon from the Ishtar Gate\n* NÃ­Ã°hÃ¶ggr (the 'Dread Biter', also spelled Nidhogg) from Norse mythology\n* Ouroboros the \"tail-eater.\"\n* Orochi, the eight-headed serpent slain by Susanoo in Japanese mythology\n* Python, from Greek mythology, the snake killed by Apollo\n* Quetzalcoatl from Aztec mythology has a dragon-like aspect\n* RyÅ«jin, the dragon god of the sea in Japanese mythology.\n* SÃ¡rkÃ¡ny, dragon of Hungarian mythology\n* Smok Wawelski (the Wawel Dragon) from Polish mythology, was killed by a clever\n  shoemaker's apprentice\n* The Tarasque, tamed by Saint Martha\n* Thevetat\n* Tiamat and Abzu from Babylonian mythology are sometimes considered dragons\n* Typhon from Greek mythology is often thought of as a dragon\n* Vritra, a major asura in Vedic religion\n* The Whitby Wyrm of Yorkshire Folklore\n* Xiuhcoatl is a serpent from Aztec mythology\n* Yam from Levantine mythology\n* Teju Jagua from GuaranÃ­ mythology is described was a huge lizard with seven\n  dog-like heads, entitled to a \"fiery gaze\", and being associated as the god of\n  fruits, caves and (more common with the Dragons in Europe) as the protector of\n  hidden treasures\n* Zilant, by the Tataro-Bulgarian mythology lived in present-day Kazan and is\n  represented on the city's coat of arms\n* Zirnitra, dragon-god in Wendish mythology.
