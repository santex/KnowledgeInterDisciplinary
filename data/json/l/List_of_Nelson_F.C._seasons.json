A number of men in flat caps are standing in the\n background.]] Nelson F.C. is an English semi-professional association football\n club based in the town of Nelson, Lancashire. Founded in 1881, the club played\n friendly matches for its first eight years, before becoming one of the founder\n members of the Lancashire League in 1889. The\n team won the Lancashire League title in 1896, but disbanded in late 1898 and\n was suspended by the Lancashire Football Association following incidents\n involving fans at an FA Cup defeat at Southport Central. Nelson was accepted back into the Lancashire League the\n following season and in 1901, they joined the Lancashire Combination. Between\n 1915 and 1918, the team ceased play for the First World War. When competitive\n football restarted in England in 1919, they joined the Central League. Two seasons later, the club was invited to be one of the\n founder teams of the Football League Third Division North. They won the league\n in 1923, gaining promotion to the Football League Second Division. However, they stayed there for just one season,\n finishing second-bottom of the league and being relegated back to the Third\n Division.\n\nAfter finishing bottom of the division for the second time, Nelson left the\nFootball League in 1931 after failing re-election. They\nrejoined the Lancashire Combination, and played in the league for the next five\nseasons, before going bankrupt in 1936 and disbanding for a second time. The club returned to action following the Second World\nWar, and won the Lancashire Combination title in 1950 and 1952. Nelson continued\nto play in the same league until 1982, when the side achieved a third-placed\nfinish. In the same year, the non-league football\nsystem was re-organised, resulting in the formation of the North West Counties\nFootball League. The club was accepted into the league's Third Division, and was\ntransferred to the Second Division in 1987, as a result of the abolition of the\nthird tier. However, the following season the team was forced to leave the\nleague after their ground was deemed to be unfit.\nThey joined the West Lancashire League in 1988 and stayed there until 1992,\nnever finishing higher than 15th in four seasons. That year, the club was\naccepted back into the North West Counties League Second Division after\nimproving the stadium. The club played in the same division for the next 15\nyears, until they won promotion to the First Division, where they played until\nthe end of the 2009â10 season. On 16 July 2010, it was\nannounced that Nelson had resigned from the North West Counties Football League\nwith immediate effect.\n\nThe side first played in the FA Cup in 1893 and have reached the Second Round\nthree times, in 1926â27, 1930â31 and 1950â51. In the 1970s, the club entered the\nFA Trophy on a number of occasions, but never progressed past the Second\nQualifying Round. Since the club's first entry into the FA Vase in 1978, the\nside have reached the Second Round twice, in the 2001â02 and 2005â06 seasons.\n","linknr":386,"url":"List_of_Nelson_F.C._seasons","recorded":1375079295,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nelson_F.C._seasons&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nelson_F.C._seasons&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Nelson_F.C._1922-3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/Nelson_F.C._1922-3.jpg/300px-Nelson_F.C._1922-3.jpg","/wiki/File:Nelson_F.C._1922-3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division_North","/wiki/Nelson_F.C.","/wiki/England","/wiki/Association_football","/wiki/Nelson,_Lancashire","/wiki/Exhibition_match","/wiki/Lancashire_League_(football)","#cite_note-history1881-1","/wiki/Lancashire_County_Football_Association","/wiki/FA_Cup","/wiki/Southport_F.C.","#cite_note-history1881-1","/wiki/Lancashire_Combination","/wiki/Central_League_(football)","#cite_note-history1881-1","/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division_North","/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division","#cite_note-history1921-2","#cite_note-history1923-3","#cite_note-history1923-3","#cite_note-history1931-4","#cite_note-history1931-4","/wiki/Non-league_football","/wiki/North_West_Counties_Football_League","#cite_note-history1982-5","/wiki/West_Lancashire_Football_League","/wiki/North_West_Counties_Football_League_Premier_Division","#cite_note-history1982-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/FA_Trophy","/wiki/FA_Vase","#Seasons","#Key","#Footnotes","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Nelson_F.C._seasons&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/FA_Cup","/wiki/FA_Trophy","#endnote_FA_Trophy","/wiki/FA_Vase","#endnote_FA_Vase","/wiki/Exhibition_match","/wiki/1889%E2%80%9390_in_English_football","/wiki/1890%E2%80%9391_in_English_football","/wiki/1891%E2%80%9392_in_English_football","/wiki/1892%E2%80%9393_in_English_football","/wiki/1893%E2%80%9394_in_English_football","/wiki/1894%E2%80%9395_in_English_football","/wiki/1895%E2%80%9396_in_English_football","/wiki/1896%E2%80%9397_in_English_football","/wiki/1897%E2%80%9398_in_English_football","/wiki/1898%E2%80%9399_in_English_football","#endnote_Suspended","#endnote_Suspended","/wiki/1900%E2%80%9301_in_English_football","/wiki/1901%E2%80%9302_in_English_football","/wiki/1902%E2%80%9303_in_English_football","/wiki/1903%E2%80%9304_in_English_football","/wiki/1904%E2%80%9305_in_English_football","#endnote_FACupWin","/wiki/1905%E2%80%9306_in_English_football","/wiki/1906%E2%80%9307_in_English_football","/wiki/1907%E2%80%9308_in_English_football","/wiki/1908%E2%80%9309_in_English_football","/wiki/1909%E2%80%9310_in_English_football","/wiki/1910%E2%80%9311_in_English_football","/wiki/1911%E2%80%9312_in_English_football","/wiki/1912%E2%80%9313_in_English_football","/wiki/1913%E2%80%9314_in_English_football","/wiki/1914%E2%80%9315_in_English_football","/wiki/1919%E2%80%9320_in_English_football","/wiki/1920%E2%80%9321_in_English_football","/wiki/1921%E2%80%9322_in_English_football","/wiki/1922%E2%80%9323_in_English_football","#endnote_Champions","/wiki/1923%E2%80%9324_in_English_football","#endnote_HighLeague","/wiki/1924%E2%80%9325_in_English_football","/wiki/1925%E2%80%9326_in_English_football","/wiki/1926%E2%80%9327_in_English_football","#endnote_SecondRound","/wiki/1927%E2%80%9328_in_English_football","#endnote_GoalsConceded","#endnote_Re-election","/wiki/1928%E2%80%9329_in_English_football","/wiki/1929%E2%80%9330_in_English_football","/wiki/1930%E2%80%9331_in_English_football","#endnote_Away_defeats","#endnote_Relegated","/wiki/1931%E2%80%9332_in_English_football","/wiki/1932%E2%80%9333_in_English_football","/wiki/1933%E2%80%9334_in_English_football","/wiki/1934%E2%80%9335_in_English_football","/wiki/1935%E2%80%9336_in_English_football","#endnote_NelsonTown","/wiki/1946%E2%80%9347_in_English_football","/wiki/1947%E2%80%9348_in_English_football","/wiki/1948%E2%80%9349_in_English_football","/wiki/1949%E2%80%9350_in_English_football","/wiki/1950%E2%80%9351_in_English_football","/wiki/1951%E2%80%9352_in_English_football","#endnote_MostGoals","/wiki/1952%E2%80%9353_in_English_football","/wiki/1953%E2%80%9354_in_English_football","/wiki/1954%E2%80%9355_in_English_football","/wiki/1955%E2%80%9356_in_English_football","/wiki/1956%E2%80%9357_
