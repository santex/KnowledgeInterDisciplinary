He summarized and\nextended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume Mécanique Céleste\n(Celestial Mechanics) (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of\nclassical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of\nproblems. In statistics, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was\ndeveloped mainly by Laplace.<ref>Stigler, Stephen M. (1986). The History of\nStatistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty before 1900. Harvard University\nPress, Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nLaplace formulated Laplace's equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform\nwhich appears in many branches of mathematical physics, a field that he took a\nleading role in forming. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in\nmathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular\nhypothesis of the origin of the solar system and was one of the first\nscientists to postulate the existence of black holes and the notion of\ngravitational collapse.\n\nLaplace is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes\nreferred to as the French [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] or Newton of France, he\npossessed a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of\nhis contemporaries.<ref name=\"eb1911\">[Anon.] (1911)\n\"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Pierre_Simon,_Marquis_De_Laplace Pierre Simon,\nMarquis De Laplace]\", [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]</ref>\n\nLaplace became a count of the First French Empire in 1806 and was named a\nmarquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration.\n","title":"Pierre-Simon%20Laplace","headings":["Early years","Analysis, probability and
