{"cursor":"9518","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, the 'look-and-say sequence' is the sequence of integers\nbeginning as follows:\n\n: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ... .\n\nTo generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the\ndigits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the\nsame digit. For example:\n\n* 1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n* 11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n* 21 is read off as \"one 2, then one 1\" or 1211.\n* 1211 is read off as \"one 1, then one 2, then two 1s\" or 111221.\n* 111221 is read off as \"three 1s, then two 2s, then one 1\" or 312211.\n\nThe look-and-say sequence was introduced and analyzed by John Conway in his\npaper \"The Weird and Wonderful Chemistry of Audioactive Decay\" published in\n[[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|Eureka]] 46, 5â18 in 1986.\n\nThe idea of the look-and-say sequence is similar to that of run-length encoding.\n\nIf we start with any digit d from 0 to 9 then d will remain indefinitely as\nthe last digit of the sequence. For d different from 1, the sequence starts\nas follows:\n: d, 1d, 111d, 311d, 13211d, 111312211d, 31131122211d, â¦\nIlan Vardi has called this sequence, starting with d = 3, the 'Conway sequence'\n.
