For example, a teacher who\nteaches a third grade class and then goes on to teach the same students, the\nfollowing year, for the fourth grade.\n\nThis is distinct from the teacher of a multi-age class, who teaches a specific\nrange of school grades together. In this case, although each child remains with\nthe same teacher for multiple years, the group of students being taught changes\nannually as older children leave the group and are replaced by younger students\nentering.\n\nLooping is usual in Waldorf education, where the traditional goal has been for a\nprimary teacher to remain as the lead teacher of a class for eight consecutive\nyears, though in conjunction with numerous specialized teachers; Heiner\nUllrich, Rudolf Steiner, Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative\neducation, v.
