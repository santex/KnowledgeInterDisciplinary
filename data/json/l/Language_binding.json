To use these libraries from another (usually higher-level) language\nsuch as Java, Common Lisp, Python or Lua, a binding to the library must be\ncreated in that language, possibly requiring the recompilation of the\nlanguage's code depending on the amount of modification necessary. However,\nmost languages offer an interface to foreign functions, such as Python's ctypes\nand ecl's cffi and uffi.\n\nSoftware reuse is a major motivation for creating library bindings, rather than\nreimplementing the library in several languages. Another is the impossibility of\nimplementing certain algorithms efficiently in high-level languages.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Language_binding","recorded":1362371625,"links":26,"instances":["programming_language_","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","computer_science","computing","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Compilers","Computer libraries"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/HelloWorld.svg/50px-HelloWorld.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["library","computer_science"],["library","computer_science"],["c","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["common_lisp","programming_language_"],["python","programming_language"],["lua","programming_language"],["portable_object","computing"]],"members":["common_lisp","python","c","java","library","portable_object","lua"],"related":["Library_(computer_science)","Operating_system","Application_programming_interface","Library_(computer_science)","System_programming_language","Programming_language","C_(programming_language)","C++","Java_(programming_language)","Common_Lisp_(programming_language)_","Python_(programming_language)","Lua_(programming_language)","Software_reuse","Algorithm","Application_programming_interface","Application_Binary_Interface","Calling_convention","Common_Language_Infrastructure","Comparison_of_application_virtual_machines","Component_Object_Model","CORBA","Distributed_Component_Object_Model","Embedded_SQL","Foreign_function_interface","Freedesktop.org","D-Bus","Name_mangling","SWIG","Portable_object_(computing)","Porting","XPCOM","Wrapper_function"]}
