Lapdogs are not a specific breed, but is a generic term for a type of dog of\nsmall size and friendly disposition.\n\nLapdogs historically were kept in many societies around the world by individuals\nwith leisure time, as docile companion animals with no working function. Genetic\nanalysis reveals that lapdogs are among the earliest specific types of dogs to\nlive with people. Today, most lapdog breeds fall into the ''Toy'' breed group.\n",
