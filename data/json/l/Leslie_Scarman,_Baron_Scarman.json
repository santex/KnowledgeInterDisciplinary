He won\nscholarships to Radley College and then Brasenose College, Oxford, as a\nClassical Scholar, graduating in 1932 with a first.\n\nHe was called to the Bar in 1936. He remained briefless until World War II,\nwhich he spent in the RAF as a staff officer in England, North Africa, and then\ncontinental Europe and he was present with Lord Tedder when the German surrender\nwas accepted in Berlin. He returned to law in 1945, practising from\nFountain Court Chambers in London, and became a QC in 1957, and a High Court\njudge in 1961 – assigned to the Family Division. He joined the Court of\nAppeal in 1973 and was Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, a Law Lord, from 1977 until\nhis retirement in 1986.\n\nHe was appointed head of the Law Commission from 1965 to 1973, during which time\n27 Commission-inspired statutes were made law.\n\nAs a judge, Scarman's career had some controversial decisions. Although widely\nregarded as a liberal, he upheld the blasphemy conviction of [[Gay News]]\n(1979), punctured the GLC's [[Fares Fair]] low-cost public transport policy\n(1981), and supported the banning of trade unions at GCHQ (1985). He is best\nknown for chairing the public inquiry on the causes of the race riots in\nBrixton in 1981. He also chaired inquiries into the Northern Ireland riots of\nAugust 1969 (1969â1972), the Red Lion Square disorders (1975) and the Grunwick\ndispute (1977).\n\nAfter entering the House of Lords the more liberal aspects of his character\ndominated – he was chancellor of the University of Warwick, president of\nthe British Institute of Human Rights, and worked on behalf of the Prince's\nTrust, the Birmingham Six, and Charter 88 amongst many other projects. In 1991\nhe set up the Scarman Trust.\n\nHe was created an OBE in 1944, knighted in 1961, made a Privy Councillor in\n1973, and raised to the Peerage in 1977 as 'Baron Scarman', of Quatt in the\nCounty of Shropshire.\n\nHe married Ruth Wright in 1947, with whom he had one son. He died in 2004. -\n[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/minutes/041213/ldminute.htm\nAnnouncement of his death at the House of Lords] House of Lords minutes of\nproceedings, 13 December
