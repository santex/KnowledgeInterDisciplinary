The\nterm \"laser\" originated as an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated\nEmission of Radiation.<ref name = \"Gould1959\"/><ref></ref> Lasers differ from\nother sources of light because they emit light coherently. Its spatial coherence\nallows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, and this enables applications like\nlaser cutting and laser lithography. Its spatial coherence also keeps a laser\nbeam collimated over long distances, and this enables laser pointers to work.\nLaser also have high temporal coherence which allows them to have a very narrow\nspectrum, i.e., they only emit a single color of light. Their temporal coherence\nalso allows them to emit pulses of light that only last a femtosecond.\n\nLasers have many important applications. They are used in common consumer\ndevices such as DVD players, laser printers, and barcode scanners. They are used\nin medicine for laser surgery and various skin treatments, and in industry for\ncutting and welding materials. They are used in military and law enforcement\ndevices for marking targets and measuring range and speed. Laser lighting\ndisplays use laser light as an entertainment medium. Lasers also have many\nimportant applications in scientific research.\n","title":"laser","headings":["Fundamentals","Design","Laser physics","Continuous and pulsed modes of operation","History","Types
