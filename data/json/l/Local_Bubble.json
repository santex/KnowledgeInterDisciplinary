It is at least 300 light years across and has a neutral\nhydrogen density of about 0.05 atoms per cubic centimetre, or approximately one\ntenth of the average for the ISM in the Milky Way (0.5 atoms/cc), and one sixth\nof the Local Fluff, or Local Interstellar Cloud (0.3 atoms/cc). http://inte-\nrstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/introduction/neighborhood.html, Our\nLocal Galactic Neighborhood, NASA The hot diffuse gas in the Local Bubble\nemits X-rays.\n\nThe very sparse, hot gas of the Local Bubble is the result of supernovae that\nexploded within the past ten to twenty million years. [http://www.solstation.com/x-\nobjects/chimney.htm Local Chimney and Superbubbles], Solstation.com It was\nonce thought that the most likely candidate for the remains of this supernova\nwas Geminga (\"Gemini gamma-ray source\"), a pulsar in the constellation Gemini.\nMore recently, however, it has been suggested that multiple supernovae in\nsubgroup B1 of the Pleiades moving group were more likely responsible. {{cite journal\n | author = T.
