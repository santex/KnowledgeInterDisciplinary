{"cursor":"11861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'lactic acid bacteria (LAB)' comprise a clade of Gram-positive, low-GC, acid-\ntolerant, generally non-sporulating, non-respiring rod or cocci that are\nassociated by their common metabolic and physiological characteristics. These\nbacteria, usually found in decomposing plants and lactic products, produce\nlactic acid as the major metabolic end-product of carbohydrate fermentation.\nThis trait has, throughout history, linked LAB with food fermentations, as\nacidification inhibits the growth of spoilage agents. Proteinaceous bacteriocins\nare produced by several LAB strains and provide an additional hurdle for\nspoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, lactic acid and other\nmetabolic products contribute to the organoleptic and textural profile of a food\nitem. The industrial importance of the LAB is further evinced by their generally\nrecognized as safe (GRAS) status, due to their ubiquitous appearance in food and\ntheir contribution to the healthy microflora of human mucosal surfaces. The\ngenera that comprise the LAB are at its core [[Lactobacillus]], [[Leuconostoc]],\n[[Pediococcus]], [[Lactococcus]], and [[Streptococcus]] as well as the more\nperipheral [[Aerococcus]], [[Carnobacterium]], [[Enterococcus]], [[Oenococcus]],\n[[Sporolactobacillus]], [[Tetragenococcus]], [[Vagococcus]], and [[Weisella]];\nthese belong to the order Lactobacillales.\n","linknr":405,"url":"Lactic_acid_bacteria","recorded":1362556634,"links":21,"instances":["fermentation","unit","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lactobacillales|*"],"headings":["Characteristics","Metabolism","''Streptococcus'' reclassification","Bacteriophages","Probiotics","Exopolysaccharides","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Streptococci.jpg/220px-Streptococci.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","food"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["mole","unit"],["starter","fermentation"]],"members":["starter","mole","fermentation"],"related":["Clade","Gram-positive","Guanine","Cytosine","Metabolic","Physiological","Bacteria","Lactic_acid","Carbohydrate","Fermentation_(food)","Bacteriocins","Pathogen","Organoleptic","Generally_recognized_as_safe","Mucosal","Genus","Lactobacillales","Bacilli","Coccus","PH","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Lactic_acid","Carbohydrate","Catalase","Hexose","Metabolic_pathway","Glucose","Glycolysis","Mole_(unit)","Pyruvate","Redox","NADH","Adenosine_triphosphate","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Glucose-6-phosphate","Ethanol","Acetyl-CoA","Acetaldehyde","Catabolism","Serology","Starter_(fermentation)","Dairy","Cheese","Genome","Genomics","Biotechnology","Bacteriophage","Phage","Receptor_binding_protein","Bacteriophage","Polysaccharide","Saccharide","Gram-positive","Peptidoglycan","Genome","Cytoplasm","Probiotics","Ecosystem","Prebiotics","Carbohydrate","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Irritable_bowel_syndrome","Vaginosis","Bioactive","Exopolysaccharide","Functional_food","Malolactic_fermentation","Gaffkaemia"]}
