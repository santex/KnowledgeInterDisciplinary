Evidence for the magma ocean hypothesis comes from the highly\nanorthositic compositions of the crust in the lunar highlands, as well as the\nexistence of rocks with a high concentration of the geochemical component\nreferred to as KREEP.\n\nAges of formation and crystallization of the lunar magma ocean have been\nconstrained by studies of isotopes of hafnium, tungsten, samarium, and\nneodymium. The magma ocean formed about 70 million years after the history of\nthe Solar System began, and most of the ocean had crystallized by about 215\nmillion years after that beginning (Brandon, 2007).\n","linknr":98,"url":"Lunar_magma_ocean","recorded":1362268772,"links":19,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lunar science"],"headings":["References","Extended scientific references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/25px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crust","geology"]],"members":["crust"],"related":["Giant_impact_hypothesis","Anorthositic","Crust_(geology)","Geology_of_the_Moon","KREEP","Hafnium","Tungsten","Samarium","Neodymium","Solar_System"]}
