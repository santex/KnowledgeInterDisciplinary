{"cursor":"17869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Many successful British television shows (particularly sitcoms and reality\nshows) have been remade for the American market. The amount of reworking varies\nwith some shows (such as All in the Family) keeping the basic situation and then\nadding many original features while others have taken complete scripts verbatim\n(such as Amanda's).\n\nThere are relatively few examples of American shows remade for the British\nmarket (the majority of these being game shows), and the British television\naudience are very accepting of the American originals while being much less\naccepting of British remakes (see, for instance, the failure of [[Brighton\nBelles]], the British remake of [[The Golden Girls]]). The U.S. remakes have\nsometimes been imported back into the UK. By contrast, original British\nprogrammes are rarely seen on the major U.S. networks in modern times (in the\n1960s the airing of UK-produced programs such as [[The Avengers (TV series)|The\nAvengers]] and [[Fireball XL5]] on U.S. network TV occurred frequently) and are\nusually broadcast only on the Public Broadcasting Service and on cable\ntelevision, especially BBC America, with only a few purely British shows having\ngained mainstream popularity in the United States.
