It is located in the central area of\nthe state along the tidal portion of the Patapsco River, an arm of the\nChesapeake Bay. The independent city is often referred to as 'Baltimore City' to\ndistinguish it from surrounding Baltimore County. Founded in 1729, Baltimore is\nthe second largest seaport in the Mid-Atlantic United States and is situated\ncloser to Midwestern markets than any other major seaport on the East Coast.<ref\nname=Hughes></ref> Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of\nentry for immigrants to the United States and a major manufacturing\ncenter.<ref></ref> After a decline in manufacturing, Baltimore shifted to a service-\noriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University\nserving as the city's top two employers.<ref></ref>\n\nAt 621,342 as of July 1, 2012, the population of Baltimore increased by 1,100\nresidents over the previous year ending over six decades of population loss\nsince its peak in 1950. The Baltimore Metropolitan Area has grown steadily to\napproximately 2.7&nbsp;million residents in 2010; the 20th largest in the\ncountry.<ref></ref> Baltimore is also a principal city in the larger\nBaltimore–Washington metropolitan area of approximately 8.4&nbsp;million\nresidents.<ref name=PopEstCSA></ref>\n\nDowntown Baltimore is the economic center of the metropolitan region and home to\nthe city’s fastest-growing neighborhoods. Within a one-mile radius of Pratt and\nLight streets, there are 103,000 jobs, 42,000 residents, and 18,000 students.\nThe area ranks 8th in the country for residential density and 15th in the\ncountry for employment density. With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore\nhas been dubbed \"a city of neighborhoods,\" and is nicknamed 'Charm City'. The\ntalents of writers Edgar Allan Poe and H.L. Mencken, musician James \"Eubie\"\nBlake, and singer Billie Holiday, as well as the city's role in the War of 1812\nand Francis Scott Key's writing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" have all\ninfluenced the city's historical importance.<ref name=\"baltimore.org\"></ref>\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, almost a quarter of the jobs in the Baltimore-\nregion are science, technology, engineering and math positions, which makes\nBaltimore rank 8th out of 100 U.S. metropolitan areas for its concentration of\nSTEM jobs. The Baltimore Area is known for health and science, which is in part\nattributed to the prestigious Johns Hopkins University school system, the\nUniversity of Maryland-Baltimore, and other smaller schools such as University\nof Baltimore, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Loyola University and\nUniversity of Notre Dame.<ref
