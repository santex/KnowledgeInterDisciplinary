The radiation causes cellular degradation due to destruction of cell\nwalls and other key molecular structures within the body; this destruction in\nturn causes the symptoms. The symptoms can begin within one or two hours and may\nlast for several months. The\nterms refer to acute medical problems rather than ones that develop after a\nprolonged period.\n\nThe onset and type of symptoms depends on the radiation exposure. Relatively\nsmaller doses result in gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting and\nsymptoms related to falling blood counts such as infection and bleeding.\nRelatively larger doses can result in neurological effects and rapid death.\nTreatment of acute radiation syndrome is generally supportive with blood\ntransfusions and antibiotics, with some more exotic treatments such as bone\nmarrow transfusions being required in extreme cases.\n\nSimilar symptoms may appear months to years after exposure as chronic radiation\nsyndrome when the dose rate is too low to cause the acute form. Radiation exposure can also increase the probability of\ndeveloping some other diseases, mainly different types of cancers. These\ndiseases are sometimes referred to as radiation sickness, but they are never\nincluded in the term acute radiation syndrome.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Radiation_sickness","recorded":1372154926,"links":[],"instances":["physics","circulatory","symptom","dermatology","unit","radiation","sv","gy","radiation","unit","medical","microbiologist","biology","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radioactive contamination","Radiology","Radiobiology","Radiation health effects","Medical emergencies","Causes of death","Effects of external causes"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Cause","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Prevention","Management","History","In other animals","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["acute","medicine"],["gray","unit"],["gray","unit"],["rad","unit"],["anorexia","symptom"],["gray","unit"],["gray","unit"],["fatigue","medical"],["shock","circulatory"],["ulcer","dermatology"],["effective_dose","radiation"],["gray","gy"],["rad","unit"],["sievert","sv"],["rem","unit"],["cross_section","physics"],["cell","biology"],["alexander_goldfarb","microbiologist"],["orders_of_magnitude","radiation"]],"members":["cross_section","shock","anorexia","ulcer","rad","orders_of_magnitude","sievert","gray","effective_dose","rem","fatigue","alexander_goldfarb","cell","acute"],"related":["Ionizing_radiation","Acute_(medicine)","Gastrointestinal","Chronic_radiation_syndrome","Radiation-induced_cancer","Haematopoiesis","Gastrointestinal","Neurological","Vascular","Prodrome","Blood_cells","Aplastic_anemia","White_blood_cells","Platelets","Anemia","Red_blood_cells","Gray_(unit)","Gray_(unit)","Rad_(unit)","Nausea","Vomiting","Anorexia_(symptom)","Abdominal_pain","Gray_(unit)","Dizziness","Headache","Decreased_level_of_consciousness","Nausea","Vomiting","Headache","Fever","Absorbed_dose","Gray_(unit)","Nausea","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Headache","Fever","Central_nervous_system","Seizures","Tremor","Ataxia","Lethargy","Leukopenia","Fatigue_(medical)","Purpura","Hemorrhage","Infections","Epilation","Hypotension","Shock_(circulatory)","Erythema","Itch","Blister","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Sebaceous_gland","Sweat_gland","Atrophy","Fibrosis","Necrosis","Chernobyl_disaster","Beta_particles","Desquamation","Oxford,_England","Linear_no-threshold_model","Effective_radiation_dose","Prognosis","Nuclear_explosion","Criticality_accident","Radiotherapy","Therac-25","Solar_flare","Goiânia_accident","Leide_das_Neves_Ferreira","Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko","Chronic_radiation_syndrome","Radioactive_contamination","Nuclear_fallout","Erythema","Low_Earth_orbit","Galactic_cosmic_ray","Solar_proton_event","Absorbed_dose","Equivalent_dose","Effective_dose_(radiation)","Committed_dose","Gray_(Gy)","Rad_(unit)","Sievert_(Sv)","Rem_(unit)","Therac-25","Cecil_Kelley_criticality_accident","Radiotherapy","Complete_blood_count","Inverse-square_law","Forceps","Erythema","Nuclear_warfare","Nuclear_War_Survival_Skills","Cresson_Kearny","United_States","Radiography","Photon","Beta_particle","Bremsstrahlung","Neutron_activation","Cross_section_(physics)","Radioactive_contamination","Gas_mask","Potassium_iodide","Cell_death","Cell_(biology)","Blood_cells","Bone_marrow","Intestinal_villus","Intestines","Antibiotics","Blood_products","Colony_stimulating_factors","Stem_cell_transplant","Neutropenia","Treatment_of_infections_after_accidental_or_hostile_exposure_to_ionizing_radiation","Anaerobic_infection","Metronidazole","Neutropenia","Sepsis","Quinolones","Ciprofloxacin","Levofloxacin","Cefepime","Ceftazidime","Gentamicin","Amikacin","Wilhelm_Röntgen","Free_radical","Radiation-induced_cancer","Marie_Curie","Aplastic_anemia","Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki","Midori_Naka","ORISE","IRSN","Radiation-induced_cancer","Criticality_accident","Harry_K._Daghlian","Pajarito_accident","Louis_Slotin","Nikolay_Khokhlov","Alexander_Goldfarb_(microbiologist)","Soviet_submarine_K-19","Orphan_source","Radiation_accident_in_Mexico_City","Soviet_submarine_K-27","Soviet_submarine_K-431","Therac-25","Radiation_accident_in_Morocco","Chernobyl_disaster","Goiânia_accident","Radiotherapy_accident_in_Zaragoza","Radiotherapy_accident_in_Costa_Rica","Samut_Prakan_radiation_accident","Instituto_Oncologico_Nacional","Yuri_Shchekochikhin","Roman_Tsepov","Alexander_Litvinenko_poisoning","Bellona_Foundation","Mayapuri_radiological_accident","Hibakusha","List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents","List_of_military_nuclear_accidents","Orders_of_magnitude_(radiation)","5-Androstenediol","CBLB502","Ex-Rad","Michihiko_Hachiya","John_Hersey","Ibuse_Masuji","Ernest_J._Sternglass","Norman_Solomon","Harvey_Wasserman","International_Atomic_Energy_Agency"]}
