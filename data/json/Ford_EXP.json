The coupes shared the\nwheelbase and mechanicals of the Ford Escort with a longer, more stylish body.\nIt was first shown at the Chicago Auto Show and introduced in April 1981 as an\nearly 1982 model.\n\nComparing the EXP to the original Thunderbird, Ford Division General Manager\nLouis E. Latalf said: \"We're introducing another two-seater with the same flair,\nbut the EXP will be a very affordable, very fuel efficient car matched to the\nlifestyles of the\neighties.\" [http://www.fordexp.com/sections/history.asp?yrMk=82E\nfordexp.com]\n\nAs the 1980s began, Ford was in a transitional phase. Henry Ford II retired as\nchairman, Lee Iaccoca was at Chrysler, and chief stylist Eugene Bordinat had\nalso stepped down. Ford's marketing strategy at the time was based on their\nperception of American society in the early 1980s. Ford felt that the growing\nnumber of one and two person households, combined with the lifestyle of the\nyounger target audience who desired a small sporty car, led them to the\nconclusion that Americans wanted a \"lively little car that is dependable,\nefficient, and good-\nlooking\". [http://www.fordexp.com/content/default.asp?artid=85\nfordexp.com]\n\nFord's marketing department believed that if a customer wanted room for four or\nfive passengers, they would buy an Escort or a Fairmont. The marketing\nphilosophy for the EXP's seating was rather like that of a European gran\nturismo; a personal vehicle for two, with a cargo area in back for emergency\ntransport of anything or anyone else. While it was moderately successful in\nsales for a two seater, it not only lacked performance but its styling still\ndescribed as \"a sound beating with the ugly stick ... unbelievably awkward,\noddly proportioned lines and a curious headlight treatment\". [http://www.carlustblog.com/2008/05/car-disgust--\nfo.html carlust] Although the EXP still has its fans, it never gained the\ncult following of cars such as the Pontiac Fiero, Toyota MR2, and Honda CRX\nwhich were built and styled around their own unique platforms. It ultimately\nwould be dropped in favor of the 2+2 Ford Probe.\n","linknr":559,"url":"Ford_EXP","recorded":1362543782,"links":26,"instances":["car_body_style","north_america"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ford vehicles|EXP","Front-wheel-drive vehicles","Compact cars","Hatchbacks","1980s automobiles","Vehicles introduced in 1981","Sports cars","Front-wheel-drive sports cars","Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States"],"headings":["Name origin","First generation (1982–1985)","Return of the EXP","Second generation (1985½–1988½)","Discontinuation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/FordEXP1982.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/MercuryLN7.jpg/280px-MercuryLN7.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/FordEXP1986.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ford_escort","north_america"],["ford_escort","north_america"],["2+2","car_body_style"],["ford_escort","north_america"]],"members":["ford_escort"],"related":["Ford_Motor_Company","Sport_compact","Ford_CE14_platform","St._Thomas_Assembly","Ontario","Canada","Wayne,_Michigan","United_States","FF_layout","Hatchback","Ford_Probe","Ford_Escort_(North_America)","Ford_Tempo","Mercury_LN7","Mercury_Lynx","Mercury_Topaz","Ford_Escort_(North_America)","Chicago_Auto_Show","Ford_Thunderbird","Ford_Fairmont","Grand_tourer","Pontiac_Fiero","Toyota_MR2","Honda_CRX","2+2_(car_body_style)","Straight-4","Automatic_transmission","OPEC","Oil","Detroit","Ford_Escort_(North_America)","Mercury_Lynx","Independent_suspension","Straight-4","Ford_IB_transmission","Car_and_Driver","Manual_transmission","Notchback","Hydraulic_brake","Close-ratio","Watt","Turbocharged","Pontiac_Fiero","Toyota_MR2","Cadillac","Donald_Petersen","Straight-4","Automatic_transmission","Fuel_injection","Chevrolet_Camaro","Pontiac_Firebird","Ford_Probe"]}
