It can\ntypically provide a list of places one will pass by, with crossroads and\ndirections that must be followed, road numbers, distances, etc. It also usually\nprovides an interactive map with a suggested route marked on it. Many online\nmapping websites offer road route planning as an additional feature of their\nmapping functions.\n\nAlthough as route planning software is prone to mistakes if you try to get\ndirections from destination A to B, the use of common sense is also required.\nApplications can typically also calculate the journey time and cost, some also\ndisplay points of interest along the route.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Route_planner","recorded":1362666625,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Route planning software|","Cartography"],"headings":["Commercial software","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Software","Journey_Planner","Telogis","Travel_technology","Journey_Planner"]}
