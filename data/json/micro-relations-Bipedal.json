An\nanimal or machine that usually moves in a 'bipedal' manner is known as a 'biped'\n(), meaning \"two feet\" (from the Latin bi for \"two\" and ped for \"foot\"). Types\nof bipedal movement include walking, running, or hopping, on two appendages\n(typically legs).\n\nRelatively few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of\nlocomotion is two-legged. Within mammals, habitual bipedalism has evolved\nmultiple times, with the macropods, kangaroo mice, dipodids, springhare, NC\nHeglund, GA Cavagna and CR Taylor 1982 Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial\nlocomotion.

Energy changes of the centre of mass as a function of speed and\nbody size in birds and mammals Journal of Experimental Biology 97:1\nhopping mice, pangolins and homininan apes, as well as various other extinct\ngroups evolving the trait independently. In the Triassic period some groups of\narchosaurs (a group that includes the ancestors of crocodiles) developed\nbipedalism; among their descendants the dinosaurs, all the early forms and many\nlater groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the birds descended from one\ngroup of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.\n\nA larger number of modern species utilise bipedal movement for a short time.\nSeveral non-archosaurian lizard species move bipedally when running, usually to\nescape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in\norder to reach food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate\nspecies, such as Gibbons and Indriids, exclusively utilise bipedal locomotion\nduring the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their\nhind legs whilst fighting or copulating. A few animals commonly stand on their\nhind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or\npredator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.\n","linknr":706,"url":"Bipedal","recorded":1362373302,"links":47,"instances":["anthropologist","anatomy","genus","writer","monkey","chimpanzee","physics","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf","http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/DjawGa88.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/DjawGa88.pdf"],"categories":["Terrestrial locomotion","Animal anatomy"],"headings":["Definition","Movement","Bipedal animals","Evolution","Physiology","Bipedal robots","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Strauss_m_Tanzania.jpg/250px-Strauss_m_Tanzania.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Muybridge_runner.jpg/250px-Muybridge_runner.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Asimo.jpg/150px-Asimo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["motion","physics"],["limb","anatomy"],["leg","anatomy"],["natasha","monkey"],["oliver","chimpanzee"],["basiliscus","genus"],["limb","anatomy"],["owen_lovejoy","anthropologist"],["elaine_morgan","writer"]],"members":["owen_lovejoy","leg","basiliscus","elaine_morgan","natasha","oliver","motion","limb"],"related":["Terrestrial_locomotion","Motion_(physics)","Limb_(anatomy)","Legs","Animal","Machine","Latin","Walking","Running","Jumping","Appendage","Leg_(anatomy)","Mammal","Macropodidae","Kangaroo_mouse","Dipodidae","Springhare","Hopping_mice","Pangolin","Hominina","Triassic","Archosaur","Crocodile","Dinosaur","Bird","Lizard","Gibbon","Indriidae","Latin","Quadrupedalism","Uner_Tan_syndrome","Standing","Walking","Running","Jumping","Animal_locomotion","Primate","Lemurs","Gibbon","Hominina","Macropodidae","Kangaroo_rat","Gerbils","Spring_hare","Birds","Dinosaur","Archosaurs","Crocodilians","Lizards","Walking","Tree_kangaroo","Birds","Dinosaur","Iguanodon","Crocodilian","Crocodile","Triassic","Pterosaur","Mammal","Quadruped","Macropodidae","Kangaroo_rat","Springhare","Sifaka","Sportive_lemur","Ground_pangolin","Tree_kangaroo","Chimpanzee","Bonobo","Gibbon","Baboon","Gelada","Natasha_(monkey)","Oliver_(chimpanzee)","Knuckle-walking","Rat","Raccoon","Beaver","Bear","Ground_squirrel","Meerkat","Dog","Quadruped","Gerenuk","Megatherium","Chalicothere","Spotted_skunk","Anal_glands","Amphibian","Archosaur","Reptile","Lizard","Agamidae","Monitor_lizard","Basiliscus_(genus)","Arthropod","Cockroach","Terrestrial_animal","Octopus","Limb_(anatomy)","Ostrich","Red_kangaroo","Cheetah","Kangaroo_rat","Bolosaurid","Archosaur","Triassic","Permian-Triassic_extinction_event","Radiometric_dating","Genus","Common_descent","Argentina","Middle_Triassic","Giant_pangolin","Megatheriidae","Rodent","Macropodidae","Sexual_dimorphism","Lumbar_spine","Pregnancy","Sexual_dimorphism","Jungle","Savanna","Hominines","Elizabeth_Vrba","Turnover-pulse_hypothesis","Lucy","Little_Foot","Chimpanzee","Humans","Owen_Lovejoy_(anthropologist)","Evolution","Hominids","Sexual_swelling","Sexual_dimorphism","Australopithecus_afarensis","Gibbons","Homininae","The_Ancestor's_Tale","Paranthropus","Homininae","Homininae","Chimpanzee","Gorilla","Modern_humans","Neanderthal_extinction","Joseph_Jordania","Aposematism","Warning_display","Intimidation","Body_painting","Joseph_Jordania","Why_do_People_Sing?_Music_in_Human_Evolution","Ardipithecus","Forest","Woodland","Preadaptation","Hominid","Natural_selection","Ecological_niche","Aquatic_ape_hypothesis","Elaine_Morgan_(writer)","Feedback","Force_plate","Domestication","Poultry","Quadriceps","Hamstring","Aerobic_glycolysis","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Robot","Robot_locomotion","ASIMO","HUBO","QRIO","Allometry","Quadrupedalism","Orthograde_posture","Charles_Darwin","The_Descent_of_Man","Raymond_Dart","Richard_Dawkins","Ancestor's_Tale","Glynn_Isaac","Elisabeth_Vrba"]}
