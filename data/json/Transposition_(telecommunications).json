{"cursor":"5584","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Transposition' is the periodic swapping of positions of the conductors of a\ntransmission line, in order to reduce crosstalk and otherwise improve\ntransmission. In telecommunications this applies to balanced pairs whilst in\npower transmission lines three conductors are periodically transposed.\n\nFor cables, the swapping is gradual and continuous; that is the two or three\nconductors are twisted around each other. For communication cables this is\ncalled twisted pair. For overhead power lines or open pair communication lines,\nthe conductors are exchanged at pylons, for example at transposition towers or\nat utility poles, respectively.\n\nThe mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposition.\nTransposition also equalizes their impedance relative to ground, thus avoiding\none-sided loads in three-phase systems. Transposing is an effective measure for\nthe reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Transposition_(telecommunications)","recorded":1362903613,"links":16,"instances":["electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Communication circuits"],"headings":["Power lines","Telecommunication","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/WireTransposition.png/220px-WireTransposition.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Verdrillschemata.gif/220px-Verdrillschemata.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Facility4508_Pylon206.JPG/220px-Facility4508_Pylon206.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crosstalk","electronics"]],"members":["crosstalk"],"related":["Transmission_line","Crosstalk","Balanced_pair","Power_transmission","Twisted_pair","Overhead_power_line","Transposition_tower","Utility_pole","Overhead_power_line","Transposition_tower","Twisted_pair","Star_quad","Star_quad","Capacitance","Phantom_circuit","Crosstalk_(electronics)"]}
