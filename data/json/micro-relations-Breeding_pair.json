{"cursor":"1216","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Breeding pair' is a pair of animals which cooperate over time to produce\noffspring with some form of a bond between the individuals. For example, many\nbirds mate for a breeding season or sometimes for life. They may share some or\nall of the tasks involved: building a nest, incubating the eggs and feeding and\nprotecting the young. The term is not generally used when a male has a harem\n(zoology) of females, such as with mountain gorillas.\n\nTrue breeding pairs are usually found only in vertebrates, but there are\nnotable exceptions, such as the Lord Howe Island stick insect. True breeding\npairs are rare in amphibians or reptiles, but fairly common with fish (e.g.\ndiscus) and especially birds. Breeding pair arrangements are rare in mammals,\nwhere the prevailing patterns are either that the male and female only meet for\ncopulation (e.g. brown bear) or that dominant males have a harem (zoology) of\nfemales (e.g. walrus).\n","linknr":162,"url":"Breeding_pair","recorded":1362686380,"links":14,"instances":["zoology","fish","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal breeding","Mating","Reproduction in animals"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["harem","zoology"],["discus","fish"],["harem","zoology"]],"members":["harem","discus","egg"],"related":["Animal","Bird","Breeding_season","Egg_(biology)","Male","Harem_(zoology)","Female","Mountain_gorilla","Vertebrate","Lord_Howe_Island_stick_insect","Discus_(fish)","Bird","Mammal","Copulation","Brown_bear","Harem_(zoology)","Walrus","Pair_bond"]}
