Ethics is a complement\nto Aesthetics in the philosophy field of Axiology. In philosophy, ethics studies\nthe moral behavior in humans, and how one should act. Ethics may be divided into\nfour major areas of study:\n* Meta-ethics, about the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions\n  and how their truth values (if any) may be determined;\n* Normative ethics, about the practical means of determining a moral course\n  of action;\n* Applied ethics, about how moral outcomes can be achieved in specific\n  situations;\n* Descriptive ethics, also known as comparative ethics, is the study of people's\n  beliefs about morality;\n","linknr":1142,"url":"Ethics","recorded":1362480608,"links":132,"instances":["philosophy","ethics","psychology","psychology","ethics","political"],"pdf":["http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf","http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf"],"categories":["Ethics|","Social
