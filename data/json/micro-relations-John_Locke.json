Considered\none of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Francis\nBacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work had a great\nimpact upon the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His\nwritings influenced Voltaire and Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers,\nas well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical\nrepublicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration\nof Independence. Becker, Carl Lotus. The Declaration of Independence: A\nStudy in the History of Political Ideas Harcourt, Brace, 1922. p. 27\n\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of\nidentity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers\nsuch as Hume, Rousseau and Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through\na continuity of [[consciousness]]. He postulated that the mind was a blank slate\nor [[tabula rasa]]. Contrary to pre-existing Cartesian philosophy, he maintained\nthat we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined\nonly by experience derived from sense perception.\n","linknr":1198,"url":"John_Locke","recorded":1362485274,"links":146,"instances":["physician","philosopher","psychology","unitarian","philosopher","philosopher","politician","economics","philosopher","theologian","philosopher","philosophy","theologian","theologian","baptist_minister"],"pdf":["https://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf","https://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf","http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_01_4_huyler.pdf"],"categories":["John
