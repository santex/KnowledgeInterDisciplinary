The term body of water most often refers to large\n accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes\n smaller pools of water such as ponds, puddles or wetlands. Rivers, streams,\n canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to\n another are also considered bodies of water.<ref>.</ref>\n\nSome bodies of water are man-made (artificial), such as reservoirs or harbors,\nbut most are naturally occurring geographical features. Bodies of water that\nare navigable are known as waterways. Some bodies of water collect and move\nwater, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as\nlakes and oceans.\n\nThe term body of water can also refer to a reservoir of water held by a plant,\ntechnically known as a phytotelma.\n",
