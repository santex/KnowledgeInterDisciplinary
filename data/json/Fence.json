Fences are generally distinguished from walls by the\nlightness of their construction and their purpose. Walls are usually barriers\nmade from solid brick or concrete, blocking vision as well as passage, while\nfences are used more frequently to provide visual sectioning of spaces.\n\nAlternatives to fencing include a ditch (sometimes filled with water,\nforming a moat).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fence","recorded":1372152269,"links":[],"instances":["fortification","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fences|","Perimeter security"],"headings":["Types","Requirement of use","Legal issues","Cultural value of fences","See also","Notes","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["ditch","fortification"],["don't_fence_me_in","song"]],"members":["ditch"],"related":["Transport","Wall","Ditch_(fortification)","Water","Moat","Agricultural_fencing","Livestock","Temporary_fencing","Perimeter_fencing","Landscaping","Real_property","Newt_fencing","Pest-exclusion_fence","Pet_fence","Pool_fence","Snow_fence","Balustrade","Railing","Balcony","Stairway","Roof","Bridge","Body_of_water","Chain-link_fencing","Close_boarded_fencing","Concrete_fence","Ha-ha","Hurdle","Palisade","Picket_fence","Post-and-rail_fencing","Roundpole_fence","Scandinavia","Palisade","Wales","Spear-top_fence","Split-rail_fence","Zig-zag","United_States","Canada","Stockade_fence","Picket_fence","Vinyl_fence","Wattle-and-daub","Wrought_iron","Hedge","Cactus_fence","Hedgerow","Shrub","Hedge_laying","Live_fencing","Sod","Wall","Dry-stone_wall","Barbed_wire","Electric_fence","Chicken_wire","Welded_wire_mesh_fence","Mast_radiator","Eddy_current","Bull","Stallion","Feudal","Peasants","Arable_land","Manoralism","Muzeum_Budownictwa_Ludowego_w_Sanoku","Poland","American_West","Open_range","Habitat","Tragedy_of_the_commons","Homestead_Act","Desert_Land_Act","Deed","Trespass","United_Kingdom","Livestock","Common_land","Common_law","Spain","Robert_Frost","Arthur_Baer","William_Faulkner","Dudley_Nichols","Kurt_Tippett","Jim_Morrison","The_Doors","Don't_Fence_Me_In_(song)","Cole_Porter","Peter_Hoekstra","Marilyn_Monroe","Agricultural_fencing","Electric_fence","Wire_obstacle","Temporary_fencing","Post_pounder","Synthetic_fence","Pool_fence","Separation_barrier"]}
