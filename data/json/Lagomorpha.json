The name of the order is derived from the Greek lagos\n(Î»Î±Î³Î¿Ï, \"hare\") and morphÄ (Î¼Î¿ÏÏÎ®, \"form\").\n\nThough these mammals can resemble rodents (order Rodentia) and were classified\nas a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since\nbeen considered a separate order. For a time it was common to consider the\nlagomorphs only distant relatives of the rodents, to whom they merely bore a\nsuperficial resemblance.\n\nThe evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood. Until\nrecently, it was generally agreed that [[Eurymylus]], which lived in eastern\nAsia and dates back to the late Paleocene or early Eocene, was an ancestor of\nthe lagomorphs. More recent examination of the fossil\nevidence suggests the lagomorphs may have instead descended from Anagaloidea,\nalso known as mimotonids, while [[Eurymylus]] was more closely related to\nrodents (although not a direct ancestor.) The leporids\nfirst appeared in the late Eocene and rapidly spread throughout the Northern\nHemisphere; they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern\nleaping gait developed. The pikas appeared somewhat later in the Oligocene of\neastern Asia.\n","linknr":465,"url":"Lagomorpha","recorded":1362902081,"links":74,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lagomorphs|"],"headings":["Characteristics","Classification","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Tasmania_2.jpg/220px-Oryctolagus_cuniculus_Tasmania_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Lagomorpha_range.png/220px-Lagomorpha_range.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["family","biology"],["order","biology"],["family","biology"]],"members":["order","family"],"related":["European_Rabbit","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Eutheria","Boreoeutheria","Euarchontoglires","Johann_Friedrich_von_Brandt","Family_(biology)","Leporidae","Ochotonidae","Prolagidae","Order_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Leporidae","Hare","Rabbit","Ochotonidae","Mammal","Rodent","Taxonomic_rank","Paleocene","Eocene","Anagaloidea","Oligocene","Incisors","Herbivore","Teeth","Leporidae","Rabbit","Hare","Extinction","Archaeolaginae","Leporinae","Palaeolaginae","Dasyporcina","Pika","Prolagidae","Sardinian_Pika"]}
