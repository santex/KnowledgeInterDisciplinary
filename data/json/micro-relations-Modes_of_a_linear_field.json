For instance, in physics, the electromagnetic field in vacuum,\ndefined in the usual (3 + 1)-dimensional space S, obeys Maxwell's\nequations. A linear combination of electromagnetic fields, with constant, real\ncoefficients, is a new field which obeys Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe solutions of the linear equations are represented in a real vector\nspace M. A radius of M, which represents proportional solutions is\ncalled a \"mode\".\n\nA norm may be defined. For instance, in electromagnetism, it is usually the\nenergy of the solution assuming that there is no other field in S. From the norm\nare defined the orthogonality and the scalar product of solutions. The\northogonality of solutions extends to the corresponding modes.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Modes_of_a_linear_field","recorded":1362552157,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linear algebra"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Physics","Vector_field","Electromagnetic_field","Maxwell's_equations","Real_number","Vector_space"]}
