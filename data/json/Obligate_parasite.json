If an obligate parasite cannot obtain\na host it will fail to reproduce. Obligate parasites have evolved a variety of\nparasitic strategies to exploit their hosts.

Other types of obligate parasitism include\nobligate brood parasites, such as the cowbird and cuckoo, which require the\nnests and parental care of other passerines in order for their young to fledge.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Obligate_parasite","recorded":1362509064,"links":13,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"]],"members":["host"],"related":["Parasite","Organism","Host_(biology)","Tick","Trematoda","Plasmodium","Brood_parasites","Cowbird","Cuckoo","Passerines","Fledge","Facultative_parasite","Obligate_intracellular_parasite","Parasitic_plant","Parasitoid","Parasitism"]}
