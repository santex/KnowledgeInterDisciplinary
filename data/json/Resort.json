Resorts are places, towns or sometimes commercial\nestablishment operated by a single company.\n\nTowns which are resorts â or where tourism or vacationing is a major part of the\nlocal activity â are sometimes called resort towns. If they are by the sea they\nare called seaside resorts. Inland resorts include ski resorts, mountain resorts\nand spa towns. Towns such as Sochi in Russia, Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt, Barizo\nin Spain, Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, Druskininkai in Lithuania, Cancun in\nMexico, Newport, Rhode Island in America, St. Moritz in Switzerland, Blackpool\nin England and Malam Jabba in Pakistan are well-known resorts.\n\nIn North American English, the term \"resort\" is now also used for a self-\ncontained commercial establishment which attempts to provide for most of a\nvacationer's wants while remaining on the premises, such as food, drink,\nlodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping. The term may be used to identify a\nhotel property that provides an array of amenities and typically includes\nentertainment and recreational activities. A hotel is frequently a central\nfeature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. A\nresort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company,\nalthough in the late twentieth century this sort of facility became more common.\n\nThe Walt Disney World resort is a prominent example of a modern, self-\ncontained commercial resort. Self-contained resorts are common in the United\nStates, but exist throughout the world. Resorts are especially prevalent in\nCentral America and the Caribbean. Closely related to resorts are convention\nand large meeting sites. Generally these occur in cities where special meeting\nhalls, together with ample accommodations as well as varied dining and\nentertainment are provided.\n","linknr":400,"url":"Resort","recorded":1362689489,"links":44,"instances":["mackinac_island","entrepreneur","arkansas"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hotel types","Resorts|"],"headings":["Resort towns","Self-contained resorts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Town_and_Country_fh000023.jpg/250px-Town_and_Country_fh000023.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Pyramid_resort_jasper.JPG/250px-Pyramid_resort_jasper.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Miamimetroarea.jpg/250px-Miamimetroarea.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Banff_Springs_Hotel1.jpg/220px-Banff_Springs_Hotel1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/REsortOnABAckgroundofMountains.JPG/250px-REsortOnABAckgroundofMountains.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Resort_swimming_pool_marawila.jpg/220px-Resort_swimming_pool_marawila.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Male_Ciche.jpg/220px-Male_Ciche.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Las_Vegas_63.jpg/250px-Las_Vegas_63.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grand_hotel","mackinac_island"],["gérard_blitz","entrepreneur"],["beaver_lake","arkansas"]],"members":["grand_hotel","gérard_blitz","beaver_lake"],"related":["Jasper,_Alberta","Relaxation_technique","Recreation","Vacation","Tourism","Tourism","Resort_town","Seaside_resorts","Ski_resorts","Mountain_resort","Spa_towns","Sochi","Russia","Sharm_el_Sheikh","Egypt","Barizo","Cortina_d'Ampezzo","Druskininkai","Cancun","Mexico","Newport,_Rhode_Island","St._Moritz","Blackpool","Malam_Jabba","Lodging","Sports","Entertainment","Hotel","Grand_Hotel_(Mackinac_Island)","Mackinac_Island,_Michigan","Walt_Disney_World","Central_America","Caribbean","Seaside_resort","Coast","United_Kingdom","Pub","Bar","Restaurant","Nightclub","Beach","Foreign_language","Chalet","Ski_schools","Ski_lifts","Banff,_Alberta","Alberta","Canada","Destination_hotel","Bahamas","Walt_Disney_World_Resort","Orlando,_Florida","Northeastern_Brazil","Thailand","South_Africa","Percent","Caribbean","Cuba","Club_Med","Sandals_Resorts","Soft_drink","Alcoholic_drink","Club_Med","Gérard_Blitz_(entrepreneur)","Destination_spa","Sri_Lanka","Golf","Golf","Day_spa","Skiing","Conference_and_resort_hotels","Conference_and_resort_hotels","Las_Vegas_Strip","Singapore","Integrated_resort","Casino","Holiday_village","Villa","Holiday_camp","Chalet","Static_caravan","Baiae","Italy","Capri","Naples","Monte_Ne","Rogers,_Arkansas","Beaver_Lake_(Arkansas)","Canada's_grand_railway_hotels","Condo_hotel","Sanatorium"]}
