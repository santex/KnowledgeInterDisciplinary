SmartStax takes advantage of Yieldgard VT Triple (Monsanto), Herculex\nXtra (Dow), RoundUp Ready 2 (Monsanto), and Liberty Link (Dow). The traits\nincluded protect against above-ground insects, Below-Ground insects, and provide\nbroad herbicide tolerance. It is currently available for corn, but cotton,\nsoybean, and specialty crop variations are to be released. Previously, the most\ngenes artificially added to a single plant was three, but Smartstax includes\neight. Smartstax also takes advantage of the Acceleron Seed Treatment System\nwhich protects against insects at the earliest stages of development. SmartStax\nis ground-breaking in that it requires only 5% refuge acres as opposed to the\n20% required of older technologies. Smartstax builds towards Monsanto's Promise\nof doubling yields by 2030 on the same or less land. http://www.genuity.com/Traits/Corn/Genuity-\nSmartStax.aspx Smartstax is sold under the Genuity (Monsanto) and Mycogen\n(Dow) brands.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Smartstax","recorded":1362503773,"links":14,"instances":["herbicide","monsanto_brand"],"pdf":["http://www.motherjones.com/files/epa-hq-opp-2011-0922-0003.pdf","http://www.motherjones.com/files/epa-hq-opp-2011-0922-0003.pdf"],"categories":["Genetically modified organisms in agriculture","Maize"],"headings":["Refuge acres","Promotion and branding","Weed and insect resistance","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Genuity_SmartStax.jpg/150px-Genuity_SmartStax.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["genuity","monsanto_brand"],["roundup","herbicide"]],"members":["roundup","genuity"],"related":["Monsanto","Dow","Maize","Cotton","Soybean","Roundup_Ready","Liberty_Link","Acceleron_Seed_Treatment_System","Genetically_modified_plant","Monsanto_Company","Dow_Chemical_Company","Yieldgard_VT","Maize","Cotton","Soybean","Acceleron","Genuity_(Monsanto_brand)","Mycogen_Seeds","Roundup_(herbicide)","Horseweed","Giant_Ragweed","Amaranth","Western_corn_rootworm","Bollworm","USDA"]}
