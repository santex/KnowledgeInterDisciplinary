The term is sometimes used to refer to the body\n hair of an animal as a complete coat, also known as the \"'pelage'\". Fur is also\n used to refer to animal pelts which have been processed into leather with the\n hair still attached. The words fur or furry are also used, more casually, to\n refer to hair-like growths or formations; particularly when the subject being\n referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft \"hairs.\"\n\nAnimal fur, if layered, rather than grown as a single coat, may consist of short\nground hair, long guard hair, and, in some cases, medium awn hair. Mammals with\nreduced amounts of fur are often called \"naked\", as in [[The Naked Ape]], naked\nmole rat, and naked dogs.\n\nAn animal with commercially valuable fur is known within the fur industry as a\nfurbearer. The use of fur as clothing and/or decoration is considered\ncontroversial by some people: most animal rights advocates object to the\ntrapping and killing of wildlife, and to the confinement and killing of animals\non fur farms.\n\nFur has been a major challenge for 3D computer graphics artists due to its\nvisual complexity and physical properties.
