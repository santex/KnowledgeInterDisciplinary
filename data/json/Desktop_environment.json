{"cursor":"15041","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 3.x desktop environment]] , using Plasma as the desktop.]]\n 4.x desktop environment]]\n\nIn graphical computing, a 'desktop environment' ('DE') commonly refers to a\nparticular implementation of graphical user interface (GUI) derived from the\ndesktop metaphor that is seen on most modern personal computers. These GUIs help the user in easily accessing,\nconfiguring and modifying many important and frequently accessed specific\noperating system (OS) features. The GUI usually does not afford access to all\nthe many features found in an OS. Instead, the traditional command-line\ninterface (CLI) is still used when full control over the OS is required in\nsuch cases.\n\nA desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders,\nwallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and\nWIMP). [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs6751_97_winter/Topics/dialog-\nwimp/ WIMP Interfaces ]\n\nA GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that\nmake the desktop metaphor more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an\nintuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which\nare similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as\nbuttons and windows.\n\nWhile the term desktop environment originally described a style of user\ninterfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the\nprograms that realize the metaphor itself.

Environment and the K Desktop Environment.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Desktop_environment","recorded":1362669144,"links":69,"instances":["computing","computing","desktop_environment","file_manager","file_systems","amigaos","theme","desktop_environment","window_manager","software","desktop_environment","user_interface","computing","framework","aros","computing","kde","user_interface","user_interface","desktop_environment","desktop_environment"],"pdf":["http://www.linux-usability.de/download/linux_usability_report_en.pdf","http://www.linux-usability.de/download/linux_usability_report_en.pdf"],"categories":["Desktop
