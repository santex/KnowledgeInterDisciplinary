{"cursor":"2667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn telecommunication a 'data link' is the means of connecting one location to\nanother for the purpose of transmitting and receiving information. It can also\nrefer to a set of electronics assemblies, consisting of a transmitter and a\nreceiver (two pieces of data terminal equipment) and the interconnecting data\ntelecommunication circuit. These are governed by a link protocol enabling\ndigital data to be transferred from a data source to a data sink.\n\nThere are at least three types of basic data-link configurations that can be\nconceived of and used:\n* Simplex communications, most commonly meaning all communications in one\n  direction only.\n* Half-duplex communications, meaning communications in both directions, but not\n  both ways simultaneously.\n* Duplex communications, communications in both directions simultaneously.\n\nIn civil aviation, a data-link system (known as Controller Pilot Data Link\nCommunications) is used to send information between aircraft and air traffic\ncontrollers when an aircraft is too far from the ATC to make voice radio\ncommunication and radar observations possible. Such systems are used for\naircraft crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. One such system, used by\nNavCanada and NATS over the North Atlantic, uses a five-digit data link sequence\nnumber confirmed between air traffic control and the pilots of the aircraft\nbefore the aircraft proceeds to cross the ocean. This system uses the aircraft's\nflight management computer to send location, speed and altitude information\nabout the aircraft to the ATC. ATC can then send messages to the aircraft\nregarding any necessary change of course.\n\nIn military aviation, a data-link may also carry weapons targeting information\nor information to help warplanes land on aircraft carriers.\n\nIn unmanned aircraft, land vehicles, boats, and spacecraft, a two-way (full-\nduplex or half-duplex) data-link is used to send control signals, and to receive\ntelemetry.\n","linknr":549,"url":"Data_link","recorded":1362485375,"links":33,"instances":["telecommunication","telecommunications","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data transmission"],"headings":["See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Phone_icon_rotated.svg/40px-Phone_icon_rotated.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sink","computing"],["duplex","telecommunications"],["terminal","telecommunication"]],"members":["terminal","duplex","sink"],"related":["Telecommunication","Data_terminal_equipment","Telecommunication_circuit","Link_protocol","Sink_(computing)","Simplex_communication","Half-duplex","Duplex_(telecommunications)","Aviation","Controller_Pilot_Data_Link_Communications","Air_traffic_control","Radar","Atlantic","Pacific","NavCanada","NATS","Flight_management_system","Aircraft_carrier","Unmanned_aircraft","Full-duplex","Half-duplex","Control_system","Telemetry","ACARS","Deep_Space_Network","Space_probe","Tactical_Data_Links","Terminal_(telecommunication)","Unmanned_Aircraft_System"]}
