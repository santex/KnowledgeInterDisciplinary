{"cursor":"5888","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'pharmacophore' is an abstract description of molecular features which are\nnecessary for molecular recognition of a ligand by a biological macromolecule.\nThe IUPAC defines a pharmacophore to be \"an ensemble of steric and electronic\nfeatures that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions\nwith a specific biological target and to trigger (or block) its biological\nresponse\". A pharmacophore model explains how\nstructurally diverse ligands can bind to a common receptor site. Furthermore\npharmacophore models can be used to identify through denovo design or virtual\nscreening novel ligands that will bind to the same receptor.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Pharmacophore","recorded":1362507957,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://biochempress.com/Files/iejmd_2007_6_0271.pdf","http://biochempress.com/Files/iejmd_2007_6_0271.pdf"],"categories":["Medicinal chemistry","Cheminformatics"],"headings":["Features","Applications","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/PharmacophoreModel_example.svg/300px-PharmacophoreModel_example.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Bzr_pm.png/300px-Bzr_pm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Molecular_recognition","Macromolecule","IUPAC","Drug_design","Virtual_screening","GABAA_receptor","Diazepam","CGS-9896","Hydrogen_bond","Lipophilicity","Hydrophobic","Aromatic","Hydrogen_bond","Cation","Anion","Molecular_shape","Computational_chemistry","Biological_activity","Chemical_compound","Lemont_Kier","Paul_Ehrlich","Cheminformatics","Molecule_mining","Pharmaceutical_company","QSAR","In_silico"]}
