Above the hull is the\nsuperstructure and/or deckhouse, where present. The line where the hull meets\nthe water surface is called the waterline.\n\nThe structure of the hull varies depending on the vessel type. In a typical\nmodern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks,\nmajor transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal)\nmembers called bulkheads, intermediate members such as girders, s and webs, and\nminor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals,\ndepending on the structural arrangement. The uppermost continuous deck may be\ncalled the \"upper deck\", \"weather deck\", \"spar deck\", \"main deck\", or simply\n\"deck\". The particular name given depends on the contextâthe type of ship or\nboat, the arrangement, or even where it sails. Not all hulls are decked (for\ninstance a dinghy).\n\nIn a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking,\nsupported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads,\nwhich are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often\nbut not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a keel. In\nfiberglass or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel\nvessels to some extent, or be of a monocoque arrangement. In many cases,\ncomposite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a\nlightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper\nhoneycomb or other material.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Moulded_depth","recorded":1362562888,"links":40,"instances":["nautical","partition","sailboat","sailing","fluid","hull","force","sailboat","keelboat","physics","nautical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ship construction","Sailing ship components","Naval architecture","Structural system","Structural engineering"],"headings":["General features","Hull shapes","Appendages","Terms","Metrics","History","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Tigre_%281724%29_mg_5065.jpg/220px-Tigre_%281724%29_mg_5065.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Hullform-3D.PNG/220px-Hullform-3D.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Royal_Navy_MTB_5.jpg/220px-Royal_Navy_MTB_5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Chine_types.svg/100px-Chine_types.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Ship%27s_hull_shape_en.png/220px-Ship%27s_hull_shape_en.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/LOA-LWL.svg/220px-LOA-LWL.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/e/c2e065d5d1a3f6a04dcbad7093fec61b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/8/3/683f0d33acbc046578317f3126d84f0c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/9/e691218e8a2972b6f35cbb7120f34a55.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/e/11e401bc4d0db5a00728bab57081045b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/6/7a650028de1b2121a223c2421de49548.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bulkhead","partition"],["chine","boating"],["chine","boating#various_types_of_chine_hulls"],["planing","sailing"],["laser","sailboat"],["yngling","keelboat"],["randmeer","sailboat"],["planing","sailing"],["drag","physics"],["beam","nautical"],["draft","hull"],["freeboard","nautical"],["displacement","fluid"],["draft","hull"],["lift","force"]],"members":["freeboard","bulkhead","randmeer","planing","displacement","draft","lift","laser","chine","yngling","drag","beam"],"related":["Watertight","Ship","Boat","Superstructure","Deckhouse","Waterline","Bulkhead_(partition)","Girders","I-beam","Structural_arrangement","Keel","Fiberglass","Icebreaker","Landing_craft","Chine_(boating)","Waterline","Motor_Torpedo_Boat","Planing_(sailing)","Hull_speed","Inverted_bell","Waterline","Centaur","Laser_(sailboat)","Dinghies","Yngling_(keelboat)","Randmeer_(sailboat)","Planing_(sailing)","Bulbous_bow","Wave_making_resistance","Drag_(physics)","Naval_architecture","Keel","Rudder","Length_overall","Length_at_the_waterline","Length_between_perpendiculars","Stern","P/p","Beam_(nautical)","Gunwale","Draft_(hull)","Waterline","Freeboard_(nautical)","Displacement_(fluid)","Froude_number","Stone_Age","Tree","Canoe","Coracle","Naval_architecture","Anti-fouling_paint","Boat","Cathedral_hull","Double_hull","Draft_(hull)","Froude_number","Hull_classification_symbol","Hull_speed","Monohull","Multihull","Naval_architecture","Ship_measurements","Shipbuilding","Submarine","Submarine_hull","Lift_(force)"]}
