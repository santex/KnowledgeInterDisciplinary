{"cursor":"3309","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'armoire [[desk]]' is a writing-table built within a large cabinet, usually\n1.5-2.0 m (5-7 feet) high. The cabinet is closed by two to four full-height\ndoors, to keep out dust or to give a tidy appearance to a room by hiding the\ncluttered working surface of the desk. This form of desk is usually placed\nagainst a wall, like its antique uncle, the secretary desk.\n\n\n\n\nSmall or home offices (also known as \"SOHO\") are the usual habitat of the modern\narmoire desk. Corporations and government bureaucracies typically shun the\narmoire desk, preferring pedestal desks and cubicles in most instances. The\nclosest ancestor, in form, of the armoire desk, is the Moore desk.\n\nThe armoire desk is often called a \"computer armoire desk\", or a computer desk,\nsince it is used in our times to house a computer and its peripherals. Holes are\nprovided to connect the peripherals located in several nooks above or below the\nmain work surface. Often, the work surface or surfaces, such as a writing area\nor a computer keyboard tray are adjustable to provide an ergonomically sound\nworking environment.\n\nSome armoire desks have a fixed work surface, which stays in place when the\ndoors are closed, and moves only for ergonomic adjustments. This kind of armoire\ndesk is a direct descendant of the antique rolltop desk which was common in\ncorporate or government offices three or four generations ago, since it provides\na fast and efficient way to store or hide current work.\n\nOther armoire desks have an easily movable, often hinged, work surface which\nmust be cleared of documents and other items in order to close the doors. This\nkind of armoire desk is a morphological descendant of the famous Wooton desk\nby its size and by the necessity to constantly store papers to shut it. There\nis also the alternative of always leaving it open, given the trouble involved.\nThe fall front desk or \"secrÃ©taire Ã  abattant\", and the slant top desk are\nalso related.\n\nUnlike all of these earlier relations, however, the modern armoire desk usually\ndoes not have a lock. Armoire desks are normally very practical pieces of\nfurniture, despite the use of rich veneers and complex exterior styling in some\nof the costlier models.\n\nThe sketch of an armoire desk which comes with this article shows a fairly large\nversion with four folding doors, a writing surface which slides out, and a\nkeyboard and mouse pad tray which, in turn, slides out from under the sliding\nwriting surface. In the version shown here it is possible to leave a few thin\npiles of paper on the writing surface before sliding it back in. In other\nversions this is not possible. Since most armoire desk are modern forms, the\nwriting surface here is placed at 30 inches (76 cm) from the floor. In antique\ndesk forms it would have been 29 inches (73.5 cm) from the floor.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Armoire_desk","recorded":1374545759,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Desk","/wiki/Dust","/wiki/Antiques","/wiki/Secretary_desk","/wiki/File:Armoiredeskfront.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Armoiredeskfront.png","/wiki/File:Armoire_deskside_vector.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Armoire_deskside_vector.svg/376px-Armoire_deskside_vector.svg.png","/wiki/Small_Office,_Home_Office","/wiki/Pedestal_desk","/wiki/Cubicle","/wiki/Moore_desk","/wiki/Computer_desk","/wiki/Computer","/wiki/Computer_keyboard","/wiki/Rolltop_desk","/wiki/Wooton_desk","/wiki/Fall_front_desk","/wiki/Slant_top_desk","/wiki/Lock_(device)","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_desk_forms_and_types","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit&section=2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&oldid=524753528","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Desks","/wiki/Category:Articles_that_may_contain_original_research_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_that_may_contain_original_research","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Armoire+desk&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Armoire+desk","/wiki/Armoire_desk","/wiki/Talk:Armoire_desk","#","/wiki/Armoire_desk","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Armoire_desk","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Armoire_desk","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&oldid=524753528","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Armoire_desk&id=524753528","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Armoire+desk","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Armoire+desk&oldid=524753528&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Armoire_desk&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoire_desk","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["device"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Desks"],"headings":["See
