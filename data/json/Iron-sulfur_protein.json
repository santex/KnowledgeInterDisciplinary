Iron-sulfur clusters are found in a variety of\nmetalloproteins, such as the ferredoxins, as well as NADH dehydrogenase,\nhydrogenases, Coenzyme Q - cytochrome c reductase, Succinate - coenzyme Q\nreductase and nitrogenase. S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg âPrinciples of\nBioinorganic Chemistryâ University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994. ISBN\n0-935702-73-3. Iron-sulfur clusters are best known for their role in the\noxidation-reduction reactions of mitochondrial electron transport. Both Complex\nI and Complex II of oxidative phosphorylation have multiple Fe-S clusters. They\nhave many other functions including catalysis as illustrated by aconitase,\ngeneration of radicals as illustrated by SAM-dependent enzymes, and as sulfur\ndonors in the biosynthesis of lipoic acid and biotin. Additionally some Fe-S\nproteins regulate gene expression. Fe-S proteins are vulnerable to attack by\nbiogenic nitric oxide.\n\nThe prevalence of these proteins on the metabolic pathways of most organisms\nleads some scientists to theorize that iron-sulfur compounds had a significant\nrole in the origin of life in the Iron-sulfur world theory.\n","linknr":225,"url":"Iron-sulfur_protein","recorded":1362557552,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cluster chemistry","Iron-sulfur proteins","Peripheral membrane proteins","Protein structure","Iron compounds","Sulfur compounds","Metalloproteins"],"headings":["Structural motifs","Biosynthesis","Synthetic analogues","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/2Fe2S.png/220px-2Fe2S.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/FdRedox.png/500px-FdRedox.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Sulfide","Oxidation_state","Metalloprotein","Ferredoxin","NADH_dehydrogenase","Hydrogenase","Coenzyme_Q_-_cytochrome_c_reductase","Succinate_-_coenzyme_Q_reductase","Nitrogenase","Oxidation-reduction_reaction","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Aconitase","S-adenosylmethionine","Lipoic_acid","Biotin","Nitric_oxide","Origin_of_life","Iron-sulfur_world_theory","Cysteinyl","Ligand","Ferredoxin","Cysteine","Histidine","Rieske_protein","Cubane","Ferredoxin","HIPIP","Nitrogenase","Aconitase","Aconitate","Lewis_acid","Isocitrate","Radical_SAM","S-adenosylmethionine","Aconitase","Nitrogenase","Hydrogenase","Cytoplasm","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Richard_H._Holm","Tetraethylammonium","Bioinorganic_chemistry"]}
