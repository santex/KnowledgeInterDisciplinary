Prior to that, Mirza was the last\nGovernor-General of Pakistan from 1955 until 1956. A great-grandson of the last Nawab of Bengal Mir Jafar, Mirza was the first president of Bengali origin\nfrom East-Pakistan, and a retired career army officer, having reached the\nprestigious higher rank of major-general in Pakistan Army.\n\nStarting his career in the government, Mirza was employed by Prime minister\nLiaquat Ali Khan in the Ministry of Defence, being appointed as the first\nDefence Secretary (one of an apex bureaucratic post), overseeing the Indo-\nPakistan war of 1947, and the Balochistan conflict in 1948. Serious disorder and civil unrest sparked in East\nPakistan as a result of the Bengali Language Movement in 1952, prompting Prime\nminister Khawaja Nazimuddin to appoint him as the Governor of the province. He\noversaw the success of the One Unit programme in East Pakistan in 1954, and\nsucceeded Malik Ghulam as the Governor-General in 1955. After successfully\npromulgating the 1956 constitution, Mirza became the first president. But his\npresidency saw great political instability, challenges in foreign policy, and\nthe ousture of four prime ministers in two years. He finally imposed martial law\nin 1958 after suspending the constitution and dissolving democratic\ninstitutions, including the Pakistan Parliament. Mirza has the distinction of\nbeing the first to bring in military influence in national politics after he\nappointed his army chief as chief martial law administrator of the country.\n\nProblems with the Pakistan Armed Forces and the establishment escalated after\nrelations with the United States deteriorated. Imposition of martial law only\nled to more civil unrest and political challenges, and also undermined Mirza's\nown position. After only twenty days of martial law, Mirza was forced out of\nthe presidency by his Chief Martial Law Administrator Field Marshal Ayub Khan.\nHe was exiled to London, where he resided until his death. When he died in\n1969 after a long illness, President Yahya Khan denied him a burial in\nPakistan. Out of respect, the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi gave him a state\nfuneral in Tehran, Iran.\n","linknr":647,"url":"Iskander_Mirza","recorded":1375082607,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Iskander_Mirza&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Iskander_Mirza&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Iskander_Mirza.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Iskander_Mirza.jpg","/wiki/President_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Chaudhry_Muhammad_Ali","/wiki/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy","/wiki/Ibrahim_Ismail_Chundrigar","/wiki/Feroz_Khan_Noon","/wiki/Ayub_Khan_(Field_Marshal)","/wiki/Governor-General_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Acting_(law)","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Chaudhry_Muhammad_Ali","/wiki/Malik_Ghulam_Muhammad","/wiki/Ministry_of_Interior_(Pakistan)","/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Bogra","/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed_Gurmani","/wiki/A._K._Fazlul_Huq","/wiki/East_Bengal","/wiki/Nurul_Amin","/wiki/Chaudhry_Khaliquzzaman","/wiki/Muhammad_Shahabuddin","/wiki/Defence_Secretary_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan","/wiki/Khawaja_Nazimuddin","/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Bogra","/wiki/Akhter_Husain","/wiki/Murshidabad","/wiki/Bengal_Presidency","/wiki/British_Raj","/wiki/West_Bengal","/wiki/India","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Republican_Party_(Pakistan)","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Elphinstone_College","/wiki/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst","/wiki/Islam","/wiki/File:US-O8_insignia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/US-O8_insignia.svg/20px-US-O8_insignia.svg.png","/wiki/Major_general","/wiki/Pakistan_Army_Corps_of_Military_Police","/wiki/Waziristan_campaign_(1936%E2%80%931939)","/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947","/wiki/Major-General","/wiki/Sahibzada","/wiki/Sayyid","/wiki/Order_of_the_Indian_Empire","/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart_for_English_dialects","/wiki/Urdu_language","/wiki/Bengali_language","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Pakistan","/wiki/President_of_Pakistan","/wiki/1958_Pakistani_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","#cite_note-Story_of_Pakistan_.28Part-I.29-1","/wiki/Governor-General_of_Pakistan#List_of_office-holders","/wiki/Governor-General_of_Pakistan","#cite_note-Story_of_Pakistan_.28Part-I.29-1","/wiki/Nawab_of_Bengal","/wiki/Mir_Jafar","#cite_note-Westview_Press.2C_1997-2","/wiki/Bengali_people","/wiki/East_Pakistan","/wiki/Military_officer","/wiki/Two_star_rank","/wiki/Major_general","/wiki/Pakistan_Army","/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Prime_minister_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan","/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Pakistan)","/wiki/Defence_Secretary_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Pakistan_Civil_Services","/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1947","/wiki/Balochistan_conflict","#cite_note-Electronic_Government_of_Pakistan-3","/wiki/East_Pakistan","/wiki/Bengali_Language_Movement","/wiki/Khawaja_Nazimuddin","/wiki/One_Unit","/wiki/Malik_Ghulam_Muhammad","/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan_of_1956","/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_Pakistan","/wiki/1958_Pakistani_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat","/wiki/Pakistan_Parliament","/wiki/Politics_of_Pakistan","/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces","/wiki/Establishment_(Pakistan)","/wiki/Pakistan-United_States_relations","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Chief_Martial_Law_Administrator","/wiki/Ayub_Khan_(Field_Marshal)","/wiki/London","/wiki/Yahya_Khan","/wiki/Shah_of_Iran","/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi","/wiki/Tehran","/wiki/Iran","#Descendent_origins","#Education_and_military_service","#Defence_Secretary","#Governor_of_East-Pakistan","#Governor-General","#Presidency","#Martial_Law","#Military_coup_d.27.C3.A9tat","#Post-presidency_and_death","#Family","#Legacy","#Honours","#Excerpts_From_Major_General_Iskander_Mirza.27s_Letter_to_His_Children","#References","/w/index.php?title=Iskander_Mirza&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mir_Jafar","/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Fateh_Ali_Mirza&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Tyabji&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Murshidabad","/wiki/Bengal_Presidency","/wiki/British_Indian_Empire","#cite_note-Westview_Press.2C_1997-2","/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Murshidabad","/wiki/Nawab_of_Bengal","/wiki/Mansur_Ali_Khan","#cite_note-Westview_Press.2C_1997-2","/wiki/Mir_Jafar","/wiki/Siraj_ud-Daulah","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Robert_Clive","#cite_note-newagebd-4","/wiki/Shi%27a_Muslim","/wiki/Zulfiqar","/wiki/Ali","#cite_note-Westview_Press
