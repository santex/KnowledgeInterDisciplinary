Selected as part of the third group of\nfourteen astronauts in 1963, he flew into space twice. His first spaceflight was\n[[Gemini 10]], in which he and command pilot John Young performed two rendezvous\nwith different spacecraft and Collins undertook two EVAs. His second spaceflight\nwas as the command module pilot for [[Apollo 11]]. While he orbited the Moon,\nNeil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made the first manned landing on the lunar\nsurface. He is one of only 24 people to have flown to the Moon.\n\nPrior to becoming an astronaut, he had attended the United States Military\nAcademy, and from there he joined the United States Air Force and flew F-86s at\nChambley-Bussieres Air Base, France. He was accepted to the U.S. Air Force\nExperimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in 1960. He\nunsuccessfully applied for the second astronaut group, but was accepted for the\nthird group.\n\nAfter retiring from NASA in 1970 he took a job in the Department of State as\nAssistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. A year later he became the\ndirector of the National Air and Space Museum. He held this position until 1978\nwhen he stepped down to become undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In\n1980 he took the job as Vice President of LTV Aerospace. He resigned in 1985 to\nstart his own business.\n\nHe is married to Patricia Collins, and they have three children: Kate, Ann,\nand Michael.\n","linknr":579,"url":"Michael_Collins_(astronaut)","recorded":1362267849,"links":74,"instances":["band","nasa","crater","musician","book","astronaut","united_states","actress","album"],"pdf":["http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/CollinsM/MC_BIO.pdf"],"categories":["1930
