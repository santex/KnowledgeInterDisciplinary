It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are\nimpoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into\nthe \"world system.\"\n\nThe theory arose as a reaction to modernization theory, an earlier theory of\ndevelopment which held that all societies progress through similar stages of\ndevelopment, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation\nto that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore\nthe task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate\nthem along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as\ninvestment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market.\nDependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are\nnot merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features\nand structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the\nweaker members in a world market economy Newschool,\n[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm \"Economic Development\"],\nretrieved July 2009.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Dependency_theory","recorded":1362543983,"links":39,"instances":["author","economist"],"pdf":["http://www-siepr.stanford.edu/Papers/pdf/99-4.pdf","http://www.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cirje/research/dp/2005/2005cf318.pdf","http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf"],"categories":["Development economics","Globalization-related theories"],"headings":["Basics","History","Other dependency theorists","Further reading","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["keith_griffin","economist"],["john_perkins","author"]],"members":["john_perkins","keith_griffin"],"related":["Social_science","World_system","Modernization_theory","Development_theory","Structuralism","Economics","Propaganda_model","Politics","Banking","Finance","Education","Culture","Sport","Human_resources","Economic_sanctions","World_system","Hans_Singer","Raúl_Prebisch","Terms_of_trade","Singer-Prebisch_thesis","Import_substitution_industrialization","Export-oriented_industrialization","Paul_A._Baran","Rosa_Luxemburg","Vladimir_Lenin","Celso_Furtado","United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean","Paul_A._Baran","Paul_Sweezy","Andre_Gunder_Frank","Modernization_theory","International_division_of_labour","Guillermo_O'Donnell","Theotonio_dos_Santos","Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso","Immanuel_Wallerstein","World_Systems_Theory","History","Anthropology","NGO","Make_Poverty_History","Fair_trade","François_Perroux","Kurt_Rothschild","Herb_Addo","Walden_Bello","Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso","Enzo_Faletto","Armando_Cordova","Ernest_Feder","Andre_Gunder_Frank","Walter_Rodney","Pablo_González_Casanova","Keith_Griffin_(economist)","Kunibert_Raffer","Paul_Israel_Singer","Osvaldo_Sunkel","Samir_Amin","World_systems_theory","Karl_Polanyi","Joshua_Goldstein","Volker_Bornschier","Luigi_Scandella","Giovanni_Arrighi","Unequal_exchange","Chicago_Boys","The_Shock_Doctrine","Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation","John_Perkins_(author)","Structural_adjustment","World-systems_theory","Marxist_international_relations_theory","North-South_model","Immanuel_Wallerstein"]}
