The\nprofessional knowledge economy: the management and integration services in\nbusiness organizations. p.140.</ref> The role of consultant outside the medical\nsphere (where the term is used specifically for a grade of doctor) can fall\nunder one of two general categories:\n* 'Internal Consultant' - someone who operates within an organization but is\n  available to be consulted on areas of specialism by other departments or\n  individuals (acting as clients); or\n* 'External Consultant' - someone who is employed externally (either by a firm\n  or some other agency) whose expertise is provided on a temporary basis,\n  usually for a fee. As such this type of consultant generally engages with\n  multiple and changing clients.\n\nThe overall impact of a consultant is that clients have access to deeper levels\nof expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in-house, and may\npurchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired.\n\n'Consultant' is also the term used to denote the most senior medical position in\nthe United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland (e.g., a consultant surgeon).\n","title":"Consultant","headings":["Ways of work","Common types","Place of work","Qualifications","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Interim_Management","2: Human_resources","2: Biotechnology_consulting","2: Fourth-party_logistics","2: Political_consulting","1: Professional","1: Information_security","1: Physical_security","1: Management","1: Accountancy","1: Law","1: Tax_law","1: Marketing","1: Public_relations","1: Finance","1: Engineering","1: United_Kingdom","1: Australia","1: Republic_of_Ireland","1: Surgery","1: Management_Consulting","1: Information_and_Communications_Technology","1: Computer_programming","1: Systems_analysis","1: Senior_management","1: Public_Relations","1: Software_engineering","1: Computer_network","1: Peter_Block","1: Certified_management_consultant","1: Chemical_engineer","1: Contingent_workforce","1: IRS_Reclassification","1: Management_consulting","1: Permatemp","1: Public_consultation","1: Tax_advisor","1: Umbrella_company","1: Immigration_Consultant","1: Consultant_pharmacist","1: Creative_consultant","1: Consulting_psychology","1: Educational_consultant","1: Elevator_consultant","1: Employment_consultant","1: Environmental_consultant","1: Foreclosure_consultant","1: Human_resource_consulting","1: Image_consultant","1: Independent_contractor","1: Information_technology_consulting","1: Lactation_consultant","1: Legal_nurse_consultant","1: Loss_control_consultant","1: Magic_consultant","1: Market_entry_consultant","1: Media_consultant","1: Performance_consulting","1: Police_consultant","1: Process_consultant","1: Statistical_consultant","1: Theatre_consultant"]}
