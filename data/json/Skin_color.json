Human skin shows higher variation in color than any other single\nmammalian species and is the result of natural selection. Skin pigmentation in\nhumans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation\npenetrating the skin, controlling its biochemical effects.\n\nThe actual skin color of different humans is affected by many substances,\nalthough the single most important substance determining human skin color is the\npigment melanin. Melanin is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes\nand it is the main determinant of the skin color of darker-skinned humans. The\nskin color of people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white\nconnective tissue under the dermis and by the haemoglobin circulating in the\nveins of the dermis. The red color underlying the skin becomes more visible,\nespecially in the face, when, as consequence of physical exercise or the\nstimulation of the nervous system (anger, fear), arterioles dilate.\n\nThe natural skin color can be darkened as a result of tanning due to exposure to\nsunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight\nirradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction which\nproduces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells. There is a correlation between the geographic\ndistribution of UV radiation (UVR) and the distribution of indigenous skin\npigmentation around the world. Areas that highlight higher amounts of UVR\nreflect darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer towards the\nequator. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower\nconcentration of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations.\n\nIn the same population it has been observed that adult human females are\nconsiderably lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium\nduring pregnancy and lactation. Vitamin D which is synthesized from sunlight\nhelps absorbing calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin in order to help\ntheir bodies absorb more calcium. The social significance\nof differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time, as\ndemonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination.\n","linknr":1062,"url":"Skin_color","recorded":1362373622,"links":55,"instances":["classification_of_human_beings","skin","human"],"pdf":["http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/562_f2011/Week%201/Jablonski%202004.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/562_f2011/Week%201/Jablonski%202004.pdf","http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/blanche_paleur.pdf","http://galsatia.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/blanche_paleur.pdf","http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf","http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38568440/admixture/shriver01.pdf","http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/MylesHumGenet07-reprint.pdf","http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/MylesHumGenet07-reprint.pdf","http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf","http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110106160600/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/RandS/research/irr/rr21.pdf","http://www.jsri.msu.edu/RandS/research/irr/rr21.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110106160600/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/RandS/research/irr/rr21.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/b74147t360040220/fulltext.pdf","http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf","http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf"],"categories":["Skin
