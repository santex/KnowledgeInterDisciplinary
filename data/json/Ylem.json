For the musical composition of\nthe same name, see [[Ylem (Stockhausen)]]; for the musical album of the same\nname, see [[Ylem (album)]].\n\n'Ylem' is a term that was used by George Gamow, Ralph Alpher, and their\nassociates in the late 1940s for a hypothetical original substance or condensed\nstate of matter, which became subatomic particles and elements as we understand\nthem today. The term ylem was actually coined by Ralph Alpher.

Recombination of the charged plasma into neutral atoms made\nthe Universe transparent at the age of 380,000 years, and the radiation released\nis still observable as cosmic microwave background radiation.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Ylem","recorded":1362372195,"links":22,"instances":["cosmology","physics","writer","author","novel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Universe","Early scientific cosmologies"],"headings":["History","Interview","Use in science fiction and popular culture","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["recombination","cosmology"],["richard_calder","writer"],["dead_boys","novel"],["john_c._wright","author"]],"members":["recombination","plasma","richard_calder","dead_boys"],"related":["George_Gamow","Ralph_Alpher","Subatomic_particles","Chemical_element","Plasma_(physics)","Baryogenesis","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Recombination_(cosmology)","Atom","Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","Middle_English","Mythology","Cosmic_egg","Photon","Robert_Herman","Scientific_prediction","Red-shift","Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","Science_fiction","James_Blish","John_Brunner","Keith_Laumer","A.E._van_Vogt","The_Battle_of_Forever","Revenge","Protagonist","Life-span","Richard_Calder_(writer)","Quantum_mechanical","Dead_Girls","Dead_Boys_(novel)","Silent_MÃ¶bius","John_C._Wright_(author)","Germany","Black_metal","Dark_Fortress","Colossal_Cave_Adventure","Muds","Nick_Mamatas","Frank_Zappa","Baryogenesis","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Quark_matter"]}
