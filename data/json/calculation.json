{"cursor":"2816","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'calculation' is a deliberate process for transforming one or more inputs into\none or more results, with variable change.\n\nThe term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite arithmetical\ncalculation of using an algorithm to the vague heuristics of calculating a\nstrategy in a competition or calculating the chance of a successful relationship\nbetween two people.\n\nFor example, multiplying 7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Estimating\nthe fair price for financial instruments using the BlackâScholes model is a\ncomplex algorithmic calculation.\n\nStatistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also\ninvolve algorithmic calculations, but provide results made up of ranges of\npossibilities rather than exact answers.\n\nTo calculate means to ascertain by computing. The English word derives from the\nLatin calculus, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from\nLatin calx). It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used\nas a counter in an abacus (Latin abacus, Greek abax). The abacus was an\ninstrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the\nslide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles\nsliding on an iron bars.\n","linknr":139,"url":"calculation","recorded":1362671006,"links":40,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical terminology","Problem solving"],"headings":["Comparison to computation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["calculus","disambiguation"]],"members":["calculus"],"related":["Arithmetic","Algorithm","Heuristics","Multiplication","Financial_instruments","Black–Scholes","Statistical_estimation","Latin","Abacus","Greek_language","English_language","Computation","Abacus","Calculator","Calculus_(disambiguation)","Complexity_class","Computation","Cost_accounting","List_of_algorithms","Mathematics","Mental_calculation"]}
