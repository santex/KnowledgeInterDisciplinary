{"cursor":"22832","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'aquifer' is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or\nunconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be\nextracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and the\ncharacterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include\n'aquitard', which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and\n'aquiclude' (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or\noverlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer pressure\ncould cause it to become a confined aquifer.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Aquifer","recorded":1362371929,"links":57,"instances":["geometry","geology","oman","hydrosphere","stes","geology","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerbal.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf","http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/balances.pdf","http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf","http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf","http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_files/outch06.pdf"],"categories":["Aquifers|","Hydraulic engineering","Hydrology","Hydrogeology","Water and the environment","Bodies of water"],"headings":["Depth","Classification","Groundwater in rock formations","Human dependence on groundwater","Subsidence","Saltwater intrusion","Salination","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Aquifer_en.svg/350px-Aquifer_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Crops_Kansas_AST_20010624.jpg/220px-Crops_Kansas_AST_20010624.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Aquifersalt.jpg/220px-Aquifersalt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["jebel_akhdar","oman"],["sierra_nevada","u.s."],["cross_section","geometry"],["rock","geology"],["spring","hydrosphere"],["fracture","geology"],["drainage_system","agriculture"],["seasonal_thermal_energy_storage","stes"]],"members":["cross_section","fracture","jebel_akhdar","spring","sierra_nevada","seasonal_thermal_energy_storage","rock","drainage_system"],"related":["Water","Permeable_rock","Gravel","Sand","Silt","Groundwater","Water_well","Hydrogeology","Atlas_Mountains","North_Africa","Mount_Lebanon","Anti-Lebanon","Syria","Israel","Jebel_Akhdar_(Oman)","Oman","Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)","Southwestern_United_States","Over-exploitation","Libya","Overpopulation","Saltwater_intrusion","Groundwater","Sea","Beach","Sand","Water_well","Water_table","Cross_section_(geometry)","Stream","Humid","Vadose_zone","Clay","Rock_(geology)","Hydraulic_conductivity","Fresh_water","Vadose_zone","Atmospheric_pressure","Hydraulic_head","Suction","Adhesion","Isobar","Capillary_action","Capillary_fringe","Sand","Clay","Diameter","Spring_(hydrosphere)","Gravel","Bedrock","Groundwater","Hydraulic_conductivity","Alluvium","Water_table","Biscayne_Aquifer","Aquifer_test","Specific_storage","Specific_storage","Water_content","Isotropy","Anisotropy","Drainage_equation","Drainage_by_wells","Cave","Erosion","Limestone","Karst_topography","Pump","Porosity","Fracture_(geology)","Deccan_Traps","Basalt","India","Cretaceous","Chalk","Kansas","Ogallala_Aquifer","Earth","Meteoric_water","Hydrogeology","Arsenic","Arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater","Fossil_water","Muammar_Gaddafi","Great_Manmade_River","Subsidence","Irrigation","Groundwater_recharge","Soil_salination","Environmental_impact_of_irrigation","Soil_salinity_control","Drainage_system_(agriculture)","Tile_drainage","Drainage_by_wells","Groundwater_model","SahysMod","Great_Artesian_Basin","Guarani_Aquifer","Brazil","Argentina","Paraguay","Uruguay","Africa","Great_Manmade_River","Libya","Ogallala_Aquifer","Overdrafting","Fossil_water","Quaternary_glaciation","Edwards_Aquifer","Texas","Lake","Hamza_River","Aquifer_storage_and_recovery","Artesian_aquifer","Cistern","Groundwater_model","List_of_aquifers","Overexploitation","Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage_(STES)"]}
