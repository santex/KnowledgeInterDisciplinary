{"cursor":"3413","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe Villar Perosa is often technically regarded as the first submachine gun. The\nVillar Perosa was somewhat odd, and had sort of a heavy double automatic pistol\nconfiguration, with two 25-round box magazines feeding each barrel and a rate of\nfire in excess of 1000 rounds per minute. It was originally intended as an\nauxiliary aircraft weapon but was removed from airplanes to be replaced by light\nmachine guns using rifle rounds. It saw wide use with ground forces mainly for\ndefensive use when fitted with a protective armored plate. A large quantity was\nseized by Austrian troops during the battle of Caporetto. it also aided\ndevelopment of the next Italian submachine guns, the OVP 1918 and the Beretta\n1918. It is always claimed that the Beretta beat the Bergman MP18 by a couple of\nmonths or a couple of weeks in the field but there is absolutely no trace of its\nuse by the Arditi units who were supposed to have fielded it, unlike the\nBergmann MP 18.1 that appears on many pictures and is cited in both German or\nAllied reports. The Beretta's rate of fire was estimated to be in the 1000 to\n1300 rounds per minute range. The small quantity of Beretta 1918 available after\nWorld War I was converted as semi auto carbine for the Forestry Service. Since\nthe rate of fire of a SMG can be estimatedâ by its bolt mass and the ratio with\nthe weight of the projectile being fired, the examination of semi auto carbine\nand 1918/30 samples confirms the rate of fire and explains the reputation of\nunreliability of these first Beretta submachine guns.\n\nâ unless using a system that delays rearward move or forward move: locking\nrollers, Blish lock, buffer or cyclic rate reducer.\n\nThe Beretta 1935 was inspired by the French STA studies led by Section Technique\nde l'ArmÃ©e from 1918 to 1938. Many technical details are close to the STA 1922\nthat was adopted as MAS 1924 and used in post World War I limited colonial\nconflicts.\n\nStarting with the 1938 A, the Beretta SMG gained a well-deserved reputation of\naccuracy and reliability. They used the Italian 9 mm model 38, a round much more\npowerful than the German made 9 mm Parabellum.\n\n*Villar Perosa (1915) *OVP (1920s, developed from Villar Perosa) *Beretta Model\n1918 (1918)
