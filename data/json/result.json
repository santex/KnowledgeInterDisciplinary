Reaching no result can mean that actions\nare inefficient, ineffective, meaningless or flawed.\n\nSome types of result are as follows:\n* in general, the outcome of any kind of research, action or phenomenon\n* in games (e.g. cricket, lotteries) or wars, the result includes the identity\n  of the victorious party and possibly the effects on the environment\n* in mathematics, the final value of a calculation (e.g. arithmetic operation),\n  function or statistical expression, or the final statement of a theorem that\n  has been proven\n* in statistics, any information analyzed, extracted or interpolated from polls,\n  tests or logs\n* in computer sciences, the return value of a function, state of a system or\n  list of records matching a query (e.g. web search). The result type is the\n  data type of the data returned by a function.\n* in science, the outcome of an experiment (e.g. see null hypothesis)\n* in forensics and justice, the proof of guilt or innocence of a suspect after\n  evaluating evidence in a criminal investigation\n* in economics and accounting, the profit or loss at the end of a fiscal period.\n* in democracy, the election of a representative or the outcome of a vote\n  on a subject\n",
