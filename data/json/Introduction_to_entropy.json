The movie running in reverse shows impossible things happening\n- water jumping out a glass into a pitcher above it, smoke going down a chimney,\nwater \"unmelting\" to form ice, crashed cars reassembling themselves, and so on.\nIn thermodynamics, one says that the \"forward\" processes - pouring water from a\npitcher, smoke going up a chimney, etc. are \"irreversible\" - they cannot happen\nin reverse, even though, on a microscopic level, no laws of physics are being\nviolated. All real physical processes involving systems in everyday life, with\nmany atoms or molecules, are irreversible. For an irreversible process, the\nthermodynamic parameter known as entropy is always increasing. The reason\nthat the movie in reverse is so easily recognized is because it shows processes\nfor which entropy is decreasing, which is physically impossible. In everyday\nlife, there may be processes in which the increase of entropy is practically\nunobservable, almost zero. In these cases, a movie of the process run in reverse\nwill not seem unlikely. For example, in a 1-second video of the collision of two\nbilliard balls, it will be hard to distinguish the forward and the backward\ncase, because the increase of entropy during that time is relatively small. In\nthermodynamics, one says that this process is practically \"reversible\", with an\nentropy increase that is practically zero. The statement of the fact that\nentropy never decreases is found in the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn a physical system, '[[entropy]]' provides a measure of the amount of thermal\nenergy that cannot be used to do work. In some other definitions of entropy, it\nis a measure of how evenly energy (or some analogous property) is distributed\nin a system.\n\nThe concept of entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics. The\nsecond law determines which physical processes can occur. For example, it\npredicts that the flow of heat from a region of high temperature to a region of\nlow temperature is a spontaneous process â it can proceed along without needing\nany extra external energy. When this process occurs, the hot region becomes\ncooler and the cold region becomes warmer. Heat is distributed more evenly\nthroughout the system and the system's ability to do work has decreased because\nthe temperature difference between the hot region and the cold region has\ndecreased. Referring back to our definition of entropy, we can see that the\nentropy of this system has increased. Thus, the second law of thermodynamics can\nbe stated to say that the entropy of an isolated system always increases, and\nsuch processes which increase entropy can occur spontaneously. Since entropy\nincreases as uniformity increases, the second law says qualitatively that\nuniformity increases.\n\nThe term entropy was coined in 1865 by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius,\nfrom the Greek words en-, \"in\", and trope \"a turning\", in analogy with\n[[energy]].\n","linknr":307,"url":"Introduction_to_entropy","recorded":1362481915,"links":13,"instances":["energy_dispersal","thermodynamics","statistical_mechanics","thermodynamics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thermodynamic entropy","Introduction articles|Entropy"],"headings":["Explanation","Example of increasing entropy","Origins and uses","Heat and entropy","Introductory descriptions of entropy","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg/220px-Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/4/354c808b3ac7ff5bd75faa26bcc36220.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/e/7/de71b72c4f62f20d117414dd2f33ca25.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/7/af7e8a85df47250ffab736b7a8807488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/e/2aede3b55c027fe4392429d6474ec397.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/c/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/8/888fa252e9cde41ef196d5154cd7219c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5206560a306a2e085a437fd258eb57ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/f/5/1f58273c4161e57f62a95804c2ae961a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/e/17eb927e31859ce116f5c64cbcc30d75.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/c/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/8/888fa252e9cde41ef196d5154cd7219c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5206560a306a2e085a437fd258eb57ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/7/af7e8a85df47250ffab736b7a8807488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/5/8153e779d69fe6c35dc2bc4dfb0f2a11.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/5/5758e3126ffd73977ec11d0c19d06692.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/7/5678e99000d8069acd323bb63d6376d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5205e29e7201a0b009466036b40a34a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/a/efaf41bc71e30379d097cec808d802db.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/5/bc5ad0dda38f84fd499b8fd2fb09ff10.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Ice_water.jpg/220px-Ice_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/b/92bbde703193217f1110b0ab9c60810b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/a/5daba0fec977aa11756d36959c046953.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/b/92bbde703193217f1110b0ab9c60810b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/b/d9ba4371a6438f1f0cd2fce07d9562dd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/3/3535d6df00ec625085f81fcbc9842faf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/9/98977358f94d468d24caf430945f6cec.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/0/5/405d8c0edea1d02ee125245447f9e848.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/b/7abbcf0ce3c8e0797da5ba0684e82a50.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/9/bc9c2319e087af5620217a5f65b3c534.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5/b/b5b58e6c0a68fedbe96264643a65661e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/5/d75eee6dda129485990751222ba37673.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/b/6/6b65c0c8b97a0a90ac605160649d03bb.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work","thermodynamics"],["microstate","statistical_mechanics"],["microstate","statistical_mechanics"],["volume","thermodynamics"],["entropy","statistical_views"],["entropy","energy_dispersal"],["entropy","order_and_disorder"],["entropy","energy_dispersal"],["entropy","energy_dispersal"]],"members":["entropy","volume","microstate","work"],"related":["Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Work_(thermodynamics)","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Spontaneous_process","Isolated_system","Rudolf_Clausius","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Natural_logarithm","Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)","Integral","Statistical_mechanics","Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)","Boltzmann's_constant","Natural_logarithm","Temperature","Pressure","Volume_(thermodynamics)","Energy","First_law_of_thermodynamics","Conservation_of_energy","Internal_energy","Thermodynamic_system","Information_entropy","Statistical_thermodynamics","Probability_theory","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Heat","Enthalpy_of_fusion","Ludwig_Boltzmann","Entropy_(statistical_views)","Probability_theory","Werner_Heisenberg","Statistical_mechanics","Entropy_(energy_dispersal)","Information_entropy","Ideal_gas","Integral","Entropy_(order_and_disorder)","Frank_L._Lambert","Entropy_(energy_dispersal)","Entropy_(energy_dispersal)","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Statistical_mechanics","Thermodynamics"]}
