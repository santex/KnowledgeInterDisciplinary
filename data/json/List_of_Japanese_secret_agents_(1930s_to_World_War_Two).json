His\nstaff consisted of Colonel Kotani, Navy officer Captain Onoda, and Mr.Yosano,\nForeign Office Chancellor.

A third objective (concerning the arrangement of a separate peace\nbetween Germany and the Soviet Union) was eliminated just prior to the departure\nof the mission. The Okamoto Mission reported its findings in a cable dated July\n5. Many reservations were attached to the report, which concluded that German\nnational power was lower than had been foreseen by the mission before it left\nJapan. Germany would accordingly encounter many difficulties in emerging\ntriumphant without first overcoming the critical problems which were fast\napproaching: Shortage of manpower, lowering of industrial war potential,\ninsufficiency of liquid fuel, etc. *On October 15, 1943, IGHQ incorporated its\nSecond Bureau's 16th Section (German and Italian Intelligence) into the 5th\nSection (U.S.S.R. intelligence).

The feeling of the Japanese Army High\nCommand was therefore somewhat inclining to pessimism vis-a vis Germany. The\nJapanese Army committed a great error by placing excessive confidence in\nGermany. After the Allies had successfully established a Second Front in\nnorthern France (June 1944) and an attempt had soon afterwards been made to\nassassinate Hitler (July 20 plot, 1944) - only then did the Japanese Army\nIntelligence Services and High Command eventually conclude that Germany\npossessed scant prospects for victory. *Patrick Heenan, July 1910-February 13,\n1942 was a Captain in the British Indian Army, who was convicted of treason,\nafter spying for Japanese military intelligence during the Malayan campaign of\nWorld War II.
