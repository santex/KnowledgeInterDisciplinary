For electronic mail, see [[Email]]. For\nother uses, see [[Mail (disambiguation)]] and [[Postal service\n(disambiguation)]].\n\n\n pillar boxes at the Inkpen Post Box Museum, near Taunton, Somerset]]\n\n'Mail', or 'post', is a system for transporting letters and other tangible\nobjects: written documents, typically enclosed in envelopes, and also small\npackages are delivered to destinations around the world. Anything sent through\nthe postal system is called mail or post.<ref>In Australia, Canada and the U.S.,\nmail is commonly used both for the postal system and for letters, postcards and\nparcels; in New Zealand, post is more common for the postal system and mail for\nthe material delivered; in the UK, post prevails in both senses. However, the\nBritish, American, Australian, and Canadian national postal services are called,\nrespectively, [[Royal Mail]], [[United States Postal Service]], [[Australia\nPost]], and [[Canada Post]]; in addition, such fixed phrases as post office or\njunk mail are found throughout the English-speaking world.</ref>\n\nA postal service can be private or public, though many governments place\nrestrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century national postal\nsystems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on\nthe article prepaid. Proof of payment is often in the form of adhesive postage\nstamps, but postage meters are also used for bulk mailing.\n\nPostal authorities often have functions other than transporting letters. In some\ncountries, a Postal Telegraph and Telephone (PTT) service oversees the postal\nsystem as well as having authority over telephone and telegraph systems. Some\ncountries' postal systems allow for savings accounts and handle applications for\npassports.\n","title":"mail","headings":["Early postal systems","Etymology","Modern mail","Types of mail","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Postage_stamp","3: Internet","3: United_States_Postal_Service","3: E-mail","3: Magazine","2: Envelope","2: Chapar_Khaneh","2: United_Kingdom","2: Genghis_Khan","2: Yuan_Dynasty","2: Kublai_Khan","2: Mongol_Empire","2: Royal_Mail","2: Retronym","2: Legal_monopoly","2: Germany","2: Universal_Postal_Union","2: POSTNET","2: Hybrid_mail","2: Postcard","2: Postal_card","1: Pillar_box","1: Taunton","1: Somerset","1: Document","1: Government_monopoly","1: Postage_meter","1: Postal_Telegraph_and_Telephone","1: List_of_basic_communication_topics","1: Writing","1: Courier","1: Egypt","1: Pharaoh","1: Ancient_Persia","1: Xenophon","1: Cyrus_the_Great","1: Darius_I_of_Persia","1: Hammurabi","1: Sargon_II_of_Assyria","1: Old_Testament","1: Esther","1: Xerxes_I","1: Medes","1: Persian_Empire","1: Herodotus","1: Scinde","1: Sindh","1: Mauryan_empire","1: India","1: Watermark","1: South_India","1: Wodeyar_dynasty","1: Kingdom_of_Mysore","1: Maharaja","1: Jodhpur","1: Darśana","1: British_Raj","1: Han_Dynasty","1: Ögedei_Khan","1: Ortoo","1: Rome","1: Augustus_Caesar","1: Oxen","1: Official_mail","1: Marco_Polo","1: Islam","1: Middle_Ages","1: Homing_pigeon","1: Pigeon_post","1: Dogsled","1: Balloon","1: Rocket","1: Mule","1: Pneumatic_post","1: Submarine","1: Charlemagne","1: Franks","1: Gaul","1: Missus_dominicus","1: Cistercians","1: Abbey","1: Monastery","1: Knights_Templar","1: University","1: Bologna","1: Scribe","1: Holy_Roman_Emperor","1: Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","1: Thurn_und_Taxis","1: France","1: Uniform_Penny_Post","1: Mulready_stationery","1: Penny_Black","1: Postal_history","1: Railway_post_office","1: Air_mail","1: Mail_truck","1: Social_networking","1: Online_auction","1: Medieval_English","1: Male","1: US_Postal_Service","1: FedEx_Corporation","1: United_Parcel_Service","1: Package_delivery","1: Mail#First-class","1: Poland","1: International_Reply_Coupon","1: Barcode#2D_barcodes","1: Airmail","1: London","1: Hendon","1: North_London","1: Windsor,_Berkshire","1: Berkshire","1: Rocket_mail","1: Franking","1: Bank","1: Direct_mail","1: United_States_of_America","1: Constitution_of_Mexico","1: Constitution_of_Brazil","1: European_Convention_of_Human_Rights","1: Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","1: Censorship","1: Civil_rights","1: Customs","1: Black_chamber","1: Military_mail","1: Telegraph","1: Telephone","1: Telex","1: Facsimile","1: Malware","1: Signature","1: Wedding","1: Internet_slang","1: Snail_mail","1: Telegram","1: Teleprinter","1: Fax","1: Short_message_service","1: INTELPOST","1: Calligraphy","1: Typeface","1: Rubber_stamps","1: Artistamps","1: Mail_art","1: EBay","1: Auction_sites","1: Online_store","1: Online_post_offices","1: Postage_stamps","1: Collecting","1: Stamp_collecting","1: Philately","1: Jargon","1: Literature","1: Biography","1: New_Testament","1: Bible","1: Apostle_Paul","1: Epistle","1: Island","1: Message_in_a_bottle","1: Sweden","1: New_Zealand","1: Letter_monopoly","1: Argentina","1: New_Zealand_Post","1: Madeira","1: Portugal","1: A4_paper_size","1: Utility","1: Credit_cards","1: Personal_identification_numbers","1: Bulk_mail","1: Presort","1: Direct_marketing","1: Advertising_mail","1: Demographics","1: Restaurant","1: Retail","1: Newspaper","1: Recorded_mail","1: Recorded_delivery","1: Registered_post","1: Post-it_notes","1: Charities","1: Fair_trade","1: Third_world_debt","1: ORM-D","1: Terrorism","1: X-ray","1: Mail_bomb","1: Newspapers","1: L-mail","1: Mail_forwarding","1: List_of_postal_entities","1: EPPML","1: Letter_box","1: Mail_carrier","1: Packstation","1: Post_box","1: Post_office","1: Post-office_box","1: Postage_rate","1: Postal_code","1: Mail_bag","1: Catcher_pouch","1: Mail_pouch","1: Mail_sack","1: Mail_satchel","1: Pony_Express_mochila","1: Institute_of_European_History","1: US_patent_office","1: Smithsonian_Institution"]}
