{"cursor":"11419","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Semelparity' and 'iteroparity' refer to the reproductive strategy of an\norganism. A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single\nreproductive episode before death, and iteroparous if it is characterized by\nmultiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime. Some plant\nscientists use the parallel terms monocarpy and polycarpy. (See also\nplietesials.)\n\nIn truly semelparous species, death after reproduction is part of an overall\nstrategy that includes putting all available resources into maximizing\nreproduction, at the expense of future life (see \"Trade-offs\", below). In any\niteroparous population there will be some individuals who die between their\nfirst and second reproductive episodes, but unless this is part of a syndrome of\nprogrammed death after reproduction, this would not be called semelparity.\n\nThis distinction is also related to the difference between annual and\nperennial plants. An annual is a plant that completes its life cycle in a\nsingle season, and is usually semelparous. Perennials live for more than one\nseason and are usually (but not always) iteroparous.
