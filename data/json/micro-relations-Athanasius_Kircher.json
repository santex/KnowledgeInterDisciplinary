Woods, p 108 A resurgence of interest in Kircher has\noccurred within the scholarly community in recent decades. The first general-\ninterest biography of Kircher is titled, A Man of Misconceptions: The Life of an\nEccentric in an Age of Change, by John Glassie.\n\nKircher claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphic writing of the ancient\nEgyptian language, but most of his assumptions and translations in this field\nwere later found to be nonsensical. He did, however, correctly establish the\nlink between the ancient Egyptian and the modern Coptic languages, and some\ncommentators regard him as the founder of Egyptology. Kircher was also\nfascinated with Sinology and wrote an encyclopedia of China, in which he noted\nthe early presence of Nestorian Christians while also attempting to establish\nlinks with Egypt and Christianity that modern scholars regard as largely\nimaginary.\n\nKircher's work with geology included studies of volcanos and fossils. One of the\nfirst people to observe microbes through a microscope, he was thus ahead of his\ntime in proposing that the plague was caused by an infectious microorganism and\nin suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kircher\nalso displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions, and\ninventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various automatons and\nthe first megaphone. The invention of the magic lantern is often misattributed\nto Kircher, although he did conduct a study of the principles involved in his\nArs Magna Lucis et Umbrae.\n\nA scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by\nthe rationalism of RenÃ© Descartes and others. In the late 20th century,\nhowever, the aesthetic qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One\nmodern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as \"a giant among seventeenth-\ncentury scholars\", and \"one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all\nknowledge as his domain\". Cutler, p 68 \nAnother scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as \"the last\nRenaissance man\".\n","linknr":646,"url":"Athanasius_Kircher","recorded":1362505853,"links":66,"instances":["language","building","music","scientist"],"pdf":["http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf","http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf","http://www.haraldfischerverlag.de/hfv/Digital/walravens.pdf","http://hotgates.stanford.edu/Eyes/library/kircher.pdf","http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf","http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/Voynich_Manuscript_Mysterious.pdf","http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/scipubs/pdfs/v57/proccas_v57_n36.pdf"],"categories":["1600s
