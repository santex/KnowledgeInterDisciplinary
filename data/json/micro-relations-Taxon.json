{"cursor":"5122","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n form a widely-accepted taxon, the genus Loxodonta]] A 'taxon' (plural: 'taxa')\n is a group of one (or more) populations of organism(s), which a taxonomist\n adjudges to be a unit. Usually a taxon is given a name and a rank, although\n neither is a requirement. Defining what belongs or does not belong to such a\n taxonomic group is done by a taxonomist with the science of taxonomy. It is not\n uncommon for one taxonomist to disagree with another on what exactly belongs to\n a taxon, or on what exact criteria should be used for inclusion.\n\nTaxonomists sometimes make a distinction between \"good\" (or natural) taxa and\nothers that are \"not good\" (or artificial). Today it is common to define a good\ntaxon as one that reflects evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships, but this\nis not mandatory.\n\nA taxon may be given a formal scientific name, the application of which is\ngoverned by one of the Nomenclature Codes, which set out rules to determine\nwhich scientific name is correct for that particular grouping.\n\nAdvocates of phylogenetic nomenclature, using cladistic methods, require taxa to\nbe monophyletic, consisting of all descendants of some ancestor. They generally\ndo not refer to taxa as their basic unit, but to \"clades,\" a clade being a\nspecial form of taxon. However, even in traditional nomenclature, few\ntaxonomists of our time would establish new taxa that they know to be\nparaphyletic. A famous example of a widely accepted taxon that is not\nalso a clade is the \"Reptilia.\"\n\n","linknr":195,"url":"Taxon","recorded":1362509297,"links":61,"instances":["taxonomy","biology","biology","zoology"],"pdf":["http://vertebrates.si.edu/herps/herps_pdfs/deQueiroz_pdfs/1990deQ_GauSZ.pdf","http://vertebrates.si.edu/herps/herps_pdfs/deQueiroz_pdfs/1990deQ_GauSZ.pdf"],"categories":["Scientific classification","Zoological nomenclature","Botanical nomenclature"],"headings":["Definition","Ranks","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Elephants_in_Kenya.jpg/270px-Elephants_in_Kenya.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg/150px-Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["class","biology"],["rank","botany"],["rank","zoology"],["segregate","taxonomy"]],"members":["segregate","domain","class","rank"],"related":["Genus","Taxonomist","Taxonomy","Evolution","Phylogenetic","Scientific_name","Nomenclature_Codes","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Cladistic","Monophyletic","Clade","Paraphyletic","Reptilia","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Taxonomic_rank","Domain_(biology)","Plant","Fungus","Class_(biology)","Marchantiophyta","Cladistics","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Phylogeny","Phenetic","Paraphyletic","Phylogenetic_taxonomy","Clade","ABCD_Schema","Alpha_taxonomy","Folk_taxonomy","Chresonym","Cladistics","ICBN","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","Rank_(botany)","Rank_(zoology)","Segregate_(taxonomy)","Virus_classification"]}
