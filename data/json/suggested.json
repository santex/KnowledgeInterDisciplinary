psychological process by which one person guides the\nthoughts, feelings, or behaviour of another. Nineteenth century writers on\npsychology such as William James used the words '\"suggest\"' and '\"suggestion\"'\nin senses close to those they have in common speechâ€”one idea was said to suggest\nanother when it brought that other idea to mind. Early scientific studies of\nhypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in\na special and technical sense (Hull, 1933). The original neuro-psychological\ntheory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideo-motor reflex response of\nWilliam B. Carpenter and James Braid.\n","title":"suggestion","headings":["Hypnosis","Waking suggestion","Other forms","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Hypnosis","1: Psychology","1: William_James","1: Clark_Leonard_Hull","1: Ideo_motor_response","1: William_Benjamin_Carpenter","1: Irving_Kirsch","1: Gudjonsson_suggestibility_scale","1: Post-hypnotic_suggestion"]}
