ShÅ Shin's long reign has been described as \"the Great Days of\n ChÅ«zan\", a period of great peace and relative prosperity. He was the son of ShÅ\n En, the founder of the dynasty, by Yosoidon, ShÅ En's second wife, often\n referred to as the queen mother. He succeeded his uncle, ShÅ Sen'i, who was\n forced to abdicate in his favor.\n\nMuch of the foundational organization of the kingdom's administration and\neconomy is traced back to developments which occurred during ShÅ Shin's reign.\nAs government became more institutionalized and organized, the [[aji\n(RyÅ«kyÅ«)|aji]] (æå¸, local lords) gradually lost power and independence, becoming\nmore closely tied to the central government at Shuri. In order to strengthen\ncentral control over the kingdom, and to prevent insurrection on the part of the\naji, ShÅ Shin gathered weapons from all the aji to be put to use for the defense\nof the kingdom, and ordered aji to make their residences in Shuri; lords\nseparated from their lands and from their people were far less able to act\nindependently or to organize rebellion, and, over time, their emotional\nconnections to Shuri grew, those with their territory weakening. The residences\nat Shuri of the aji were divided into three districts â one each for those\ncoming from the northern, central, and southern areas of Okinawa Island which\nhad formerly been the independent kingdoms of Hokuzan, ChÅ«zan, and Nanzan\nrespectively. These regions were now renamed Kunigami, Nakagami, and Shimajiri,\nrespectively, place names which remain in use today. Through intermarriage,\nresidence in Shuri, and other factors, the aji came to be more integrated as a\nclass, more closely associated with life and customs and politics at Shuri, and\nless attached to their ancestral territorial identities.\n\nThe aji left deputies, called aji okite (æå¸æ), to administer their lands on\ntheir behalf, and some years later a system of jito dai (å°é ­ä»£), agents sent by\nthe central government to oversee the outlying territories, was established.\nSome aji of the northern regions were allowed to remain there, not moving to\nShuri, as they were too powerful for the king to force their obedience in this\nmatter; the king's third son was made Warden of the North, however, and granted\nauthority to maintain peace and order in the region. Kerr. pp105-8.\n\nThe Shuri dialect of the Okinawan language used by administrators and\nbureaucrats became standardized at this time, and a golden age of poetry and\nliterature blossomed. The first volumes of the [[Omoro SÅshi]], a collection of\npoems, songs, and chants reflecting centuries-old oral tradition as well as\ncontemporary events, were completed in 1532. Kerr. p111. Along with\nlater volumes, the Omoro SÅshi would become one of the chief primary sources for\nmodern-day historians studying the kingdom's history.\n\nThe process of moving the aji to Shuri also brought about major changes to the\ncity, including the construction of a great many grand gates, pavilions, lakes,\nbridges, monuments, and gardens. There came to be a great demand for masons,\ncarpenters, and others, as well as for a wide variety of goods and materials,\nimported by each aji from his own territories. Okinawa Island quickly became\nmore economically integrated, with goods and labor traveling to and from Shuri\nand the neighboring port city of Naha. Kerr. p108. Economic\nintegration allowed territories to become more specialized, and the production\nof luxury goods expanded significantly. Various kinds of hairpins and other\nornaments became standard elements of the fashions of courtiers and bureaucrats,\nnew techniques in producing and weaving silk were imported, and the use of gold,\nsilver, lacquer, and silk became more common among townspeople. Kerr.\np108. Urbanization led to increased prosperity for merchants, traders,\ncourtiers, townsmen and others, though historian George H. Kerr points out that\nfarmers and fishermen, who made up the vast majority of the Okinawan population,\nremained quite poor. Kerr. p105.\n\nMany monuments, temples, and other structures were also erected during the\nprosperous reign of ShÅ Shin. A new palace building was constructed, in Chinese\nstyle, and court rituals and ceremonies were dramatically altered and expanded,\nin emulation of Chinese modes. A pair of tall stone \"Dragon Pillars\" were placed\nat the entrance to the palace, patterned not after Chinese, Korean or Japanese\nmodels, but after those of Thailand and Cambodia, reflecting, as Kerr points\nout, the reach and extent of Okinawan trade and the cosmopolitan nature of the\ncapital at this time. Kerr. p109. The Buddhist temple Enkaku-ji was\nbuilt in 1492, SÅgen-ji was expanded in 1496, and in 1501, Tamaudun, the royal\nmausoleum complex, was completed. ShÅ Shin successfully petitioned the Korean\nroyal court, several times, to send volumes of Buddhist texts; Kerr.\np112. the first metal movable type printing presses in the world had been\ninvented in Korea in the 13th century. In the thirtieth year of his reign, a\nstele was erected in the grounds of Shuri Castle, listing Eleven Distinctions of\nthe Age enumerated by court officials. A reproduction of this stele, destroyed\nin the 1945 Battle of Okinawa along with the castle, stands in the castle\ngrounds today.\n\nThe reign of ShÅ Shin also saw the expansion of the kingdom's control over\nseveral of the outlying Ryukyu Islands. Okinawan ships began in the late 15th\ncentury to frequent Miyakojima and the Yaeyama Islands; following a series of\ndisputes among the local lords in the Yaeyama Islands which broke out in 1486,\nShÅ Shin in 1500 sent military forces to quell the disputes and establish\ncontrol over the islands. Kumejima was brought under firm control of Shuri, and\nliaison offices were established in Miyako and Yaeyama, in 1500 and 1524\nrespectively. Kerr. p115.\n\nShÅ Shin also effected significant changes to the organization of the native\n[[noro]] (ãã­, high priestesses) cult and its relationship to the government. He\nowed his uncle's abdication, and his own succession to his sister, the noro of\nthe royal family, a special position known as the [[kikoe-Ågimi]]. He\nestablished a new residence for the kikoe-Ågimi (èå¾å¤§å) just outside the gates to\nthe castle, and erected high walls in 1519 around the Sonohyan Utaki, the sacred\nspace and accompanying sacred hearth which she tended. A system by which the\nking and kikoe-Ågimi appointed local noro across the kingdom was established,\ntying this element of the native Ryukyuan religion into formal systems of\nauthority under the government. Kerr. p111.\n\nAfter a fifty year reign, ShÅ Shin died in 1526, and was succeeded by his son\nShÅ Sei. It is said that after such a long reign, officials encountered\ndifficulties in determining the proper way to conduct the royal funeral,\nsuccession rituals, and other important related ceremonies. Kerr.\np115. Historian George Kerr writes that \"Okinawa was never again to know\nthe halcyon days of Sho Shin's reign. Kerr. p116.
