An example of a phraseological collocation, as\npropounded by Michael Halliday,<ref>Halliday, M.A.K., 'Lexis as a Linguistic\nLevel', Journal of Linguistics 2(1) 1966: 57-67</ref> is the expression strong\ntea. While the same meaning could be conveyed by the roughly equivalent\n*powerful tea, this expression is considered incorrect by English speakers.\nConversely, the corresponding expression for computer, powerful computers is\npreferred over *strong computers. Phraseological collocations should not be\nconfused with idioms, where meaning is derived, whereas collocations are mostly\ncompositional.\n\nThere are about six main types of collocations: adjective+noun, noun+noun (such\nas collective nouns), verb+noun, adverb+adjective, verbs+prepositional phrase\n(phrasal verbs), and verb+adverb.\n\nCollocation extraction is a task that extracts collocations automatically from a\ncorpus, using computational linguistics.\n","title":"collocation","headings":["Expanded definition","In dictionaries","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Corpus_linguistics","2: Co-occurrence","2: Phraseology","2: Phraseme#Collocations","2: Phrasal_verb","1: Terminology","1: Michael_Halliday","1: Idiom","1: Collective_nouns","1: Collocation_extraction","1: Computational_linguistics","1: Syntax","1: Subjectâ€“verbâ€“object","1: Lexicon","1: Antonymy","1: Grammar","1: Key_Word_in_Context","1: Statistical_significance","1: Mutual_information","1: Student's_t-test","1: Log-likelihood","1: Harold_Palmer","1: Foreign_language","1: Monolingual_learner's_dictionary","1: Specialized_dictionary","1: ClichÃ©","1: Collocational_restriction","1: Collostructional_analysis","1: Compound_noun,_adjective_and_verb","1: Lexical_item","1: N-gram"]}
