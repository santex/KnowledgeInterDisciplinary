Every subsequential limit is a cluster point, but not conversely.\nIn first-countable spaces, the two concepts coincide.\n\nThe supremum of the set of all subsequential limits of some sequence is called\nthe limit superior, or limsup. Similarly, the infimum of such a set is called\nthe limit inferior, or liminf.
