They were constructed in Wapping downstream from the City of London\nbetween 1799 and 1815, at a cost exceeding Â£5Â½ million. Traditionally\nships had docked at wharves on the River Thames, but by this time, more capacity\nwas needed. They were the closest docks to the City of London, until St\nKatharine Docks were built two decades later.\n\nThe London Docks occupied a total area of about 30 acres (120,000 mÂ²),\nconsisting of Western and Eastern docks linked by the short Tobacco Dock. The\nWestern Dock was connected to the Thames by Hermitage Basin to the south west\nand Wapping Basin to the south. The Eastern Dock connected to the Thames via the\nShadwell Basin to the east. The principal designers were the architects and\nengineers Daniel Asher Alexander and John Rennie. The docks specialised in high-\nvalue luxury commodities such as ivory, spices, coffee and cocoa as well as wine\nand wool, for which elegant warehouses and wine cellars were constructed. In\n1864 they were amalgamated with St Katharine Docks. The system was never\nconnected to the railway network. Together with the rest of the enclosed docks,\nthe London Docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909.\n\nThe docks were finally closed to shipping in 1969 and sold to the borough of\nTower Hamlets, which filled in the western portion of the London Docks with the\n(unrealised) intention of turning them into public housing estates. The land was\nstill largely derelict when it was acquired in 1981 by the London Docklands\nDevelopment Corporation (LDDC). It was subsequently redeveloped with over 1,000\nindividual properties centred around the old Tobacco Dock and Shadwell Basin.\nThe controversial \"Fortress Wapping\" printing works of Rupert Murdoch's News\nInternational corporation was constructed on the northern half of the infilled\nWestern Dock. Hermitage Basin and Shadwell Basin survive, but Wapping Basin is\nnow a sports pitch and some of the Eastern Dock site is open space. A small\ncanal runs across the southern part of the Western Dock site from Hermitage\nBasin to Tobacco Dock.\n","linknr":120,"url":"London_Docks","recorded":1374966100,"links":["/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Custom_Office_London_Dock.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Custom_Office_London_Dock.jpg/250px-Custom_Office_London_Dock.jpg","/wiki/File:Custom_Office_London_Dock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Daniel_Asher_Alexander","/wiki/File:London_Dock_Custom_and_Excise_1820.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/London_Dock_Custom_and_Excise_1820.jpg/250px-London_Dock_Custom_and_Excise_1820.jpg","/wiki/File:London_Dock_Custom_and_Excise_1820.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Plan_of_London_Docks_by_Henry_Palmer_1831.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Plan_of_London_Docks_by_Henry_Palmer_1831.JPG/250px-Plan_of_London_Docks_by_Henry_Palmer_1831.JPG","/wiki/File:Plan_of_London_Docks_by_Henry_Palmer_1831.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Birdseye_View_of_the_London_Docks._ILN_1845.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Birdseye_View_of_the_London_Docks._ILN_1845.jpg/250px-Birdseye_View_of_the_London_Docks._ILN_1845.jpg","/wiki/File:Birdseye_View_of_the_London_Docks._ILN_1845.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:London_docks_c1909.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/London_docks_c1909.jpg/250px-London_docks_c1909.jpg","/wiki/File:London_docks_c1909.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Port_of_London","/wiki/Wapping","/wiki/City_of_London","#cite_note-1","/wiki/River_Thames","/wiki/St_Katharine_Docks","/wiki/Tobacco_Dock","/wiki/Shadwell_Basin","/wiki/Daniel_Asher_Alexander","/wiki/John_Rennie_(engineer)","/wiki/Port_of_London_Authority","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/London_Docklands_Development_Corporation","/wiki/Fortress_Wapping","/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch","/wiki/News_International","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tobacco_Dock","/wiki/Shadwell_Basin","/wiki/Safeguarded_wharf","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-333-57688-8","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=London_Docks&params=51_30_21.6_N_0_3_37.2_W_region:GB_type:landmark","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&oldid=547792948","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:London_docks","/wiki/Category:History_of_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Tower_Hamlets","/wiki/Category:Port_of_London","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=London+Docks&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=London+Docks","/wiki/London_Docks","/wiki/Talk:London_Docks","#","/wiki/London_Docks","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/London_Docks","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/London_Docks","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&oldid=547792948","/w/index.php?title=London_Docks&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1488404","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=London_Docks&id=547792948","/w/index.php?title=
