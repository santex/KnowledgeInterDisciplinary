With a\npopulation of 495,360 in 2011 (up 1.9% from 2010),<ref></ref> it is the largest\nsettlement in Lothian and lies at the centre of a larger urban zone of\napproximately 850,000 people.<ref></ref> While the town originally formed on the\nridge descending from the Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built\non seven hills.\n\nFrom its prehistoric beginning as a hillfort, following periods of Celtic and\nGermanic influence, Edinburgh became part of the Kingdom of Scotland during the\n10th century. With burgh charters granted by David I and Robert the Bruce,\nEdinburgh grew through the Middle Ages as Scotland’s biggest merchant town. By\nthe time of the European Renaissance and the reign of James IV it was well\nestablished as Scotland's capital. The 16th century Scottish Reformation and\n18th century Scottish Enlightenment were formative periods in the history of the\ncity, which played a central role in both. While political power shifted to\nLondon following the Treaty of Union in 1707, devolution in 1997 has resulted in\nthe return of a Scottish parliament.\n\nEdinburgh has a high proportion of independent schools, one college and four\nuniversities. The University of Edinburgh (which now includes Edinburgh College\nof Art) is the biggest university in Scotland<ref></ref> and ranked 21st in the\nworld.<ref></ref> These institutions help provide a highly educated\npopulation<ref></ref> and a dynamic economy.<ref name=\"Work In Edinburgh - Jobs,\nEmployment, Careers And Recruitment Information\" ></ref> Edinburgh has the UK's\nstrongest economy outside London and was named European Best Large City of the\nFuture for Foreign Direct Investment by fDi Magazine in 2012/13.<ref></ref>\n\nEach August the city hosts the biggest annual international arts festival in the\nworld. This includes the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Festival\nFringe and the Edinburgh International Book Festival. Other festivals are held\nthroughout the year, such as the Science Festival, Film Festival and Jazz and\nBlues Festival. Other annual events include the Hogmanay street party and\nBeltane. Edinburgh is the world's first UNESCO City of Literature<ref></ref> and\nthe city's Old Town and New Town are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<ref\nname=\"www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site\"></ref> Edinburgh regularly polls as\none of the best locations to live nationally, having won more than 12 UK Best\nCity Awards in 8 years to 2013.<ref></ref>\n\nAttracting over one million overseas visitors a year, Edinburgh is the second\nmost popular tourist destination in the UK after London<ref></ref> and was voted\nEuropean Destination of the Year at the World Travel Awards 2012.\n","title":"edinburgh","headings":["Etymology","History","Geography","Demography","Religion","Governance","Economy","Transport","Education","Healthcare","Culture","Sport","Notable
