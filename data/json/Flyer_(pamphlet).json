Flyers have been used in\narmed conflict: for example, airborne leaflet propaganda has been a tactic of\npsychological warfare. *Recruit members *Advertise an event such as a music\nconcert, nightclub appearance, festival, or political rally\n\nLike postcards, pamphlets and small posters, flyers are a low-cost form of mass\nmarketing or communication. There are many different flyer formats. Some\nexamples are:\n\n* A4 (roughly letterhead size)\n* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)\n* DL (compliments slip size)\n* A6 (postcard size)\n\nFlyers are inexpensive to produce. Their widespread use intensified with the\nspread of desktop publishing systems. In recent years, the production of flyers\nthrough traditional printing services has been supplanted by Internet services;\ncustomers may send designs and receive final products by mail.\n\nBut flyers are not a new medium: prior to the War of American Independence some\ncolonists were outraged with the Stamp Act and gathered together in anti-stamp\nact congresses. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued\nhandbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other paraphernalia, to do so.\n\nToday, some jurisdictions have laws or ordinances banning or restricting\nleafleting or flyering, and owners of private property may put up signs saying\n\"Post No Bills\"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building\nsites or vacant lots.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Flyer_(pamphlet)","recorded":1362553610,"links":45,"instances":["economics","people","economics","activity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Advertising publications by format","Direct marketing"],"headings":["Distribution and use","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Without_breaking_stride%2C_homeward_bound_commuter_as_the_Staten_Island_Ferry_Terminal_reaches_for_leaflet_from_street..._-_NARA_-_549907.jpg/225px-Without_breaking_stride%2C_homeward_bound_commuter_as_the_Staten_Island_Ferry_Terminal_reaches_for_leaflet_from_street..._-_NARA_-_549907.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flyers_sobe_2.jpg/225px-Flyers_sobe_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Helmand_leaflets350.jpg/225px-Helmand_leaflets350.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Flyers_in_China_02.jpg/225px-Flyers_in_China_02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nightlife","activity"],["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["demonstration","people"]],"members":["good","demonstration","service","nightlife"],"related":["Miami","Nightlife_(activity)","Afghanistan","Hainan","People's_Republic_of_China","Paper","Advertisement","Business","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Restaurant","Nightclub","Evangelism","Political_campaign","Political_party","Airborne_leaflet_propaganda","Psychological_warfare","Concert","Nightclub","Festival","Demonstration_(people)","Postcard","Pamphlet","Poster","Mass_marketing","Communication","Letterhead","Compliments_slip","Postcard","Desktop_publishing","Internet","War_of_American_Independence","Local_ordinance","Street","Bulletin_boards","Bulletin_board","College_campus","Caf√©","Laundromat","San_Francisco,_California","Haight_Street","Telephone_pole","Edinburgh_Fringe","Royal_Mile","Canvassing","Folded_leaflet","Pamphlet","Street_marketing"]}
