Usually some amount of loss of honor or dignity is involved,\nbut how much and the type depends on the embarrassing situation. It is similar\nto shame, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.\nAlso, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act\nthat is merely socially unacceptable, rather than morally wrong.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"embarrassment","recorded":1372154587,"links":[],"instances":["social_concept","psychology","emotion","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Emotions","Bullying","Psychological abuse"],"headings":["Causes","Medical","Etymology","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["minimisation","psychology"],["prefix","linguistics"],["face","social_concept"],["guilt","emotion"]],"members":["face","minimisation","guilt","prefix"],"related":["Emotion","Honor","Dignity","Shame","Morality","Debagging","Flatulence","Nude","Gossip","Humiliation","Birthday","Blushing","Sweating","Anxiety","Stammer","Akathesia","Nervous_laughter","Anger","Humor","Space_Shuttle_Challenger","Hwang_Woo-Suk","Anger","Denial","Minimisation_(psychology)","Privacy","Knowledge","Skill","Criticism","Environment","Faux_pas","Accidents","Social_identity","Fetal_distress","Respiratory_failure","Samuel_Pepys","Michel_de_Montaigne","√Ålvaro_de_Luna","Portuguese_language","Prefix_(linguistics)","Iberian_Peninsula","Celtic_languages","Iberian_Romance_languages","Spanish_language","Vulgar_Latin","Bernardo_Davanzati","Blushing","Face_(social_concept)","Guilt_(emotion)","Humiliation","Modesty","Shame"]}
