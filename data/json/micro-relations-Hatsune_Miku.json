It uses Yamaha Corporation's Vocaloid 2 and Vocaloid 3\nsynthesizing technology. The name of the character comes from a fusion of the\nJapanese for , and future ( sounds like a nanori reading of future, , normally\nread as \"mirai\" ), referring to her position as the first of Crypton's\n\"Character Vocal Series\". She was the second Vocaloid to be sold using the\nVocaloid 2 engine and the first Japanese Vocaloid to use the Japanese version of\nthe Vocaloid 2 engine. Her voice is sampled from Japanese voice actress, Saki\nFujita. Hatsune Miku has performed at her concerts onstage as an animated\nprojection. Hatsune Miku is portrayed to be a 16-year-old girl with\nlong teal pigtails.\n","linknr":542,"url":"Hatsune_Miku","recorded":1362676119,"links":31,"instances":["company","probe","term"],"pdf":["http://www.crypton.co.jp/download/pdf/info_miku_e.pdf"],"categories":["2007 introductions","Fictional characters introduced in 2007","Fictional singers","Japanese idols","Japanese popular culture","Vocaloid"],"headings":["Development","Characteristics","Featured music","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Miku_hatsune_cover.jpg/200px-Miku_hatsune_cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Studie_GLAD_BMW_Z4_2008_Super_GT_qualifying.jpg/220px-Studie_GLAD_BMW_Z4_2008_Super_GT_qualifying.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/Hatsune_Miku_Software_Screenshot.png/220px-Hatsune_Miku_Software_Screenshot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Hatsune_Miku_Corolla.jpg/220px-Hatsune_Miku_Corolla.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chibi","term"],["akatsuki","probe"],["ordet","company"]],"members":["ordet","akatsuki","chibi"],"related":["Crypton_Future_Media","Microsoft_Windows","Proprietary_software","Persona","Crypton_Future_Media","Yamaha_Corporation","Vocaloid","Nanori","Software_engine","SeiyÅ«","Saki_Fujita","Voice_acting_in_Japan","Saki_Fujita","Humanoid_robot","HRP-4C","CEATEC","Super_GT","2008_Super_GT_season","Good_Smile_Company","Itasha","2008_Super_GT_season","Studie","2008_Super_GT_season","2009_Super_GT_season","BMW_E85","Nissan_350Z","FIA","2010_Super_GT_season","Porsche_911_GT3","Race_queen","Toyota_Corolla","Sapporo_Snow_Festival","Saki_Fujita","Google_Chrome","Cannes_Lions_International_Advertising_Festival","Amazon.com","Chibi_(term)","Turquoise","Nico_Nico_Douga","YouTube","Super-deformed","Loituma_Girl","Ievan_Polkka","2D_computer_graphics","3D_computer_graphics","United_States","Nevada","Black_Rock_Desert","Outer_space","Venus","Akatsuki_(probe)","Japan_Aerospace_Exploration_Agency","Japan_Standard_Time","Black_Rock_Shooter","Original_video_animation","Ordet_(company)","Anime","Noitamina","Original_video_animation","Cosplay","Sega","TinierMe","Nintendo_3DS","Nendoroid","Leek","M.U.G.E.N","Oricon","Livetune","Nyan_Cat","Cover_version","Asami_Shimoda","Animelo_Summer_Live","Saitama_Super_Arena","Anime_Festival_Asia","Singapore","Zepp","Odaiba","Tokyo","L.A._Live","Anime_Expo","Sound_Horizon"]}
