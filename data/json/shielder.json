It was ordered in 1995 and was first deployed in 1999.\n\nThe system consists of up to 40 dispensers, each containing 6 mines, mounted on\na flat bed version of the Alvis Stormer tracked armoured vehicle. The dispensers\ncan launch mines to the sides and rear of the vehicle as it proceeds. Each mine\nhas a programmable life, after which they self-destruct. A dispenser control\nunit provides fire signals, testing and arming of the self-destruct mechanism.\n\nTwenty-nine Shielder systems are currently deployed with the British Army.\n",
