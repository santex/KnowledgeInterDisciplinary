{"cursor":"4935","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church' (previously the 'Augustana Lutheran\nSynod' and also 'Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North\nAmerica' and 'Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America')\nwas a Lutheran church body in the United States that was one of the churches\nthat merged into the Lutheran Church in America in 1962. It had its roots among\nthe Swedish immigrants in the 19th century.\n\nThe 'Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America' was\nestablished in 1860. The organizing meeting was held at the Jefferson Prairie\nSettlement, near Clinton, Wisconsin from June 5â8. A group of Swedish Lutheran\npastors including Jonas Swensson, Lars Paul EsbjÃ¶rn, Tuve Hasselquist, Eric\nNorelius and Erland Carlsson pioneered development of the Augustana Synod.\n\n\"Augustana\" is the Latin translation of the city of Augsburg in Germany,\nbirthplace of one of Lutheranism's defining documents, the Augsburg Confession\nof Faith. Along with the Swedish members of the church were Norwegian and Danish\nmembers who left the church in 1870 to form two new church bodies the Conference\nof the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and the Norwegian\nAugustana Synod. Also in 1870 the synod was renamed the 'Swedish Evangelical\nLutheran Augustana Synod in North America'. In 1894 the name was change to\n'Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America'. In 1948, the name\n'Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church' was adopted.\n\nOriginally somewhat conservative, the church turned gradually more liberal after\nhistorical criticism had been introduced at its seminary. The Augustana\nTheological Seminary was located on the campus of Augustana College in Rock\nIsland, Illinois. It was later merged into the Lutheran School of Theology at\nChicago at the time of the formation of the Lutheran Church in America.\n\nThe Augustana Church was the direct parent to several liberal arts colleges in\nthe United States: Augustana College in Rock Island, IL; Gustavus Adolphus\nCollege in St. Peter, MN; Bethany College in Lindsborg, KS; California Lutheran\nUniversity in Thousand Oaks, CA; Midland Lutheran College in Fremont, NE; and\nUpsala College in East Orange, NJ. Augustana and Gustavus Adolphus consistently\nrank among the top 100 liberal arts colleges in the U.S., and the other\ninstitutions are recognized as strong regional colleges.\n\nWhile the Augustana Church only had about 500,000 members when the Lutheran\nChurch in America was formed, its influence on its successor bodies has been\nsignificant, incorporating many of Augustana's emphases on mission, ecumenism,\nand social service. Herbert W. Chilstrom, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in\nAmerica's first presiding bishop, is a graduate of the Augustana Theological\nSeminary and was ordained to Augustana's ministry in 1958. Included among the\nAugustana-founded congregations is Mount Olivet Lutheran Church in Minneapolis,\nMN the largest Lutheran congregation in the world with over 13,000 members.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Augustana_Synod","recorded":1375076093,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Synod&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Lutheranism","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_in_America","/wiki/Swedish_American","/wiki/Jefferson_Prairie_Settlement","/wiki/Clinton_(village),_Rock_County,_Wisconsin","/wiki/Jonas_Swensson","/wiki/Lars_Paul_Esbj%C3%B6rn","/wiki/Tuve_Hasselquist","/wiki/Eric_Norelius","/wiki/Erland_Carlsson","/wiki/Augsburg_Confession","/wiki/Norwegians","/wiki/Danish_people","/wiki/Conference_of_the_Norwegian-Danish_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_of_America","/wiki/Norwegian_Augustana_Synod","/wiki/Historical_criticism","/wiki/Lutheran_School_of_Theology_at_Chicago","/wiki/Augustana_College_(Illinois)","/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_College","/wiki/Bethany_College_(Kansas)","/wiki/California_Lutheran_University","/wiki/Midland_Lutheran_College","/wiki/Upsala_College","/wiki/Herbert_W._Chilstrom","/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tuve_Hasselquist","/wiki/Jonas_Swensson","/wiki/Eric_Norelius","/wiki/Erland_Carlsson","/wiki/Eric_Norelius","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit&section=2","http://books.google.com/books?id=xBQ5ZO7QITcC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit&section=3","http://www.augustanaheritage.org/","http://www.archive.org/details/thelutheransinam00wolfuoft","http://www.archive.org/details/augustanasynodbr00augu","http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/History/ELCA-Archives/ELCA-Family-Tree.aspx","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&oldid=564934818","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Swedish_migration_to_North_America","/wiki/Category:Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America_predecessor_churches","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_1860","/wiki/Category:Lutheranism_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Lutheran_denominations_established_in_the_19th_century","/wiki/Category:1860_establishments_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Augustana+Evangelical+Lutheran+Church&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Augustana+Evangelical+Lutheran+Church","/wiki/Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Talk:Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","#","/wiki/Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&oldid=564934818","/w/index.php?title=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4569330","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Augustana_Evangelical_Lutheran_Church&id=564934818","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Augustana+Evangelical+Lutheran+Church","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Augustana+Evangelical+Lutheran+Church&oldid=564934818&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Augustana
