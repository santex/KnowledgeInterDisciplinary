{"cursor":"8651","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Wallop, 1st Earl of Portsmouth' (15 April 1690 â 22 November 1762), known\nas 'John Wallop, 1st Viscount Lymington' from 1720 to 1743, was a British peer\nand Member of Parliament.\n\nWallop was the third son of John Wallop, of Farleigh Wallop and his wife Alicia,\ndaughter of William Borlase. The Wallops were an old and influential Hampshire\nfamily; his great-grandfather was the regicide Robert Wallop. His father died\nabout 1694, and he succeeded an elder brother, Bluett Wallop, in the family\nestates in 1707. Wallop was educated at Eton in 1708, in Geneva from 1708 to\n1709, and took his Grand Tour through Italy and Germany in 1710.\n\nIn 1715, Wallop was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for both Andover,\nwhere a family interest existed, and Hampshire, choosing to sit for the latter.\nIn 1717, he took the side of Stanhope and Sunderland over Walpole and Townshend\nand was rewarded with appointment as a junior Lord of the Treasury. He was re-\nelected without opposition at the ensuing by-election in Hampshire. However, he\nvoted against the Government on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and\nSchism Acts.\n\nOn 20 May 1716, Wallop had married Lady Bridget Bennet (d. 12 October 1738), the\ndaughter of Charles Bennet, 1st Earl of Tankerville. They had six sons and four\ndaughters: Debrett's Peerage Collins's Peerage *Hon. Bridget\nWallop (20 February 1717 â 26 June 1736) *John Wallop, Viscount Lymington\n(1718â1749) *Hon. Borlace Wallop (3 June 1720 â April 1741), ensign in the Royal\nRegiment of Foot Guards, aide-de-camp to General Wentworth, carried orders at\nthe attack on Fort Saint Lazarus and died of fever soon thereafter *Hon. Mary\nWallop (17 August 1721 â 13 April 1722) *Hon. Charles Wallop (1722â1771) *Hon.\nAnne Wallop (d. 3 March 1759), unmarried *Hon. Bluett Wallop (1726â1749) *Hon.\nElizabeth Wallop (d. June 1727) *Henry Wallop, died in infancy *Bennet Wallop,\ndied young\n\nWhen Sunderland fell in 1720 after the South Sea Bubble, Wallop was put out of\nthe Treasury. He was compensated with a peerage, being created 'Viscount\nLymington' and 'Baron Wallop' on 11 June 1720. In 1731, he suggested to Queen\nCaroline (through the medium of her favorite, Charlotte Clayton) that he should\nreplace the Duke of Bolton as the Government's electoral manager in Hampshire,\nbut nothing immediately came of this.\n\nOn 11 January 1732 (O.S.) he was appointed Justice in Eyre for the forests north\nof Trent. In 1733, when the Duke of Bolton broke with Walpole over the proposed\nExcise Bill, he was stripped of most of his offices; Lymington succeeded him as\nLord Lieutenant of Hampshire, Vice-Admiral of Hampshire, and Vice-Admiral of the\nIsle of Wight. In July 1734, the Duke of Montagu, who had succeeded Bolton as\nGovernor of the Isle of Wight, resigned that office and Lymington received it as\nwell, although he resigned office as Justice in Eyre that year. The disaffection of Bolton threatened the Whig interest in Hampshire.\nLymington worked in \"perfect harmony\" with Lord Harry Powlett, Bolton's brother\nand one of the Whig candidates, but Bolton's opposition to Anthony Chute, the\nother Whig, resulted in the defeat of Chute and the victory of one of the Tory\ncandidates, Edward Lisle. Bridget, Viscountess\nLymington, having died in 1738, Lymington remarried on 9 June 1741 to Elizabeth,\nwidow of Henry Grey and daughter of James Griffin, 2nd Baron Griffin of\nBraybrooke; they had no children.\n\nUpon Walpole's fall in 1742 (due in part to the failed siege of Cartagena, which\nhad claimed the life of Lymington's second son), the Duke of Bolton regained all\nof his prior offices in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, to Lymington's loss. As\nin 1720, Lymington was compensated with a peerage, and was created 'Earl of\nPortsmouth' on 11 October 1743. He regained the offices of Governor and Vice-\nAdmiral of the Isle of Wight in 1746, when Bolton supported the abortive\nministry of Bath and Granville and was deprived of those posts by the\nPelhams. Two of his sons died in 1749: Bluett, his youngest,\nin June, and John, Viscount Lymington in November. Upon his death in 1762, he\nwas succeeded by his grandson John Wallop, 2nd Earl of Portsmouth.\n","linknr":186,"url":"John_Wallop,_1st_Earl_of_Portsmouth","recorded":1375067175,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Wallop,_1st_Earl_of_Portsmouth&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Wallop,_1st_Earl_of_Portsmouth&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Farleigh_Wallop","/wiki/William_Borlase_(died_1665)","/wiki/Hampshire","/wiki/Robert_Wallop","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Geneva","/wiki/Grand_Tour","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/British_general_election,_1715","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Andover_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hampshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/James_Stanhope,_1st_Earl_Stanhope","/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_3rd_Earl_of_Sunderland","/wiki/Robert_Walpole","/wiki/Charles_Townshend,_2nd_Viscount_Townshend","/wiki/Lord_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/By-election","/wiki/Occasional_Conformity_Act_1711","/wiki/Schism_Act_1714","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/Charles_Bennet,_1st_Earl_of_Tankerville","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/John_Wallop,_Viscount_Lymington","/wiki/Ensign_(rank)","/wiki/Grenadier_Guards","/wiki/Aide-de-camp","/wiki/Thomas_Wentworth_(British_Army_officer)","/wiki/Battle_of_Cartagena_de_Indias#Attack_on_Fort_San_Lazaro","/wiki/Charles_Wallop","/wiki/Bluett_Wallop","/wiki/South_Sea_Bubble","/wiki/Caroline_of_Ansbach","/wiki/Charles_Powlett,_3rd_Duke_of_Bolton","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/Old_Style","/wiki/Justice_in_Eyre","/wiki/River_Trent","/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Hampshire","/wiki/Vice-Admiral_of_Hampshire","/wiki/Vice-Admiral_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/John_Montagu,_2nd_Duke_of_Montagu","/wiki/Governor_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/Harry_Powlett,_4th_Duke_of_Bolton","/wiki/Anthony_Chute","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Lisle&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-hampshire-4","/wiki/Henry_Grey_(MP)","/w/index.php?title=James_Griffin,_2nd_Baron_Griffin_of_Braybrooke&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/Battle_of_Cartagena_de_Indias","/wiki/Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/William_Pulteney,_1st_Earl_of_Bath","/wiki/John_Carteret,_2nd_Earl_Granville","#cite_note-hop-1","/wiki/Bluett_Wallop","/wiki/John_Wallop,_Viscount_Lymington","/wiki/John_Wallop,_2nd_Earl_of_Portsmouth","/w/index.php?title=John_Wallop,_1st_Earl_of_Portsmouth&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-hop_1-0","#cite_ref-hop_1-1","#cite_ref-hop_1-2","#cite_ref-hop_1-3","#cite_ref-hop_1-4","#cite_ref-hop_1-5","http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/wallop-john-1690-1762","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-hampshire_4-0","http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/constituencies/hampshire","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/William_Guidott","/w/index.php?title=Gilbert_Searle&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Andover_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Guidott","/wiki/William_Guidott","/w/index.php?title=James_Brudenell_(died_1746)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thomas_Lewis_(died_1736)","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Sturt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Hampshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=George_Pitt_(1663-1735)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=George_Pitt_(1663-1735)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lord_Nassau_Powlett","/wiki/Bennet_Sherard,_1st_Earl_of_Harborough","/wiki/Justice_in_Eyre","/wiki/Peregrine_Bertie,_2nd_Duke_of_Ancaster_and_Kesteven","/wiki/Charles_Powlett,_3rd_Duke_of_Bolton","/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Hampshire","/wiki/Charles_Powlett,_3rd_Duke_of_Bolton","/wiki/Vice-Admiral_of_Hampshire","/wiki/Vice-Admiral_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/John_Montagu,_2nd_Duke_of_Montagu","/wiki/Governor_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Charles_Powlett,_3rd_Duke_of_Bolton","/wiki/Governor_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Vice-Admiral_of_the_Isle_of_Wight","/wiki/Thomas_Holmes,_1st_Baron_Holmes","/wiki/Peerage_of_England","/wiki/Viscount_Lymington","/wiki/John_Wallop,_2nd_Earl_of_Portsmouth","/wiki/Earl_of_Portsmouth","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/63841560","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type
