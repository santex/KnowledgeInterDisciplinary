{"cursor":"1553","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In FM broadcasting, 'preemphasis improvement' is the improvement in the signal-to-\nnoise ratio of the high-frequency portion of the baseband, i.e., modulating,\nsignal, which improvement results from passing the modulating signal through a\npreemphasis network.\n\nPreemphasis increases the magnitude of the higher signal frequencies, thereby\nimproving the signal-to-noise ratio. At the output of the discriminator in the\nFM receiver, a deemphasis network restores the original signal power\ndistribution.\n\nFM improvement factor is the quotient obtained by dividing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) at the output of an FM receiver by the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)\nat the input of the receiver. When the FM improvement factor is greater than\nunity, the improvement in the SNR is always obtained at the expense of an\nincreased bandwidth in the receiver and the transmission path.\n\nFM improvement threshold is the point in an FM (frequency modulation) receiver\nat which the peaks in the RF signal equal the peaks of the thermal noise\ngenerated in the receiver. A baseband signal-to-noise ratio of about 30 dB is\ntypical at the improvement threshold, and this ratio improves 1 dB for each\ndecibel of increase in the signal above the threshold.\n","linknr":102,"url":"FM_improvement_threshold","recorded":1362551734,"links":14,"instances":["signal_processing","telecommunications","physics","telecommunication"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radio terminology"],"headings":["Source"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Radio_icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["transmission","telecommunications"],["signalling","telecommunication"]],"members":["bandwidth","transmission","power","signalling"],"related":["Signal-to-noise_ratio","Frequency","Baseband","Preemphasis_network","Output","Discriminator","Deemphasis","Power_(physics)","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Output","Frequency_modulation","Carrier-to-noise_ratio","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Transmission_(telecommunications)","Frequency_modulation","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Thermal_noise","Baseband","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Decibel"]}
