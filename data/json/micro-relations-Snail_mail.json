{"cursor":"5051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Snail mail' or 'smail' (from snail + mail) is a dysphemistic retronymânamed\nafter the snail with its slow speedâused to refer to letters and carried by\nconventional postal delivery services. The phrase refers to the lag-time between\ndispatch of a letter and its receipt, versus the virtually instantaneous\ndispatch and delivery of its electronic equivalent, e-mail.\n\nIt is also known, more neutrally, as 'paper mail', 'postal mail', 'land\nmail', or simply '[[mail]]' or 'post'. An earlier term of the same type\nis surface mail, coined retrospectively after the development of airmail.\nThis happened not too long ago, between the 1970s to 1990s. Cognitive\nEnglish grammar, by GÃ¼nter Radden, RenÃ© Dirven,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=lx7UAniLfJwC&pg=PA4&dq=surface%20mail\np. 4]\n\nSnail mail is also a term used in reference to penpalling. Snail mail penpals\nare those penpals that communicate with one another through the postal system,\nrather than on the internet which has become the more common medium.\n\nSome online groups also use paper mail through regular gift or craft hot topics.\nIn some countries, services are available to print and deliver emails to those\nunable to receive email, like people with no computers or internet access.\n\nSimilar terminology was used in the 1840s to contrast the already-operating\npostal mail with the new telegraph. The Philadelphia North American stated: \"The\nmarkets will no longer be dependent upon snail paced mails\".
