Typically, au pairs take on a\nshare of the family's responsibility for childcare as well as some housework,\nand receive a small monetary allowance for personal use. Au pair schemes are\nsubject to government restrictions which specify an age range usually from late\nteens to mid to late twenties. In Europe, where the concept originated, au pairs\nare only supposed to work part-time, and they often also study part-time,\ngenerally focusing on the language of the host country, but in the United\nStates, they are permitted to provide full-time childcare.\n",
