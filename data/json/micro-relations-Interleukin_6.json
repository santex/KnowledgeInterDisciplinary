{"cursor":"18745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Interleukin 6' (IL-6) is an interleukin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory\nand anti-inflammatory cytokine. In humans, it is encoded by the IL6 gene.\n\nIL-6 is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response, e.g.\nduring infection and after trauma, especially burns or other tissue damage\nleading to inflammation. IL-6 also plays a role in fighting infection, as IL-6\nhas been shown in mice to be required for resistance against bacterium\n[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]].\n\nIL-6 is also considered a \"myokine,\" a cytokine produced from muscle, and is\nelevated in response to muscle contraction. It is significantly\nelevated with exercise, and precedes the appearance of other cytokines in the\ncirculation. During exercise, it is thought to act in a hormone-like manner to\nmobilize extracellular substrates and/or augment substrate delivery.\n\nAdditionally, osteoblasts secrete IL-6 to stimulate osteoclast formation. Smooth\nmuscle cells in the tunica media of many blood vessels also produce IL-6 as a\npro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-6's role as an anti-inflammatory cytokine is\nmediated through its inhibitory effects on TNF-alpha and IL-1, and activation of\nIL-1ra and IL-10.\n","linknr":721,"url":"Interleukin_6","recorded":1362485051,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines","Osaka University research"],"headings":["Function","Receptor","Interactions","Role in disease","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/IL6_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png/250px-IL6_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/PBB_GE_IL6_205207_at.png/250px-PBB_GE_IL6_205207_at.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/PDB_1alu_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1alu_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/PDB_1il6_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1il6_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/PDB_1p9m_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1p9m_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/PDB_2il6_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_2il6_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Interleukin","Cytokine","Gene","T_cell","Macrophage","Osteoblast","Osteoclast","Smooth_muscle_cell","Tunica_media","Cytokine","TNF-alpha","IL1A","Interleukin_1_receptor_antagonist","Interleukin_10","Fever","Acute_phase_response","Blood_brain_barrier","Prostaglandin_E2","Hypothalamus","Macrophages","Pathogen","PAMP","Innate_immune_system","PRRs","Toll-like_receptor","Hybridoma","Briclone","Estrogen","Osteoporosis","Adipocytes","C-reactive_protein","Memory_consolidation","Neutrophils","B_cells","Type_I_cytokine_receptor","Cluster_of_differentiation","Gp130","Leukemia_inhibitory_factor","Ciliary_neurotropic_factor","Oncostatin_M","Interleukin_11","Cardiotrophin-1","Intracellular","Transcription_factors","Janus_kinase","STAT_protein","Interleukin_11","Interleukin_27","Ciliary_neurotrophic_factor","Cardiotrophin-1","CLCF1","Leukemia_inhibitory_factor","Oncostatin_M","Kaposi's_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus","KSHV-IL6","Protein-protein_interaction","Interleukin-6_receptor","Glycoprotein_130","Diabetes","Atherosclerosis","Major_depressive_disorder","Alzheimer's_Disease","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Multiple_myeloma","Prostate_cancer","Behcet's_disease","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Metastatic_cancer","Anti-IL-6","Tocilizumab","Rheumatoid_arthritis","ALD518"]}
