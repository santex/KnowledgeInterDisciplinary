{"cursor":"5103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'digital signal' is a physical signal that is a representation of a sequence\nof discrete values (a quantified discrete-time signal), for example of an\narbitrary bit stream, or of a digitized (sampled and analog-to-digital\nconverted) analog signal. The term digital signal can refer to either of the\nfollowing:\n# any continuous-time waveform signal used in digital communication,\n# representing a bit stream or other sequence of discrete values a pulse train\n# signal that switches between a discrete number of voltage levels or levels of\n# light intensity, also known as a line coded signal or baseband transmission,\n# for example a signal found in digital electronics or in serial communications,\n# or a pulse code modulation (PCM) representation of a digitized analog signal.\n\nA signal that is generated by means of a digital modulation method (digital\npassband transmission), to be transferred between modems, is in the first case\nconsidered as a digital signal, and in the second case as converted to an\nanalog signal.\n","linknr":596,"url":"Digital_signal","recorded":1362580106,"links":43,"instances":["electronics","signal_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digital signal processing"],"headings":["Waveforms in digital systems","Logic voltage levels","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/S_digital.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/Hobby_frequency_counter.jpg/220px-Hobby_frequency_counter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Biphase_Mark_Code.svg/240px-Biphase_Mark_Code.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electronics"],["sampling","signal_processing"]],"members":["signal","sampling"],"related":["Signal_(electronics)","Quantification","Discrete-time_signal","Bit_stream","Digitize","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Analog-to-digital_converter","Analog_signal","Digital_communication","Bit_stream","Discrete_mathematics","Pulse_train","Line_code","Baseband","Digital","Serial_communication","Pulse_code_modulation","Digital_modulation","Passband","Modem","Computer_architecture","Digital","Waveform","Boolean_logic","Clock_signal","Synchronization","Transition_time","Electric_potential","Electric_current","Schmitt_trigger","CMOS","IC_power_supply_pin","Transistor-transistor_logic","Emitter_coupled_logic","Digital_signal_processing","Nyquist–Shannon_sampling_theorem","Whittaker–Shannon_interpolation_formula","Intersymbol_interference_in_digital_communication"]}
