      "text" : "\n\n\nA 'perforation' is a small hole in a thin material or web. There is usually more\nthan one perforation in an organized fashion, where all of the holes are called\na perforation. The process of creating perforations is called 'perforating',\nwhich involves puncturing the workpiece with a tool.\n\nPerforations are usually used to allow easy separation of two sections of the\nmaterial, such as allowing paper to be torn easily along the line. Packaging\nwith perforations in paperboard or plastic film is easy for consumers to open.\nOther purposes include filtrating fluids, sound deadening, allowing light or\nfluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.<ref\nname=\"todd\"></ref>\n\nVarious applications include packaging films (to allow the contents to breathe),\nmedical films, micro perforated plate and sound and vapor barriers.\n",
