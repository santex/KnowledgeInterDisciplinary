Culinary use\n typically distinguishes herbs as referring to the leafy green parts of a plant\n (either fresh or dried), from a \"spice\", a product from another part of the\n plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits.\n\nIn American botanical English the term \"herb\" is also used as an abbreviation of\n\"herbaceous plant\". This usage is rarely found in British English.\n\nHerbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases\nspiritual usage. General usage of the term \"herb\" differs between culinary herbs\nand medicinal herbs. In medicinal or spiritual use any of the parts of the plant\nmight be considered \"herbs\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, resin,\nroot bark, inner bark (and cambium), berries and sometimes the pericarp or other\nportions of the plant.\n\nThe word \"herb\" is pronounced by many U.S. speakers, or by other U.S. speakers\nand all other English speakers.
