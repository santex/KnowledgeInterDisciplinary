{"cursor":"52276","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Paranormal' is a general term (coined ca. 1915â1920 ) that designates experiences that lie\noutside \"the range of normal experience or scientific explanation\" or that indicates phenomena understood to be outside of\nscience's current ability to explain or measure. Paranormal phenomena are distinct from\ncertain hypothetical entities, such as dark matter and dark energy, only insofar\nas paranormal phenomena are inconsistent with the world as already understood\nthrough empirical observation coupled with scientific methodology.\n\nThousands of stories relating to paranormal phenomena are found in popular\nculture, folklore, and the recollections of individual subjects.
