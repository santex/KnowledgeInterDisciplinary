Specifically,\na 'k-simplex' is a k-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its\nk&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vertices. More formally, suppose the k&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 points\n<math>u_0,\\dots, u_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</math> are affinely independent, which\nmeans <math> u_1 - u_0,\\dots, u_k-u_0 </math> are linearly independent. Then,\nthe simplex determined by them is the set of points <math> C =\\{\\theta_0 u_0 +\n\\dots+\\theta_k u_k | \\theta_i \\ge 0, 0 \\le i \\le k, \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\theta_i=1\\}\n</math>. For example, a 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron,\nand a 4-simplex is a 5-cell. A single point may be considered a 0-simplex, and a\nline segment may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the\nsmallest convex set containing the given vertices.\n\nA 'regular simplex'<ref> Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope</ref>\nis a simplex that is also a regular polytope. A regular n-simplex may be\nconstructed from a regular (n&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex\nto all original vertices by the common edge length.\n\nIn topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form\na simplicial complex. The associated combinatorial structure is called an\nabstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means\nany finite set of vertices.\n","title":"simplex","headings":["Elements","Symmetric graphs of regular simplices","The standard simplex","Cartesian coordinates for regular ''n''-dimensional simplex in R<sup>''n''</sup>","Geometric properties","Algebraic topology","Algebraic geometry","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Simplicial_complex","4: Polytope","3: Triangle","3: Tetrahedron","3: 5-cell","3: Hypercube","3: Simplicial_homology","3: Pythagorean_theorem","3: Volume","2: Line_segment","2: Regular_polytope","2: Topology","2: Combinatorics","2: Cross-polytope","2: Tesseract","2: Topological_space","2: Ternary_plot","2: Simplex_algorithm","1: Geometry","1: Dimension","1: Convex_hull","1: Convex_set","1: Abstract_simplicial_complex","1: Finite_set","1: Binomial_coefficient","1: Pascal's_triangle","1: Simplicial_complex#Definitions","1: Coxeter","1: Hypercubic_honeycomb","1: Triangle_number","1: Tetrahedron_number","1: Schläfli_symbol","1: Coxeter-Dynkin_diagram","1: Petrie_polygon","1: 5-simplex","1: 6-simplex","1: 7-simplex","1: 8-simplex","1: 9-simplex","1: 10-simplex","1: 11-simplex","1: 12-simplex","1: 13-simplex","1: 14-simplex","1: 15-simplex","1: 16-simplex","1: 17-simplex","1: 18-simplex","1: 19-simplex","1: 20-simplex","1: Affine_hyperplane","1: Affine_transformation","1: Generalized_barycentric_coordinates","1: Indefinite_sum","1: Fundamental_domain","1: Probability_theory","1: Graphical_projection","1: Selection_algorithm","1: Simplex_method","1: Unit_vector","1: Dot_product","1: Determinant","1: Parallelepiped","1: Dihedral_angle","1: De_Gua's_theorem","1: Hasse_diagram","1: Vertex_figure","1: Orthoplex","1: Topologically_equivalent","1: Manifold_with_corners","1: Categorical_distribution","1: Algebraic_topology","1: Open_subset","1: Manifold","1: Simplicial_object","1: K-Theory","1: Chow_groups","1: Applied_statistics#industrial","1: Mixture","1: Response_surface_methodology","1: Nonlinear_programming","1: Sequential_quadratic_programming","1: Operations_research","1: Linear_programming","1: George_Dantzig","1: Geometric_design","1: Computer_graphics","1: Triangulation#simplicial","1: Interpolation","1: Polynomial_and_rational_function_modeling","1: Causal_dynamical_triangulation","1: Distance_geometry","1: Delaunay_triangulation","1: Hill_tetrahedron","1: Metcalfe's_Law","1: List_of_regular_polytopes","1: Schläfli_orthoscheme","1: Simplicial_set","1: 3-sphere","1: Walter_Rudin","1: Andrew_S._Tanenbaum","1: H.S.M._Coxeter","1: Stephen_Boyd","1: Lieven_Vandenberghe"]}
