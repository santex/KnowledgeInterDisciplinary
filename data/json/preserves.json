The preparation of fruit preserves today often\ninvolves adding commercial or natural pectin as a gelling agent, although sugar\nor honey may be used, as well. Before World War II, fruit preserve recipes did\nnot include pectin, and many artisan jams today are made without pectin. The\ningredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves;\njams, jellies and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit\npreserves that vary based upon the ingredients used.\n\nMany varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit\npreserves, such as strawberry, as well as savoury preserves of culinary\nvegetables, such as tomatoes or squash. In American English, the plural form\n\"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies. In British and\nCommonwealth English most fruit preserves are simply called jam, with the\nsingular preserve being applied to high fruit content jam, often for marketing\npurposes. Additionally, the name of the type of fruit preserves will also vary\ndepending on the regional variant of English being used.\n","title":"Fruit%20preserves","headings":["Variations","Regional terminology","Production","Packaging","Legal definitions","Jelly worldwide","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Pectin","4: Sugar","2: Fruit","2: Vegetable","2: Honey","1: Strawberry","1: Canning","1: Gelling_agent","1: List_of_culinary_vegetables","1: Commonwealth_English","1: Ribes","1: Plum","1: Raspberry","1: Egg_whites","1: British_English","1: Citrus","1: Bergamot_orange","1: Bitter_orange","1: Fruit_preserves#Jam","1: Acid","1: Trial_and_error","1: Boiling","1: Tamper_evident","1: Jar","1: United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","1: European_Union","1: Cucumber","1: Rhubarb","1: Sweet_potato","1: Almond_jelly","1: Coffee_jelly","1: Cranberry_sauce","1: Grass_jelly","1: Konjac","1: Mayhaw","1: U.S._South","1: Korea","1: Philippines","1: Lekvar","1: Peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich","1: Spoon_sweets"]}
