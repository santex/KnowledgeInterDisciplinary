National Center for\nEducational Statistics. 31 March 2008.\nhttp://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/glossary/s.asp\n\nSocioeconomic status is typically broken into three categories, high SES, middle\nSES, and low SES to describe the three areas a family or an individual may fall\ninto. When placing a family or individual into one of these categories any or\nall of the three variables (income, education, and occupation) can be assessed.\nAdditionally, low income and little education have shown to be strong predictors\nof a range of physical and mental health problems, ranging from respiratory\nviruses, arthritis, coronary disease, and schizophrenia. These may be due to\nenvironmental conditions in their workplace, or in the case of mental illnesses,\nmay be the entire cause of that persons social predicament to begin\nwith.
