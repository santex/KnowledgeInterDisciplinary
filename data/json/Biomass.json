[http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&_da-\nd=portal&_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center]. Biomassenergycentre.org.uk.\nRetrieved on 2012-02-28. As a renewable energy source, biomass can either\nbe used directly, or indirectlyâonce or converted into another type of energy\nproduct such as biofuel. Biomass can be converted to energy in three ways:\nthermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion.\n\nHistorically, humans have harnessed biomass derived energy products since the\ntime when people began burning wood to make fire.

In the first sense, biomass is plant matter used either to\ngenerate electricity (via steam turbines or gasifiers), or to produce heat (via\ndirect combustion). Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today; examples include forest residues (such as dead trees,\nbranches and tree stumps), yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid\nwaste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be\nconverted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels.\nIndustrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including\nmiscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane,\nbamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil\npalm (palm oil).\n\nThe adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process.\nOver the past decade, the production of these plants has increased 14%. In the United States, alternative electricity-production\nsources on the whole generate about 13% of power; of this fraction, biomass\ncontributes approximately 11% of the alternative\nproduction.

According to a study conducted in early 2012, of the 107 operating\nbiomass plants in the United States, 85 have been cited by federal or state\nregulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past\n5 years. This data also includes minor infractions.\n\nBiomass-derived energy also holds the promise of reducing carbon dioxide\nemissions, a significant contributor to global warming, as carbon dioxide acts\nas a âgreenhouseâ gas by trapping heat absorbed by the earth from the sun.\nAlthough the burning of biomass energy releases as much carbon dioxide as fossil\nfuels, biomass burning does not release ânew carbonâ into the atmosphere while\nburning fossil fuels does. [http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_biomass.html] Retrieved on 2012-06-\n2012. This is because carbon dioxide released from fossil fuels was carbon\nthat was fixated via photosynthesis millions of years ago that had been locked\nin the hydrocarbons of fossil fuels.\n\nIndustry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plantâs ability\nto comply with emissions standards. Some of these challenges, unique to biomass\nplants, include inconsistent fuel supplies and age. The type and amount of the\nfuel supply is completely reliant factors; the fuel can be in the form of\nbuilding debris or agricultural waste (such as deforestation of invasive species\nor orchard trimmings). Furthermore, many of the biomass plants are old, use\noutdated technology and were not built to comply with todayâs stringent\nstandards. In fact, many are based on technologies developed during the term of\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who created the Department of Energy in 1977.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration projected that by 2017, biomass is\nexpected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas, slightly more expensive\nthan nuclear power, and much less expensive than solar panels. In\nanother EIA study released, concerning the governmentâs plan to implement a 25%\nrenewable energy standard by 2025, the agency assumed that 598 million tons of\nbiomass would be available, accounting for 12% of the renewable energy in the\nplan.
