He is one of\nseven men, and one of four in the Open Era, to capture the career Grand Slam,\nand one of three (with Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal) to do so separately on\nclay, grass, and hard courts. Federer also shares the Open Era record for most\ntitles at the Australian Open with Agassi and Novak Djokovic (4), at Wimbledon\nwith Pete Sampras (7) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (5).\nFederer's ATP tournament records include winning six ATP World Tour Finals,\nplaying in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared\nwith Djokovic), and having won the most prize money of any other player in\nhistory, with over $75,000,000.\n\nFederer has appeared in 24 men's Grand Slam finals, with ten in a row, both\nrecords, and appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships\nthrough to the 2010 Australian Open.
