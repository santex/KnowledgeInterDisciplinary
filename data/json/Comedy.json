This\nsense of the term must be carefully distinguished from its academic one, namely\nthe comic theatre, whose Western origins are found in Ancient Greece. In the\nAthenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political\nsatire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. Henderson, J. (1993)\nComic Hero versus Political Elite pp.307-19 in  The theatrical genre can\nbe simply described as a dramatic performance which pits two societies against\neach other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye famously depicted these\ntwo opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the\nOld\", (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957) but this dichotomy is seldom\ndescribed as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes\nthe essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth\nand the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle,\nthe youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and\nis left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very\ndramatic irony which provokes laughter. (Marteinson, 2006)\n\nSatire and political satire use ironic comedy to portray persons or social\ninstitutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the\nobject of humor. Satire is a type of comedy. Parody subverts popular genres and\nforms, using certain ironic changes to critique those forms from within (though\nnot necessarily in a condemning way). Screwball comedy derives its humor largely\nfrom bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. Black comedy\nis defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in\nhuman nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create\ncomedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. A comedy of\nmanners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually\nupper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and\nmannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts\nburgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are\nfalling in love.\n","linknr":816,"url":"Comedy","recorded":1362373359,"links":122,"instances":["tv_network","arts","aristotle","usa","norm","tv_channel","poet","muse","entertainment","tv_channel","drama","spain"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Comedy|"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Studies
