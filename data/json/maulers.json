      "text" : "\n\n\n'The Maulers' are a fictional rock and roll band created in the early 1980s by\nseveral friends in Quincy, Illinois. The characters are Peter Thruster, lead\nvocals, brothers Eddie and Alex Vas Deferenz, lead guitars/vocals, Bitch Pastey,\nrhythm guitar/vocals, Slats Magnum, bass/vocals and Jim Smith, drums. The band's\nmanager is Col. Deryk St. Derrick who holds a 50-year, unbreakable contract in\nwhich he agrees to manage the band and have complete control of their lives for\n80% of their profits.\n\nThe purpose of creating the band was to enter an Air Band Contest at a local\ncollege. The band won the contest and was invited back for several subsequent\nvisits until it was discovered that only one member of six was actually taking\nclasses, and he was only taking a half credit class. The Maulers were told they\ncould not continue competing since they consistently won, but, would be allowed\nto perform as an exhibition act. Over the next few years, the Maulers performed\nin other local airband contests, dazzling audiences with their ability to look\nlike a real rock band, complete with elaborate pyrotechnics and a motorcycle or\nscooter driven onstage during the song, Bad Motor Scooter by Montrose. With the\nend of the 1980s came the decline of the Maulers until, in 1997, a friend\nsuggested a party in his backyard with real bands and having the Maulers as a\nheadline act. The gathering would be named Maulerpalooza, and on November 1,\n1997, the Maulers performed once again with the storyline that their citizenship\nhad been revoked due to an affair between lead singer Thruster and the wife of\nthe head of corporate telecommunications giant, MCI. They had been playing in\nsoutheast Asian brothels for the last 10 years and were now sneaking back into\nthe country to perform for a few of their loyal fans before their infamous\n1980–1999 World Carnage Tour ended.\n\nThe performance was a success and the band played once again in the summer of\n1998 at a daylong festival, Maulerstock in sweltering heat to over 500 fans\ngathered in the backyard.\n\nLater that fall came Mauloween with equal success. All the latter day Mauler\nshows also included a multimedia presentation with a band history and storyline\nprojected on a large video screen near the stage. Local TV anchors were enlisted\nto appear, along with the Mayor of the city explaining how the Maulers were a\nlocal treasure and they had plans to erect a monument in the city square as a\nshrine. It also explained the absence of Eddie Vas Deferenz, who after years of\ntouring got a couple days off and decided to take a 3-hour boat tour with\ngirlfriend and rising starlet, Ginger Grant.\n\nIn the summer of 1999 came the Maullenium show which was attended by over 1,000\npeople. ATV shuttles were employed as mini shuttle busses and the pyro show grew\nto extreme proportions with over 2,000 effects being shot in a 20-minute\nperformance.\n\nThe following summer came Lloyd's Monsters of Rock, named after the owner of the\nproperty. Again, nearly 1000 people attended, along with several law enforcement\nofficers at the conclusion. The owners of the property decided that perhaps it\nwas time to seek another venue.\n\nThe Maulers live on in cyberspace at [http://www.maulers.com www.maulers.com]\nwhere you can see photos of the band performing, get an insiders look at their\nproduction company, Penisaurus Worldwide Productions, and even get advice from\nlead singer Peter Thruster in his, \"Ask Pete\" advice column.\n\nThe Maulers have now performed in several venues over the following years. 2005\nwas a Halloween show at Quincy's South Side Boat Club & October 30, 2010 was a\nshow in Camp Point, IL at the wedding of Randy Phillips & Marcy Inman\nimmediately following the ceremony. This performance consisted of a single song,\n\"Hair of the Dog\" by Guns 'n' Roses.\n\nOn July 6, 2013, a show is planned at the same location, but with a full set\nlist.\n",
