{"cursor":"1295","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn geometry, a 'circumscribed sphere' of a polyhedron is a sphere that contains\nthe polyhedron and touches each of the polyhedron's vertices. The word\n'circumsphere' is sometimes used to mean the same thing. When it exists, a\ncircumscribed sphere need not be the smallest sphere containing the polyhedron;\nfor instance, the tetrahedron formed by a vertex of a cube and its three\nneighbors has the same circumsphere as the cube itself, but can be contained\nwithin a smaller sphere having the three neighboring vertices on its equator.\n\nAll regular polyhedra have circumscribed spheres, but most irregular polyhedra\ndo not have one, since in general not all vertices lie on a common sphere. It is\npossible to define the smallest containing sphere for such shapes.\n\nThe radius of sphere circumscribed around a polyhedron P is called the\n'circumradius' of P.\n\nThe circumscribed sphere is the three-dimensional analogue of the\ncircumscribed circle.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Circumscribed_sphere","recorded":1362689181,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary geometry","Spheres"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg/30px-POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Geometry","Polyhedron","Sphere","Cube","Regular_polyhedra","Circumscribed_circle","Midsphere","Inscribed_sphere","Bounding_sphere"]}
