      "text" : "\n, 1908.]] 'Shinny' (also 'shinney') is an informal type of hockey played on ice.\nIt is also used as another term for street hockey. There are no formal rules or\nspecific positions, and generally, there are no goaltenders. The goal areas at\neach end may be marked by nets, or simply by objects, such as blocks of snow,\nstones, etc. Bodychecking and lifting or \"roofing/reefing/raising the puck\"\n(shooting the puck or ball so it rises above the ice) are often forbidden\nbecause the players are not wearing protective equipment. It may also be called\n'pick-up hockey', pond hockey, or \"outdoor puck\". Shinny is a game that all\nlevels of hockey enthusiasts can play because it requires no rink, requires no\nskills except ability to hold a stick and at the very least to try to touch the\npuck or ball when it goes by. Shinny may be completely non-competitive and\nrecreational - scoring irrelevant - or competitive and scores kept.\n\nIn his book Country on Ice, Doug Beardsley states that most Canadian hockey\nplayers have played some form of shinny in their youth.<ref\nname=beardsley></ref>\n",
