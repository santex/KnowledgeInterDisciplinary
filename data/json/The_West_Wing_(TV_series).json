The series is set in the West Wing of the\nWhite House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff are\nlocated, during the fictional Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet\n(played by Martin Sheen).\n\nThe West Wing was produced by Warner Bros. Television. For the first four\nseasons, there were three executive producers: Aaron Sorkin (lead writer of\nalmost all of the first four seasons), Thomas Schlamme, and John Wells. After\nSorkin left the program, John Wells became the sole executive producer.\n\nIt first aired on NBC in 1999 and has been broadcast by many networks in several\nother countries. The series ended its seven-year run on May 14, 2006.\n\nThe show received positive reviews from critics, political science professors,\nand former White House staffers. In total, The West Wing won three Golden Globe\nAwards and 26 Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series,\nwhich it won four consecutive times from 2000 through 2003. The show's ratings\nwaned in later years following the departure of series creator Sorkin (who wrote\nor co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes) after the fourth season, yet it\nremained popular among high-income viewers, a key demographic for the show and\nits advertisers, with around 16 million viewers. In 2013 [[TV\nGuide]] ranked it #7 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All\nTime. Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas\nof All Time\".
