However, it is able to provide true 3D information. This information is\ntypically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be\nfreely reformatted or manipulated as required.\n\nThe basic technique requires delivery of a gamma-emitting radioisotope (called\nradionuclide) into the patient, normally through injection into the bloodstream.\nOn occasion, the radioisotope is a simple soluble dissolved ion, such as a\nradioisotope of gallium(III), which happens to also have chemical properties\nthat allow it to be concentrated in ways of medical interest for disease\ndetection. However, most of the time in SPECT, a marker radioisotope, which is\nof interest only for its radioactive properties, has been attached to a specific\nligand to create a radioligand, which is of interest for its chemical binding\nproperties to certain types of tissues. This marriage allows the combination of\nligand and radioisotope (the radiopharmaceutical) to be carried and bound to a\nplace of interest in the body, which then (due to the gamma-emission of the\nisotope) allows the ligand concentration to be seen by a gamma-camera.\n","linknr":536,"url":"SPECT","recorded":1362507563,"links":32,"instances":["tests","medical_imaging","observational","tests","99mtc_exametazime"],"pdf":[],"categories":["3d nuclear medical imaging","Radiobiology","Neuroimaging","Medical physics"],"headings":["Principles","Application","Reconstruction","Typical SPECT acquisition protocols","SPECT/CT","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/SPECT_Slice_of_Brain_using_Tc-99m_Ceretec.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/TEMP-Siemens.jpg/220px-TEMP-Siemens.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/SPECT_CT.JPG/220px-SPECT_CT.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Coded_aperture_mask_%28for_gamma_camera%29.jpg/220px-Coded_aperture_mask_%28for_gamma_camera%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gated_acquisition","medical_imaging"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["technetium","99mtc_exametazime"],["artifact","observational"],["isas","ictal-interictal_spect_analysis_by_spm"]],"members":["sensitivity","isas","gated_acquisition","artifact","specificity","technetium"],"related":["Technetium_exametazime","Nuclear_medicine","Tomography","Gamma_rays","Gamma_camera","Radioisotope","Radionuclide","Radioligand","Radiopharmaceutical","Radiograph","Gamma_camera","Radionuclide","Graphical_projection","Tomographic_reconstruction","MRI","Computed_tomography","Positron_emission_tomography","Radiopharmaceuticals","Gated_acquisition_(medical_imaging)","MUGA_scan","EKG","Left_ventricular_ejection_fraction","Leukocyte","Bone_scintigraphy","Ischemic_heart_disease","Myocardium","Cardiac_stress_test","Tetrofosmin","Adenosine","Dobutamine","Dipyridamole","Aminophylline","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Technetium_(99mTc)_exametazime","Technetium-99m","Nuclear_isomer","Cerebral_blood_flow","Dementia","Cognitive_test","Fludeoxyglucose","Positron_emission_tomography","Technetium-99m_generator","Cyclotron","Fluorine-18","Gamma_camera","Artifact_(observational)","Filtered_back_projection","Iterative_reconstruction","Computed_tomography","Image_registration","Radioisotope","Half-life","Radioactive_tracer","Becquerel","Technetium-99m","Sestamibi","Sestamibi_parathyroid_scan","Sestamibi","HMPAO","Iodine-123","Iodine-131","MIBG","Indium-111","Sestamibi_parathyroid_scan","Gamma_camera","Neuroimaging","Functional_neuroimaging","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Positron_emission_tomography","ISAS_(Ictal-Interictal_SPECT_Analysis_by_SPM)"]}
