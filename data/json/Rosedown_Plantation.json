Most of the 19th century cotton barons of\nall nationalities had requested and received their plantations through the\nSpanish government, the titles to which remained valid after the establishment\nof the United States government. The parents of Daniel and Martha (Barrow)\nTurnbull, the original owners of Rosedown, achieved high social status in West\nFeliciana through their immense cotton operations, and Daniel Turnbull himself\nwas known before the Civil War as one of the richest men in the nation.\n\n\n\nRosedown, named for a play that the Turnbulls saw on their honeymoon, was not\nassembled by Spanish Land Grant, but in a group of seven purchases made by\nDaniel Turnbull from the 1820s through the 1840s. At its largest, Rosedown\ncomprised approximately 3,455 acres, mostly planted in cotton. Daniel and Martha\nbegan construction on the main house at Rosedown in 1834, completing it by May\nthe following year for a total cost of $13,109.20. The Federal-Greek\nrevivalâstyle main house (ca. 1835), complete with Grecian-style wings (ca.\n1845), is at the head of a oak . The home was furnished with imported goods from\nPhiladelphia, New Orleans, and Europe. Most of the furnishings remained with the\nhouse during the years after the American Civil War. A large percentage of\noriginal pieces are still displayed at Rosedown. Near the main house are several\ndependencies, most notably three latticed summerhouses and a Greek temple-style\ndoctor's office.\n\nThe gardens were the province of Martha Turnbull throughout her life. On a\nEuropean Grand Tour the Turnbulls visited the great formal gardens of France,\nItaly, and England. the influence of which can be seen in Martha's activities at\nRosedown. The gardens were actually begun prior to the construction of the\nhouse, however, as early as 1836, there are records showing the purchase of\ncamellias, azaleas, and other plants from William Prince & Sons in New York. The\ngardens were slowly extended from the house over many years to cover\napproximately . Mrs. Turnbull kept a detailed garden diary during her sixty-year\ntenure at Rosedown. In the 19th century, Rosedown was one of the few privately\nmaintained formal gardens in the United States.\n\nThe contribution of slave labor to the construction and upkeep of the\nplantation, as well as agricultural prosperity and wealth accrued by Daniel\nTurnbull, was immense. During peak years of cotton production, as many as 450\nslaves worked at Rosedown. The couple had three children, William, Sarah and\nJames Daniel. James Daniel died of yellow fever in 1843, at the age of 7.\nWilliam married Caroline Butler, and had two children, William and Daniel.\nWilliam drowned in a boating accident crossing \"Old River\" in 1856 at the age of\n27. That left their daughter Sarah. She married James Bowman from the nearby\nOakley Plantation. They moved into Rosedown and had ten children, eight girls\nand two boys. Martha and Daniel retired to a wing in the back of the house in\n1859 to accommodate Sarah and James' growing family.\n\nAfter Daniel's death in 1861, the family saw a steady decline in a way of life\nthat could no longer be supported. Rosedown and two other Turnbull plantations\nwere ravaged during the war both by the invasion of Northern Troops and by the\nloss of the slave labor workforce. The Turnbull/Bowman family stayed at Rosedown\nthroughout the war, protecting and farming the property as best they could with\n250 sharecroppers.\n\nMartha Turnbull died in September, 1896, leaving Sarah in sole possession of\nRosedown. After Sarah's death in 1914, Sarah's four unmarried daughters (Corrie,\nIsabel, Sarah and Nina) took over the plantation. In the 1930s they decided to\nopen the house to tourists interested in the remnants of the prosperous cotton\nculture. The sisters made extraordinary sacrifices to hold Rosedown, and when\nMiss Nina, the last surviving sister, died in 1955, there were no bills or\nmortgages outstanding on the property and they still had 3,000 acres of land,\nthe 28 acres of gardens, the house and all its furnishings. The family was\nEpiscopalian and are interred at the Grace Church Cemetery in St.\nFrancisville.\n\nAfter Miss Nina's death, Rosedown passed to her nieces and nephews, who decided\nto sell the old plantation. In 1956, Catherine Fondren Underwood, herself an\nenthusiastic amateur horticulturalist, purchased it and began an eight-year, ten\nmillion dollar, restoration of the house and formal gardens. The Underwoods\nreturned Rosedown to function as a working cattle farm, and restored the old\nhome to its former grandeur. They opened the house for tours in 1964.\n\nCurrently, the Office of State Parks preserves the main house, historic gardens,\n12 historic outbuildings and 311 remaining acres of Rosedown Plantation as a\nstate historic site. State Park staff and volunteers conduct tours and programs\nto illustrate plantation life in the 1800s.\n\nRosedown Plantation was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2005. |date=March, 2001 |author=Donna Fricker, Patty Henry, and Erika\nMartin Seibert |publisher=National Park Service|postscript= }}\n\nOther state sites in the area include Audubon SHS, which features the Barrow\nfamily's Oakley Plantation home; Centenary SHS which looks to Louisiana's early\nhigher education initiatives; Locus Grove Cemetery, which is the last resting\nplace of Sarah Knox Taylor, Zachary Taylor's first wife; and Port Hudson SHS,\nsite of the longest siege in American military history.\n\nRosedown is located at 12501 La. Hwy. 10 in West Feliciana Parish. It is open\n9:00 am to 5:00 p.m. daily; closed Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New\nYear's Day. Guided tours of the main house are provided on the hour from 10:00\nam to 4:00 pm. There is an admission
