{"cursor":"30727","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Being' is an extremely broad concept encompassing subjective and objective\nfeatures of reality and existence. Anything that partakes in being is also\ncalled a \"being\", though often this use is limited to entities that have\nsubjectivity (as in the expression \"human being\"). So broad a notion has\ninevitably been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy,\nbeginning in western philosophy with attempts among the pre-Socratics to deploy\nit intelligibly.\n\nAs an example of efforts in recent times, Heidegger (who himself drew on ancient\nGreek sources) adopted German terms like [[Dasein]] to articulate the topic. Heidegger, [[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]], p. 27: \"this\nentity which each of us is himself ... we shall denote by the term\n'Dasein'.\" Several modern approaches build on such continental European\nexemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of\nhuman psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the\nExistentialist tradition).\n\nBy contrast, in mainstream Analytical philosophy the topic is more confined to\nabstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as W. V. O.\nQuine, to name one of many. One most fundamental question that continues to\nexercise philosophers is put by William James:  \"How comes the world\nto be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its\nplace? ... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge.\"\n\n","linknr":804,"url":"beings","recorded":1362582414,"links":57,"instances":["philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","aristotle","logic","linguistics","aristotelian","philosophy","european_history","philosophy","philosophy","disambiguation","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in metaphysics","Ontology","Philosophy of life"],"headings":["The substantial being","The transcendental being","Being in Islamic philosophy","Being in the Age of Reason","Being in continental philosophy and existentialism","Gilson's theory of animate versus indeterminate","Quotations","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png/180px-Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/10px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Being_Parmenides.png/220px-Being_Parmenides.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["objectivity","philosophy"],["categories","aristotle"],["tautology","logic"],["becoming","philosophy"],["property","philosophy"],["absolutism","european_history"],["hylomorphism","aristotelian"],["matter","philosophy"],["accident","philosophy"],["atman","disambiguation"],["becoming","philosophy"],["copula","linguistics"],["hypostasis","philosophy"],["object","philosophy"]],"members":["object","accident","objectivity","categories","tautology","copula","hylomorphism","hypostasis","absolutism","matter","becoming","atman","property"],"related":["Subjectivity","Objectivity_(philosophy)","Reality","Existence","Human_being","Pre-Socratics","Martin_Heidegger","Existentialism","Analytical_philosophy","W._V._O._Quine","William_James","Pre-Socratic_philosophy","Categories_(Aristotle)","Ousia","Definition","Differentia","Tautology_(logic)","Substance_theory","A_priori_and_a_posteriori","Parmenides","Becoming_(philosophy)","Heraclitus","Aristotle","Potentiality_and_actuality","Saint","Doctor_of_the_Church","Thomism","Empedocles","Predicables","Property_(philosophy)","Univocity","Transcendentals","Islamic_philosophy","Ibn_Sina","Suhrawardi_Maqtul","Mulla_Sadra","Medieval","Renaissance","Rationalist","Reason","Doubt","Empiricism","Scientific_method","Experiment","Revolution","Absolutism_(European_history)","Established_religion","Faith","Immanuel_Kant","Nietzsche","Hegel","Ideology","Existentialism","Phenomenalism","Jesuit_order","Rationalism","Empiricism","Age_of_reason","Thomas_Hobbes","Charles_II_of_England","English_civil_war","Manifesto","Epistemology","Metaphysics","Hylomorphism_(Aristotelian)","Paradox","Matter_(philosophy)","Substantial_form","Accident_(philosophy)","Great_chain_of_being","Materialism","Aegis","Idealism","Matter","Mind","Kant","Hegel","Continental_philosophy","Analytical_philosophy","Nothing","Existentialism","Existentialism","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Continental_philosophy","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Martin_Heidegger","Being_in_itself","Present-at-hand","Ready-to-hand","Experience","Martin_Heidegger","World","Innate_language","Information","Académie_française","Étienne_Gilson","Parmenides","Leucippus","Plato","Aristotle","Augustine","Plotinus","Aquinas","Descartes","Spinoza","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Hegel","Heidegger","Sartre","Carl_Jung","Karl_Marx","Atman_(disambiguation)","Becoming_(philosophy)","Category_of_being","Cogito_ergo_sum","Copula_(linguistics)","Entity","Essence","Existence","Existentialism","Human_being","Hypostasis_(philosophy)","Infosphere","Noumenon","Object_(philosophy)","Ontology","Organism","Ousia","Phenomenon","Physical_ontology","Substance_theory","Supreme_being","Erich_Fromm","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Martin_Heidegger","Immanuel_Kant","Jean-Paul_Sartre"]}
