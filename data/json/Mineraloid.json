{"cursor":"1917","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'mineraloid' is a mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate\ncrystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the\ngenerally accepted ranges for specific minerals. For example, obsidian is an\namorphous glass and not a crystal. Jet is derived from decaying wood under\nextreme pressure. Opal is another mineraloid because of its non-crystal nature.\nPearl, considered by some to be a mineral because of the presence of calcium\ncarbonate crystals within its structure, would be better considered a mineraloid\nbecause the crystals are bonded by an organic material, and there is no definite\nproportion of the components.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Mineraloid","recorded":1362579284,"links":24,"instances":["element","lignite"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mineralogy"],"headings":["Common mineraloids","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Topaze_Br%C3%A9sil2.jpg/40px-Topaze_Br%C3%A9sil2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["jet","lignite"],["jet","lignite"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","jet"],"related":["Mineral","Crystallinity","Obsidian","Amorphous","Glass","Crystal","Jet_(lignite)","Opal","Pearl","Amber","Jet_(lignite)","Mercury_(element)","International_Mineralogical_Association","Lechatelierite","Limonite","Lapis_Lazuli","Obsidian","Opal","Silicon_dioxide","Pearl","Petroleum","Ebonite","Vulcanization","Tektites","List_of_minerals","Nonmineral"]}
