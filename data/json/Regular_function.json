In mathematics, a\n'regular function' is a function that is analytic in a given\nregion. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularFunction.html Wolfram\nMathworld: Regular Function] In complex analysis, a complex regular\nfunction on a fixed domain is known as a holomorphic function.\n\nIn algebraic geometry the term has a more specific definition. It means an everywhere-\ndefined polynomial function on an algebraic variety V with values in the field K\nover which V is defined.\n\nFor example, if V is the affine line over K, the regular functions on V make up\na commutative ring, under pointwise multiplication of functions, isomorphic with\nthe polynomial ring in one variable over K. In other words, the regular\nfunctions are just polynomials in some natural parameter on the affine line.\n\nMore generally, for any affine variety V, the regular functions make up the\ncoordinate ring of V, often written K[V]. This can be expressed in other ways. A\nregular function is the same as a morphism to the affine line, or in the\nlanguage of scheme theory a global section of the structure sheaf.\n\nThe reason for looking at regular functions becomes more apparent when one\nallows V to be a projective variety. Then regular functions on V become rare.\nFor example morphisms from a projective space to the affine line must be\nconstant: regular functions on a projective space are constant functions. The\nsame is true for any connected projective variety (this can be viewed as an\nalgebraic analogue of Liouville's theorem in complex analysis).\n\nIn fact taking the function field K(V) of an irreducible algebraic curve V, the\nfunctions F in the function field may all be realised as morphisms from V to the\nprojective line over K. The image will either be a single point, or the whole\nprojective line (this is a consequence of the completeness of projective\nvarieties). That is, unless F is actually constant, we have to attribute to F\nthe value â at some points of V. Now in some sense F is no worse behaved at\nthose points than anywhere else: â is just the chosen point at infinity on the\nprojective line, and by using a MÃ¶bius transformation we can move it anywhere we\nwish. But it is in some way inadequate to the needs of geometry to use only the\naffine line as target for functions, since we shall end up only with constants.\n\nFor those reasons, the larger class of rational functions is constantly used in\nalgebraic geometry. For the needs of birational geometry, more generally,\nmorphisms are replaced with morphisms defined on open dense subsets. This brings\nfresh phenomena in dimension â¥ 1.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Regular_function","recorded":1362672139,"links":13,"instances":["complex_analysis","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic varieties","Types of functions"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["field","mathematics"],["liouville's_theorem","complex_analysis"]],"members":["field"],"related":["Mathematics","Function","Analytic_function","Holomorphic_function","Algebraic_geometry","Polynomial","Algebraic_variety","Field_(mathematics)","Affine_line","Commutative_ring","Polynomial_ring","Affine_variety","Morphism","Scheme_theory","Global_section","Structure_sheaf","Projective_variety","Projective_space","Liouville's_theorem_(complex_analysis)","Complex_analysis","Function_field_of_an_algebraic_variety","Irreducible_variety","Algebraic_curve","Projective_line","Completeness_of_projective_varieties","Point_at_infinity","Möbius_transformation","Rational_function","Birational_geometry"]}
