{"cursor":"5506","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sir Ralph Sandwich' (1235–1308) (also known as Ralph de Sandwich and\nRalph of Sandwich) was an English administrator and justice. He was Mayor of\nLondon from 1285 to 1293. [http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5C61458D-4D0A-4C07-AE3E-\n90C1C20B1E71/0/LH_HC_lordmayors1189.pdf Mayors and Lord Mayors of the City of\nLondon from 1189], www.cityoflondon.gov.uk, accessed 25 September 2011.\n\nHe was the son of Simon of Sandwich, the brother of Henry of Sandwich, and\nGillian Sandwich. His family had close connections with Simon de Montfort, and\nhis uncle's links with Montfort's administration is most likely what brought\nRalph into government. By September 1264 he had become part of the captive\nKing's household, and on 1 January 1265 he became Master of the Great Wardrobe.\nOn 7 May he was made Keeper of the Great Seal, although without the governmental\nposition which accompanied it. He was only allowed to use it for routine writs,\notherwise the presence of Peter de Montfort and two others was required.\n\nIn 1265 Sandwich was captured at the Battle of Evesham fighting on the losing\nside for de Montfort. His lands were confiscated and given to Roger de Leybourne\nand his father's lands awarded to Leybourne's son William. After his pardon in\n1266, Sandwich maintained a relationship with the Leybourne family, acting as a\nlawyer to Roger's widow in 1272 and executing her will in 1276. After the death\nof Henry of Sandwich in 1273 he was made administrator of the See of London,\nhaving already acted as their administrator during Henry's exile in Rome. In\nNovember 1273 he was appointed to audit the accounts of the Constable of Dover\nCastle, and in 1274 was summoned to attend the coronation of Edward I. In\nNovember 1275 he was one of three men appointed as a Steward of the King's\nDemesne, with his responsibilities being the counties of the south and west. The\npost, which involved large amounts of travel, handling of huge sums of money\n(over Â£7000 between 1277 and 1279) and the supervision of large building works\nat Devizes, Banstead, and Odiham, completely exhausted one of his colleagues.\n\nHe also acted as Keeper of the Port of Dover, Keeper of the Forest of Dean and\nadministrator of the See of Canterbury during the 1278–1279 vacancy. In\n1280 he was appointed to negotiate for the site of New Winchelsea. A member of\nthe King's council, Sandwich was in 1278 appointed justice coram rege (in the\npresence of the King) for when the king was in Kent, and was with the judges\nwhen Alexander III of Scotland paid homage in Westminster in October. In 1285\nEdward took direct control of London, appointing Sandwich as Warden of London on\n1 July and Constable of the Tower on 10 September. Until 1293 Sandwich was the\neffective Mayor of London, and presided over the city's Court of Hustings. He\nwas appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1289 after the\nprevious holder, Sir Thomas Weyland, became a fugitive âuntil the king makes\nfurther provisionâ, and stepped down in 1290 after a replacement was found.\nBetween 1286 and 1307 he sat every year as a justice at the original Old Bailey,\nand sat as a justice at the trial of William Wallace at Westminster Hall in\n1305.\n\nHe attended Edward II's coronation in February 1308, and on 24 March turned the\ncustody of the Tower of London over to John Cromwell. He died before 20 August\nand was buried in Greyfriars Church.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Ralph_Sandwich","recorded":1375075856,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/List_of_Lord_Mayors_of_London","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Henry_of_Sandwich","/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","/wiki/Master_of_the_Great_Wardrobe","/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm","/wiki/Peter_de_Montfort","/wiki/Battle_of_Evesham","/wiki/Roger_de_Leybourne","/wiki/Diocese_of_London","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Constable_of_Dover_Castle","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Demesne","/wiki/Devizes","/wiki/Banstead","/wiki/Odiham","/wiki/Dover","/wiki/Forest_of_Dean","/wiki/See_of_Canterbury","/wiki/Winchelsea","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland","/wiki/Westminster","/wiki/London","/wiki/Constable_of_the_Tower","/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London","/wiki/Husting","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Thomas_Weyland","/wiki/Old_Bailey","/wiki/William_Wallace","/wiki/Westminster_Hall","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Edward_II_of_England","/wiki/Tower_of_London","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5C61458D-4D0A-4C07-AE3E-90C1C20B1E71/0/LH_HC_lordmayors1189.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24646","/wiki/Master_of_the_Great_Wardrobe","/wiki/Thomas_de_Cantilupe","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/Walter_Giffard","/wiki/Thomas_Weyland","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/John_of_Mettingham","/wiki/Constable_of_the_Tower","/w/index.php?title=Gregory_de_Rokesley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London","/w/index.php?title=John_le_Breton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&oldid=492437319","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1235_births","/wiki/Category:1308_deaths","/wiki/Category:Lord_Chancellors_of_England","/wiki/Category:Chief_Justices_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Category:Lord_Mayors_of_London","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_English_royal_pardons","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ralph+Sandwich&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ralph+Sandwich","/wiki/Ralph_Sandwich","/wiki/Talk:Ralph_Sandwich","#","/wiki/Ralph_Sandwich","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ralph_Sandwich","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ralph_Sandwich","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&oldid=492437319","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7288062","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ralph_Sandwich&id=492437319","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ralph+Sandwich","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ralph+Sandwich&oldid=492437319&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Sandwich&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Sandwich","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7288062#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikiped
