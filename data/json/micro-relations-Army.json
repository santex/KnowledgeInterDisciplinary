{"cursor":"21584","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n[[File:Conscription map of the world.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the world of the\narmy forms\n\n\n\n]]\n\nAn 'army' (from Latin arma âarms, weaponsâ via Old French armÃ©e, âarmedâ\n(feminine)), in the broadest sense, is the land-based military branch, service\nbranch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include other branches\nof the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a\nnational military force, the word army may also mean a field army an army\ncomposed of full-time career soldiers who 'stand over', in other words, who do\nnot disband during times of peace. They differ from army reserves who are\nactivated only during such times as war or natural disasters.\n\nIn several countries, the army is officially called the 'Land Army' to\ndifferentiate it from an air force called the 'Air Army', notably France. In\nsuch countries, the word \"army\" on its own retains its connotation of a land\nforce in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of\nactive troops, is the People's Liberation Army of China with 2,250,000 active\ntroops and 800,000 reserve personnel followed by the Indian Army with 1,129,000\nactive troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.\n\nBy convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies\nwhich grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia. Regular in this\ncase refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular\nmilitary can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or\npart-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces\n(established under laws such as the National Defence Act, from de facto \"non-\nstatutory\" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may\nalso be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or\nfencible (designed for â or restricted to â homeland defence).\n","linknr":440,"url":"Army","recorded":1362482191,"links":103,"instances":["united_states","soviet_army","soviet_army","military","polity","military","prussia","class","1558"],"pdf":["http://www.lecavalierbleu.com/images/30/extrait_81.pdf"],"categories":["Armies|"],"headings":["History","Armies
