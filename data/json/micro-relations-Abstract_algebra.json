{"cursor":"16112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n have a group structure; the group is a fundamental concept within abstract\n algebra.]] In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, 'abstract\n algebra' is a usual name for the sub-area that studies for themselves algebraic\n structures such as groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras.\n The term 'abstract algebra' was coined at the turn of the 20th century to\n distinguish this area from the other parts of algebra. The term 'modern\n algebra' has also been used to denote abstract algebra.\n\nTwo mathematical subject areas that study the properties of algebraic structures\nviewed as a whole are universal algebra and category theory. Algebraic\nstructures, together with the associated homomorphisms, form categories.\nCategory theory is a powerful formalism for studying and comparing different\nalgebraic structures.\n","linknr":352,"url":"Abstract_algebra","recorded":1362374627,"links":69,"instances":["algebra","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","order","mathematics","ring_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abstract algebra|"],"headings":["History","Basic concepts","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Rubik%27s_cube_v2.svg/220px-Rubik%27s_cube_v2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["category","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["ideal","ring_theory"],["matrix","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["ring","algebra"],["field","algebra"],["set","mathematics"],["magma","algebra"],["group","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["magma","algebra"],["group","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["lattice","order"],["ring","mathematics"]],"members":["magma","ring","matrix","group","lattice","category","ideal","field","module","set"],"related":["Algebra","Mathematics","Algebraic_structure","Group_(mathematics)","Ring_(mathematics)","Field_(mathematics)","Module_(mathematics)","Vector_space","Algebra_over_a_field","Universal_algebra","Category_theory","Homomorphism","Category_(mathematics)","Matrix_(mathematics)","Determinant","Linear_algebra","Polynomial","Symmetry","Diophantine_equation","Ring_(mathematics)","Ideal_(ring_theory)","Algebraic_structure","Hypercomplex_number","History_of_group_theory","Leonhard_Euler","Algebraic_operations","Modular_arithmetic","Euler_theorem","Fermat's_little_theorem","Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","Cyclic_group","Abelian_group","Composition_of_binary_quadratic_forms","Associativity","Leopold_Kronecker","Ideal_class_group","Heinrich_M._Weber","Cancellation_property","Inverse_element","Permutations","Joseph_Lagrange","Lagrange_resolvents","Edward_Waring","Alexandre_Vandermonde","Paolo_Ruffini","Permutation_group","Évariste_Galois","Augustin_Cauchy","Camille_Jordan","Isomorphism","Arthur_Cayley","Matrix_(mathematics)","Intellectual_rigor","Algebra","Natural_sciences","Axiomatic_system","Algebraic_structure","Group_(mathematics)","Ring_(algebra)","Field_(algebra)","Group_theory","Ring_theory","Pure_mathematics","Ernst_Steinitz","David_Hilbert","Emil_Artin","Emmy_Noether","Ernst_Kummer","Leopold_Kronecker","Richard_Dedekind","Georg_Frobenius","Issai_Schur","Bartel_van_der_Waerden","Monograph","Set_(mathematics)","Set_theory","Magma_(algebra)","Semigroups","Group_(mathematics)","Group_theory","Ring_(mathematics)","Binary_operation","Magma_(algebra)","Quasigroups","Monoids","Semigroups","Group_(mathematics)","Ring_(mathematics)","Field_(mathematics)","Module_(mathematics)","Vector_spaces","Algebra_over_a_field","Associative_algebras","Lie_algebras","Lattice_(order)","Boolean_algebras","Algebraic_topology","Poincaré_conjecture","Fundamental_group","Algebraic_number_theory","Ring_(mathematics)","Algebraic_number_theory","Andrew_Wiles","Fermat's_Last_Theorem","Gauge_theory","Local_symmetry","Lie_group","Force_carrier","Boson","Coding_theory","John_Wiley_&_Sons","GFDL"]}
