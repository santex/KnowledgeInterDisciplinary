The Constitution sets out the\nboundaries of federal law, which consists of constitutional acts of Congress,\nconstitutional treaties ratified by Congress, constitutional regulations\npromulgated by the executive branch, and case law originating from the federal\njudiciary.\n\nThe Constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land, thus\npreempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty U.S. states and\nin the territories.
