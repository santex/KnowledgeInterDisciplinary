However, in\nstatistics, these terms are usually used for controlled experiments. Formal\nplanned experimentation is often used in evaluating physical objects, chemical\nformulations, structures, components, and materials. Other types of study, and\ntheir design, are discussed in the articles on opinion polls and statistical\nsurveys (which are types of observational study), natural experiments and quasi-\nexperiments (for example, quasi-experimental design). See Experiment for the\ndistinction between these types of experiments or studies.\n\nIn the design of experiments, the experimenter is often interested in the effect\nof some process or intervention (the \"treatment\") on some objects (the\n\"experimental units\"), which may be people, parts of people, groups of people,\nplants, animals, etc. Design of experiments is thus a discipline that has very\nbroad application across all the natural and social sciences and engineering.\n","recorded":1362123817,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"795","instances":["natural_sciences","statistics","metrology","physician","epidemiology","statistics","statistics","journal","medicine","statistics","computer_graphics","clinical_trials","drawing","japan","1746","statistics","statistics","statistics","rpd","statistics","statistics","statistics","probability_theory","mathematics","mathematician","statistics","statistics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Design of experiments","Statistical methods","Statistical theory","Industrial engineering","Systems engineering","Quality control","Quality","Quantitative research","Engineering statistics","Experiments"],"headings":["History of development","Principles of experimental design, following Ronald A.
