{"cursor":"2077","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'release factor' is a protein that allows for the termination of translation\nby recognizing the termination codon or stop codon in a mRNA sequence.\n\nDuring translation of mRNA, most codons are recognized by \"charged\" tRNA\nmolecules, called aminoacyl-tRNAs because they are adhered to specific amino\nacids corresponding to each tRNA's anticodon.\n\nIn the standard genetic code, there are three mRNA stop codons: UAG (\"amber\"),\nUAA (\"ochre\"), and UGA (\"opal\" or \"umber\").\n\nAlthough these stop codons are triplets just like ordinary codons, they are not\ndecoded by tRNAs. Instead, it was discovered by Mario Capecchi in 1967 that\ntRNAs do not ordinarily recognize stop codons at all, and that what he named\n\"release factor\" was not a tRNA molecule, but a protein.

Later, it was demonstrated that\ndifferent release factors recognize different stop codons. Scolnick, E., R.\nTompkins, T. Caskey, and M. Nirenberg (1968).
