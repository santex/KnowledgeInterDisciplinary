Water (H 2O) is also a monoxide; see dihydrogen\nmonoxide hoax. A well known monoxide is carbon monoxide (CO); see carbon\nmonoxide poisoning. Most of the members of the Periodic Table form oxides when\noxidized. There are two main types of oxides: monoxides and dioxides. Monoxides\n(generally MO) such as silicon monoxide (SiO) only exist at high temperatures.\nAmong monoxides, CO is neutral, GeO is distinctly acidic, and SnO and PbO are\namphoteric.\n\n","linknr":97,"url":"monoxide","recorded":1362581540,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxides"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oxide","Atom","Oxygen","Molecule","Potassium_oxide","Water","Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_monoxide_poisoning"]}
