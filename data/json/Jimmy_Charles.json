{"cursor":"2956","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jimmy Charles', was an American singer with a distinctive \"crying style\".\n\nCharles was born in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1943. Before he sang\nprofessionally, he built up quite a local reputation wailing at churches and\ncommunity functions.\n\nWhen Charles was 16, his uncle accompanied him to New York City to try his luck\nat the amateur talent shows held at the Apollo Theater. Surprisingly, Charles\nwon the renowned contest for four consecutive weeks.\n\nCharles' uncle then hooked up his warbling kin with Phil Medley, a jack-of-all-\ntrades who was an accomplished singer, songwriter, producer, and arranger.\nImpressed by the lad's delivery, Medley cut a demo with Charles singing a song\nMedley had been trying to place entitled [[A Million to One]]. He got the ear of\nBill Lashley, an executive at Promo Records, and played it for him. Promo liked\nthe demo and signed the youngster to a recording contract. They redid Medley's\nsong with the Revellettes backing the singer. The Revellettes were a trio from\nPaterson New Jersey, and were friends of Jimmy's and included sisters Jackie and\nEvelyn Kline, and Dottie Hailstock. When the song was recorded, they did 16\ntakes to get the one they wanted. It was a very hot day in Paterson, and the\nflip they nailed in just one try. The dreamy ballad ascended to number five on\nBillboard's Top 100 in September 1960. It was also released on the London label\nfor both the UK and Australia, and it was pressed on Reo for Canada. The record\nreceived worldwide acclaim\n\nHis career ended as quickly as it started. The Age of Love, Charles' next\nrelease, stalled at the 47th position, 42 slots lower than A Million to One.\nJimmy Charles also released two Christmas records in 1960. Santa Won't Be Blue\nThis Christmas backed with I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus was the first. The\nsecond was Christmasville USA and A Little White Mouse Called Steve. The latter\nwas a record that did receive airplay and is remembered by many, but sadly did\nnot become a national chart hit. A subsequent release called Just Whistle for\nMe failed to attract much attention or airplay either, and his career was\nquickly over. Jimmy did continue to tour on the strength of A Million To One,\nwell into the 60's. Today, he resides in Texas, and has started singing again\nwhen time permits.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Jimmy_Charles","recorded":1375054397,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Singer","/wiki/Paterson,_New_Jersey","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Apollo_Theater","/wiki/Phil_Medley","/wiki/A_Million_to_One","/w/index.php?title=Promo_Records&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Revellettes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=edit&section=1","http://www.colorradio.com/Jimmy_Charles.htm","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&oldid=544510393","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_male_singers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1942_births","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jimmy+Charles&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jimmy+Charles","/wiki/Jimmy_Charles","/wiki/Talk:Jimmy_Charles","#","/wiki/Jimmy_Charles","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jimmy_Charles","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jimmy_Charles","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&oldid=544510393","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1407654","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jimmy_Charles&id=544510393","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jimmy+Charles","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jimmy+Charles&oldid=544510393&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Charles&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Charles","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1407654#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Charles","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["American male singers","Living people","1942 births"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States","Singer","Paterson,_New_Jersey","New_York_City","Apollo_Theater","Phil_Medley","Promo_Records","Revellettes","Billboard_Hot_100"]}
