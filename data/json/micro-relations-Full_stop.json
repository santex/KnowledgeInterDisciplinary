In American English, the phrase \"full\nstop\" is generally used only in the context of transport to describe the process\nof completely halting the motion of a vehicle. See, e.g., Seaboard Air Line\nRailway Co. v. Blackwell, \"under the laws of the state a train is required to\ncome to a full stop 50 feet from the crossing\"; Chowdhury v. City of Los\nAngeles, [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/38CA4t1187.htm 38 Cal. App. 4th\n1187] (1995) \"Once the signals failed, the City could reasonably foresee that\nmotorists using due care would obey the provisions of the Vehicle Code and make\na full stop before proceeding when it was safe to do so\". is the\npunctuation mark placed to indicate the end of sentences. In the context of web\naddresses and computing in general, it is typically called a 'dot'.\nSome experts call it a 'baseline dot' [http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-\n043.pdf] [http://www.fontshop.com/glossary/]\n[http://www.mathisfunforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=11414]\n[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=CharStories_2024], because\nit is a on the baseline, as distinct from an interpunct (a middle dot). In\nconversation, as opposed to linguistics, the term is often used to mean \"the end\nof the matter\" (for example, \"We are calling a full stop to discussions on this\nsubject\" or \"We will not do it. Period!\").\n","linknr":476,"url":"Full_stop","recorded":1362374590,"links":69,"instances":["linguistics","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","punctuation","programming_language","typography","programming_language","unix_shell","programming_language","computer_science","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v31n2p042-043.pdf"],"categories":["Punctuation"],"headings":["History","Usage","Punctuation styles when quoting","Spacing after a full stop","Full stops in other scripts","Use in telegrams","Encodings","Computing use","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["baseline","typography"],["space","punctuation"],["c","programming_language"],["class","computer_science"],["object","computer_science"],["java","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["pascal","programming_language"],["erlang","programming_language"],["haskell","programming_language"],["bash","unix_shell"],["dot","disambiguation"]],"members":["sentence","python","object","java","erlang","space","pascal","baseline","c","bash","haskell","class","dot"],"related":["British_English","Irish_English","Australian_English","New_Zealand_English","American_English","Canadian_English","Canada","United_States","American_English","Punctuation","Sentence_(linguistics)","Web_address","Baseline_(typography)","Interpunct","Aristophanes_of_Byzantium","Punctuation","Armenian_alphabet","Abbreviation","Haplography","British_English","Title","American_English","Rand_McNally","Initialisms","Glyph","Decimal_separator","English_language","Decimal_separator","Multiplication","Interpunct","American_English","Space_(punctuation)","ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet","Monospaced_font","Typewriters","Em_space","History_of_sentence_spacing","Linotype_machine","TeX","Chinese_language","Japanese_language","Traditional_Chinese_characters","Devanagari_script","Hindi","Sanskrit","Languages_of_India","Hindi","Marathi_language","Sinhala_language","Sinhala_numerals","Urdu","Thai_language","Ge'ez_script","Amharic_language","Telegram","Computing","Delimiter","Domain_Name_System","Computer_file","Programming_languages","C_(programming_language)","Struct","C++","Class_(computer_science)","Object_(computer_science)","Java_(programming_language)","Python_(programming_language)","Pascal_(programming_language)","Erlang_(programming_language)","Prolog","Smalltalk","Regular_expression","Perl","PHP","String_concatenation","Haskell_(programming_language)","Function_composition","File_systems","Filename_extension","RISC_OS","Unix","MS-DOS","Unix-like","Hidden_file","Microsoft_Windows","Working_directory","Parent_directory","Bourne_shell","Interpreters","Bourne_shell","Korn_shell","Bash_(Unix_shell)","Decimal_separator","Dot_(disambiguation)","Sentence_spacing","Terminal_punctuation"]}
