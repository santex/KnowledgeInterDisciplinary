The country consists\nof 16 states, and its capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany covers an area\nof and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 80.3&nbsp;million\ninhabitants, it is the most populous member state in the European Union. Germany\nis the major economic and political power of the European continent and a\nhistoric leader in many theoretical and technical fields.\n\nA region named Germania, inhabited by several Germanic peoples, was documented\nbefore AD&nbsp;100. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded\nsouthward and established successor kingdoms throughout much of Europe.\nBeginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the\nHoly Roman Empire.<ref>The Latin name Sacrum Imperium (Holy Empire) is\ndocumented as far back as 1157. The Latin name Sacrum Romanum Imperium (Holy\nRoman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name \"Holy Roman Empire of\nthe German Nation\" (Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation) dates back to\nthe 15th century.<br/></ref> During the 16th century, northern German regions\nbecame the centre of the Protestant Reformation while southern (most notably\nBavaria) and western parts remained dominated by Roman Catholic denominations,\nwith the two factions clashing in the Thirty Years' War, marking the beginning\nof the Catholic–Protestant divide that has characterized German society ever\nsince.<ref name=\"georgetown1\"></ref> Occupied during the Napoleonic Wars, the\nrise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted in the\nunification of most of the German states in 1871 into the German Empire, which\nwas dominated by Prussia.\n\nAfter the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the subsequent military surrender\nin World War I, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic in\n1918, and some of its territory partitioned in the Treaty of Versailles. Despite\nits lead in many scientific and artistic fields at this time, amidst the Great\nDepression, the Third Reich was established in 1933. The latter period was\nmarked by fascism and World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided by allied\noccupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany. In 1990,\nthe country was reunified.\n\nGermany was a founding member of the European Community in 1957, which became\nthe EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and since 1999, a member of the\neuro area. Germany is a great power and member of the United Nations, NATO, the\nG8, the G20, the OECD and the Council of Europe, and took a non-permanent seat\non the UN Security Council for the 2011–2012 term.\n\nGermany has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-\nlargest by purchasing power parity. Subsequently, it is the second-largest\nexporter and third-largest importer of goods. The country has developed a very\nhigh standard of living and features a comprehensive system of social security,\nwhich includes the world's oldest universal health care system. Germany has been\nthe home of many influential philosophers, music composers, scientists and\ninventors, and is known for its rich cultural and political history.\n","title":"germany","headings":["Etymology","History","Geography","Politics","Economy","Demographics","Culture","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Berlin","5:
