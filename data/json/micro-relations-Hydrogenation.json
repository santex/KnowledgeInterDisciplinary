The process is commonly employed to reduce or\nsaturate organic compounds. Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of\npairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule, generally an alkene. Catalysts are\nrequired for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place\nonly at very high temperatures. Hydrogen adds to double and triple bonds in\nhydrocarbons.\n\nBecause of the importance of hydrogen, many related reactions have been\ndeveloped for its use. Most hydrogenations use gaseous hydrogen (H 2),\nbut some involve the alternative sources of hydrogen, not H 2: these\nprocesses are called transfer hydrogenations. The reverse reaction, removal of\nhydrogen from a molecule, is called dehydrogenation. A reaction where bonds are\nbroken while hydrogen is added is called hydrogenolysis, a reaction that may\noccur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom (oxygen, nitrogen or halogen)\nbonds. Hydrogenation differs from protonation or hydride addition: in\nhydrogenation, the products have the same charge as the reactants.\n\nHydrogenation of unsaturated fats produces saturated fats. In the case of\npartial hydrogenation, trans fats may be generated as well.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Hydrogenation","recorded":1362371450,"links":56,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemist"],"pdf":["http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1922/44/i06/f-pdf/f_ja01427a021.pdf","http://members.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/27B49B9B-EA63-4D73-BAB4-42FEFCD72C68/0/crfsfsv4n1p00220030ms20040577.pdf","http://members.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/27B49B9B-EA63-4D73-BAB4-42FEFCD72C68/0/crfsfsv4n1p00220030ms20040577.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV7P0226.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV8P0609.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P0552.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV4P0603.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV6P0371.pdf"],"categories":["Addition
