{"cursor":"11504","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n 'Goose bumps', also called 'goose flesh', 'goose\npimples', the medical term 'cutis anserina', are the bumps on a person's skin at\nthe base of body hairs which may involuntarily develop when a person is cold or\nexperiences strong emotions such as fear, nostalgia, pleasure, euphoria, awe,\nadmiration and sexual\narousal. http://www.exploratorium.edu/music/questions/goosebumps.html\n\nThe reflex of producing goose bumps is known as 'arasing', 'piloerection', or\nthe 'pilomotor reflex'. It occurs in many mammals besides humans; a prominent\nexample is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters\nwhen they encounter sharks or other predators.\n\nOther creatures get goose bumps for the same reason, for example this is why a\ncat or dogâs hair stands on end. In cold situations, the rising hair traps air\nbetween the hairs and skin, creating insulation and warmth. In response to fear,\ngoose bumps make an animal appear larger â hopefully scaring away the enemy.\n","linknr":260,"url":"Goose_bumps","recorded":1362483459,"links":38,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://people.bu.edu/mnmuller/Pdfs/Muller&Mitani_2005.pdf"],"categories":["Skin physiology","Reflexes"],"headings":["Etymology","Anatomy and biology","Cause","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/2003-09-17_Goose_bumps.jpg/220px-2003-09-17_Goose_bumps.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","biology"]],"members":["stress"],"related":["Skin","Hair","Cold","Fear","Nostalgia","Pleasure","Euphoria","Awe","Reflex","Mammal","Porcupine","Sea_otter","Cat","Dog","Geese","Hair_follicle","Phenomenon","Syphilis","Winchester_Geese","Bishop_of_Winchester","Liberty_of_the_Clink","Winchester_Palace","German_language","Italian_language","Russian_language","Ukrainian_language","Polish_language","Czech_language","Slovak_language","Danish_language","Latvian_language","Hungarian_language","Chicken","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","Romanian_language","French_language","Chicken","Dutch_language","Chinese_language","Finnish_language","Afrikaans_language","Korean_language","Japanese_language","English_language","Latin","Muscle","Hair","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Fight-or-flight_response","Fur","Thermal_insulation","Chimpanzee","New_world_monkey","Cotton-top_tamarin","Sexual_dimorphism","Animal_Behaviour","House_mouse","Cat","Areolas","Symptom","Epilepsy","Brain_tumor","Autonomic_hyperreflexia","Opiate","Heroin","Keratosis_pilaris","Cold","Hair_follicle","Shivering","Sweat","Perspiration","Evaporate","Fight-or-flight_response","Stress_(biology)","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Adrenaline","Heart_rate","Metabolism","Porcupine","Quill","Food","Drugs","Money","Dopamine","Breathing","Scientist","Cold_chill","Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response"]}
