By his arranged (by King\n Ahaziah) marriage with the princess Jehosheba (alternately Jehoshabeath), he\n became the brother-in-law of King Ahaziah (). King Ahaziah died shortly\n thereafter in battle at Megiddo and the throne was usurped by Queen Athaliah.\n\nAbout ninety years old at the time of this marriage to the young princess, he\nwas instrumental in the staging of the coup that dethroned and killed the ultra\nwicked Queen Athaliah. Jehosheba and Jehoiada had rescued the infant King Joash\nfrom Athaliah's slaughter of the royal children. For six years, they hid the\nsole surviving heir to the throne within the temple. Jehoiada guided much\nyounger King Joash in a righteous rule for about 35 years which included\nrestoration of the temple (). Jehoiada is also noteworthy for the national\ncovenant that he made \"between him, and between all the people, and between the\nking, that they should be the LORD's people\" ().\n\nJehoiada lived 130 years and was buried very honorably among the kings in the\ncity of David (). Jehoiada's son, Zechariah, was later martyred by king Joash.\nJehoiada's name doesn't appear in the list of the Zadokite dynasty in (6:4-15 in\nother translations).\n\nJosephus mentions Jehoiada in his Jewish Antiquites Book 9, Chapter 7 as \"high\npriest,\" The Complete Works of Flavius Josephus - Page 237 William\nWhiston \"How Athaliah reigned over Jerusalem for five [six] years, when\nJehoiada the high priest slew her,\" although Josephus does not mention a\nJehoiada in his High Priest list (Antiquities of the Jews 10:151-153).\n\nAccording to the medieval chronicle Seder Olam Zutta (804 CE), Jehoiada was the\nHigh priest.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Jehoiada","recorded":1362565237,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["High Priests of Israel","9th-century BC clergy","Year of birth unknown","Year of death uncertain","Place of birth unknown"],"headings":["Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Menora.svg/55px-Menora.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Jehoiada.jpg/175px-Jehoiada.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/The10Commandments.png/36px-The10Commandments.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Hebrew_Bible","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Athaliah","Jehoash_of_Judah","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Jehosheba","Athaliah","Jehoash_of_Judah","Zechariah_Ben_Jehoiada","Josephus","Antiquities_of_the_Jews","Seder_Olam_Zutta","Kohen_Gadol"]}
