{"cursor":"7358","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n sign is a completely conventional symbol with no inherent relationship to what\n it represents.]] A 'sign' is a representation of an object that implies a\n connection between itself and its object. A natural sign bears a causal\n relation to its objectâfor instance, thunder is a sign of storm. A conventional\n sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence.\n (This is in contrast to a symbol which stands for another thing, as a flag may\n be a symbol of a nation).\n\n\n\nThe way a sign signifies is called semiosis which is a topic of semiotics and\nphilosophy of language.\n\nHow a sign is perceived depends upon what is intended or expressed in the\nsemiotic relationship of:\n\n* Signification\n* Significance (i.e. meaning)\n* Importance\n\nThus, for example, people may speak of the significance of events, the\nsignification of characters, the meaning of sentences, or the import of a\ncommunication. Different ways of relating signs to their objects are called\nmodes of signification.\n\nUses of conventional signs are varied. Usually the goal is to elicit a response\nor simply inform. That can be achieved by marking something, displaying a\nmessage (i.e. a notice), drawing attention or presenting evidence of an\nunderlying cause (for instance, medical symptoms signify a disease), performing\na bodily gesture, etc.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Sign","recorded":1362540804,"links":37,"instances":["computing","mathematics","disambiguation","arts","semiotics","mathematics","animal","hunting","semiotics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Communication","Semiotics"],"headings":["Nature","Types","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Biohazard.svg/220px-Biohazard.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Door_sign.JPG/220px-Door_sign.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Pedestrian_Crossing-sign.jpg/300px-Pedestrian_Crossing-sign.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Zodiac_woodcut.png/220px-Zodiac_woodcut.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/DurbanSign1989.jpg/180px-DurbanSign1989.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meaning","semiotics"],["semiotic_elements_and_classes_of_signs","peirce#classes_of_signs"],["tracking","hunting"],["spoor","animal"],["sign","linguistics"],["sign","mathematics"],["parity","mathematics"],["transposition","mathematics"],["sign","semiotics"],["icon","computing"],["representation","arts"],["signing","disambiguation"]],"members":["icon","transposition","signing","representation","meaning","semiotic_elements_and_classes_of_signs","parity","spoor","tracking","sign"],"related":["Symbol","Thunder","Full_stop","Symbol","Flag","Semiosis","Semiotics","Philosophy_of_language","Semiotic","Meaning_(semiotics)","Notice","Symptom","Gesture","Semiotics","Epistemology","Philosophy_of_language","Aristotle","Augustine_of_Hippo","Aquinas","Language","Discourse","Communication","Philosophy","Science","Logic","Mathematics","Poetry","Theology","Religion","Durban","Apartheid","South_Africa","Racial_segregation","Astrology","Sun_sign","Hand_gesture","Sign_language","Gang_signal","Tracking_(hunting)","Spoor_(animal)","Signboard","Indication","Divination","Omen","Ontology","Spirituality","Coincidence","Synchronicity","Sign_(linguistics)","Mathematics","Sign_(mathematics)","Positive_and_negative_numbers","Sign_of_a_permutation","Parity_(mathematics)","Transposition_(mathematics)","Signedness","Signed_number_representation","Biology","Medical_sign","Medicine","Symptom","Sign_(semiotics)","Information_sign","People","Traffic_sign","Stop_sign","Speed_limit","Cross_walk","Writing_system","Grapheme","Commercial_signage","Flashing_sign","Signature","Asemic_writing","Roland_Barthes","Commercial_signage","Mary_Douglas","Icon","Icon_(computing)","Ideogram","Oneiromancy","Edmund_Leach","Claude_Lévi-Strauss","List_of_symbols","Logotype","Map-territory_relation","National_symbol","Neon_sign","Religious_symbolism","Representation_(arts)","Ferdinand_de_Saussure","Semiotics","Signing_(disambiguation)","Structuralism","Symbol","Synchronicity","Traffic_sign"]}
