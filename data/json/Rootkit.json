The\nterm rootkit is a concatenation of \"root\" (the traditional name of the\nprivileged account on Unix operating systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers\nto the software components that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has\nnegative connotations through its association with malware.\n\nRootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it once\nthey've obtained root or Administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result\nof direct attack on a system (i.e. exploiting a known vulnerability, password\n(either by cracking, privilege escalation, or social engineering). Once\ninstalled, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain\nprivileged access. The key is the root/Administrator access. Full control over a\nsystem means that existing software can be modified, including software that\nmight otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.\n\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the\nsoftware that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an\nalternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature\nscanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be\ncomplicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit\nresides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only\navailable solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal\nmay require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.\n","linknr":989,"url":"Rootkit","recorded":1362551616,"links":108,"instances":["computing","computing","electronic","computer_science","computing","computing","computing","software","linux","computer_virus","computer_security","computer_security","computing","software","computing","computing","security"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20060823090948/http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/threat_center/wp_akapoor_rootkits1_en.pdf","http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/threat_center/wp_akapoor_rootkits1_en.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060823090948/http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/threat_center/wp_akapoor_rootkits1_en.pdf","http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/windows.rootkit.overview.pdf","http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/windows.rootkit.overview.pdf","http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf","http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/DAIZOVI/BHUSA09-Daizovi-AdvOSXRootkits-SLIDES.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/DAIZOVI/BHUSA09-Daizovi-AdvOSXRootkits-SLIDES.pdf","http://www.vividmachines.com/download/icsicceid.pdf","http://www.vividmachines.com/download/icsicceid.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/ORTEGA/BHUSA09-Ortega-DeactivateRootkit-PAPER.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/ORTEGA/BHUSA09-Ortega-DeactivateRootkit-PAPER.pdf","http://www.stoned-vienna.com/downloads/The%20Rise%20of%20MBR%20Rootkits%20&%20Bootkits%20in%20the%20Wild.pdf","http://www.stoned-vienna.com/downloads/The%20Rise%20of%20MBR%20Rootkits%20&%20Bootkits%20in%20the%20Wild.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081205031526/http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/wp_rootkits_0407.pdf","http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/wp_rootkits_0407.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081205031526/http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/white_papers/wp_rootkits_0407.pdf","http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/b/e/abefdf1c-96bd-40d6-a138-e320b6b25bd3/understandingantimalwaretechnologies.pdf","http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/b/e/abefdf1c-96bd-40d6-a138-e320b6b25bd3/understandingantimalwaretechnologies.pdf","http://www.megasecurity.org/papers/Rootkits.pdf","http://www.megasecurity.org/papers/Rootkits.pdf","http://pxnow.prevx.com/content/blog/zeroaccess_analysis.pdf","http://pxnow.prevx.com/content/blog/zeroaccess_analysis.pdf","https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Kumar/Whitepaper/bh-eu-07-Kumar-WP-apr19.pdf","https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Kumar/Whitepaper/bh-eu-07-Kumar-WP-apr19.pdf","http://www.eecs.umich.edu/virtual/papers/king06.pdf","http://www.eecs.umich.edu/virtual/papers/king06.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/wdcui/papers/hooksafe-ccs09.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/wdcui/papers/hooksafe-ccs09.pdf","http://esec-lab.sogeti.com/dotclear/public/publications/10-hack.lu-nicreverse_slides.pdf","http://esec-lab.sogeti.com/dotclear/public/publications/10-hack.lu-nicreverse_slides.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-Heasman.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-Heasman.pdf","http://www.ngsconsulting.com/research/papers/Implementing_And_Detecting_A_PCI_Rootkit.pdf","http://www.ngsconsulting.com/research/papers/Implementing_And_Detecting_A_PCI_Rootkit.pdf","http://cansecwest.com/csw09/csw09-sacco-ortega.pdf","http://cansecwest.com/csw09/csw09-sacco-ortega.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/ORTEGA/BHUSA09-Ortega-DeactivateRootkit-PAPER.pdf","http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/ORTEGA/BHUSA09-Ortega-DeactivateRootkit-PAPER.pdf","http://www.eset.com/resources/white-papers/TDL3-Analysis.pdf","http://www.eset.com/resources/white-papers/TDL3-Analysis.pdf","http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/The_Evolution_of_TDL.pdf","http://www.eset.com/us/resources/white-papers/The_Evolution_of_TDL.pdf","http://www.mhprofessional.com/downloads/products/0071591184/0071591184_chap10.pdf","http://www.mhprofessional.com/downloads/products/0071591184/0071591184_chap10.pdf","http://www.trlokom.com/pdf/TrlokomRootkitDefenseWhitePaper.pdf","http://www.trlokom.com/pdf/TrlokomRootkitDefenseWhitePaper.pdf","http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/testing_methodology_for_rootkit_removal.pdf","http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/testing_methodology_for_rootkit_removal.pdf","http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/resource_files/C2426F48-1D09-3519-AD02D13C71B888A6/Whitepaper_Rootkit_Strom_v3.pdf","http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/resource_files/C2426F48-1D09-3519-AD02D13C71B888A6/Whitepaper_Rootkit_Strom_v3.pdf","http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/resource_files/87B92DAF-1D09-3519-AD80984BBE62D62D/TCG_PCSpecificSpecification_v1_1.pdf","http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/resource_files/87B92DAF-1D09-3519-AD80
