Example of hatching (e.g., background) and cross-\nhatching in many darker areas (visible if viewed at full size).]]\n\n'Hatching' (hachure in French) is an artistic technique used to create tonal or\nshading effects by drawing (or painting or scribing) closely spaced parallel\nlines. (It is also used in monochromatic heraldic representations to indicate\nwhat the tincture of a \"full-colour\" emblazon would be.) When lines are placed\nat an angle to one another, it is called 'cross-hatching'.\n\nHatching is especially important in essentially linear media, such as drawing,\nand many forms of printmaking, such as engraving, etching and woodcut. In\nWestern art, hatching originated in the Middle Ages, and developed further into\ncross-hatching, especially in the old master prints of the fifteenth century.\nMaster ES and Martin Schongauer in engraving and Erhard Reuwich and Michael\nWolgemut in woodcut were pioneers of both techniques, and Albrecht DÃ¼rer in\nparticular perfected the technique of crosshatching in both media. Twenty-first\ncentury artist Larry D. Alexander has created and developed a large body of Pen\nand Ink Drawings using the crosshatching technique since the early 1990s.
