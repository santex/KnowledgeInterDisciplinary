{"cursor":"7454","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Organosulfates' are a class of organic compounds sharing a common functional\ngroup commonly with the structure R-O-SO 3- . The\nSO 4 core is a sulfate group and the R group is any organic residue.\nAll organosulfates are formally esters derived from alcohols and sulfuric acid,\nalthough many are not prepared in this way. Many sulfate esters are used in\ndetergents, and some are useful reagents. Alkyl sulfates consist of a\nhydrophobic hydrocarbon chain, a polar sulfate or sulfonate group (containing an\nanion) and either a cation or amine to neutralize the sulfate group. Examples\ninclude: sodium lauryl sulfate (also known as sulfuric acid mono dodecyl ester\nsodium salt) and related potassium and ammonium salts.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Organosulfate","recorded":1362512013,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Alkyl_Sulfates_SIAR.pdf","http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Alkyl_Sulfates_SIAR.pdf","http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Alkyl_Sulfates_SIAR.pdf","http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Alkyl_Sulfates_SIAR.pdf"],"categories":["Organic compounds","Organosulfates|*"],"headings":["Applications","Synthetic organosulfates","Dialkylsulfates","Natural sulfate esters","Safety","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Alkylsulfate.png/200px-Alkylsulfate.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/SulfateEster.png/140px-SulfateEster.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_compounds","Functional_group","Sulfate","Ester","Alcohol","Sulfuric_acid","Reagent","Hydrophobe","Sulfate","Sulfonate","Amine","Sodium_lauryl_sulfate","Surfactant","Sodium_lauryl_sulfate","Ethoxylation","Lauryl_alcohol","Sodium_laureth_sulfate","Cosmetics","Zieglerâ€“Natta_catalyst","Oxo_synthesis","Oleochemical","Hydrocarbon","Chlorosulfuric_acid","Elbs_persulfate_oxidation","Boyland-Sims_oxidation","Diethyl_sulfate","Dimethyl_sulfate","Reagent","Organic_synthesis","Alkylating_agent","3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate","Biosynthesis","OECD","Genotoxicity","Mutagen","Carcinogen","Biodegradation"]}
