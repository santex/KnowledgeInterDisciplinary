{"cursor":"4118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n figurine]] A 'figurine' (a diminutive form of the word figure) is a statuette\n that represents a human, deity or animal. Figurines may be realistic or\n iconic, depending on the skill and intention of the creator. The earliest were\n made of stone or clay. Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood\n and plastic.\n\nFigures with movable parts, allowing limbs to be posed, are more likely to be\ncalled dolls, mannequins, or action figures; or robots or automata, if they can\nmove on their own.\n\nFigurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and\ntabletop role playing games. Old figurines have been used to discount some\nhistorical theories, such as the origins of chess.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Figurine","recorded":1362371285,"links":29,"instances":["gaming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of sculpture","Figurines","Toy collecting"],"headings":["Prehistory","History","Modern era","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/St_Sebastian_Groeden.jpg/170px-St_Sebastian_Groeden.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg/100px-Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Dresden_figurine.gif/125px-Dresden_figurine.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Porzellanfabrik-Goebel_Hummelfigur.jpg/170px-Porzellanfabrik-Goebel_Hummelfigur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["miniature_figure","gaming"]],"members":["miniature_figure"],"related":["Deity","Animal_figurines","Iconic","Doll","Mannequin","Action_figure","Robot","Automaton","Miniature_figure_(gaming)","Board_game","Chess","Role_playing_game","Origins_of_chess","Neolithic","Venus_figurines","Ceramic","Minoan_civilization","Crete","Terracotta","Iron_Age","Jewelry","Porcelain","Porcelain","China","Dresden","Val_Gardena","South_Tyrol","Italy","Action_figure","Model_figure","Precious_Moments,_Inc.","Hummel_figurine","Bobblehead","Royal_Doulton","Lladr√≥","Kevin_Smith","View_Askew","Portmanteau","Four_Horsemen_Studios","Olmec_figurine","Psi_and_phi_type_figurine","Animal_figurines"]}
