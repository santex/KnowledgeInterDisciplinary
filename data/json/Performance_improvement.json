The concept of performance improvement can be applied to either\nindividual performance such as an athlete or organizational performance such as\na racing team or a commercial enterprise.\n\nIn Organizational development, 'performance improvement' is the concept of\norganizational change in which the managers and governing body of an\norganization put into place and manage a program which measures the current\nlevel of performance of the organization and then generates ideas for modifying\norganizational behavior and infrastructure which are put into place to achieve\nhigher output. The primary goals of organizational improvement are to increase\norganizational effectiveness and efficiency to improve the ability of the\norganization to deliver goods and or services. A third area sometimes targeted\nfor improvement is organizational efficacy, which involves the process of\nsetting organizational goals and objectives.\n\nPerformance improvement at the operational or individual employee level usually\ninvolves processes such as statistical quality control. At the organizational\nlevel, performance improvement usually involves softer forms of measurement such\nas customer satisfaction surveys which are used to obtain qualitative\ninformation about performance from the viewpoint of customers. A simple but\ncomprehensive guide to Performance Improvement has been developed by the United\nStates Coast Guard. This guide illustrates many of the tools that are available\nfor your use in Performance Improvement.
