His\nwork on insects demonstrated that the various phases during the life of an\ninsectâegg, larva, pupa, and adultâare different forms of the same animal. As\npart of his anatomical research, he carried out experiments on muscle\ncontraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells.\nHe was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his\ntechniques remained useful for hundreds of years.\n","linknr":281,"url":"Jan_Swammerdam","recorded":1362502052,"links":39,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.janswammerdam.net/NRN.pdf","http://www.janswammerdam.net/NRN.pdf","http://www.janswammerdam.net/NRN.pdf"],"categories":["Dutch entomologists","Beekeepers","Dutch naturalists","Dutch zoologists","Microscopists","People from Amsterdam","Leiden University alumni","1637 births","1680 deaths"],"headings":["Biography","Research on Insects","Research on Anatomy","Contributions to Methodology","Spirituality","Bibliography","Further reading","References and notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Jan_Swammerdam.jpg/150px-Jan_Swammerdam.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Illustration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Swammerdam_frog_thigh.PNG/220px-Swammerdam_frog_thigh.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["epigenesis","biology"]],"members":["epigenesis","egg"],"related":["The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr._Nicolaes_Tulp","Amsterdam","Netherlands","Entomology","University_of_Leiden","Entomology","Antoinette_Bourignon","Amsterdam","Netherlands","Insects","Egg_(biology)","Larva","Pupa","Muscle_contraction","Red_blood_cell","Microscope","Oude_Kerk","Apothecary","Minerals","Fossils","Insects","University_of_Leiden","Issy","Saumur","Melchisédech_Thévenot","Flemish_people","Mysticism","Antoinette_Bourignon","Niels_Stensen","Herman_Boerhaave","Anton_Leeuwenhoek","Rembrandt","Aristotle","Fish","Reptiles","Mammals","Metamorphosis","Caterpillar","Butterfly","William_Harvey","Dragonflies","Mayflies","Ecdysis","Epigenesis_(biology)","Ovaries","Beekeeping","Bees","Wasps","Ants","Dragonflies","Snails","Worm","Butterflies","Entomology","Nerve","Muscle","Nerve-muscle_preparation","Circulatory_system","Muscle_contraction","Balloonist_theory","Galen","René_Descartes","Hydraulics","Reflex","Brain_ventricle","Neuroscience","Insects","Anatomy","Metamorphosis","Spontaneous_generation","Antoinette_Bourignon","Amsterdam"]}
