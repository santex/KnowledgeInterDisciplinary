{"cursor":"4535","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nA 'polyolefin' is a polymer produced from a simple olefin (also called an alkene\nwith the general formula C nH 2n ) as a monomer. For example,\npolyethylene is the polyolefin produced by polymerizing the olefin ethylene. An\nequivalent term is 'polyalkene'; this is a more modern term, although polyolefin\nis still used in the petrochemical industry. Polypropylene is another common\npolyolefin which is made from the olefin propylene.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Polyolefin","recorded":1362891590,"links":29,"instances":["company"],"pdf":["http://www.nicnas.gov.au/publications/car/new/plc/plc0200fr/plc210fr.pdf"],"categories":["Plastics","Polyolefins|"],"headings":["Industrial polyolefins","Properties","Uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Gateway-Tracing-Paper.jpg/220px-Gateway-Tracing-Paper.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/1-Hexene.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["head","company"]],"members":["head"],"related":["Polymer","Olefin","Alkene","Monomer","Polyethylene","Ethylene","Petrochemical","Polypropylene","Propylene","Thermoplastic","Polyethylene","Polypropylene","Polymethylpentene","Polybutene-1","Elastomer","Polyisobutylene","Ethylene_propylene_rubber","EPDM_rubber","Alpha-olefin","Double_bond","Molecule","Polymer","Alkyl","Functional_group","1-Hexene","Chemical_structure","Chemical_structure","Molecule","Viscous","Temperature","Lubricant","Synthetic_oil","Polyethylene","Copolymer","1-Hexene","1-octene","Methyl","Polypropylene","Blown_film","Heatshrink","Flexible_foam","Crocs","Polyalphaolefin","Head_(company)","Tennis_racket","HEPA_filter","Aerosol"]}
