{"cursor":"4614","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Achdiat Karta Mihardja' (March 6, 1911 â July 8, 2010) was an Indonesian\nauthor, novelist and playwright. He is best known for his novel, [[Atheis]],\nwhich was published in 1949. Atheis is considered one of Indonesia's most\nimportant literary works following World War II.\n\nMihardja was born on March 6, 1911, in Garut, West Java. His father, a bank\nmanager, had a collection of books which Mihardja credited with sparking his\ninterest in literature. Mihardja worked as a journalist early in\nhis career. In 1949, he published his most important work, Atheist, which\ncentered on a Muslim man from West Java, Hasan, and his relationship with his\nfriends, who had been influenced by foreign ideas, such as Marxism. The\nmanuscript can be found in the H.B. Jassin Library of Indonesian literature at\nTaman Ismail Marzuki cultural centre in central Jakarta. See Desi Anwar, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/columns/desi-anwar-lost-for-\nwords/541557 Desi Anwar: Lost for Words'], The Jakarta Globe, 1 September\n2012. The book is considered as one of Indonesia's most important modern\nliterary works. The story of the book, and some details of the film that was\nbased on it, are at Olin Monteiro, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/blogs/rethinking-atheism-through-an-\nindonesian-filmmakers-lens/507439 Rethinking Atheism Through an Indonesian\nFilmaker's Lens'],The Jakarta Globe, 27 March 2012. Atheist'' was later\nadapted into a 1974 film, which was directed by Sjumandjaja and co-starred\nChristine Hakim and Deddy Sutomo. Mihardja was a recipient on Indonesia's\nnational literary award in 1956 for his work.\n\nMihardja helped to found Lekra, an Indonesian writers' organization tied to the\nCommunist Party of Indonesia, in 1950. Though rumors persisted, he denied that\nhe was an atheist. Mihardja was a member of the Socialist Party of Indonesia,\nwhich was banned in 1960 by his friend, President Sukarno. He would later speak\nabout his relationship with Sukarno, \"We were best friends but not in terms of\nideology...Worse, out of the blue he banned my party.\"\n\nIn 1961 Mihardja became a professor Indonesian literature and language at\nAustralian National University on invitation from the university. He ultimately\nchose to settle in Canberra in Australia in the 1960s where he lived for more\nthan 40 years. However he continued to receive recognitions for his work in\nIndonesia. He was awarded Indonesia's arts award in 1971.\n\nHis last visit to Indonesia was in June 2005. The visit was to promote the\nrelease of Manifesto Khalifatullah, a follow-up novel to Atheist which went on\nsale on June 7, 2005. Mihardja described Manifesto Khalifatullah as his answer\nto issues raised in Atheist. He described the main message of the 2005 novel as\n\"God made man to be His representative on earth, not that of Satan.\" In 2009\nMihardja expressed an interest in writing his autobiography but he was unable to\ncomplete this work.\n\nAchdiat Karta Mihardja suffered a stroke in July 2010. He died of complications\nin Canberra on July 8, 2010 at the age of 99. He was survived by his wife, Tati\nSuprapti Noor, and four children. He was buried in Canberra on the same\nday.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","recorded":1375086678,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Indonesia","/wiki/Author","/wiki/Novelist","/wiki/Playwright","/wiki/Atheis","/wiki/World_War_II","#cite_note-jp-1","/wiki/Garut","/wiki/West_Java","#cite_note-jp-1","/wiki/Muslim","/wiki/West_Java","/wiki/Marxism","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Atheis_(film)","/wiki/Sjumandjaja","/wiki/Christine_Hakim","/w/index.php?title=Deddy_Sutomo&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-jp-1","/wiki/Lekra","/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Indonesia","/wiki/Atheist","/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Indonesia","/wiki/Sukarno","/wiki/Ideology","#cite_note-jp-1","/wiki/Indonesian_literature","/wiki/Australian_National_University","/wiki/Canberra","#cite_note-jp-1","#cite_note-jp-1","/wiki/Stroke","#cite_note-jp-1","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-jp_1-0","#cite_ref-jp_1-1","#cite_ref-jp_1-2","#cite_ref-jp_1-3","#cite_ref-jp_1-4","#cite_ref-jp_1-5","#cite_ref-jp_1-6","http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/09/obituary-%E2%80%98atheist%E2%80%99-writer-laid-rest-canberra.html","/wiki/Jakarta_Post","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/H.B._Jassin","/wiki/Taman_Ismail_Marzuki","http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/columns/desi-anwar-lost-for-words/541557","#cite_ref-3","http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/blogs/rethinking-atheism-through-an-indonesian-filmmakers-lens/507439","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/1341562","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&oldid=547771004","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1911_births","/wiki/Category:2010_deaths","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_novelists","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_dramatists_and_playwrights","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_journalists","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_writers","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_academics","/wiki/Category:Australian_National_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:People_from_Canberra","/wiki/Category:People_from_Garut","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_expatriates_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:Sundanese_people","/wiki/Category:Indonesian_emigrants_to_Australia","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Achdiat+Karta+Mihardja&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Achdiat+Karta+Mihardja","/wiki/Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","/wiki/Talk:Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","#","/wiki/Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&oldid=547771004","/w/index.php?title=Achdiat_Karta_Mihardja&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4252037","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&p
