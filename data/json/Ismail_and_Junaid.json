The lyrics of the song\nare based on poetry by the famous Pashtun poet, Ameer Hamza Khan\nShinwari.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Ismail_and_Junaid","recorded":1375081293,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Peshawar","/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","/wiki/Pakistan","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Pashto_music","/wiki/Peshawar","/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","/wiki/Pakistan","#cite_note-et-1","/wiki/Lead_vocalist","/wiki/Poet","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Guitarist","/wiki/Supporting_vocalist","/wiki/Charsadda","#cite_note-voice_of_change-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Lahore_University_of_Management_Sciences","/wiki/Pashto_language","/wiki/YouTube","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-et-1","#cite_note-pakium-5","/wiki/Jal_(band)","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Rubab_(instrument)","/wiki/Sufi_music","/wiki/Folk_music_of_Pakistan","#cite_note-voice_of_change-2","/wiki/Voice_of_America","/wiki/National_Public_Radio","/wiki/Pashtun_culture","#cite_note-et-1","/wiki/Ameer_Hamza_Khan_Shinwari","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)","/wiki/Tourism_Corporation_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","/wiki/Pashtun_diaspora","/wiki/Express_Tribune","#cite_note-et-1","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-et_1-0","#cite_ref-et_1-1","#cite_ref-et_1-2","#cite_ref-et_1-3","http://tribune.com.pk/story/405422/ij-shake-up-the-pashto-music-scene/","/wiki/Express_Tribune","#cite_ref-voice_of_change_2-0","#cite_ref-voice_of_change_2-1","http://dawn.com/2011/04/17/rising-stars-the-voice-of-change/","#cite_ref-3","http://www.pakmediarevolution.net/2010/06/audio-ismail-junaid-qarar-pmr-exclusive/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyabVj_EQKk","/wiki/YouTube","#cite_ref-pakium_5-0","http://www.pakium.com/2011/05/05/interview-with-peshawar-based-duo-ismail-and-junaid","#cite_ref-6","http://pakmusic.net/video-ranra-ismail-junaid","#cite_ref-7","http://www.pakium.com/2011/07/06/ismail-and-junaid-ranra-music-video-mp3-download-lyrics","#cite_ref-8","http://dawn.com/2011/10/09/in-the-loop-catching-up-with-ismail-and-junaid/","#cite_ref-9","http://tribune.com.pk/story/552382/for-ismail-and-junaid-revival-of-pashtun-culture-comes-first/","#cite_ref-10","http://epaper.dawn.com/~epaper/DetailImage.php?StoryImage=05_02_2012_422_002","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit&section=3","http://www.facebook.com/ismailandjunaid","/wiki/Facebook","http://www.reverbnation.com/ismailandjunaid","/wiki/ReverbNation.com","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&oldid=557569846","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Musical_duos","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_from_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa","/wiki/Category:Pakistani_boy_bands","/wiki/Category:Pakistani_musical_duos","/wiki/Category:Pashtun_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Peshawar","/wiki/Category:Pakistani_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:Pashto-language_singers","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_2010","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ismail+and+Junaid&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ismail+and+Junaid","/wiki/Ismail_and_Junaid","/wiki/Talk:Ismail_and_Junaid","#","/wiki/Ismail_and_Junaid","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ismail_and_Junaid&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ismail_and_Junaid","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ismail_and_Junaid","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/
