{"cursor":"8140","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biochemistry, 'chemosynthesis' is the biological conversion of one or more\ncarbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients into organic\nmatter using the oxidation of inorganic molecules (e.g. hydrogen gas, hydrogen\nsulfide) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as in\nphotosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs, organisms that obtain carbon through\nchemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but groups that include\nconspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing\ngamma and epsilon proteobacteria, the Aquificaeles, the methanogenic archaea and\nthe neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria. '' gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen\ngas.]] Many microorganisms in dark regions of the oceans also use chemosynthesis\nto produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be\ndistinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H 2) are\navailable, the energy available from the reaction between CO 2 and\nH 2 (leading to production of methane, CH 4) can be large\nenough to drive the production of biomass. Alternatively, in most oceanic\nenvironments, energy for chemosynthesis derives from reactions in which\nsubstances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are oxidized. This may occur with\nor without the presence of oxygen.\n\nMany chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean,\nand symbiotic associations between chemosynthesizers and respiring heterotrophs\nare quite common. Large populations of animals can be supported by\nchemosynthetic secondary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates,\ncold seeps, whale falls, and isolated cave water.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface\nof Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and other planets.
