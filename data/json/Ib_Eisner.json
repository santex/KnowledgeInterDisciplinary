{"cursor":"3343","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ib Eisner' (19 May 1925 in Copenhagen, Denmark â 7 April 2003 in Frederiksberg,\nDenmark) was a Danish artist.\n\nHis artistic career started in 1945 with entering the Copenhagen Academy of\nArts, where he studied in the classes of the Professors KrÃ¦sten Iversen (1886-\n1955), Olaf Rude (1886-1957) and Axel JÃ¸rgensen (1890-1963).\n\nIn the early fifties he discovered characteristic motif cycles, which were to\ninfluence all of his work. From then on he mostly devoted himself to painting\nscenes from his immediate surroundings, which he transferred directly onto\ncanvas on site. Eisner showed particular interest in the long-established Danish\nforest park \"Dyrehaven\", which offered the painter a wide repertoire of motifs\nfor years. He also was interested in motifs of the popular amusement parks\n\"Tivoli\" and \"Bakken\" as well as in scenes from his personal surroundings in\nFrederiksberg and views of the island of Bornholm. Other pictographic themes\nwhich were constant factors in Eisner's paintings are still life and the Danish\ntraditional \"Sankt Hans Fire\".\n\nIb Eisner worked mostly in picture series to explore the nuances of changes of\nlighting moods and seasons. French Impressionist theme and composition\ntechniques are noticeable not only in his preferred method of operation, the plein-\nair painting, which from this point on the artist applied in all weather\nconditions, but also in the treatment and application of colour. These alternate\nbetween the fluent, almost sketchy application of colour with thinned oil paints\nand a paste-like, relieflike flow, deliberately trying to reveal the artistic\nfacture. Eisner applied pure, mostly unmixed colours next to each other in quick\nbrushstrokes, creating a vibrant structure of bright tones and developing an\noriginal picture-intrinsic dynamic. He painted mostly without fixed contour\nlines or preparatory drawings, since the capturing of elusive lighting effects\nrequired swift work. With these painting tools, the artist created a unique\natmosphere characteristic to each picture.\n\nIb Eisner's works were purchased by art associations for the promotion of fine\narts as well as banks and companies in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and by private\ncollectors. His international recognition is evident through the sale of his\npaintings to Germany, Sweden, Japan, Great Britain and the United States.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Ib_Eisner","recorded":1375068668,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Copenhagen","/wiki/Denmark","/wiki/Frederiksberg","/wiki/Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Art","/wiki/Tivoli_Gardens","/wiki/Dyrehavsbakken","/wiki/Bornholm","/wiki/Still_life","/wiki/Midsummer","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=edit&section=2","http://www.ibeisner.com","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/47877661","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&oldid=544270437","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1925_births","/wiki/Category:2003_deaths","/wiki/Category:Danish_artists","/wiki/Category:Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Fine_Arts_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ib+Eisner&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ib+Eisner","/wiki/Ib_Eisner","/wiki/Talk:Ib_Eisner","#","/wiki/Ib_Eisner","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ib_Eisner","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ib_Eisner","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&oldid=544270437","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1655730","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ib_Eisner&id=544270437","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ib+Eisner","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ib+Eisner&oldid=544270437&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ib_Eisner&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ib_Eisner","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ib_Eisner","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1655730#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ib_Eisner","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1925 births","2003 deaths","Danish artists","Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni"],"headings":["Literature","External links"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Copenhagen","Denmark","Frederiksberg","Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Art","Tivoli_Gardens","Dyrehavsbakken","Bornholm","Still_life","Midsummer"]}
