The\nEvert family was of German aristocratic origin, and they were philhellenes (i.e.\nlovers of Greek culture) who permanently settled in Greece in the late 19th\ncentury and eventually took Greek citizenship. After Law studies in the\nUniversity of Athens, Angelos Evert joined the Gendarmerie as an officer in\nSeptember 1915. He was transferred to the Cities Police in 1929, and became\nPolice Commissioner of the Athens branch in September 1941, a few months after\nthe country was overrun by the Germans.\n\nOver the next few years he was active in several fronts, supporting the\nResistance and maintaining contacts with the Greek government in exile at Cairo,\nall the while cooperating with the German occupation authorities in the hunting\nof communists. He also participated in the rescue of several Jewish families\nfrom Athens, for which he was later honoured as a \"Righteous among the Nations\".\nOn 3 December 1944, his policemen opened fire on a large pro EAM demonstration\nin central Athens, triggering the [[Dekemvriana]] clashes.\n\nHe served as Chief of the Cities Police from 1951 until he was dismissed on 31\nJanuary 1955. He died of heart failure on 30 December 1970. His son, Miltiadis\nEvert, became a politician with the conservative New Democracy party, and served\nas Mayor of Athens in 1987â1989 and chairman of New Democracy in
