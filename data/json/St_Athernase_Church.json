It remains in use as a Church of Scotland parish church and the\ncurrent minister (since 2003) is the Reverend Caroline Taylor.\n\nThe chancel and half-round apse date from the 12th century with the exterior\nfeaturing blind arcades with typical Norman arches. The church, dedicated to the\nlittle known St Athernase, was granted by Ness, Lord of Lochore, to the canons\nof St Andrews in 1185. Around 1700 a belfry was added, and in 1858 restoration\nwas carried out to the nave.\n\nThe church is open to the public in summer, at other times by arrangement.\nRelics preserved inside include part of a 9th-century cross-slab found near the\nvillage (closely comparable to the large collection at St Andrews Cathedral),\nand three elaborate 16th century memorial stones of the Bruces of Earlshall, the\nlocal lairds. One of the latter shows a full length figure of a woman, naÃ¯ve in\nexecution, but valuable in documenting contemporary dress.\n\nThe oft-mentioned dedication of the medieval church of Leuchars to St Athernase\nis actually an error. It arises from a nineteenth-century misreading of a list\nof church dedications in the Register of St Andrews Priory, a medieval\nmanuscript now in the National Archives of Scotland. Folio 155v. has a list of\nchurches dedicated, or re-dedicated, by bishop David de Bernham of St Andrews in\nthe 1240s. The eighth church in this list is 'ecclesia sancti Johannis\neuangeliste et sancti Athernisci confessoris de Losceresch (the church of St\nJohn the evangelist and St Athernase the confessor). However the church of\nLosceresch is not the church of Leuchars, which in medieval sources is spelt\nLochris, Locres etc., but the parish church of Lathrisk (now Kettle parish in\nFife), whose early spellings are Losresc (1170s), Loseresch, Losseresc (1227)\nand such like. Athernase is the patron saint not of Leuchars but of Lathrisk.\n\nThe patron of Leuchars is not known for certain, but some medieval sources\nindicate a local cult of St Bonoc, a name unknown outside the parish of\nLeuchars, and a chapel of St Bonoc, complete with chaplain, is known to\nhave existed.\n\n\"Athernase\" is probably an anglicised form of the name ItharnÃ¡n, found also in\nFife at Kilrenny, and on the Isle of May, an Irish missionary who \"died among\nthe Picts\" in 669 according to the Annals of Ulster.\n\nLocation: Schoolhill, Leuchars, by St Andrews
