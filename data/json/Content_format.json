Content formats\n are used in recording and transmission to prepare data for observation or\n interpretation. Bob Boiko, Content Management Bible, Nov 2004 pp:79, 240,\n 830 Ann Rockley, Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content\n Strategy, Oct 2002 pp:269, 320, 516 This includes both analog and\n digitized content. Content formats may be recorded and read by either natural\n or manufactured tools and mechanisms.\n\nIn addition to converting data to information, a content format may include the\nencryption and/or scrambling of that information. Jessica Keyes, Technology\nTrendlines, Jul 1995 pp:201 Multiple content formats may be contained\nwithin a single section of a storage medium (e.g. track, disk sector, computer\nfile, document, page, column) or transmitted via a single channel (e.g. wire,\ncarrier wave) of a transmission medium. With multimedia, multiple tracks\ncontaining multiple content formats are presented simultaneously. Content\nformats may either be recorded in secondary signal processing methods such as a\nsoftware container format (e.g. digital audio, digital video) or recorded in the\nprimary format (e.g. spectrogram, pictogram).\n\nObservable data is often known as raw data, or raw content. Oge Marques and\nBorko Furht, Content-Based Image and Video Retrieval, April 2002 pp:15 A\nprimary raw content format may be directly observable (e.g. image, sound,\nmotion, smell, sensation) or physical data which only requires hardware to\ndisplay it, such as a phonographic needle and diaphragm or a projector lamp and\nmagnifying glass.\n\nThere has been a countless number of content formats throughout history. The\nfollowing are examples of some common content formats and content format\ncategories (covering: sensory experience, model, and language used for encoding\ninformation): {| width=\"65%\"\n|- valign=top\n|width=\"50%\"| *Audio data encoding David Austerberry, The Technology of\nVideo and Audio Streaming, Second Edition, Sep 2004 pp: 328 **Analog audio\ndata **Stereophonic sound formats **Digital audio data **Audio data compression\n**Synthesizer sequences *Visual data encoding **Hand rendering materials **Film\nspeed formats **Pixel coordinates data **Color space data **Vector graphic\ncoordinates/dimensions **Texture mapping formats **3D display formats\n**Holographic formats **Display resolution formatting *Motion graphics encoding\n**Frame rate data **Video data M.
