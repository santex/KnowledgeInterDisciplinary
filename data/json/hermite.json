One of his students\nwas Henri Poincaré.\n\nHe was the first to prove that ''e'', the base of natural logarithms, is a\ntranscendental number. His methods were later used by Ferdinand von Lindemann to\nprove that π is transcendental.\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Stieltjes in 1893, Hermite famously remarked: \"I turn with\nterror and horror from this lamentable scourge of continuous functions with no\nderivatives.\"\n","title":"Charles%20Hermite","headings":["Life","Contribution to mathematics","Publications","Quotations","See also","References","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Dieuze","3: Paris","3: Sorbonne","3: Thomas_Joannes_Stieltjes","3: Transcendental_number","2: Moselle","2: Ãcole_Polytechnique","2: CollÃ¨ge_Henri_IV","2: Henri_PoincarÃ©","2: Hermitian_operator","2: Hermite_polynomials","2: France","2: Mathematician","2: Number_theory","2: Elliptic_function","2: Hermite_interpolation","2: Natural_logarithm","2: Ferdinand_von_Lindemann","2: Pi","2: Ãmile_Picard","2: Internet_Archive","1: French_people","1: Mathematics","1: CollÃ¨ge_Louis-le-Grand","1: LÃ©on_Charve","1: Henri_PadÃ©","1: Mihailo_PetroviÄ","1: Jules_Tannery","1: Hermitian_adjoint","1: Hermitian_form","1: Hermitian_function","1: Hermitian_matrix","1: Hermitian_metric","1: Hermitian_transpose","1: Hermitian_wavelet","1: Quadratic_form","1: Invariant_theory","1: Orthogonal_polynomials","1: Algebra","1: Hermite_normal_form","1: Cubic_Hermite_spline","1: Weierstrass_function","1: Nancy-UniversitÃ©","1: LycÃ©e_Louis-le-Grand","1: EugÃ¨ne_Charles_Catalan","1: Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Niels_Henrik_Abel","1: Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi","1: Abelian_variety","1: Elliptic_functions","1: Joseph_Bertrand","1: Joseph_Liouville","1: BaccalaurÃ©at","1: Augustin-Louis_Cauchy","1: Jacques_Philippe_Marie_Binet","1: AcadÃ©mie_des_Sciences","1: Jean-Marie_Duhamel","1: Faculty_of_Sciences_of_Paris","1: Ãcole_Normale_SupÃ©rieure","1: LÃ©gion_d'honneur","1: Pure_mathematics","1: Abelian_function","1: Cambridge_University_Press","1: List_of_things_named_after_Charles_Hermite","1: Hermitian_manifold","1: Hermite's_cotangent_identity","1: Hermite_reciprocity","1: Ramanujan's_constant"]}
