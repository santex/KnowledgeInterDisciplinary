{"cursor":"8837","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The names 'Alice and Bob' are two commonly used placeholder names. They are used\nfor archetypal characters in fields such as cryptography and physics.\nThe names are used for convenience; for example, \"Alice sends a message to Bob\nencrypted with his public key\" is easier to follow than \"Party A sends a message\nto Party B encrypted by Party B's public key.\" Following the alphabet, the\nspecific names have evolved into common parlance within these fieldsâhelping\ntechnical topics to be explained in a more understandable fashion.\n\nIn cryptography and computer security, there are a number of widely used names\nfor the participants in discussions and presentations about various protocols.\nThe names are conventional, somewhat self-suggestive, sometimes humorous, and\neffectively act as metasyntactic variables.\n\nIn typical implementations of these protocols, it is understood that the actions\nattributed to characters such as Alice or Bob need not always be carried out by\nhuman parties directly, but also by a trusted automated agent (such as a\ncomputer program) on their behalf.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Alice_and_Bob","recorded":1362566150,"links":30,"instances":["fantasy","cryptography","algorithm","wizard"],"pdf":["http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf"],"categories":["Cryptographic protocols","Placeholder names"],"headings":["List of characters","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Public_key_shared_secret.svg/220px-Public_key_shared_secret.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Asymetric_cryptography_-_step_2.svg/220px-Asymetric_cryptography_-_step_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","cryptography"],["rsa","algorithm"],["merlin","wizard"],["wizard","fantasy"]],"members":["wizard","protocol","rsa","merlin"],"related":["Placeholder_name","Cryptography","Physics","Cryptography","Computer_security","Protocol_(cryptography)","Metasyntactic_variable","Bruce_Schneier","Ron_Rivest","RSA_(algorithm)","Quantum_cryptography","Man-in-the-middle_attack","Zero-knowledge_proof","Trusted_Third_Party","Interactive_proof_system","Merlin_(wizard)","Wizard_(fantasy)","King_Arthur","Complexity_class","Arthur–Merlin_protocol","Twenty_Questions","Paul_Erdős","Anagram","Combinatorial_game_theory","Metasyntactic_variable","Placeholder_name","Bruce_Schneier","Charles_L._Perkins","Brian_LaMacchia","Shlomi_Dolev","Quantum_Computing"]}
