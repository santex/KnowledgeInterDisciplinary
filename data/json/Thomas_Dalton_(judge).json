{"cursor":"2799","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Thomas Dalton' (died 1730) was an English judge who became Chief Baron of the\nIrish Exchequer.\n\nDalton was born in Hampshire, eldest son of the Reverend Peter Dalton; his\nmother is said to have belonged to the Dublin family of Dominick, who gave their\nname to Dominick Street, in which case Sir Christopher Dominick (died 1743) who\nbegan laying out the street, was probably a first cousin. He graduated from\nQueen's College, Oxford in 1702 and became a fellow of All Souls' College in\n1706. He was called to the Bar in 1711. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Chief\nBaron of the Irish Exchequer and held office until his death in 1730, aged about\nfifty-five. He was buried in St Andrew's Church, Dublin.\n\nAccording to Elrington Ball, during his academic career he had a reputation for\npride and arrogance; enemies called him a proud empty [[Whig (British political\nparty)|Whig]], who offended many by throwing a celebration dinner on each\nanniversary of the execution of Charles I of England. However he earned a good\nreputation as Chief Baron and after his premature death tributes were paid in\nverse to him as a \" learned and unbiased judge.\" Ball, F. Elrington The\nJudges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926\n\nDalton's high reputation in Ireland is confirmed by a letter written by Hugh\nBoulter, the influential Archbishop of Armagh, who was consulted on all judicial\nappointments. Richard West, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, died suddenly at the\nend of 1726. Boulter wrote to the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Granville, recommending\nThomas Wyndham, who was successful in obtaining the office. If Wyndham was\nunsuitable for any reason, the Archbishop recommended Dalton, as \" having a very\ngood character here, and being well skilled in the affairs of\nIreland.\" O'Flanagan J.
