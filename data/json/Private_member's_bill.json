{"cursor":"19540","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'member of parliamentâs legislative [[Motion (parliamentary\nprocedure)|motion]]', called a 'private member's bill' or a 'member's bill' in\nsome parliaments, [http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/billgui-\ndance/gpb-1.htm#32 Part 3 Members' Bills] www.scottish.parliament.uk, accessed 1\nAugust 2009 is a proposed law introduced by a member of a legislature who\nis not acting on behalf of the executive government. In most countries with a\nparliamentary system, most bills are proposed by the government. In the United\nStates and other countries in which the executive is formally separated from the\nlegislature, there is no mechanism for the executive government to directly\nintroduce its own legislative proposals, and members of the executive are not\npart of the legislature. All bills are simply introduced by members of the\nlegislature, and the concept of the private member's bill does not apply.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and other countries that follow the Westminster System\nsuch as Canada and New Zealand, an individual member of parliament (MP) who is\nnot a Government minister is called a private member (of parliament) (or\n[[backbencher]]) and therefore such an MP's legislative motion is called a\nprivate member's bill. The MP who introduces a legislative motion can be a\nmember of a party represented in the government (cabinet) or in the\nopposition. It can also be introduced by a crossbencher. Usually, in such\ncountries, the overwhelming majority of bills introduced are proposed by\nmembers of the cabinet, and most of the legislature's time is spent dealing\nwith such bills, which are called \"Government bills\". However, some\nparliamentary time is regularly set aside so that backbenchers and\ncrossbenchers may also introduce bills.\n\nA private member's bill is not to be confused with a private bill, which is a\nbill that only affects an individual citizen or group.\n\nThe United Kingdom parliament has a long history of enacting private member's\nbills. In contrast, the Oireachtas (parliament) of the Republic of Ireland\nrarely passes private members' bills, with the overwhelming number of bills\nbeing passed being introduced by members of the cabinet.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Private_member's_bill","recorded":1375071086,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Private_bill","/wiki/Private_law","/wiki/Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)","/wiki/Parliament","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Legislature","/wiki/Parliamentary_system","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Westminster_System","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Member_of_parliament","/wiki/Backbencher","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Opposition_(parliamentary)","/wiki/Crossbencher","/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)","/wiki/Cabinet_(government)","/wiki/Private_bill","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Oireachtas","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#Private_member.27s_bill_by_country","#Australia","#Canada","#Passed","#India","#New_Zealand","#Norway","#United_Kingdom","#House_of_Commons_procedure","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Compulsory_voting","/wiki/Tasmania","/wiki/Herbert_Payne","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Euthanasia","/wiki/Kevin_Andrews_(Australian_politician)","/wiki/Northern_Territory_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Rights_of_the_Terminally_Ill_Act_1995","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Conscience_vote","/wiki/Alan_Corbett","/wiki/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Child_protection","/wiki/Paediatric","/wiki/John_Yu","/wiki/Royal_Alexandra_Hospital_for_Children","/wiki/Sydney","/wiki/Australian_Government","/wiki/Australian_of_the_Year","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_Parliamentary_Review","#cite_note-Lever-4","/wiki/Minority_governments_in_Canada","#cite_note-The_Toronto_Star-5","/wiki/Riding_(country_subdivision)#Canada","/wiki/Prorogation_in_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-Parliament_of_Canada-6","/wiki/Trans-Canada_Airlines","/wiki/Air_Canada","/wiki/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-Parliament_of_Canada-6","/wiki/Minority_governments_in_Canada","#cite_note-The_Toronto_Star-5","/wiki/Canadian_Parliamentary_Review","#cite_note-Lever-4","/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_of_Canada","/wiki/Lynn_McDonald","/wiki/Royal_Assent","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Free_vote","#cite_note-Lever-4","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Lok_Sabha","#cite_note-Sify-10","#cite_note-PRS-Rohit-11","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/New_Zealand","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Parliament_of_Norway","/wiki/Norwegian_language","#cite_note-stortingetPQR-13","#cite_note-Representantforslag-14","/wiki/Cabinet_of_Norway","#cite_note-stortingetPQR-13","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Private_Members%27_Bills_in_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Ballot","/wiki/Ten_Minute_Rule","/wiki/Lobbying","/wiki/Filibuster","/wiki/Abortion_Act_1967","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/David_Steel","/wiki/Home_Secretary","/wiki/Roy_Jenkins","/w/index.php?title=Adoption_Act_1964&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Murder_(Abolition_of_Death_Penalty)_Act_1965","/wiki/Charter_Trustees","/wiki/Law_Reform_(Year_and_a_Day_Rule)_Act_1996","/wiki/Knives_Act_1997","/w/index.php?title=British_Nationality_(Hong_Kong)_Act_1997&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Female_Genital_Mutilation_Act_2003","/wiki/Gangmasters_(Licensing)_Act_2004","/wiki/Sustainable_Communities_Act","/w/index.php?title=Private_member%27s_bill&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament#Procedure","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Minister_(government)","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Talked_out","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Order_paper","/wiki/Sta
