{"cursor":"12752","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Non-volatile memory', 'nonvolatile memory', 'NVM' or 'non-volatile storage' is\ncomputer memory that can retain stored information even when not powered.\nExamples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory, flash memory,\nferroelectric RAM (F-RAM), most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g.\nhard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape), optical discs, and early computer\nstorage methods such as paper tape and punched cards.\n\nNon-volatile memory is typically used for the task of secondary storage, or long-\nterm persistent storage. The most widely used form of primary storage today is a\nvolatile form of random access memory (RAM), meaning that when the computer is\nshut down, anything contained in RAM is lost. Unfortunately, most forms of non-\nvolatile memory have limitations that make them unsuitable for use as primary\nstorage. Typically, non-volatile memory either costs more or performs worse than\nvolatile random access memory.\n\nSeveral companies are working on developing non-volatile memory systems\ncomparable in speed and capacity to volatile RAM. IBM is currently developing\nMRAM (Magnetoresistive RAM). Not only would such technology save energy, but it\nwould allow for computers that could be turned on and off almost instantly,\nbypassing the slow start-up and shutdown sequence. In addition, Ramtron\nInternational has developed, produced, and licensed ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM), a\ntechnology that offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory\noptions, including extremely high endurance (exceeding\n10 16 for 3.3Â V devices), ultra low power\nconsumption (since F-RAM does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile\nmemories), single-cycle write speeds, and gamma radiation tolerance. Other\ncompanies that have licensed and produced F-RAM technology include Texas\nInstruments, Rohm, and Fujitsu.\n\nNon-volatile data storage can be categorized in electrically addressed systems\n(read-only memory) and mechanically addressed systems (hard disks, optical disc,\nmagnetic tape, holographic memory, and such). Electrically addressed systems are\nexpensive, but fast, whereas mechanically addressed systems have a low price per\nbit, but are slow. Non-volatile memory may one day eliminate the need for\ncomparatively slow forms of secondary storage systems, which include hard disks.\n","linknr":260,"url":"Non-volatile_memory","recorded":1362671086,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf","http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/7F878B7F4496E2B686257061007D3C30/$file/HGST_3K8_091506.pdf","http://www.hynix.com/datasheet/pdf/flash/HY27UH08AG(5_D)M%20(Rev0.6).pdf","http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/12128_div/12128_div.pdf","http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/data_sheet/MR2A16A.pdf"],"categories":["Computer memory","Computer storage","Non-volatile memory|"],"headings":["Electrically addressed","Mechanically addressed systems","Organic","Specifications","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computer_memory","Read-only_memory","Flash_memory","Ferroelectric_RAM","Computer_data_storage","Hard_disk","Floppy_disk","Magnetic_tape","Optical_disc","Paper_tape","Punched_card","Random_access_memory","MRAM","Ramtron_International","Ferroelectric_RAM","Texas_Instruments","Rohm","Fujitsu","Read-only_memory","Hard_disk","Optical_disc","Magnetic_tape","Holographic_memory","Mask_ROM","Programmable_read-only_memory","EPROM","EEPROM","Floating_gate_transistor","Digital_camera","BIOS","Random-access_memory","Dynamic_Random_Access_Memory","Dielectric","Magnetic_tunnel_junctions","Freescale_Semiconductor","Thermal_Assisted_Switching","Crocus_Technology","Spin_Torque_Transfer","Crocus_Technology","Hynix","IBM","Magnetic_tape","Hard_disk","Optical_disc","Printed_electronics","Ferroelectric_memory","Thin_Film_Electronics_ASA","Ferroelectric_polymers","Roll-to-roll","Printed_electronics","Thin_Film_Electronics_ASA","Ferroelectricity","Ferroelectric_capacitor","Ferroelectric_RAM","Flash_memory","Blu-ray_Disc"]}
