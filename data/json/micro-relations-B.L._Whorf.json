This principle has frequently been called the \"SapirâWhorf\nhypothesis\", after him and his mentor Edward Sapir, but Whorf called it the\nprinciple of linguistic relativity, because he saw the idea as having\nimplications similar to Einstein's principle of physical relativity.\n\nThroughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young\nman he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to\nthe study of Biblical Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous\nlanguages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by\nhis work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in\nMexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the\nlanguage at linguistic conferences. This led him to begin studying linguistics\nwith Edward Sapir at Yale University while still maintaining his day job at the\nHartford Fire Insurance Company. During his time at Yale he worked on the\ndescription of the Hopi language, and the historical linguistics of the Uto-\nAztecan languages, publishing many influential papers in professional journals.\nHe was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938.\nWhorf taught his seminar on \"Problems of American Indian Linguistics\". In\naddition to his well known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar\nsketch of Hopi and studies of Nahuatl dialects, proposed a deciphering of Maya\nhieroglyphic writing, and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction\nof Uto-Aztecan.\n\nAfter his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist\nfriends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation\nbetween language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published\nposthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views\nfell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who\nconsidered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather\nthan cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and\npoorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood\ndata. In the late 20th century, interest in Whorf's ideas experienced a\nresurgence, and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works,\narguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's\nactual ideas, or had attributed him ideas he had never expressed. The field of\nlinguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in\npsycholinguistics and linguistic anthropology, and continues to generate debate\nand controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism.\nBy comparison Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such\nconcepts as the allophone and the cryptotype, and the formulation of \"Whorf's\nlaw\" in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.\n","linknr":1022,"url":"B.L._Whorf","recorded":1362480866,"links":46,"instances":["grammar","perception","psychologist","linguistics","linguistics","philosopher","aspect"],"pdf":["http://www.henrysweet.org/lee_nov1997.pdf","http://www.henrysweet.org/lee_nov1997.pdf","http://users.utu.fi/freder/Pullum-Eskimo-VocabHoax.pdf","http://users.utu.fi/freder/Pullum-Eskimo-VocabHoax.pdf"],"categories":["1897
