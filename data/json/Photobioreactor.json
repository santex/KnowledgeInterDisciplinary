Also, an open pond could be seen as photobioreactor, but mostly the\nterm photobioreactor only refers to closed systems, systems closed to the\nenvironment having no direct exchange of gases and contaminants with the\nenvironment. Nowadays, some extremophilic organisms (organisms that\ncan grow under extreme conditions) are grown into open ponds. However, many\nother microalgae are promising for the production of an enormous variety of\ncompounds. To cultivate also these algae and their products,\nmonocultures have to be maintained and for that, enclosed photobioreactors have\nto be used. A photobioreactor can be\ndescribed as an enclosed, illuminated culture vessel designed for\ncontrolled biomass production of phototrophic liquid cell suspension cultures.\nPhotobioreactors, despite their costs, have several major advantages over open\nsystems. They can :\n* prevent or minimize contamination, permitting cultivating of axenic algal\n  monocultures (culture consisting of only one species of microalgae),\n* offer better control over biocultural conditions (pH, light intensity, carbon\n  dioxide, temperature).\n* prevent water evaporation,\n* lower carbon dioxide losses due to out gassing,\n* permit higher cell concentrations.\n* permit the production of complex biopharmaceuticals, e.g. in knockout mosses,\n  under GMPconditions, a biotechnology known as molecular farming Eva\n  Decker, Ralf Reski (2008): Current achievements in the production of complex\n  biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactors.

As a result,\nthese systems more expensive to build and operate than ponds. Cheaper, next\ngeneration systems are currently under development, and engineers are working on\nexploiting byproducts to make production of microalgae commercially attractive.\nAn [http://www.algae.wur.nl/UK/technologies/production/ overview of production\nsystems] can be found at the research page of Wageningen UR.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Photobioreactor","recorded":1362500448,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Biological engineering","Bioreactors"],"headings":["Photobioreactor patterned after the “Christmas tree” principle","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Bioreaktor_quer2.jpg/170px-Bioreaktor_quer2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/20120927_Tannenbaumreaktor.jpg/220px-20120927_Tannenbaumreaktor.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/20120927_Tannenbaumreaktor_optimierter_Lichteinfall.png/220px-20120927_Tannenbaumreaktor_optimierter_Lichteinfall.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/RV_Celtic_Explorer%2C_Galway_Bay%2C_Ireland.jpg/140px-RV_Celtic_Explorer%2C_Galway_Bay%2C_Ireland.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Biosecure_KOI_breeding_and_growing_intensive_facility_in_Israel.jpg/140px-Biosecure_KOI_breeding_and_growing_intensive_facility_in_Israel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bioreactor","Photon","Pond","Microalgae","Phototroph","Contamination","Axenic","Monoculture","Bioculture","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Biopharmaceutical","Knockout_moss","Good_manufacturing_practice","Biotechnology","Molecular_farming","Ralf_Reski","Open-pond","Algae","Microalgae","Microbiofuels","AlgaePARC","Biological_pump","Iron_fertilization","Ocean_acidification","Phytoplankton","Biofuel"]}
