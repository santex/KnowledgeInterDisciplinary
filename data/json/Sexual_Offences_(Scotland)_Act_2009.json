{"cursor":"3386","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'The Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009' (asp 9) is an Act of the Scottish\nParliament. It creates a code of sexual offences that is said to be intended to\nreform that area of the law.\n\nIn 2004 the Scottish Law Commission began working on a reference from the\nScottish Executive to \"examine the law relating to rape and other sexual\noffences, and the evidential requirements for proving such offences, and to make\nrecommendations for reform\" and completed its report in December\n2007. [http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/html/cpsexualoffences.htm Scottish Law\nCommission] The Scottish Government gave a commitment to bring forward\nlegislation in the light of the Commission's\nreview. [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/05093403/6 Scottish\nGovernment \"Principles & Priorities\" - Safer and Stronger Scotland] On 17\nJune 2008, the Scottish Government introduced the Sexual Offences (Scotland)\nBill to the Scottish Parliament. [http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/11-\nsexualOffences/index.htm Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill] The Bill was\npassed by the Parliament on 10 June\n2009. [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/06/10171818 Scottish\nGovernment news release] The Act came into force on 1 December 2010\n(except for sections 52 and 53(2)). [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2010-\n/357/pdfs/ssi_20100357_en.pdf]\n\nThe Act provides for a definition of consent; it states that \"âconsentâ means\nfree agreement (and related expressions are to be construed accordingly)\". -\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/part/2/crossheading/consent Under\nthe Act, a number of circumstances where the victim is unable to give consent\n(such as incapacitation due to alcohol consumption) are illegal. A\nspokesperson for the Scottish Executive has said that the Act provides âa clear\nlegal framework that reflects the values of modern society.â\n\nThe corresponding legislation in England and Wales is the Sexual\nOffences Act 2003.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009","recorded":1375055892,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Sexual_offence","/wiki/Law_reform","/wiki/Scottish_Law_Commission","/wiki/Scottish_Executive","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Scottish_Government","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Scottish_Executive","#cite_note-8","/wiki/England_and_Wales","/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003","#Section_1_-_Rape","#Section_3_-_Sexual_assault","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Laws_regarding_rape#Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Sexual_assault","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act","/wiki/Sexual_offences_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Protection_of_Children_and_Prevention_of_Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2005","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/html/cpsexualoffences.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/05093403/6","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/11-sexualOffences/index.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/06/10171818","#cite_ref-5","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2010/357/pdfs/ssi_20100357_en.pdf","#cite_ref-6","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/part/2/crossheading/consent","#cite_ref-7","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8092157.stm","/wiki/BBC_News_Online","#cite_ref-8","http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/crime-courts/fears-that-flagship-rape-laws-fail-women-1.1020513","/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)","/w/index.php?title=Sexual_Offences_(Scotland)_Act_2009&action=edit&section=5","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/contents","/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/contents/enacted","/wiki/The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kin
