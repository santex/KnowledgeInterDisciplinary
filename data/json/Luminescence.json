It can be caused by chemical reactions,\nelectrical energy, subatomic motions, or stress on a crystal. This distinguishes\nluminescence from incandescence, which is light emitted by a substance as a\nresult of heating. Historically, radioactivity was thought of as a form of \"radio-\nluminescence\", although it is today considered to be separate since it involves\nmore than electromagnetic radiation. The term 'luminescence' was introduced in\n1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann. E.
