Trigonometry defines the trigonometric\nfunctions, which describe those relationships and have applicability to cyclical\nphenomena, such as waves. The field evolved during the third century BC as a\nbranch of geometry used extensively for astronomical studies.<ref>R. Nagel\n(ed.), Encyclopedia of Science, 2nd Ed., The Gale Group (2002)</ref> It is also\nthe foundation of the practical art of surveying.\n\nTrigonometry basics are often taught in school either as a separate course or as\npart of a precalculus course. The trigonometric functions are pervasive in parts\nof pure mathematics and applied mathematics such as Fourier analysis and the\nwave equation, which are in turn essential to many branches of science and\ntechnology. Spherical trigonometry studies triangles on spheres, surfaces of\nconstant positive curvature, in elliptic geometry. It is fundamental to\nastronomy and navigation. Trigonometry on surfaces of negative curvature is part\nof hyperbolic geometry.\n","title":"trigonometry","headings":["History","Overview","Applications of trigonometry","Standard identities","Angle transformation formulas","Common formulas","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Trigonometric_functions","3: Periodic_function","3: Astronomy","3: Navigation","3: Euler's_formula","2: Angle","2: Surveying","2: Hipparchus","2: Triangulation","2: Complex_number","2: Trigonometric_function","2: Unit_circle","2: List_of_trigonometric_identities","1: International_Space_Station","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Mathematics","1: Triangle","1: Wave","1: Geometry","1: School","1: Precalculus","1: Pure_mathematics","1: Applied_mathematics","1: Fourier_analysis","1: Wave_equation","1: Spherical_trigonometry","1: Sphere","1: Curvature","1: Elliptic_geometry","1: Hyperbolic_geometry","1: Sumer","1: Babylonians","1: Nubia","1: Ancient_Greeks","1: Greek_mathematics","1: Euclid","1: Archimedes","1: Inscribed_angle","1: Ptolemy","1: Mathematical_Association_of_America","1: Indian_mathematics","1: Aryabhata","1: Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam","1: Spherical_geometry","1: Chinese_mathematics","1: Europe","1: Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century","1: Astronomy_in_medieval_Islam","1: Muhammad_ibn_JÄbir_al-HarrÄnÄ«_al-BattÄnÄ«","1: Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi","1: Germany","1: Regiomontanus","1: Nicolaus_Copernicus","1: Bartholomaeus_Pitiscus","1: Gemma_Frisius","1: Leonhard_Euler","1: Colin_Maclaurin","1: Trigonometric_series","1: Oxford_University_Press_US","1: Brook_Taylor","1: Taylor_series","1: Complementary_angles","1: Shape","1: Ratio","1: Hypotenuse","1: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Inverse_trigonometric_function","1: Trigonometric_identities","1: Law_of_sines","1: Law_of_cosines","1: Polygon","1: Radian","1: Calculus","1: Infinite_series","1: De_Moivre's_formula","1: Mnemonic","1: Mathematical_table","1: Interpolate","1: Slide_rule","1: Scientific_calculator","1: Programming_language","1: Floating_point_unit","1: Marine_chronometer","1: Geography","1: Satellite_navigation_system","1: Light","1: Music_theory","1: Audio_synthesis","1: Acoustics","1: Optics","1: Electronics","1: Probability_theory","1: Statistics","1: Biology","1: Medical_imaging","1: CAT_scan","1: Ultrasound","1: Pharmacy","1: Chemistry","1: Number_theory","1: Cryptology","1: Seismology","1: Meteorology","1: Oceanography","1: Physical_science","1: Geodesy","1: Architecture","1: Phonetics","1: Economics","1: Electrical_engineering","1: Mechanical_engineering","1: Civil_engineering","1: Computer_graphics","1: Cartography","1: Crystallography","1: Game_development","1: Circumscribed_circle","1: Pythagorean_theorem","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Imaginary_unit","1: Aryabhata's_sine_table","1: Generalized_trigonometry","1: LÃ©nÃ¡rt_sphere","1: List_of_triangle_topics","1: Rational_trigonometry","1: Skinny_triangle","1: Small-angle_approximation","1: Trigonometry_in_Galois_fields","1: Uses_of_trigonometry","1: Eli_Maor","1: Clark_University"]}
