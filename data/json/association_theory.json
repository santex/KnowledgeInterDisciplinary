Graham termed these\nmaterials colloids. Prior to the development of macromolecular theory by Hermann\nStaudinger in the 1920s, association theory remained the most prevalent model of\npolymer structure in the scientific community.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"association_theory","recorded":1365389907,"links":[],"instances":["chemist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obsolete scientific theories","Polymer chemistry","History of chemistry"],"headings":["Bibliography"],"image":[],"tags":[["thomas_graham","chemist"]],"members":["thomas_graham"],"related":["Thomas_Graham_(chemist)","Cellulose","Starch","Polymer","Colloids","Macromolecule","Hermann_Staudinger"]}
