{"cursor":"33366","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is used to refrigerate and preserve food such as this northern kingfish.]]\n 'Refrigeration' is a process in which work is done to move heat from one\n location to another. The work of heat transport is traditionally driven by\n mechanical work, but can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser,\n or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including, but not limited\n to: household refrigerators, industrial freezers, cryogenics, and air\n conditioning. Heat pumps may use the heat output of the refrigeration process,\n and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to\n refrigeration units.\n","linknr":430,"url":"Refrigeration","recorded":1362500447,"links":45,"instances":["engineer","heat_transfer","ship","building","shelter","physics","physics"],"pdf":["http://marketequip.com/documents/historyofrefrigeration.pdf","http://www.wvu.edu/~exten/infores/pubs/fypubs/136.wlg.pdf","http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf"],"categories":["Heating,
