That is, in the Cantor normal form there is no\nfinite number as last term, and the ordinal is nonzero. *It is a limit point of\nthe class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the order topology. (The other\nordinals are isolated points.)\n\nSome contention exists on whether or not 0 should be classified as a limit\nordinal, as it does not have an immediate predecessor; some textbooks include 0\nin the class of limit ordinals for example, Thomas Jech, Set Theory.
