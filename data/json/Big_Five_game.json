{"cursor":"13431","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Africa, the 'big five game' animals are the lion, African elephant, Cape\nbuffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros. The term big\nfive game (sometimes capitalized or quoted as \"Big Five\") was coined by big-game\nhunters and refers to the five most difficult animals in Africa to hunt on foot.\nSubsequently the term was adopted by safari tour operators for marketing\npurposes.  The term is used in most tourist and wildlife\nguides that discuss African wildlife safaris. The members of the Big Five were\nchosen for the difficulty in hunting them and the degree of danger involved,\nrather than their size.\n\nThe big five are among the most dangerous, yet most popular species for big game\nhunters to hunt.\n\nThe 1990 and later releases of South African rand banknotes feature a different\nbig-five animal on each denomination.\n\nCountries where all the members of the big five can be found include Namibia,\nSouth Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. According to recent studies, it is difficult to spot the rhinoceros\nin Botswana.\n\nBecause there are no longer any African countries where hunting rhinoceros is\npermitted, hunters are beginning to adopt the diminished term \"Big Four\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Big_Five_game","recorded":1372152263,"links":[],"instances":["animal","lion","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animals","Hunting","Tourism in Africa"],"headings":["Species","Conservation status","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["horn","anatomy"],["mane","lion"],["spoor","animal"]],"members":["spoor","mane","horn"],"related":["Africa","Lion","African_elephant","African_buffalo","Leopard","Rhinoceros","Africa","Safari","South_African_rand","Banknote","Namibia","South_Africa","Kenya","Tanzania","Zimbabwe","Botswana","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Herbivore","Incisor","Ivory","African_forest_elephant","African_bush_elephant","Rhinoceros","White_rhinoceros","Critically_endangered","Horn_(anatomy)","Bovid","Hippopotamus","Crocodile","Carnivore","Felidae","India","Mane_(lion)","Spoor_(animal)","Canned_hunt","Hydrostatic_shock",".300_Winchester_Magnum",".375_H&H_Magnum","9.3x62mm_Mauser","License","Bloodhound","Rhodesian_Ridgeback","Endangered_species","Vulnerable_species","Near_threatened","Critically_endangered_species","Least_concern","Big_game_hunting","Trophy_hunting","Elephant_gun","Game_reserve","Lion_hunting","Hippopotamus","Crocodile","Little_five_game"]}
