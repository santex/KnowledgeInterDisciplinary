{"cursor":"47283","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Criticism' is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something or\nsomeone in a sometimes negative, sometimes intelligible, (or articulate) way.\n\n*The judger is called \"the critic\". *To engage in criticism is \"to criticize\".\n*One specific item of criticism is called \"a criticism\" or a \"critique\".\n\nThis article provides only general information about criticism. For subject-\nspecific information, see the Varieties of criticism page.\n\nCriticism can be:\n\n*directed toward a person or an animal; at a group, authority or organization;\nat a specific behaviour; or at an object of some kind (an idea, a\nrelationship, a condition, a process, or a thing). *personal (delivered\ndirectly from one person to another, in a personal capacity), or impersonal\n(expressing the view of an organization, and not aimed at anyone personally).\n*highly specific and detailed, or very abstract and general. *verbal\n(expressed in language) or non-verbal (expressed symbolically, or expressed\nthrough an action or a way of behaving). *explicit (the criticism is clearly\nstated) or implicit (a criticism is implied by what is being said, but it is\nnot stated openly). *the result of critical\nthinking[http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/critical/] or spontaneous impulse.\n\nTo criticize does not necessarily imply \"to find fault\", but the word is often\ntaken to mean the simple expression of an objection against prejudice, or a\ndisapproval. Often criticism involves active disagreement, but it may only mean\n\"taking sides\". It could just be an exploration of the different sides of an\nissue. Fighting is not necessarily involved.\n\nCriticism is often presented as something unpleasant, but it need not be. It\ncould be friendly criticism, amicably discussed, and some people find great\npleasure in criticism (\"keeping people sharp\", \"providing the critical edge\").\nThe Pulitzer Prize for Criticism has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper\nwriter who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.\n\nAnother meaning of criticism is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of\nliterature, artwork, film, and social trends (see the article links below). The\ngoal of this type of criticism is to understand the possible meanings of\ncultural phenomena, and the context in which they take shape. In so doing, the\nattempt is often made to evaluate how cultural productions relate to other\ncultural productions, and what their place is within a particular genre, or a\nparticular cultural tradition.\n\nCriticism as an evaluative or corrective exercise can occur in any area of human\nlife. Criticism can therefore take many different forms. How exactly people go\nabout criticizing, can vary a great deal. In specific areas of human endeavour,\nthe form of criticism can be highly specialized and technical; it often requires\nprofessional knowledge to understand the criticism.\n","linknr":546,"url":"Criticism","recorded":1362664885,"links":47,"instances":["psychology","human_behavior"],"pdf":["http://www.citigraphics.net/jenner/djenner/archive/CritiqueAndCriticalThinking.pdf"],"categories":["Criticism|","Social psychology","Philosophy","Literary concepts","Psychological abuse","Psychological manipulation"],"headings":["Etymology","Criticism classification","The psychology of criticism","Purpose of criticism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["obedience","human_behavior"],["perfectionism","psychology"]],"members":["perfectionism","obedience"],"related":["Critic","Critique","Varieties_of_criticism","Critical_thinking","Prejudice","Pulitzer_Prize_for_Criticism","Raymond_Williams","Socrates","Plato","Literary_criticism","Samuel_Johnson","Alexander_Pope","Censure","Immanuel_Kant","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Division_of_labour","Tertiary_education","Karl_Popper","Imre_Lakatos","Neo-Marxism","Critical_theory","Michel_Foucault","Discourse","Noun","Verb","Facebook","Psychological_manipulation","Occupy_movement","2011_Israeli_social_justice_protests","Hebrew","Occupy_London","Occupy_London","Ambiguity","Varieties_of_criticism","Art_criticism","Film_criticism","Literary_criticism","Theatre_criticism","Architecture_criticism","Bona_fide","Rapport","Attention_span","Criminal","Insane","Terrorist","Criminalization","Theodor_W._Adorno","Critical_Theory","Authority","Obedience_(human_behavior)","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","Humiliated","Narcissistic_rage","Narcissists","Perfectionism_(psychology)","Anal_retentive","Nagging","Hypocrites","Hypocrisy","Anti-psychiatry_movement","Political_abuse_of_psychiatry","List_of_criticism_and_critique_articles","Art_criticism","Complaint","Connoisseur","Controversy","Critic","Critical_philosophy","Critical_theory","Critical_thinking","Critique","Film_criticism","Literary_criticism","Music_journalism","Protest","Social_criticism","Textual_criticism","Theatre_criticism","Varieties_of_criticism"]}
