Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating\nforces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum\nthrough pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in\ninterstellar space and reportedly modeling fission weapon detonation. Some of\nits principles are even used in traffic engineering, where traffic is treated as\na continuous fluid.\n\nFluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these practical\ndisciplines—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow\nmeasurement and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid\ndynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties of the\nfluid, such as velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, as functions of\nspace and time.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, hydrodynamics was synonymous with fluid dynamics.\nThis is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like\nmagnetohydrodynamics and hydrodynamic stability, both of which can also be\napplied to gases.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Fluid%20dynamics","headings":["Equations of fluid dynamics","Terminology in fluid dynamics","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Pressure","5: Viscosity","4: Boundary_layer","4: Turbulence","3: Density","3: Magnetohydrodynamics","3: Newtonian_fluid","3: Stokes_flow","3: Bernoulli's_equation","3: Static_pressure","2: Flow_measurement","2: Temperature","2: Hydrodynamic_stability","2: Reynolds_transport_theorem","2: Compressibility","2: Incompressible_flow","2: Compressible_flow","2: Acoustics","2: Inviscid_flow","2: Vorticity","2: Potential_flow","2: Laminar_flow","2: Reynolds_decomposition","2: NavierâStokes_equations","2: Rheology","2: Slope","2: Fluid_statics","2: Dynamic_pressure","2: Stagnation_point","2: Stagnation_pressure","2: Aerodynamics","1: Viscous","1: Vortex_generator","1: Turbulent_flow","1: Flow_separation","1: Dermal_denticle","1: Kammback","1: Physics","1: Fluid_mechanics","1: Natural_science","1: Fluid","1: Liquid","1: Gas","1: Force","1: Aircraft","1: Mass_flow_rate","1: Petroleum","1: Weather","1: Nebula","1: Interstellar","1: Fission_weapon","1: Velocity","1: Conservation_law","1: Conservation_of_mass","1: Conservation_of_momentum","1: Newton's_laws_of_motion","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: First_Law_of_Thermodynamics","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: General_relativity","1: Infinitesimal","1: Navier-Stokes_equations","1: Non-linear","1: Differential_equations","1: Solution_in_closed_form","1: Computational_Fluid_Dynamics","1: Thermodynamics","1: Ideal_gas_law","1: Gas_constant","1: Molar_mass","1: Fluid_parcel","1: Substantial_derivative","1: Time_derivative","1: Convective_derivative","1: Mach_number","1: Sound_waves","1: Reynolds_number","1: No-slip_condition","1: D'Alembert's_paradox","1: Lamellar_field","1: Steady_flow","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Sphere","1: Stationary_process","1: Random","1: Average","1: Direct_numerical_simulation","1: Airbus_A300","1: Boeing_747","1: Reynolds-averaged_NavierâStokes_equations","1: Turbulence_modeling","1: Reynolds_stresses","1: Heat_transfer","1: Mass_transfer","1: Large_eddy_simulation","1: Detached_eddy_simulation","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Water","1: Earth's_atmosphere","1: Blood","1: Polymer","1: Latex","1: Honey","1: Electrical_conduction","1: Electromagnetism","1: Saline_water","1: Maxwell's_equations","1: Buoyancy","1: Convection","1: Aspect_ratio","1: Free_surface","1: Surface_waves","1: Porous_medium","1: Pressure_gradient","1: Coriolis_force","1: Atmospheric_dynamics","1: Pressure_measurement","1: Enthalpy","1: Entropy","1: Isentropic","1: Acoustic_theory","1: Aeroelasticity","1: Aeronautics","1: Computational_fluid_dynamics","1: Geophysical_fluid_dynamics","1: Haemodynamics","1: Hydraulics","1: Hydrology","1: Hydrostatics","1: Electrohydrodynamics","1: Quantum_hydrodynamics","1: Airy_wave_theory","1: BenjaminâBonaâMahony_equation","1: Conservation_laws","1: Darcy's_law","1: HagenâPoiseuille_equation","1: Helmholtz's_theorems","1: Kirchhoff_equations","1: Knudsen_equation","1: Manning_equation","1: Mild-slope_equation","1: Morison_equation","1: Oseen_flow","1: Pascal's_law","1: Poiseuille's_law","1: Pressure_head","1: Relativistic_Euler_equations","1: Stokes_stream_function","1: Stream_function","1: Streamlines,_streaklines_and_pathlines","1: Cavitation","1: Couette_flow","1: Free_molecular_flow","1: Isothermal_flow","1: Open_channel_flow","1: Secondary_flow","1: Stream_thrust_averaging","1: Superfluidity","1: Supersonic","1: Transient_flow","1: Transonic","1: Two-phase_flow","1: List_of_hydrodynamic_instabilities","1: Non-Newtonian_fluid","1: Surface_tension","1: Vapour_pressure","1: Coanda_effect","1: Convection_cell","1: Squeeze_mapping#Corner_flow","1: Magnus_effect","1: Ocean_surface_waves","1: Rossby_wave","1: Shock_wave","1: Soliton","1: Stokes_drift","1: Venturi_effect","1: Vortex","1: Water_hammer","1: Wave_drag","1: Cryosphere_science","1: Fluid_power","1: Hydraulic_machinery","1: Meteorology","1: Naval_architecture","1: Oceanography","1: Plasma_physics","1: Pneumatics","1: 3D_computer_graphics","1: Journal_of_Fluid_Mechanics","1: Physics_of_Fluids","1: Experiments_in_Fluids","1: International_Journal_for_Numerical_Methods_in_Fluids","1: Flow,_Turbulence_and_Combustion","1: List_of_publications_in_physics#Fluid_dynamics","1: Isosurface","1: KeuleganâCarpenter_number","1: Rotating_tank","1: Sound_barrier","1: Beta_plane","1: Immersed_boundary_method","1: Bridge_scour","1: RealMedia"]}
