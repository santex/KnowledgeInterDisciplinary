{"cursor":"3090","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" code: 1jce) in cartoon representation. The fold of the protein is similar to\n its eukaryotic counterpart actin.]] 'MreB' is a protein found in bacteria that\n has been identified as a homologue of actin, as indicated by similarities in\n tertiary structure and conservation of active site peptide sequence. The\n conservation of protein structure suggests the common ancestry of the\n cytoskeletal elements formed by actin, found in eukaryotes, and MreB, found in\n prokaryotes. Indeed, recent studies have found that MreB proteins polymerize to\n form filaments that are similar to actin microfilaments.\n","linknr":479,"url":"MreB","recorded":1362483821,"links":22,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["Function","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/MreB.png/220px-MreB.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Staphylococcus_aureus_VISA_2.jpg/35px-Staphylococcus_aureus_VISA_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Actin","Homology_(biology)","Actin","Tertiary_structure","Amino_acid_sequence","Common_descent","Cytoskeleton","Eukaryote","Prokaryote","Polymerization","Microfilament","Bacteria","Mutant","Gene","Helix"]}
