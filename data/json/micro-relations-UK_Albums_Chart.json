It is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company\nand broadcast on a Sunday on BBC Radio 1 (Top 40), and published in Music Week\nmagazine (Top 75) and on the OCC website (Top 100).\n\nTo qualify for the UK albums chart the album must be the correct length and\nprice. It must be more than 3 tracks or 20 minutes long and not be classed as a\nbudget album. A budget album costs between Â£0.50 and Â£3.75. Additionally,\nvarious artist compilations - which until January 1989 were included in the main\nalbum listing - are now listed separately in a compilations chart. Full details\nof the rules can be found on the Official Charts Company website.

Indeed, in recent years, the album chart has been in good\nhealth despite fears that music innovations such as MP3 players would threaten\nthe traditional album. 2005 even saw a record number of artist album sales with\n126.2 million sold in the UK.\n\nAccording to the canon of The Official Charts Company, the official British\nalbums chart is the [[Melody Maker]] chart from 8 November 1958 to March 1960\n(although the [[Record Mirror]] published charts from 28 July 1956 Warwick,\nNeil; Kutner, Jon; Brown, Tony (2004). The Complete Book Of The British Charts:\nSingles and Albums (3rd ed.). London: Omnibus Press. ISBN 1-84449-058-0. );\nthe [[Record Retailer]] chart from 1960 to 1969; and the Official UK Albums\nChart from 1969 on. In the 1970s the new album chart was revealed at 12.45pm on\nThursdays on BBC Radio 1, and then moved to 6.05 pm (later 6.30 pm) on Wednesday\nevenings during the Peter Powell and Bruno Brookes shows. In October 1987 it\nmoved to Monday lunchtimes, during the Gary Davies show, and from April to\nOctober 1993 it briefly had its own show from 7.00-8.00 pm on Sunday evenings,\nintroduced by Lynn Parsons. Since October 1993 it has been included in the UK\nTop 40 show from 4.00-7.00 pm on Sundays. A weekly 'Album Chart' show was\nlicensed out to BBC Radio 2 and presented by Simon Mayo, until it ended on 2\nApril 2007.\n","linknr":625,"url":"UK_Albums_Chart","recorded":1362477679,"links":47,"instances":["band","entertainer","band","uk","sugababes_song","singer","disc_jockey"],"pdf":["http://c0903002.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/3188-official-album-chart-rules.pdf"],"categories":["British record charts"],"headings":["Record holders","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Official_Albums_Chart_%28UK%29.jpg/220px-Official_Albums_Chart_%28UK%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/British_chart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["peter_powell","disc_jockey"],["queen","band"],["madonna","entertainer"],["queen","band"],["oasis","band"],["push_the_button","sugababes_song"],["adele","singer"],["list_of_best-selling_albums_by_year","uk"]],"members":["oasis","madonna","queen","push_the_button","adele","peter_powell"],"related":["Album","United_Kingdom","Official_Charts_Company","BBC_Radio_1","Music_Week","MP3_player","BBC_Radio_1","Peter_Powell_(disc_jockey)","Bruno_Brookes","Gary_Davies","Lynn_Parsons","BBC_Radio_2","Simon_Mayo","Queen_(band)","The_Beatles","Elvis_Presley","U2","Madonna_(entertainer)","U.K.","Abba","Neil_Reid","Joss_Stone","Vera_Lynn","Bob_Marley_&_The_Wailers","ABBA","Queen_(band)","Fleetwood_Mac","Meat_Loaf","Bob_Marley_&_The_Wailers","Kate_Bush","Oasis_(band)","Susan_Boyle","Arctic_Monkeys","Craig_David","Ray_Quinn","Led_Zeppelin","Sugababes","Push_the_Button_(Sugababes_song)","About_You_Now","Christina_Aguilera","Elvis_Presley","Cliff_Richard","Kylie_Minogue","Simon_and_Garfunkel","Adele_(singer)","List_of_best-selling_albums_by_year_(UK)","List_of_UK_Albums_Chart_Christmas_number_ones","List_of_UK_Albums_Chart_number_ones","UK_Singles_Chart","List_of_albums_which_have_spent_the_most_weeks_on_the_UK_Albums_Chart","List_of_singles_which_have_spent_the_most_weeks_on_the_UK_Singles_Chart"]}
