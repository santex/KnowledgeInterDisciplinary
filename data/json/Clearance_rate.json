{"cursor":"1779","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn criminal justice, 'clearance rate' is calculated by dividing the number of\ncrimes that are \"cleared\" (a charge being laid) by the total number of crimes\nrecorded. Clearance rates are used by various groups as a measure of crimes\nsolved by the police.\n\nClearance rates can be problematic for measuring the performance of police\nservices and for comparing various police services. This is because a police\nforce may employ a different way of measuring clearance rates. For example, each\npolice force may have a different method of recording when a \"crime\" has\noccurred and different criteria for determining when a crime has been \"cleared.\"\nOne police force may appear to have a much better clearance rate because of its\ncalculation methodology.

Further focus on clearance rates may result\nin effort being expended to attribute crimes (correctly or incorrectly) to a\ncriminal, which may not result in retribution, compensation, rehabilitation or\ndeterrence.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Clearance_rate","recorded":1362897206,"links":19,"instances":["criminal_justice"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Criminology","Law enforcement","Crime data"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/2004_UCR_crime_clearance.jpg/350px-2004_UCR_crime_clearance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Cuffspolicewkiimage.jpg/40px-Cuffspolicewkiimage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Nuvola_apps_agent.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_agent.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conflict_model","criminal_justice"]],"members":["conflict_model"],"related":["Criminal_justice","Crime","Conflict_Model_(criminal_justice)"]}
