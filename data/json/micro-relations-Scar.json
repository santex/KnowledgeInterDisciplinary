A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin\nand other tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing\nprocess. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g. after\naccident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception\nto this is animals with regeneration, which do not form scars and the tissue\nwill grow back exactly as before.\n\nScar tissue is the same protein (collagen) as the tissue that it replaces, {{Cite web\n  | last = Sherratt first = Jonathan A. title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar\n  | Tissue Formation quote = This is composed of the same main protein\n  | (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition.\n  | Most crucially, the protein fibres in normal tissue have a random\n  | (basketweave) appearance, while those in scar tissue have pronounced\n  | alignment in a single direction. publisher = Department of Mathematics, Heriot-\n  | Watt University year = 2010 url =\n  | http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/researchinterests/scartissueformation.html\n  | accessdate = 2010-08-20}} but the fiber composition of the protein is\n  | different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers\n  | found in normal tissue, in fibrosis\n  | the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single\n  | direction. This collagen scar tissue\n  | alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen\n  | randomised alignment. For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to\n  | ultraviolet radiation, and sweat glands and hair follicles do not grow back\n  | within scar tissue. A myocardial infarction, commonly\n  | known as a heart attack, causes scar formation in the heart muscle, which\n  | leads to loss of muscular power and possibly heart failure. However, there\n  | are some tissues (e.g. bone) that can heal without any structural or\n  | functional deterioration.\n","linknr":761,"url":"Scar","recorded":1362543758,"links":75,"instances":["literature","injury","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.practicalplasticsurgery.org/docs/Practical_10.pdf","http://www.practicalplasticsurgery.org/docs/Practical_10.pdf","http://www.medwelljournals.com/fulltext/java/2008/1087-1089.pdf","http://www.medwelljournals.com/fulltext/java/2008/1087-1089.pdf"],"categories":["Diseases involving the fasciae"],"headings":["Etymology","Types","Pathophysiology","Treatments","Intentional scarring","Research","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Very-minor-scar.jpg/230px-Very-minor-scar.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Scars_2yrs.png/220px-Scars_2yrs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg/150px-Cicatrices_de_flagellation_sur_un_esclave.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Scar.JPG/250px-Scar.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Scar_revision.jpg/220px-Scar_revision.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["regeneration","biology"],["latinisation","literature"],["burn","injury"]],"members":["latinisation","burn","regeneration"],"related":["Fibrosis","Skin","Wound","Biological_tissue","Healing","Lesion","Accident","Disease","Surgery","Regeneration_(biology)","Ultraviolet_radiation","Sweat_gland","Hair_follicle","Myocardial_infarction","Myocardial_scarring","Heart","Heart_failure","Bone","Old_French","Late_Latin","Latinisation_(literature)","Greek_language","Keloid","Organ_hypertrophy","Keloid","Neoplasm","Phenotypic","Acne_vulgaris","Body_piercings","Shoulder","Chest","Fat","Muscle","Chickenpox","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Pregnancy","Growth_spurt","Joints","Corticosteroid","Road_rash","Collagen","Collagen","Myofibroblast","Inflammation","Fibroblast","Wound_healing","Dermis","Injury","Collagen_induction_therapy","Collagen","Artefill","Allergic_reaction","Dermabrasion","Local_anaesthetic","Pulsed_dye_laser","Carbon_dioxide_laser","Radiotherapy","Silicone_scar_sheet","Pressure_dressing","Elastomer","Burn_(injury)","Corticosteroid","Primary_intention","Secondary_intention","Vitamin_E","Mederma","Dermatitis","Body_art","Ribosomal_s6_kinase","Cirrhosis","Osteopontin","Wound_healing","Dueling_scars","Granulation_tissue","Scarification","Self-injury","Type-I_collagen"]}
