Havzi Nela was born on February 20, 1934 in the village Kollovoz\ndistrict of KukÃ«s. He managed to finish both elementary and high school while\nliving in extreme poverty. Since high school he expressed objections against the\ninjustice created by the communist regime. After this he began studies at the\nHigher Pedagogical Institute of Shkodra (Luigj Gurakuqi University today), but\nwas expelled due to seemilngy rebellious and controversial beliefs. After much\ndifficulty, he found a job as an elementary school teacher at Plani i Bardhe, a\nsmall village in the district of Mat. He was forced to leave the village due to\nsuspicious activity. Suspicion arose after students began reading his poetry. He\nthen went on to study at the Higher Pedagogical Institute of Shkodra by\ncorrespondence. He worked as a teacher in different villages such as Kruma,\nLojme and Shishtavec until 1967, when he moved to Topojan. Topojan was where the\nmost dramatic events of the poet and his family began.\n\nHavzi Nela was constantly under surveillance and was often taken in to custody.\nHe was restricted and censored heavily in what he wrote, but also where and how\nhe could live. After his students read the poem \"Shko dallandyshe (Go Swallow)\"\nwritten by Filip Shiroka, Havzi Nela and his wife, Lavdie were under threat of\nprosecution from the government due to its controversial content. They risked\ntheir lives by taking the journey across the border into Kosova on April 26,\n1967. While crossing the boarder he wrote on a piece of paper; \"Goodbye,\nhomeland, I am leaving, but with a broaken heart, (Lamtumire atdhe i dashur, se\npo iki zemÃ«rplasur)\" He placed the piece of paper in the branch of a hazel tree.\nIt is widely believed that the purpose of this was to declare an undying love\nfor the country and its people however expressing disdain towards its\ndictatorship. A tragic fate would soon follow in Kosovo. He was captured just\nbeyond the border together with his wife. They were arrested and imprisoned in\nPrizeren, Kosova. On May 6, 1967, the Yugoslavian government agreed on an\nexchange turning Havzi Nela and Lavdie Nela in for several Yugoslavian prisoners\nheld in Albania. The exchange took place at Morina border crossing point.\n\nOn May 22, 1967, the poet was tried and sentenced by the courts of Kukes county\nto fifteen years in prison. The charges were betrayal and desertion of his\ncountry. A serious offence under the regime of communist leader Enver Hoxha. His\nwife Lavdie Nela was sentenced to ten years in prison. She was offered the\npossibility of a shorter sentence if she would forsake and divorce her husband.\nShe did not agree to this and accepted her punishment. Havzi Nela was imprisoned\nin the prison of Burrel initially then transferred to SpaÃ§-RrÃ«shen prison.\n\nOn August 8, 1975, eight years were added to his sentence due to his involvement\nand organisation responsabilitied for an uprising which took place within the\nprison. The uprising was directed against the governments regime and appalling\nconditions at the prison. On December 19, 1986, he was released from prison. He\nwas incarcerated in the village of Arren. When news came of his dying mother\nless than a year later, on October 12, 1987 he left Arren to go and see her one\nlast time. This was discovered by the government immediately and Havzi Nela was\nonce again arrested and soon after senteced to death by hanging.\n\nOn June 24, 1988, the Supreme Court of Albania's communist judges consisting of\nFehmi Abdiu, Vili and Fatmira Laskaj Robo rejected Lavdie Nela's appeal against\nher husband's death sentence. The offitials behind this felt it was a good\nopportunity to make an example of Havzi Nela and spread terror throughout the\nnation. They built a contraption in the middle of the town of Kukes where he\nwould be hung publically. The death penalty was signed by Ramiz Alia and Kristaq\nRama, [http://www.botasot.info/shqiperia/39488/S6u4o0k/ Ja si Kristaq Rama\nvendosi pÃ«r varjen nÃ« litar tÃ« poetit Havzi Nela] [http://lajme.shqip-\neria.com/lajme/artikull/iden/367106/titulli/Varja-e-Havzi-Neles-PD-zbardh-\nvendimin-dhe-firmen-e-Kristaq-Rames Varja e Havzi NelÃ«s, zbardhet vendimin dhe\nfirma e Kristaq RamÃ«s] the father of the today's opposition leader Edi\nRama [http://www.ps.al/leadership/ Socialist Party of Albania\nLeadership] On August 10, 1988, at 02:00 am, he was executed.

He was deprived of the opportunity to reach out to all the dead and to\nbe laid to rest. He stayed on his feet at an undisclosed location for five years\nand ten days, until August 20, 1993. After numerous attempts by the democratic\ngovernment of Albania, this was the day that it finally became possible to\nsearch the land which was covered with rocks and bushes near Kolsh village, two\nkilometers away from KukÃ«s. With the presidential decree of the President of the\nRepublic of Albania, Sali Berisha, Havzi Nela was given the title \"Martyr of\nDemocracy\". In commemorating the 75th anniversary of the birth of Havzi Nela,\nprominent writer Ismail Kadare wrote: \"The poet Havzi Nela is a bell that still\nrings for Albanian society. Not to listen to it is to continue to be trampled on\nby the foot of oppression.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Havzi_Nela","recorded":1375056198,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Havzi_Nela.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Havzi_Nela.jpg/200px-Havzi_Nela.jpg","/wiki/Kollovoz","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Communist_Albania","/wiki/File:Havzi_Nela_death_penalty.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b3/Havzi_Nela_death_penalty.jpg/200px-Havzi_Nela_death_penalty.jpg","/wiki/File:Havzi_Nela_death_penalty.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania","/wiki/Ramiz_Alia","/wiki/Kristaq_Rama","/wiki/Edi_Rama","/wiki/Kollovoz","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs","/w/index.php?title=Higher_Pedagogical_Institute_of_Shkodra&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Luigj_Gurakuqi_University","/wiki/Filip_Shiroka","/wiki/Kosova","/wiki/Prizeren","/wiki/Kosova","/wiki/Enver_Hoxha","/wiki/Prison_of_Burrel","/wiki/Spa%C3%A7","/wiki/Rr%C3%ABshen","/w/index.php?title=Fehmi_Abdiu&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Fatmira_Laskaj&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Death_sentence","/wiki/Terror","/wiki/Ramiz_Alia","/wiki/Kristaq_Rama","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Edi_Rama","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Albania","/w/index.php?title=Martyr_of_Democracy&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ismail_Kadare","/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.botasot.info/shqiperia/39488/S6u4o0k/","#cite_ref-2","http://lajme.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/367106/titulli/Varja-e-Havzi-Neles-PD-zbardh-vendimin-dhe-firmen-e-Kristaq-Rames","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ps.al/leadership/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.klosi.org/news/klosi_news_oponion/154.html","#cite_ref-5","http://lajme.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/367106/titulli/Varja-e-Havzi-Neles-PD-zbardh-vendimin-dhe-firmen-e-Kristaq-Rames","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Kollovoz","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs","/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County","/wiki/Albania","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&oldid=560965789","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1934_births","/wiki/Category:1988_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Kuk%C3%ABs_District","/wiki/Category:Albanian_poets","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_Albania_by_hanging","/wiki/Category:Albanian_people_executed_by_hanging","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_November_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Havzi+Nela&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Havzi+Nela","/wiki/Havzi_Nela","/wiki/Talk:Havzi_Nela","#","/wiki/Havzi_Nela","/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Havzi_Nela&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Havzi_Nela","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Havzi_Nela","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Havzi_N
