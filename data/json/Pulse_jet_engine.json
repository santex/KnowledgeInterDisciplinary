Pulsejet engines can be made with few\nhttp://gofurther.utsi.edu/Projects/PulseDE.htm or no moving parts, http://news.google.com/patents/about?id=vOZsAAAAEBAJ http://www.go-\nogle.com/patents?vid=USPAT6216446 http://www.home.no/andreas.sunnhord-\nvik/English/mechanical/valveless_e.htm and are capable of running\nstatically.\n\nPulse jet engines are a lightweight form of jet propulsion, but usually have a\npoor compression ratio, and hence give a low specific impulse.\n\nOne notable line of research of pulsejet engines includes the pulse detonation\nengine which involves repeated detonations in the engine, and which can\npotentially give high compression and good efficiency.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pulse_jet_engine","recorded":1372154987,"links":[],"instances":["inventor","electrical","unit","flying_bomb"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pulsejet engines|","Aircraft engines|Pulsejet"],"headings":["Types","History","Operation","Function","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["v-1","flying_bomb"],["paul_schmidt","inventor"],["paul_schmidt","inventor"],["v-1","flying_bomb"],["newton","unit"],["magneto","electrical"],["v-1","flying_bomb"],["v-1","flying_bomb"]],"members":["paul_schmidt","magneto","newton"],"related":["Jet_engine","Pulse","Moving_parts","Compression_ratio","Specific_impulse","Pulse_detonation_engine","Intake","Combustion_chamber","Resonance","Reed_valve","Intake","Combustion_chamber","Martin_Wiberg","V-1_(flying_bomb)","Paul_Schmidt_(inventor)","Georg_Hans_Madelung","Paul_Schmidt_(inventor)","Reich_Air_Ministry","Ribbon_parachute","V-1_(flying_bomb)","Argus_Motoren","The_Askania_Company","Robert_Lusser","Fieseler","Fritz_Gosslau","Siemens","Reich_Air_Ministry","Peenem√ºnde","Cycles_per_second","Newton_(unit)","Ignition_coil","Magneto_(electrical)","Acetylene","Operating_temperature","Piston","Exothermic","Hydrogen_peroxide","Potassium_permanganate","T-Stoff","Z-Stoff","Wright_Field","Reverse_engineering","Republic-Ford_JB-2","Republic_Aviation","Ford_Motor_Company","Hap_Arnold","V-1_(flying_bomb)","Germany","Cruise_missile","World_War_II","Turbojet","Rocket","Thrust-to-weight_ratio","Thrust_specific_fuel_consumption","Lenoir_cycle","Otto_cycle","Brayton_cycle","Acoustic_resonance","Torque","Fuselage","Hiller_YH-32_Hornet","Ram_jet","Control_line","Radio-controlled_aircraft","Closed_wing","Venturi_pump","V-1_(flying_bomb)","SNECMA","Mach_number","Moving_parts","Target_drone","Control_line","Model_aircraft","Pulse_detonation_engine","Turbofan","Pratt_&_Whitney","General_Electric","Boeing","Pulse_Ejector_Thrust_Augmentor","VTOL","Pulse_detonation_engine","Valveless_pulse_jet","List_of_aircraft_engines"]}
