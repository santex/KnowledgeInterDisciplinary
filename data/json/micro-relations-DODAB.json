Among\nvarious preparation methods, the ââhot-waterâ method offers a simple procedure\nto prepare DODAB cationic vesicles by simply dissolving the DODAB in hot water\nabove 50 Â°C, i.e., chain melting (main) transition, Tm. In general, the DSC\nthermograms of the unsonicated DODAB dispersions are dominated by two\nendotherms; the pre- (35â36 Â°C) and main transition (42.7â45 Â°C) peaks.\nMoreover, in literature reported the presence of a third endotherm (post\ntransition) at 52.2 Â°C. The main transition (Tm) is ascribed to gel to liquid-\ncrystalline phase transition in which the alkyl chains transform from solidlike\nto liquid-like state.\n\nThe 10 mM DODAB is a critical concentration, below which the dispersions consist\nof large polydispersed unilamellar vesicles (ULVs) that exhibit a local (chain\nmelting) transition at 43 Â°C, beyond which a structural transition occurs: ULVs\n--> MLVs (multilamellar vesicles) as indicated by the sudden increase in the\ndynamic moduli. However, above 10 mM DODAB, the dispersions are mostly formed by\nULVs in coexistence with lamellar fragments resulting in a network that shows a\nrheogram similar to that of hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase.
