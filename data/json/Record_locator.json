{"cursor":"3799","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'record locator' is an alphanumeric code, typically 6 characters in length,\nused in airline reservation systems to access a specific record. When a\npassenger, travel agent or airline employee refers to a record locator they\ntypically mean a pointer to a specific reservation which is known as a Passenger\nName Record or PNR. However, a record locator can point at records containing\nother forms of data. Record locators are unique within a given system at a\nspecific point in time. Because the number of character combinations in 6\ncharacters is finite (albeit very large) record locators get reused once the\ndata to which it refers has been purged from the system. Because 1, I and L can\nbe confused (also 0 and o) these characters are not always used in record\nlocators. The pool of available character combinations is further reduced\nbecause the locator is actually a location address and there are rules about\nwhat character combinations can be used for such addresses.\n\nBecause the term record locator is usually used to refer to a PNR the two terms\ncan become confused.\n\nWhen a reservation is made a PNR is created in the system used by the person\nmaking the booking. This PNR will have a record locator. If the booking has been\nmade through the airline and the only flight(s) are operated by the airline\nmaking the reservation only one PNR will exist. However if the booking contains\nflights of more than one airline (for example a passenger flies London/New York\non British Airways and returns on United Airlines) then the reservation for both\nflights will (typically) be made through the first airline. The first airline\nwill send messages to the 2nd confirming the reservation and the 2nd airline\nwill create a separate PNR which has its own record locator. If the booking is\nmade through a travel agency then a PNR (and record locator) will exist in the\nsystem used by the agency and further PNRs (each with their own record locator)\nwill exist in each airline system.\n\nIn recent years more and more airlines have stopped running their own\nreservation systems and have become clients of systems such as Amadeus and Sabre\nwho provide hosting services. Where this occurs a single PNR (with just one\nrecord locator) may be created in the hosting system containing details of all\nthe flights for which that hosting system is responsible. For example, a\nreservation for passenger traveling from London to Paris on Air France returning\nBA booked through AF will reside in one PNR in the Amadeus system with just one\nrecord locator because both airlines use Amadeus for reservations. If that\nbooking is made through a travel agent using Amadeus the same single PNR/record\nlocator will exist. However if the reservation is made via an agency using a\ndifferent system (e.g. Sabre) there will be two PNRs (one in Sabre and one in\nAmadeus) each with its own locator.\n\nAirline systems pass record locators between themselves as part of the\nconfirmation process. Should a record locator fail to be passed between two\nsystems the PNR can still be retrieved using flight number/date and name.\n\nNot all airlines use the term record locator. Other terms in use include:\n*Confirmation number *Reservation number *Confirmation code *Booking reference\n*Booking code\n\nExample record locators are RMT33W, KZVGX5, IIRCYC.\n\nIn the past, the Reservec 2 system had eight character record locators in the\nform xxnnnnxx where x was a letter and n a number. Some CPARS (Compact\nProgrammed Airlines Reservations System) systems used five character locators.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Record_locator","recorded":1374521814,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit","/wiki/Alphanumeric","/wiki/Airline","/wiki/Passenger","/wiki/Travel_agent","/wiki/Passenger_Name_Record","/wiki/London","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/British_Airways","/wiki/United_Airlines","/wiki/Travel_agency","/wiki/Amadeus_CRS","/wiki/Sabre_(computer_system)","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Air_France","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit&section=1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&oldid=544245088","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Airline_tickets","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_September_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Record+locator&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Record+locator","/wiki/Record_locator","/wiki/Talk:Record_locator","#","/wiki/Record_locator","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Record_locator","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Record_locator","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&oldid=544245088","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3422426","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Record_locator&id=544245088","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Record+locator","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Record+locator&oldid=544245088&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Record_locator&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localitzador","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_locator","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3422426#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_locator","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["computer_system"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Airline
