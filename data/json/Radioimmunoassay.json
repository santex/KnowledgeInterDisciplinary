As\nsuch, it can be seen as the inverse of a radiobinding assay, which quantifies an\nantibody by use of corresponding antigens.\n\nAlthough the RIA technique is extremely sensitive and extremely specific,\nrequiring specialized equipment, it remains the least expensive method to\nperform such tests. It requires special precautions and licensing, since\nradioactive substances are used. Today it has been supplanted by the ELISA\nmethod, where the antigen-antibody reaction is measured using colorimetric\nsignals instead of a radioactive signal. However, because of its robustness,\nconsistent results and low price per test, RIA methods are again becoming\npopular. It is generally simpler to perform than a bioassay.\n\nThe RAST test (radioallergosorbent test) is an example of radioimmunoassay. It\nis used to detect the causative allergen for an allergy.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Radioimmunoassay","recorded":1362510371,"links":23,"instances":["tests","tests"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Endocrine procedures","Immunologic tests","Radiobiology"],"headings":["Method","History","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"]],"members":["sensitivity","specificity"],"related":["In_vitro","Assay","Antigen","Hormone","Blood","Radiobinding_assay","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","ELISA","Colorimetry","Bioassay","RAST_test","Allergen","Allergy","Antigen","Radioactivity","Isotope","Iodine","Tyrosine","Antibodies","Blood_serum","Concentration","Supernatant","Gamma_counter","Binding_curve","Rosalyn_Yalow","Solomon_Berson","Mount_Sinai_School_of_Medicine","Yalow","Nobel_Prize_in_Medicine","Hormone","Endocrinology"]}
