A principal goal for the bureau is helping stop\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while furthering the growth of\nUnited States exports. The Bureau is led by the Under Secretary of Commerce\nfor Industry and Security.\n\nThe mission of the BIS is to advance U.S. national security, foreign policy, and\neconomic interests. BIS's activities include regulating the export of sensitive\ngoods and dual-use technologies in an effective and efficient manner; enforcing\nexport control, anti-boycott, and public safety laws; cooperating with and\nassisting other countries on export control and strategic trade issues;\nassisting U.S. industry to comply with international arms control agreements;\nmonitoring the viability of the U.S. defense-industrial base; and promoting\nfederal initiatives and public-private partnerships to protect the nation's\ncritical infrastructures.\n\nItems on the 'Commerce Control List' (CCL) - which includes many sensitive goods\nand technologies like encryption software - require a permit from the Department\nof Commerce before they can be exported. To determine whether an export permit\nis required, an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) is used.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security","recorded":1362581690,"links":21,"instances":["politics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Export and import control","United States Department of Commerce agencies","Federal law enforcement agencies of the United States"],"headings":["Guiding Principles of the Bureau of Industry and Security","Private Sector Collaboration","Shifting Global Priorities","International Cooperation","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Ambox_PR.svg/45px-Ambox_PR.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/US-DOC-BureauOfIndustryAndSecurity-Seal.svg/170px-US-DOC-BureauOfIndustryAndSecurity-Seal.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/28px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/US-DeptOfCommerce-Seal.svg/100px-US-DeptOfCommerce-Seal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["internationalism","politics"]],"members":["internationalism"],"related":["United_States","Washington,_DC","United_States","Eric_L._Hirschhorn","Under_Secretary_of_Commerce_for_Industry_and_Security","United_States_Department_of_Commerce","United_States_Department_of_Commerce","United_States","Under_Secretary_of_Commerce_for_Industry_and_Security","National_security","Foreign_policy","Economy_of_the_United_States","Dual-use_technologies","Export_restriction","Anti-boycott","Public_safety","Export","Arms_control","Military-industrial_complex","Public-private_partnership","Critical_infrastructure","Encryption_software","Export_Control_Classification_Number","National_security","Economic_security","Cyber_security","Homeland_security","Dual-use","Export_restrictions","Weapons_of_mass_destruction","Nuclear_proliferation","Terrorists","Countries_of_concern","U.S._foreign_policy","Military_superiority","Trade","Commerce","Aerospace_manufacturer","Microprocessor","Arms_industry","High-tech","Symbiotic_relationship","International_security","Geopolitics","State_governments_of_the_United_States","Local_government_in_the_United_States","First_responders","United_States_federal_executive_departments","Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government","United_States_National_Security_Council","United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","United_States_Department_of_State","United_States_Department_of_Defense","United_States_Department_of_Energy","United_States_Department_of_Justice","United_States_Intelligence_Community","Congressional_oversight","United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs","United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations","Members_of_Congress","Congressional_staff","Internationalism_(politics)","Transshipment","Critical_infrastructure_protection","Enforcement","Lowest_common_denominator","Commodity_Classification_Automated_Tracking_System","Office_of_Export_Enforcement"]}
