{"cursor":"21495","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Angling' is a method of fishing by means of an \"angle\" (fish hook). The\nhook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a\nfishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions\nas a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself\ncan be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float is\nsometimes used.\n\nAngling is a principal method of sport fishing, but commercial fisheries also\nuse angling methods such as longlining or trolling. Catch and release fishing is\nincreasingly practiced by recreational fishermen. In many parts of the world,\nsize limits apply to certain species, meaning fish below and/or above a certain\nsize must, by law, be released.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Angling","recorded":1372152344,"links":[],"instances":["angling","fishing","fishing","fish","fishing","fishing","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Recreational fishing"],"headings":["Introduction","Hooks","Baits","Laws and regulations","Catch and release","Capacity for pain","Tournaments and derbies","Motivation","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["float","fishing"],["float","fishing"],["troll","angling"],["bass","fish"],["bass","fish"],["spawn","biology"],["gaff","fishing"],["sinker","fishing"],["trolling","fishing"]],"members":["troll","gaff","float","bass","trolling","sinker","spawn"],"related":["Fishing","Fish_hook","Fishing_line","Fishing_rod","Fishing_reel","Fishing_lure","Fishing_bait","Float_(fishing)","Float_(fishing)","Sport_fishing","Commercial_fishing","Longline_fishing","Troll_(angling)","Catch_and_release","Recreational_fishing","Minimum_landing_size","Fish","Sea_water","Swordfish","Marlin","Tuna","Cod","Bass_(fish)","Fresh_water","Bass_(fish)","Esox","Walleye","Muskellunge","Yellow_perch","Trout","Salmon","Catfish","Crappie","Bluegill","Lepomis","Carp","Esox","Tench","Rudd","Rutilus","European_perch","Barbus_barbus","Seafood","Esophagus","Fishing_lure","Fly_fishing","Texas_Rig","Earthworm","Leech","Cyprinid","Frog","Salamander","Insect","Larva","Maggots","Grasshopper","Bee","Ant","Trout","Roe","Florida","USA","Lepomis","Roe","Bait_fish","Bait_fish","Ecosystem","United_States","Michigan","Viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia","Trout","Salmon","Introduced_species","Law","Regulation","Individual_Fishing_Quota","Snagging","Bait_fish","Sport_fishing","Spawn_(biology)","Slot_limit","Taboo","Catch_and_Release","Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","Manitoba","Brook_trout","Suffering","Batrachoididae","Neocortex","Temple_Grandin","Epistemology","Solipsism","Existentialism","Ethology","Taiwan","Tournament","Fly_fishing","Bibliography_of_fly_fishing","Fishing_rod","Bamboo_fly_rods","Fishing_reel","Fishing_line","Fish_hook","Fishing_lure","Trout_worms","Gaff_(fishing)","Piscatorial_Society","Sinker_(fishing)","Trolling_(fishing)","Biteindex"]}
