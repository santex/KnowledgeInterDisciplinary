{"cursor":"15776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Vietnam.]] A 'fish trap' is a trap used for fishing. Fish traps may have the\nform of a fishing weir or a lobster trap. A typical trap might consist of a\nframe of thick steel wire in the shape of a heart, with chicken wire stretched\naround it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of\nthe trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as\nthe chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. In earlier\ntimes, traps were constructed of wood and fibre. __TOC__\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fish_trap","recorded":1372152326,"links":[],"instances":["cameroon_and_gabon","fish","australia","tactic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fishing equipment","Fishing techniques and methods"],"headings":["History","Types and methods","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["trap","tactic"],["victoria","australia"],["baka","cameroon_and_gabon"],["pike","fish"]],"members":["baka","pike","victoria","trap"],"related":["Vietnam","Trap_(tactic)","Fishing_weir","Lobster_trap","Heart","Chicken_wire","Prehistoric","Yaghan","Tierra_Del_Fuego","Bahia_Wulaia","Archaeological","Trabucco","Commercial_fishing","Gargano","Adriatic","Province_of_Foggia","Tyrrhenian_Sea","Indigenous_Australians","Murray-Darling_Basin","Indigenous_people","Brewarrina,_New_South_Wales","Victoria_(Australia)","Canals","Eel","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Pit_River","California","Dam","Baka_(Cameroon_and_Gabon)","Pike_(fish)","Crab_trap","Crab_trap","MƒÅori_people","Chicken_wire","Lobster_pot","Lobster_pot","Lobster","Crayfish","Buoy","Haikou","RMB","Stickleback_trap","Almadraba","Almadraba","Andalusia","Tuna","Double-Heart_of_Stacked_Stones","Double-Heart_of_Stacked_Stones","Fishing_weir","Cimei","Pescadores","Taiwan","Fishing_weir","Fishing_weir","Fishing_weir","Fish_wheel","Fish_wheel","Putcher","Putcher","River_Severn","Hazel","Willow","Trabucco","Trabucco","Aleppo_pine","Gargano","Abruzzo","Molise","Wagenya","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","East_Timor","Tamil_Nadu","Haikou","Animal_trapping"]}
