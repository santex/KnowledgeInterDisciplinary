{"cursor":"3475","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'South-East' (), also referred to as 'South-Eastern [[Krai]]' () and 'South-\nEastern [[Oblast]]' () was a territory, and later an administrative division,\nof the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) which existed in\n1920-1924.\n\nOriginally, the name \"South-East\" was used informally to refer to the\nterritories of Don, Kuban-Black Sea, and Terek Oblasts, as well as those of\nStavropol Governorate and Dagestan ASSR, which were governed by the\nRevolutionary Soviet of the Laborers' Army of South-East Russia (hence the name\n\"South-East\") established on August 7, 1920. While the Soviet itself was\nabolished in 1921, the name \"South-East\" stuck. Occasionally, the territory was\nalso referred to as \"South-Eastern Krai\" and \"South-Eastern Oblast\", even though\nno official krai/oblast status was assigned to it at the time.\n\nThe system of the administrative and territorial division of the RSFSR was\ndeveloping haphazardly in the beginning of the 1920s: it was inconsistent,\nexpensive to maintain, and not very effective in practice. As a reaction to\nthat, the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on April 23,\n1924 decided to test a new system of the administrative division in two\nexperimental areas: one industrially developed and one agricultural. The South-\nEast became a testing ground for the new system in the agricultural area. On\nFebruary 13, 1924, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK)\nofficially defined the South-East as the area comprising the territories of Don\nand Kuban Oblasts, Terek and Stavropol Governorates, the city of Grozny, and Kabardino-\nBalkar, Karachay-Cherkess, Adyghe-Cherkess, and Chechen Autonomous\nOblasts The names of some of these administrative units, as used in the\ndefinition of the South-East, are inconsistent with their official names. The\narea of the South-East itself was inconsistently referred to as either \"South-\nEast\", or \"South-Eastern Oblast\", or \"South-Eastern Krai\". and mandated\nits division into districts ([[raion]]s) by the end of 1924. On June 2, 1924,\nthe Presidium of the VTsIK established a list of the new okrugs and districts\ninto which the \"South-Eastern Krai (Oblast)\" was to be divided. At the same\ntime, Kuban-Black Sea Oblast was abolished and replaced with four new okrugs,\nwhich were further divided into districts by the Executive Committee of Kuban-\nBlack Sea Oblast on July 19, 1924.\n\nSouth-Eastern Krai was renamed North Caucasus Krai by the Resolution of the\nPresidium of the VTsIK of October 16, 1924 and by the Resolution of the Krai\nExecutive Committee of November 16, 1924.\n","linknr":96,"url":"South-East,_Russian_SFSR","recorded":1364238279,"links":["/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Krai","/wiki/Oblast","/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","/w/index.php?title=Don_Oblast&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kuban-Black_Sea_Oblast","/wiki/Terek_Oblast","/wiki/Stavropol_Governorate","/wiki/Dagestan_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","/wiki/12th_Congress_of_the_Russian_Communist_Party_(Bolsheviks)","/wiki/All-Russian_Central_Executive_Committee","/wiki/Grozny","/wiki/Kabardino-Balkar_Autonomous_Oblast","/wiki/Karachay-Cherkess_Autonomous_Oblast","/wiki/Adyghe_Autonomous_Oblast","/wiki/Chechen_Autonomous_Oblast","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Raion","/wiki/Okrug","/wiki/North_Caucasus_Krai","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&oldid=542935265","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:History_of_the_administrative_divisions_of_Russia","/wiki/Category:Subdivisions_of_the_Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","/wiki/Category:Russia_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_coordinates","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Russian_language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=South-East%2C+Russian+SFSR&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=South-East%2C+Russian+SFSR","/wiki/South-East,_Russian_SFSR","/wiki/Talk:South-East,_Russian_SFSR","#","/wiki/South-East,_Russian_SFSR","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/South-East,_Russian_SFSR","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/South-East,_Russian_SFSR","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&oldid=542935265","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=South-East%2C_Russian_SFSR&id=542935265","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=South-East%2C+Russian+SFSR","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=South-East%2C+Russian+SFSR&oldid=542935265&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=South-East,_Russian_SFSR&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudeste,_RSFS_de_Rusia","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%92%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%A1%D1%85%D1%96%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_%D0%A0%D0%A0%D0%A4%D0%A1%D0%A0","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/South-East,
