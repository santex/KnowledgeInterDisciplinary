{"cursor":"1677","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry a 'convergent synthesis' is a strategy that aims to improve the\nefficiency of multi-step chemical synthesis, most often in organic synthesis. In\n'linear synthesis' the overall yield quickly drops with each reaction step:\n\n:A â B â C â D\n\nSuppose the yield is 50% for each reaction, the overall yield of D is only\n12.5% from A.\n\nIn a convergent synthesis\n\n:A â B (50%) :C â D (50%) :B + D â E (25%)\n\nthe overall yield of E (25%) looks much better. Convergent synthesis is applied\nin the synthesis of complex molecules (see total synthesis) and involve\n'fragment coupling' and 'independent synthesis'.\n\nExamples:\n* Convergent synthesis is encountered in dendrimer synthesis Convergent\n  Synthesis of Internally Branched PAMAM Dendrimers Michael Pittelkow, Jrn B.\n  Christensen Org. Lett., 7 (7), 1295 -1298, 2005 where branches (with the\n  number of generations preset) are connected to the central core\n* Proteins of up to 300 amino acids are produced by a convergent approach using\n  chemical ligation.\n* An example of its use in total synthesis is the final step (photochemical\n  [2+2]cycloaddition) towards the compound Biyouyanagin A: Total Synthesis\n  and Revised Structure of Biyouyanagin A K.
