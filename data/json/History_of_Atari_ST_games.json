{"cursor":"3355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nDuring the age of the home computer, computer games were an important part of\nthe software landscape. While its main competitor, the Commodore Amiga, had\nbetter hardware support for games, the Atari ST's aggressive pricing and a head\nstart in the marketplace insured that the ST still had a large selection of\ngames during its prime years. This page intends to show some of the most\nimportant games on the Atari ST.\n\nThe first games for the Atari ST were mostly ports from 8-bit platforms, like\n[[Hardball (computer game)|Hardball]] and [[SunDog Frozen Legacy|SunDog]], or\nfrom old arcade games like [[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]].\nAtari also acted as a publisher in the early years, but as third party support\nbecame stronger they focused solely on hardware.\n\nIn 1987 the first games that were designed for 16-bit computers arrived. The\nfirst 3D realtime role playing computer game, the highly rated [[Dungeon Master\n(video game)|Dungeon Master]], debuted on the ST. Other notable 16-bit games\nincluded graphic text adventures like The Guild of Thieves. Still, arcade\nconversions like [[Bubble Bobble]] were an important factor, and remained so\nuntil the end of the 16-bit era.\n\nAnother achievement on the Atari ST was the first multiplayer first-person\nshooter on a homecomputer: [[MIDI Maze]]. Using the ST's MIDI ports it allowed\nup to 15 simultaneous players in a simple 3D maze.\n\nIn 1988 more complex games, like [[Carrier Command]] and [[Falcon (computer\ngame)|Falcon]], became more common on the 16-bit home computers. But it also\nstarted a flood of TV and movie franchise games like Thundercats, which were\noften regarded as substandard games. Carrier Command and Starglider 2 were\nremarkable for being the first true 3D games using flat shading and in a complex\nuniverse. Thundercats shows a common problem of many Atari ST games: because the\nhardware does not support scrolling and the relatively slow CPU of the ST, games\nused large borders or frames around the actual playfield to reduce the amount of\ndata that needs to be copied.\n\n1989 was the peak of the ST's popularity. A large selection of games, including\nmilestones such as [[Populous]], appeared in that year.\n\nIn the 90s the Atari ST market became smaller, and so did the number of games.\nMany companies focused on the Amiga and released only their most popular games\nfor the ST, such as [[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]. But as with most\nsystems, the most technically advanced games appeared in this period. [[Lethal\nXcess]] impressed with smooth scrolling and a large number of sprites. [[No\nSecond Prize]] was not the first 3D racing game, but had a higher framerate than\nall others and thus appeared much smoother to the spectator. [[Alpha Waves]]\nfeatured full-screen flat-shaded 3D, and a dual-player split-screen mode.\n[[Frontier: Elite 2]] is regarded as the last major game for the Atari ST and\nwas released (after many delays) in 1994.\n","linknr":116,"url":"History_of_Atari_ST_games","recorded":1375058676,"links":["/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Home_computer","/wiki/Computer_games","/wiki/Software","/wiki/Commodore_Amiga","/wiki/Atari_ST","/wiki/Head_start_(positioning)","/wiki/Porting","/wiki/Hardball_(computer_game)","/wiki/SunDog_Frozen_Legacy","/wiki/Arcade_games","/wiki/Crystal_Castles_(video_game)","/wiki/Atari","/wiki/3D_computer_graphics","/wiki/Continuous_game","/wiki/Role-playing_game","/wiki/Dungeon_Master_(video_game)","/wiki/Bubble_Bobble","/wiki/Multiplayer","/wiki/First-person_shooter","/wiki/MIDI_Maze","/wiki/MIDI","/wiki/Carrier_Command","/wiki/Falcon_(computer_game)","/wiki/Flat_shading","/wiki/Scrolling","/wiki/Central_processing_unit","/wiki/Populous","/wiki/Atari_ST","/wiki/Amiga","/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)","/wiki/Lethal_Xcess","/wiki/Scrolling","/wiki/Sprite_(computer_science)","/w/index.php?title=No_Second_Prize&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Framerate","/wiki/Alpha_Waves","/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_2","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Atari_ST_games","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&oldid=549074766","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Atari_ST_games","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=History+of+Atari+ST+games&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=History+of+Atari+ST+games","/wiki/History_of_Atari_ST_games","/wiki/Talk:History_of_Atari_ST_games","#","/wiki/History_of_Atari_ST_games","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/History_of_Atari_ST_games","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/History_of_Atari_ST_games","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&oldid=549074766","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5775066","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=History_of_Atari_ST_games&id=549074766","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=History+of+Atari+ST+games","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=History+of+Atari+ST+games&oldid=549074766&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Atari_ST_games&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5775066#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Atari_ST_games","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//
