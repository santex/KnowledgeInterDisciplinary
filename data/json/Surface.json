{"cursor":"24065","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, specifically, in topology, a 'surface' is a two-dimensional,\ntopological manifold. The most familiar examples are those that arise as the\nboundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space\n'R' 3 — for example, the surface of a ball. On the other hand,\nthere are surfaces, such as the Klein bottle, that cannot be embedded in three-\ndimensional Euclidean space without introducing singularities or self-\nintersections.\n\nTo say that a surface is \"two-dimensional\" means that, about each point, there\nis a coordinate patch on which a two-dimensional coordinate system is defined.\nFor example, the surface of the Earth is (ideally) a two-dimensional sphere, and\nlatitude and longitude provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the\npoles and along the 180th meridian).\n\nThe concept of surface finds application in physics, engineering, computer\ngraphics, and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of\nphysical objects. For example, in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an\nairplane, the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface.\n","linknr":354,"url":"Surface","recorded":1362485648,"links":71,"instances":["topology","mathematics","mathematics","topology","topology","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","topology","manifold","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~biblio/numerisation/docs/G_GRAMAIN-55/pdf/G_GRAMAIN-55.pdf","http://new.math.uiuc.edu/zipproof/zipproof.pdf","http://new.math.uiuc.edu/zipproof/zipproof.pdf"],"categories":["Surfaces","Geometric
