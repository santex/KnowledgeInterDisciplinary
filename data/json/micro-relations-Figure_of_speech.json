{"cursor":"22908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'figure of speech' is the use of a word or words diverging from its usual\nmeaning. It can also be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words\nwith literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the\nliteral meaning of the words in it, as in idiom, metaphor, simile, hyperbole,\nor personification. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of\nexpression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as\nany figure of speech introduces an ambiguity between literal and figurative\ninterpretation. A figure of speech is sometimes called a rhetorical figure or\na locution.\n\nNot all theories of meaning have a concept of \"literal language\" (see literal\nand figurative language). Under theories that do not, figure of speech is not an\nentirely coherent concept.\n\nRhetoric originated as the study of the ways in which a source text can be\ntransformed to suit the goals of the person reusing the material. For this goal,\nclassical rhetoric detected four fundamental operations Jansen\n(2008), quote from the summary: Using these formulas, a pupil could\nrender the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author,\nthis principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new\ncreation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-\nmade framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire\ntexts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that\nfor the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at\nschool at a relatively early age, for example inthe improvement of pupilsâ own\nwriting.  that can be used to transform a sentence or a\nlarger portion of a text: expansion, abridgement, switching, transferring.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Figure_of_speech","recorded":1362371286,"links":54,"instances":["literary_device","literature","linguistic","rhetoric","rhetoric","figure_of_speech","rhetoric","linguistics","rhetoric","figure_of_speech","figure_of_speech","figure_of_speech","rhetorical","rhetoric","rhetoric","prosody","figure_of_speech","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Figures
