{"cursor":"6652","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cluster sampling' is a sampling technique used when \"natural\" but relatively\nhomogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. It is often used\nin marketing research. In this technique, the total population is divided into\nthese groups (or clusters) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected.\nThen the required information is collected from a simple random sample of the\nelements within each selected group. This may be done for every element in these\ngroups or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups. A\ncommon motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of\ninterviews and costs given the desired accuracy. Assuming a fixed sample size,\nthe technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the\npopulation is within the groups, not between them.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Cluster_sampling","recorded":1362567004,"links":14,"instances":["statistics"],"pdf":["http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/statmethodsforsamplesurveys/PDFs/Lecture5.pdf","http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/statmethodsforsamplesurveys/PDFs/Lecture5.pdf"],"categories":["Sampling techniques","Market research"],"headings":["Cluster elements","Aspects of cluster sampling","Advantage","Disadvantage","More on cluster sampling","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampling","statistics"],["sampling","statistics"]],"members":["sampling"],"related":["Sampling_(statistics)","Statistical_population","Marketing_research","Simple_random_sample","Mean","Stratified_sampling","Multistage_sampling","Estimator","Cluster_analysis","War","Famine","Natural_disaster","Sampling_error","Multistage_sampling","Simple_random_sampling","Sampling_(statistics)","Multistage_sampling","Simple_random_sampling"]}
