His wealth and influence enabled him to amass one of the\nfinest collections of neuropteroid insects and to describe many species from\naround the world. His collection is housed in the Royal Belgian Institute of\nNatural Sciences.\n\nHe was the author of Monographie des LibellulidÃ©es d'Europe (1840) and Faune\nBelge (1842).\n\nSelys-Longchamps was a wealthy aristocrat born at Paris. He was educated at home\nand never at University but became the leading student of Odonata (worldwide)\nand the Neuropteroid (worldwide) and Orthopteroid (mainly Europe) insects. He\nwas also a leading ornithologist. A liberal representative in the Belgian\nParliament he became Councillor for Waremme in 1846 entered the Belgian Senate\nin 1855 and was finally elected President of the Belgian Senate from 1880 -\n1884. His early interest in birds is shown by a book of coloured figures of\nBelgian species painted when he was 16.Ornithology remained a lifelong interest\nand he assembled an ornithological museum at Waremme maintaining a very large\ncollections of birds, both European and Exotic and including a great auk and an\negg. He was also interested in small mammals. At 18 ( 1831) he published his\nfirst scientific paper,a list of the insects of Liege and in 1837 a list of the,\ndragonflies or Odonata and butterflies and moths or Lepidoptera - of Belgium.\nFrom that date on a continuous flow of papers on the Odonata appeared. The works\nwere often monographic examples being, 1840 Monographie des Libellulides\nd'Europeand 1850 Revue des Odonates d'Europe, two large works on \"Gomphines\" and\n\"Calopterygines\". There were also synopses (works containing phylogenetic\nanalyses, tables and keys) of the \"Gomphines\", Calopterygines\", Agrionines\",\n\"Cordulines\" and ( generic only )\"Aeschnines\". The only family not treated\nsynoptically being the difficult \"Libellulines\". There are (very numerous) local\nfaunas for dragonflies, appendices to travel works, phylogenetic and\nmorphological notes. Selys-Lonchamps met and began a collaboration with Hermann\nAugust Hagen in 1845 They jointly the Revue and two monographs. Hagen also aided\nwork on the Synopses and sometimes Selys is given as the author in Kirbys\ncatalogue when Hagen is ( in many such instances it is clearly stated by de\nSelys that he had never seen the insects and that Hagen was the author). Selys\nis the properly attributed author of well over 1,000 species, an enormous number\ncompared to Hagen and more than half of known species. Aware of being an \"Homme\ndistrait\" Selys often affixed names to undescribed species in his collection (\nnomina nuda). This led to much later nomenclatural confusion. De Selys was an\ninveterate traveller spending long periods in most European countries and being\nan honorary member of almost all European entomological societies including the\nRoyal Entomological Society which so honoured him in 1871. He helped to found\nthe SocietÃ© Entomologique de Belgique in 1856.\n\nHe amassed the greatest collection of Neuroptera and Orthoptera in the world\nincorporating the collections of Pierre AndrÃ© Latreille, Jules PiÃ¨rre Rambur,\nJean Guillaume Audinet-Serville, and FÃ©lix Ãdouard GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville and wrote\nover 250 papers some of which are masterworks. His collection is in the Royal\nBelgian Institute of Natural Sciences although there are de Selys types in many\nother museums- for instance the Hope Department of Entomology, University of\nOxford. He died at LiÃ¨ge.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Edmond_de_Sélys_Longchamps","recorded":1375082241,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Blason_S%C3%A9lys-Longchamps.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Blason_S%C3%A9lys-Longchamps.svg/220px-Blason_S%C3%A9lys-Longchamps.svg.png","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Belgian_Senate","/wiki/Camille_de_Tornaco","/wiki/Jules_d%27Anethan","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/First_French_Empire","/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Belgium)","/wiki/File:Michel_edmond_de_selys_longchamps.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Michel_edmond_de_selys_longchamps.JPG/170px-Michel_edmond_de_selys_longchamps.JPG","/wiki/File:Michel_edmond_de_selys_longchamps.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Liberalism","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Scientist","/wiki/Dragonflies","/wiki/Damselflies","/wiki/Royal_Belgian_Institute_of_Natural_Sciences","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Odonata","/wiki/Neuroptera","/wiki/Orthoptera","/wiki/Ornithology","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Waremme","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Belgian_Senate","/wiki/Belgian_Senate","/wiki/Great_auk","/wiki/Mammals","/wiki/Odonata","/wiki/Lepidoptera","/wiki/Monograph","/wiki/Synopses","/wiki/Phylogenetic","/wiki/Genus","/w/index.php?title=Synoptically&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Phylogenetic","/wiki/Morphology_(biology)","/wiki/Hermann_August_Hagen","/wiki/Nomina_nuda","/wiki/Royal_Entomological_Society","/wiki/Royal_Belgian_Entomological_Society","/wiki/Neuroptera","/wiki/Orthoptera","/wiki/Pierre_Andr%C3%A9_Latreille","/wiki/Jules_Pi%C3%A8rre_Rambur","/wiki/Jean_Guillaume_Audinet-Serville","/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_%C3%89douard_Gu%C3%A9rin-M%C3%A9neville","/wiki/Royal_Belgian_Institute_of_Natural_Sciences","/wiki/Biological_type","/wiki/Hope_Department_of_Entomology","/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge","#Works","#See_also","#External_links","#References","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hermann_August_Hagen","http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k26769q","http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/loader?did=D73957","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Belgium)","/wiki/Liberalism_in_Belgium","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit&section=3","http://users.pandora.be/tailly/lib/odolit.htm","http://www.liberaalarchief.be/D.html","http://dz-srv1.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub/digbib/doasearch?sa1=Author&sv1=Selys%2DLongchamps%2CEdm%2E%20de","http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent591k/stamps/entframeset.html","http://reflexions.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_26170/a-life-day-by-day","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Camille_de_Tornaco","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Belgian_Senate","/wiki/Jules_d%27Anethan","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/78775131","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/France","/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge","/wiki/Belgium","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_Sélys_Longchamps&oldid=553196420","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1813_births","/wiki/Category:1900_deaths","/wiki/Category:Belgian_entomologists","/wiki/Category:Belgian_ornithologists","/wiki/Category:Lepidopterists","/wiki/Category:Belgian_politicians","/wiki/Category:Belgian_scientists","/wiki/Category:Presidents_of_the_Senate_(Belgium)","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmond+de+S%C3%A9lys+Longchamps&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmond+de+S%C3%A9lys+Longchamps","/wiki/Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps","/wiki/Talk:Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps","#","/wiki/Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_de_S%C3%A9lys_Longchamps&a
