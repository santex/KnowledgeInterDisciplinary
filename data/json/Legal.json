Lady Justice is depicted as a goddess equipped with\n three symbols of justice: a sword symbolising the court's coercive power;\n scales representing an objective standard by which competing claims are\n weighed; and a blindfold indicating that justice is or should be meted out\n objectively, without fear or favor, regardless of power, money, wealth, or\n identity. Luban, Law's Blindfold, 23 ]]\n\n'Law' is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social\ninstitutions to govern behavior .Robertson, Crimes against humanity, 90; see \"analytical jurisprudence\"\nfor extensive debate on what law is; in [[The Concept of Law]] Hart argued law\nis a \"system of rules\" (Campbell, The Contribution of Legal Studies, 184);\nAustin said law was \"the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a\nsanction\" (Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]);\nDworkin describes law as an \"interpretive concept\" to achieve justice (Dworkin,\nLaw's Empire, 410); and Raz argues law is an \"authority\" to mediate people's\ninterests (Raz, The Authority of Law, 3â36). Laws are made by governments,\nspecifically by their legislatures. The formation of laws themselves may be\ninfluenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded\ntherein. The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and\nserves as a social mediator of relations between people.\n\nA general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions (including\nCanon and Socialist law), in which the legislature or other central body\ncodifies and consolidates their laws, and common law systems (including Islamic\nlaw), where judge-made binding precedents are accepted. Historically, religious\nlaws played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is\nstill the case in some countries, particularly Islamic.\n\nThe adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. Criminal\nlaw deals with conduct that is considered harmful to social order and in which\nthe guilty party may be imprisoned or fined. Civil law (not to be confused with\ncivil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of lawsuits (disputes)\nbetween individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a legal\nremedy (often monetary damages) to the winning litigant.\n\nUnder civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: Contract law\nregulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets.\nProperty law regulates the transfer and title of personal property and real\nproperty. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial\nsecurity. Tort law allows claims for compensation if a person's property is\nharmed. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the\nprotection of human rights and the election of political representatives.\nAdministrative law is used to review the decisions of government agencies.\nInternational law governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging\nfrom trade to military action.\n\nTo implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public\nservants, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While\nall these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an\nindependent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support\ntheir progress.\n\nLaw provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy,\neconomic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues\nconcerning equality, fairness, and justice. \"In its majestic equality\", said the\nauthor Anatole France in 1894, \"the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep\nunder bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.\" The original\nFrench is: \"La loi, dans un grand souci d'Ã©galitÃ©, interdit aux riches comme aux\npauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain\"\n(France, The Red Lily, [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-\nlily/8/ Chapter VII]). Writing in 350 BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle\ndeclared, \"The rule of law is better than the rule of any\nindividual.\" Aristotle. Politics, Book 3#3:16. n.b. This translation reads,\n\"it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens\"\n\nIn a presidential democracy, the constitution is sovereign and the central\ninstitutions for interpreting and creating law are the three main branches of\ngovernment, namely an impartial judiciary, a democratic legislature, and an\naccountable executive. In parliamentary systems, the legislature is sovereign\nand appoints one of its members as the executive (often called the prime\nminister). The judicial branch is under the parliament.\n","linknr":2245,"url":"Legal","recorded":1362486250,"links":209,"instances":["law","government","political_custom","polity","law","penalty","law","political_philosophy","british_coin","legal_philosopher","consolidation_act_1992","economics","penology","disambiguation","criminal","economics","economics","law","law","law","law","law","tort","finance","law","legal","economics","law","law","criminal_law","theory","finance","historiography","legal_system","tort","law","political","proposed_law","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf","http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf","http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf","http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf","http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf","http://www.law.uiuc.edu/publications/cll&pj/archive/vol_25/issue_1/JacobyArticle25-1.pdf","http://www.law.uiuc.edu/publications/cll&pj/archive/vol_25/issue_1/JacobyArticle25-1.pdf","http://www.mises.org/etexts/bureaucracy.pdf","http://www.mises.org/etexts/bureaucracy.pdf","http://www.reds.msh-paris.fr/publications/revue/pdf/ds11-12/ds011012-05.pdf","http://www.reds.msh-paris.fr/publications/revue/pdf/ds11-12/ds011012-05.pdf","http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v36-issue2/smith.pdf","http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v36-issue2/smith.pdf","https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/wilcoxc//CivilSociety.pdf","https://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/wilcoxc//CivilSociety.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf","http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf","http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf"],"categories":["Law|","Social
