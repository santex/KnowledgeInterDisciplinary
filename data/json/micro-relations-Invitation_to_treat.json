It comes from the Latin phrase invitatio ad offerendum\nand means \"inviting an offer\". Or as Andrew Burrows writes, an invitation\nto treat is\n\n \"an expression of willingness to negotiate. A person making an\ninvitation to treat does not intend to be bound as soon as it is accepted by the\nperson to whom the statement is addressed.\" Burrows (2007) 5\n\n\nContract lawyers distinguish this from a binding offer, which can be accepted\nto form a contract (subject to other conditions being met). The distinction\nbetween an offer and invitation to treat is best understood through the\ncategories that the courts create. Invitations to treat include the display of\ngoods; the advertisement of a price or an auction; and an invitation for\ntenders (or competitive bids). There may however be statutory or complementary\nobligations, so consumer protection laws prohibit misleading advertising and at\nauctions without reserve there is always a duty to sell to the highest [[bona\nfide]] bidder.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Invitation_to_treat","recorded":1362686022,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Contract law","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["Case law","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Contract_law","Consumer_protection","Misleading_advertising","Call_for_bids","Auction","Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","Barry_v_Davies","Contract_of_sale","Bait_and_switch","Flick_knife","Advertisements","Contract","Offer_and_acceptance"]}
