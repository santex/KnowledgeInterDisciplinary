This is accomplished through more\neffective products, processes, services, technologies, or ideas that are readily\navailable to markets, governments and society. The term innovation can be\ndefined as something original and new that \"breaks in to\" the market or into\nsociety. One usually associates to new phenomena that are important in some way.\nA definition of the term, in line with these aspects, would be the following:\n\"An innovation is something original, new, and important - in whatever field -\nthat breaks in to (or obtains a foothold in) a market or society.\"<ref>Based on\nFrankelius, P. (2009), Questioning two myths in innovation literature, Journal\nof High Technology Management Research, Vol. 20, No. 1, pp. 40–51.</ref>\n\nWhile something novel is often described as an innovation, in economics,\nmanagement science and other fields of practice and analysis it is generally\nconsidered a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they\nhave an impact on society.\n\nInnovation differs from invention in that innovation refers to the use of a\nbetter and, as a result, novel idea or method, whereas invention refers more\ndirectly to the creation of the idea or method itself.\n\nInnovation differs from improvement in that innovation refers to the notion of\ndoing something different rather than doing the same thing better.\n","title":"innovation","headings":["Inter-disciplinary views","Measures","Rate of innovation","Government policies","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3:
