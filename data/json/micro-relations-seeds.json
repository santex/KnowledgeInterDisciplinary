{"cursor":"48695","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n seeds]] A 'seed' is a small embryonic plant enclosed in a covering called the\n seed coat, usually with some stored food. It is the product of the ripened\n ovule of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants which occurs after fertilization and\n some growth within the mother plant. The formation of the seed completes the\n process of reproduction in seed plants (started with the development of\n flowers and pollination), with the embryo developed from the zygote and the\n seed coat from the integuments of the ovule. All seeds are different size,\n shape and colour.\n\nSeeds have been an important development in the reproduction and spread of\nflowering plants, relative to more primitive plants such as mosses, ferns and\nliverworts, which do not have seeds and use other means to propagate themselves.\nThis can be seen by the success of seed plants (both gymnosperms and\nangiosperms) in dominating biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands\nboth in hot and cold climates.\n\nThe term \"seed\" also has a general meaning that antedates the aboveâanything\nthat can be sown, e.g. \"seed\" potatoes, \"seeds\" of corn or sunflower \"seeds\". In\nthe case of sunflower and corn \"seeds\", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a\nshell or husk, whereas the potato is a tuber.\n","linknr":821,"url":"seeds","recorded":1362686227,"links":100,"instances":["fruit","condiment","plant","fruit","botany","biology","biology","vegetable","fruit","biology","botany","physics","fluid","tree"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Seeds|","Plant
