It comes from the Sanskrit word \"Siá¹ƒha\" ('ng' sound), which\nmeans lion.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the term 'Sinha' (or 'Siha' / 'Sinhe' / 'Singhe' / 'Singha') have\ncommonly been used by the Sinhalese (or Sinhala). When it comes to the term\n'Sinhala' itself, the first part of the word, Sinha stands for 'lion' while la\nor le stands for 'Blood', giving the meaning Lions blood. The word Simhmam (or\n'Singam' / 'Singham' / 'Singhai' / 'Singai') is the Sri Lankan Tamil derivative.\nIn northern and middle part of India Sinhraj is also use, giving the meaning\nLion king.\n\nThe more common surnames, \"Singh\" in India and \"Weerasingha\", \"Jayasinghe\",\n\"Wijesinghe\", \"Edirisinghe\", \"Singaiariyan\" etc. in Sri Lanka share this same\nroot. As a surname, Sinha is mainly used by Kandyan, Kshatriya, Kurmi<ref\nname=\"sinha kurmi\"></ref> - Rajput's and Kayastha's as well as some Brahmins\n(Bhumihar), in Orissa and South West Bengal (Northern Rurh region-Burdwan belt),\nSinha is also a shortened version of the surname Singha-Maha-Patra, a Utkal\nBrahmin surname. In Gujarat, the Sinha / Sinh surname is mostly used by Vaishnav\nVaniyas, a trader class and rajputs.\n\nBeing landholding sub-castes of Brahmins, among Bhumihar Brahmins and Maithil\nBrahmins, some of them have secular titles like Singh interchangeably as\nSinha.<ref name=\"Using surnames to conceal identity\">{{cite news\n | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-\n | 21/patna/28055564_1_surnames-caste-identity-kumar-suresh-singh title = Using\n | surnames to conceal identity publisher = The Times of India date = 2009-02-21\n | accessdate = 2013-01-18\n}}</ref> The general editor of the book \"People of India (Bihar and Jharkhand)\",\npublished by Anthropological Survey of India (ASI), and noted academician-\nbureaucrat, the late Kumar Suresh Singh, said that the surname \"Singh\", which\nused to denote connection with power and authority, was used in Bihar by Brahmin\nzamindars, like the surname \"Khan\" in Muslims.<ref name=\"Using surnames to\nconceal identity\"/>\n\nSinha is also an unrelated name found in Brazil.\n","title":"sinha","headings":["Notable people named Sinha","Notable destinations named after Sinha"]},"micro-relation":["7: Sri_Lanka","3: Sinhalese_people","3: Bollywood","3: King","2: India","2: Lion","2: Singh","2: Bhumihar","2: Brahmin","2: Banaili","2: Mahanuwara","2: Kandy","1: Indian_subcontinent","1: Sanskrit","1: Blood","1: Sri_Lankan_Tamil","1: Weerasingha","1: Jayasinghe","1: Wijesinghe","1: Edirisinghe","1: Singaiariyan","1: Kandyan","1: Kshatriya","1: Kurmi","1: Orissa","1: West_Bengal","1: Utkal_Plains","1: Gujarat","1: Vaishnav","1: Maithil_Brahmins","1: The_Times_of_India","1: Anthropological_Survey_of_India","1: Kumar_Suresh_Singh","1: Brazil","1: Shatrughan_Sinha","1: Yashwant_Sinha","1: Finance_Minister","1: Sonakshi_Sinha","1: Sri_Krishna_Sinha","1: Indradeep_Sinha","1: Ganga_Sharan_Sinha","1: Sandali_Sinha","1: Paul_Sinha","1: Raja_Bahadur_Kirtyanand_Sinha","1: Rajkumar_Shyamanand_Sinha","1: Satyendra_Narayan_Sinha","1: Ram_Dulari_Sinha","1: Mala_Sinha","1: Actress","1: Ranasinghe_Premadasa","1: President","1: Sri_Vikrama_Rajasinha","1: Vikrama_Rajasinha","1: Singai_Pararasasegaram","1: Rajarata","1: Jaffna","1: Bidya_Sinha_Mim","1: Ripu_R_Sinha","1: Upendra_K_Sinha","1: Allison_Sinha","1: Shouvik_Sinha","1: DeLon","1: Musician","1: Rapper","1: Hip-hop","1: Artist","1: Esita_Sinha","1: Raju_Sinha","1: Sigiriya","1: Singapore"]}
