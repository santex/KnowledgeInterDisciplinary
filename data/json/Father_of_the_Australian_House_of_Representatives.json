It is held by the member who has served longer,\ncontinuously, than any other currently serving member. Where two or more members\nhave equal lengths of continuous service, more than any other currently serving\nmembers, they are known as the joint Fathers of the House of Representatives.\nJoint Fathers are shown in small type in the following list.\n\nThe only Father of the House of Representatives with broken service but whose\nlatter period of continuous service was sufficiently long to qualify was\nEddie Ward.\n\nThe first House of Representatives was elected in March 1901. The election was\nheld on Friday 29 March in South Australia and Tasmania, and on Saturday 30\nMarch in the other states. Despite that slight variation in the election date,\nall the members elected to the First Parliament were considered to have had\nequal seniority. It follows that there could not be a \"longest-serving member\"\nuntil only one member from the First Parliament was still in the House. That\noccurred on 8 April 1935 with the death of David Watkins, leaving Billy Hughes\nas the inaugural Father of the House of Representatives. Hughes was also the\ninaugural Father of the Parliament from 1938.\n\nSince that date the Fathers and joint Fathers of the House of Representatives\nhave been:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!From !To !Member !Continuous  term started !Status\n|- 9 April 1935 28 October 1952\n|Billy Hughes\n|30 March 1901 Father - 29 October 1952 9 December 1961 Sir Earle Page 13\n|December 1919\n|Father\n|- 10 December 1961 31 July 1963\n|Eddie Ward\n| 6 February 1932 Eddie Ward also served between 7 March 1931 and 19\n| December 1931.
