Menopause is an event that typically (but not always) occurs in\nwomen in midlife, during their late 40s or early 50s, and it signals the end of\nthe fertile phase of a woman's life. However, rather than being\ndefined by the state of the uterus and the absence of menstrual flow, menopause\nis more accurately defined as the permanent cessation of the primary functions\nof the ovaries Whales and humans linked by 'helpful grandmothers â BBC News : the\nripening and release of ova and the release of hormones that cause both the\ncreation of the uterine lining, and the subsequent shedding of the uterine\nlining (a.k.a. the menses or the period).\n\nThis transition from a potentially reproductive to a non-reproductive state is\nthe result of a reduction in female hormonal production by the ovaries. This\ntransition is normally not sudden or abrupt, tends to occur over a period of\nyears, and is a consequence of biological aging. However, for some women, the\naccompanying signs and effects that can occur during the menopause transition\nyears can significantly disrupt their daily activities and sense of well-being.\nIn addition, women who have some sort of functional disorder affecting the\nreproductive system (e.g., endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, cancer of\nthe reproductive organs) can go into menopause at a younger age than the normal\ntimeframe. The functional disorders often significantly speed up the menopausal\nprocess and create more significant health problems, both physical and\nemotional, for the affected woman.\n\nThe word \"menopause\" was coined specifically for human females, where the end of\nfertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly\nmenstruations. However, menopause also exists in some other animals, many of\nwhich do not have monthly menstruation; in this case,\nthe term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the\nnatural lifespan.\n\nThe date of menopause in human females is formally medically defined as the time\nof the last menstrual period (or menstrual flow of any amount, however small),\nin those women who have not had a hysterectomy. Women who have their uterus\nremoved but retain their ovaries do not immediately go into menopause, even\nthough their periods cease. Adult women who have their ovaries removed however,\ngo immediately into full 'surgical menopause', no matter how young they are.\n\nMenopause is an unavoidable change that every woman will experience, assuming\nshe reaches middle age and beyond. It is helpful if women are able to learn what\nto expect and what options are available to assist the transition, if that\nbecomes necessary. Menopause has a wide starting range, but can usually be\nexpected in the age range of 42â58. Bucher, et\nal. 1930 An early menopause can be related to cigarette smoking, higher\nbody mass index, racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, chemotherapy, radiation\nand the surgical removal of the ovaries, with or without the removal of the\nuterus.\n\nMenopause can be officially declared (in an adult woman who is not pregnant, is\nnot lactating, and who has an intact uterus) when there has been amenorrhea\n(absence of any menstruation) for one complete year. However, there are many\nsigns and effects that lead up to this point, many of which may extend well\nbeyond the \"official\" declaration date of menopause. These include: irregular\nmenses, vasomotor instability (hot flashes and night sweats), atrophy of\ngenitourinary tissue, increased stress, breast tenderness, vaginal dryness,\nforgetfulness, mood changes, and in certain cases osteoporosis and/or heart\ndisease. Bucher, et al., 1931 These effects are related to the\nhormonal changes a woman's body is going through, and they affect each woman to\na different extent. The only sign or effect that all women universally have in\ncommon is that by the end of the menopause transition every woman will have a\ncomplete cessation of menses.\n","linknr":1156,"url":"Menopause","recorded":1362485005,"links":66,"instances":["dt56a","biology","menopause","mood","medical"],"pdf":["http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf","http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/hw/McAuliffe_Whitehead_2005.pdf"],"categories":["Aging","Endocrinology","Menopause|*","Menstrual
