They are a subset of the general class of halocarbons, although the\ndistinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and,\nconsequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used\nas flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents,\nand pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many\nhalocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For\nexample, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion.\nMethyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain\nchlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated\nvolatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl\niodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting\nproperties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated\nthe compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane.\nHaloalkane or alkyl halies are the compounds which have the general formua â³RXâ³\nwhere R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F,Cl,Br,I).\n\nHaloalkanes have been known for centuries. Ethyl chloride was produced\nsynthetically in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds\ndeveloped in the 19th century in step with the development of organic chemistry\nand the understanding of the structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for\nthe selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods\nincluded the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and\nthe conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and\nso easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in\nindustrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other\nfunctional groups.\n\nWhile most haloalkanes are human-produced, non-artificial-source haloalkanes\ndo occur on Earth, mostly through enzyme-mediated synthesis by bacteria,\nfungi, and especially sea macroalgae (seaweeds). More than 1600 halogenated\norganics have been identified, with bromoalkanes being the most common\nhaloalkanes. Brominated organics in biology range from biologically produced\nmethyl bromide to non-alkane aromatics and unsaturates (indoles, terpenes,\nacetogenins, and phenols). {{Cite journal| journal = Natural Product\nReports | year = 2004 | volume = 21 | pages =180–188 | doi =\n10.1039/b302337k | title = The role of vanadium bromoperoxidase in the\nbiosynthesis of halogenated marine natural products\n| first = Alison | last = Butler | coauthors = Catter-Facklin, Jayen M. | pmid =\n| 15039842 | issue = 1}}\nPMID 19363038 Review of vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases in nature\n Halogenated alkanes in land plants are more rare, but do occur, as for\nexample the fluoroacetate produced as a toxin by at least 40 species of known\nplants.
