The poem fell into obscurity for decades, and its existence did not\nbecome widely known again until it was printed in 1815 in an edition prepared by\nthe Icelandic-Danish scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin.\n\nIn the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats in Scandinavia, comes to the help of\nHroðgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall (in Heorot) has been under\nattack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother\nattacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to\nGeatland in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty\nyears has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the\nbattle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a tumulus, a burial mound,\nin Geatland.\n",
