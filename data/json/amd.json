Its main products include\nmicroprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics\nprocessors for servers, workstations and personal computers, and embedded\nsystems applications.\n\nAMD is the second-largest global supplier of microprocessors based on the x86\narchitecture (behind Intel) and also one of the largest suppliers of graphics\nprocessing units. It also owns 8.6% of Spansion, a supplier of non-volatile\nflash memory.<ref name=\"AMD 10k sec filing\"></ref>\n\nAMD is the only significant rival to Intel in the central processor (CPU) market\nfor (x86 based) personal computers. Since acquiring ATI in 2006, AMD and its\ncompetitor Nvidia have dominated the discrete graphics processor unit (GPU)\nmarket.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Advanced%20Micro%20Devices","headings":["Corporate
