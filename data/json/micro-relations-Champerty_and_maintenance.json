{"cursor":"12484","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Champerty and maintenance' are doctrines in common law jurisdictions, that aim\nto preclude frivolous litigation. \"Maintenance\" is the intermeddling of a\ndisinterested party to encourage a lawsuit. It is \"A taking in hand,\na bearing up or upholding of quarrels or sides, to the disturbance of the common\nright.\" Coke (1641) Institutes \"Champerty\" is the \"maintenance\" of a\nperson in a lawsuit on condition that the subject matter of the action is to be\nshared with the maintainer. Among laypersons, this is known as\n\"buying into someone else's lawsuit.\"\n\n\n\nAt common law, 'maintenance' and 'champerty' were both crimes and torts, as was\nbarratry, the bringing of vexatious litigation. This is generally no longer so\nas during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to\nobviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen\nwill case (1856â1864). However, the principles are relevant to modern\ncontingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by\na plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the\ncase. Champertous contracts can still, depending on jurisdiction, be void for\npublic policy or attract liability for costs.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Champerty_and_maintenance","recorded":1362667643,"links":16,"instances":["english_law","law","law","law","common_law"],"pdf":["http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/UploadFiles/Publications/Publication_79_174_R72.pdf","http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2003/2003-ohio-2721.pdf","http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/072803financing-decision.pdf","http://www.hofstra.edu/PDF/law_lawrev_marcushamer_vol33no4.pdf"],"categories":["Legal terms","Tort law","Legal ethics","Legal costs","Abuse of the legal system"],"headings":["History","By jurisdiction","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/100px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["barratry","common_law"],["assignment","law"],["void","law"],["public_policy","law"],["costs","law"],["costs","english_law"]],"members":["costs","public_policy","assignment","void","barratry"],"related":["Common_law","Jurisdiction","Frivolous_litigation","Lawsuit","Edward_Coke","Crime","Tort","Barratry_(common_law)","Vexatious_litigation","Legal_ethics","Swynfen_will_case","Contingent_fee","Lawyer","Assignment_(law)","Plaintiff","Void_(law)","Public_policy_(law)","Legal_liability","Costs_(law)","Medieval","England","Nobility","Royal_court","Fraud","Judicial_independence","Jeremy_Bentham","Australia","Cause_of_action","Crime","Tort","Criminal_Law_Act_1967","Criminal_Law_Act_1967","Embracery","Bribery_Act_2010","Costs_(English_law)","Superior_Courts_Act_1981","Wrongful_trading","New_Zealand_Law_Commission","New_Zealand_Law_Commission","Nevada","Ohio","Litigation_funding","Subpoena_ad_testificandum"]}
