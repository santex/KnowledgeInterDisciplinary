It may occur spontaneously\nin nature, or as a result of exposure to mutagens. It can also be achieved\nexperimentally using laboratory procedures. In nature mutagenesis can lead to\ncancer and various heritable diseases, but it is also the driving force of\nevolution. Mutagenesis as a science was developed based on work done by Hermann\nMuller, Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson in the first half of the 20th\ncentury.<ref></ref>\n",
