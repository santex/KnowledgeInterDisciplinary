{"cursor":"15697","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science, 'array programming languages' (also known as 'vector' or\n'multidimensional' languages) generalize operations on scalars to apply\ntransparently to vectors, matrices, and higher dimensional arrays.\n\nArray programming primitives concisely express broad ideas about data\nmanipulation. The level of conciseness can be dramatic in certain cases: it is\nnot uncommon to find array programming language one-liners that require more\nthan a couple of pages of Java code.\n\nAPL, designed by Ken Iverson, was the first programming language to provide\narray programming capabilities. The mnemonic APL refers to the title of his\nseminal book \"A Programming Language\" and not to arrays per se. Iverson's\ncontribution to rigor and clarity was probably more important than the simple\nextension of dimensions to functions.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Array_programming","recorded":1362540282,"links":14,"instances":["computing","programming_language","instruction_set","mathematics","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","geometric","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language_from_kx_systems","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Array programming languages|","Programming paradigms"],"headings":["Concepts","Uses","Languages","Mathematical reasoning and language notation","Third party libraries","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scalar","computing"],["vector","geometric"],["matrix","mathematics"],["scalar","computing"],["reduce","higher-order_function"],["mmx","instruction_set"],["apl","programming_language"],["a+","programming_language"],["idl","programming_language"],["k","programming_language"],["q","programming_language_from_kx_systems"],["r","programming_language"],["s-lang","programming_language"],["zpl","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["pascal","programming_language"],["armadillo","c++_library"]],"members":["scalar","r","mmx","matrix","pascal","zpl","k","idl","apl","vector","reduce","armadillo","c","q","c_sharp"],"related":["Computer_science","Scalar_(computing)","Vector_(geometric)","Matrix_(mathematics)","One-liner_program","APL_programming_language","Kenneth_E._Iverson","Programming_language","High-level_programming_language","Scalar_(computing)","Function_rank","Tensor","Cross_product","Matrix_multiplication","Reduce_(higher-order_function)","Intel","MMX_(instruction_set)","SSSE3","3DNow!","SIMD","Parallel_computing","MIMD","APL_(programming_language)","J_programming_language","Fortran","A+_(programming_language)","IDL_(programming_language)","K_(programming_language)","Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)","Mathematica","MATLAB","MOLSF","NumPy","GNU_Octave","Perl_Data_Language","R_(programming_language)","S-Lang_(programming_language)","SAC_programming_language","Nial_programming_language","ZPL_(programming_language)","C_(programming_language)","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","Pascal_(programming_language)","PDF","Algorithmic_efficiency","Optimizing_compiler","Computational_overhead","Ada","MATLAB","GNU_Octave","Augmented_assignment","Matrix_inversion","System_of_linear_equations","Mooreâ€“Penrose_pseudoinverse","Nial","Transpose","Determinant","Matrix_inversion","Associativity","Relational_operator","Associativity","Commutativity","Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software","LAPACK","C++","Operator_overloading","Armadillo_(C++_library)","Blitz++","Array_slicing"]}
