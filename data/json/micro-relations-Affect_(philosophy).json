For Spinoza,\nas discussed in Parts Two and Three of his [[Ethics (book)|Ethics]], affects are\nstates of mind and body related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings\nand emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy\n(laetitia), Part III, Proposition 56. {{cite book\n|last=Spinoza |first=Benedictus de |authorlink=Baruch Spinoza |others=Trans. by\nW.H.

Affects are\ndifficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, \"an affect or\npassion of the mind [animi pathema] is a confused idea\" which is only perceived\nby the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force.
