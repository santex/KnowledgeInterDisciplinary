The totality of\nfossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossiliferous\n(fossil-containing) rock formations and sedimentary layers (strata) is known as\nthe fossil record.\n\nThe study of fossils across geological time, how they were formed, and the\nevolutionary relationships between taxa (phylogeny) are some of the most\nimportant functions of the science of paleontology. Such a preserved specimen is\ncalled a \"fossil\" if it is older than some minimum age, most often the arbitrary\ndate of 10,000&nbsp;years.<ref></ref> Hence, fossils range in age from the\nyoungest at the start of the Holocene Epoch to the oldest from the Archaean Eon,\nup to 3.4&nbsp;billion&nbsp;years old.<ref><br/></ref> The observation that\ncertain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led early geologists to\nrecognize a geological timescale in the 19th century. The development of\nradiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed geologists to\ndetermine the numerical or \"absolute\" age of the various strata and thereby the\nincluded fossils.\n\nLike extant organisms, fossils vary in size from microscopic, even single\nbacterial cells<ref> {{cite journal\n | last = Westall first = Frances title = Early Archean fossil bacteria and\n | biofilms in hydrothermally influenced sediments from the Barberton\n | greenstone belt, South Africa journal = Precambrian Research volume = 106 |\n | issue = 1–2 | pages = 93–116 url =\n | http://ieg.or.kr:8080/abstractII/E0210601006.html doi = 10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00127-\n | 3 year = 2001 display-authors = 1 last2 = De Wit first2 = Maarten J last3 =\n | Dann first3 = Jesse last4 = Van Der Gaast first4 = Sjerry last5 = De Ronde\n | first5 = Cornel E.J last6 = Gerneke first6 = Dane}}\n</ref> one micrometer in diameter, to gigantic, such as dinosaurs and trees many\nmeters long and weighing many tons. A fossil normally preserves only a portion\nof the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized\nduring life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or\ncalcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. Fossils may also consist of the marks\nleft behind by the organism while it was alive, such as the footprint or feces\n(coprolites) of a reptile. These types of fossil are called trace fossils (or\nichnofossils), as opposed to body fossils. Finally, past life leaves some\nmarkers that cannot be seen but can be detected in the form of biochemical\nsignals; these are known as chemofossils or biomarkers.\n",
