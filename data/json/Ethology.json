The focus of ethology is on animal\nbehaviour under natural conditions, as opposed to behaviourism, which\nfocuses on behavioural response studies in a laboratory setting.\n\nMany naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history.\nThe modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during\nthe 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian\nbiologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, joint winners of the 1973 Nobel\nPrize in Physiology or Medicine. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medici-\nne/laureates/1973/index.html Nobel Prize page] for 1973 Medicine Award to\nTinbergen, Lorenz, and von Frisch for contributions in ethology Ethology\nis a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to\ncertain other disciplines such as neuroanatomy, ecology, and evolution.\nEthologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a\nparticular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour (e.g. aggression)\nin a number of unrelated animals.\n\nThe desire to understand animals has made ethology a rapidly growing field.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, many aspects of animal communication, animal\nemotions, animal culture, learning, and even sexual conduct that experts long\nthought they understood, have been re-examined, and new conclusions reached. New\nfields have developed, such as neuroethology.\n\nUnderstanding ethology or animal behaviour can be important in animal training.\nConsidering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables the\ntrainer to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task. It\nalso enables the trainer to encourage the performance of naturally-occurring\nbehaviours and also the discontinuance of undesirable behaviours.
