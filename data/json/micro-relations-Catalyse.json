Unlike other reagents that\nparticipate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction\nitself. A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations.\nCatalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts. Substances that\nslow a catalyst's effect in a chemical reaction are called inhibitors.\nSubstances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and\nsubstances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons.\n\nCatalytic reactions have a lower rate-limiting free energy of activation than\nthe corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in higher reaction rate at the\nsame temperature. However, the mechanistic explanation of catalysis is complex.\nCatalysts may affect the reaction environment favorably, or bind to the reagents\nto polarize bonds, e.g. acid catalysts for reactions of carbonyl compounds, or\nform specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate\nesters in osmium tetroxide-catalyzed dihydroxylation of alkenes, or cause\ndissociation of reagents to reactive forms, such as atomic hydrogen in catalytic\nhydrogenation.\n\nKinetically, catalytic reactions are typical chemical reactions; i.e. the\nreaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-\ndetermining step. Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and\nrates are limited by amount of catalyst and its \"activity\". In heterogeneous\ncatalysis, the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products\nfrom the surface can be rate determining. A Nanomaterial-based catalyst is an\nexample of a heterogeneous catalyst. Analogous events associated with substrate\nbinding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.\n\nAlthough catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be\ninhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes. In heterogeneous\ncatalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst\nbecomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous\ncatalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solidâliquid system or evaporate\nin a solidâgas system.\n","linknr":596,"url":"Catalyse","recorded":1362900882,"links":86,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","thermodynamics","molecular","chemistry","fire_starter","matter","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.climatetechnology.gov/library/2005/tech-options/tor2005-143.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/qm3732u7x7577224/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/qm3732u7x7577224/fulltext.pdf","http://aci.anorg.chemie.tu-muenchen.de/wah/vortraege/catalysis.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical
