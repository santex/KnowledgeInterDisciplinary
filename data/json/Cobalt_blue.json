Cobalt blue pigments are extremely stable, and have historically been\nused as colouring agents in ceramics, (especially Chinese porcelain),\njewellery, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based\ncobalt pigment smalt.\n\nChemically, cobalt blue pigment is a cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or\ncobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl 2O 4. The compound is made by\nsintering finely ground CoO and Al 2O 3 (alumina) at\n1200 Â°C. Cobalt blue is lighter and less intense than (iron-cyanide based)\nPrussian blue.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Cobalt_blue","recorded":1362903133,"links":33,"instances":["painter"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Inorganic pigments","Cobalt compounds","French inventions","Shades of blue"],"headings":["Historical uses and production","Cobalt blue in human culture","Toxicity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Cobalt_Blue.JPG/220px-Cobalt_Blue.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Gtk-dialog-info.svg/16px-Gtk-dialog-info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Bristol.blue.glass.arp.750pix.jpg/220px-Bristol.blue.glass.arp.750pix.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Cobalt_blue_hue.png/220px-Cobalt_blue_hue.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cobalt(ii_oxide"],["cobalt(ii_aluminate"],["john_varley","painter"]],"members":["john_varley"],"related":["Color","Cobalt","Alumina","Glass","Smalt","Cobalt(II)_oxide","Aluminium_oxide","Cobalt(II)_aluminate","Sintering","Prussian_blue","Louis_Jacques_Thénard","English_language","Jacob_Benjamin_Wegner","Blaafarveværket","Blue_colour_works","Ore_Mountains","Saxony","John_Varley_(painter)","Ultramarine","Maxfield_Parrish","Blue_and_white_porcelain","Concrete","Blue","Cobalt_glass","Fluorescein","Major_League_Soccer","Kansas_City_Wizards","2008_Major_League_Soccer_season","Netherlands","Romania","Tricolour","Jeep","Bugatti","Jeep_Wrangler_Unlimited","Cobalt_poisoning","List_of_colors","Cobalt_glass","Smalt"]}
