For humans, food energy typically comes from\ncarbohydrates, fats, proteins, organic acids, polyols, and ethanol present in\nthe diet. Ross, K. A. (2000c) Energy and fuel, in Littledyke M., Ross K. A.\nand Lakin E. (eds), Science Knowledge and the Environment. London: David Fulton\nPublishers. Some diet components that provide little or no food energy,\nsuch as water, minerals, vitamins and fiber, may still be necessary to health\nand survival for other reasons. Ruminants are able to extract food energy from\ncellulose tanks to bacteria in their rumens.\n\nIn the International System of Units, energy is measured in joules (J) or its\nmultiples; the kilojoule (kJ) is most often used for food-related quantities. An\nolder metric system unit of energy, still widely used in food-related contexts,\nis the calorie; more precisely, the \"food calorie\", \"large calorie\" or\nkilocalorie (Cal of kcal), equal to 4.184 kilojoules. (It should not be confused\nwith the \"small calorie\" (cal) that is often used in chemistry and physics,\nequal to 1/1000 of a food calorie.) Within the European Union, both the\nkilocalorie (\"kcal\") and kilojoule (\"kJ\") appear on nutrition labels. In many\ncountries, only one of the units is displayed; in the US and Canada the unit is\nspelled out as \"calorie\" or \"Calorie\".\n\nFats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per mass, 38 and 30\nkJ/g (9 and 7 kcal/g), respectively. Proteins and most carbohydrates have about\n17 kJ/g (4 kcal/g). Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed, such as fiber\nor lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals, contribute less food energy.\nPolyols (including sugar alcohols) and organic acids have less than than 17\nkJ/g (4 kcal/g).\n\nTheoretically, food energy could be measured in different ways, such as Gibbs\nfree energy of combustion, or the amount of ATP generated by metabolizing the\nfood. But the convention is to use the heat of the oxidation reaction, with the\nwater substance produced being in the liquid phase. Conventional food energy is\nbased on heats of combustion in a bomb calorimeter and corrections that take\ninto consideration the efficiency of digestion and absorption and the production\nof urea and other substances in the urine. These were worked out in the late\n19th century by the American chemist Wilbur Atwater.

See Atwater\nsystem for more detail.\n\nEach food item has a specific metabolizable energy intake (MEI). This value can\nbe approximated by multiplying the total amount of energy associated with a food\nitem by 85%, which is the typical amount of energy actually obtained by a human\nafter respiration has been completed. In animal nutrition where energy is a\ncritical element of the economics of meat production, a specific metabolizable\nenergy may be determined for each component (protein, fat, etc.) of each\ningredient of the feed.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Food_energy","recorded":1362504969,"links":33,"instances":["nutrient","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/nutrition/nvscf-vnqau-eng.pdf","http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/nutrition/nvscf-vnqau-eng.pdf","http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/PolicyDoc.pdf","http://www.anses.fr/cgi-bin/countdocs.cgi?Documents/ANC-Ft-TableauxApportsE.pdf","http://www.concept2.com/us/support/manuals/pdf/B_UsersManual.pdf"],"categories":["Nutrition"],"headings":["Nutrition labels","Recommended daily intake","Energy usage in the human body","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Nutrition-label.jpg/220px-Nutrition-label.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protein","nutrient"],["power","physics"]],"members":["protein","power"],"related":["Energy","Animal","Human_being","Food","Cellular_respiration","Metabolism","Muscle","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein_in_nutrition","Organic_acid","Polyol","Ethanol","Water","Dietary_mineral","Vitamin","Dietary_fiber","Ruminant","Cellulose","Bacteria","Rumen","International_System_of_Units","Joule","Kilojoule","Metric_system","Calorie","Kilocalorie","Chemistry","Physics","European_Union","Nutrition_facts_label","Lactose","Polyols","Sugar_alcohols","Organic_acids","Gibbs_free_energy","Adenosine_triphosphate","Water_substance","Wilbur_Atwater","Atwater_system","Mandatory_labelling","Calorimeter","Calorimetry","Dietary_fiber","Protein","Carbohydrate","Fat","Fat","Ethanol","Protein_(nutrient)","Carbohydrate","Organic_acid","Polyol","Sugar_alcohol","Sweeteners","Dietary_fiber","France","Sedentary_lifestyle","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","United_Nations","Power_(physics)","Aerobic_exercise","Anaerobic_exercise","Adenosine_triphosphate","Basal_metabolic_rate","Chemical_energy","Basal_metabolic_rate","Food_chain","Atwater_system","Nutrition_facts_label","Calorie","Food_composition"]}
