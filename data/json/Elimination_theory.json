In the same way,\ncomputational techniques for elimination can in practice be based on GrÃ¶bner\nbasis methods. There is however older literature on types of eliminant,\nincluding [[resultant]]s to find common roots of polynomials,\n[[discriminant]]s and so on. In particular the discriminant appears in\ninvariant theory, and is often constructed as the invariant of either a curve\nor an n-ary k-ic form. Whilst discriminants are always constructed resultants,\nthe variety of constructions and their meaning tends to vary. A modern and\nsystematic version of theory of the discriminant has been developed by Gelfand\nand coworkers. Some of the systematic methods have a homological basis, that\ncan be made explicit, as in Hilbert's theorem on syzygies. This field is at\nleast as old as BÃ©zout's theorem.\n\nThe historical development of commutative algebra, which was initially called\n[[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] theory, is closely linked to concepts in\nelimination theory: ideas of Kronecker, who wrote a major paper on the subject,\nwere adapted by Hilbert and effectively 'linearised' while dropping the explicit\nconstructive content. The process continued over many decades: the work of F.S.\nMacaulay who gave his name to Cohen-Macaulay modules was motivated by\nelimination.\n\nThere is also a logical content to elimination theory, as seen in the Boolean\nsatisfiability problem. In the worst case it is presumably hard to eliminate\nvariables computationally. \"Quantifier elimination\" is a term used in\nmathematical logic to explain that, in some theories, every formula is\nequivalent with a formula without quantifier. This is the case of the theory of\nthe polynomials over an algebraically closed field, and \"elimination theory\" may\nbe viewed as the theory of the methods making quantifier elimination effective\n(algorithmic) in this case. Quantifier elimination over the reals is another\nexample, which is fundamental in computational algebraic geometry.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Elimination_theory","recorded":1362574689,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic geometry","Computer algebra"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Commutative_algebra","Algebraic_geometry","Polynomial","Gaussian_elimination","Cramer's_rule","Gröbner_basis","Root_of_a_function","Invariant_theory","Israel_Gelfand","Homological_algebra","Hilbert's_syzygy_theorem","Bézout's_theorem","Commutative_algebra","Leopold_Kronecker","David_Hilbert","Francis_Sowerby_Macaulay","Boolean_satisfiability_problem","Quantifier_elimination","Mathematical_logic","Polynomial","Algebraically_closed_field","Tarski-Seidenberg_theorem","Buchberger_algorithm","Resultant","Triangular_decomposition","Israel_Gelfand","Andrey_Zelevinsky","Graduate_Texts_in_Mathematics","Springer-Verlag"]}
