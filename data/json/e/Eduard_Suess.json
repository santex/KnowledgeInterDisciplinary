{"cursor":"5745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Eduard Suess' (August 20, 1831, London – April 26, 1914, Vienna) was a\ngeologist who was an expert on the geography of the Alps. He is responsible for\nhypothesising two major former geographical features, the supercontinent\nGondwana (proposed 1861) and the Tethys Ocean.\n\nSuess was born in London to a Lutheran Saxon merchant and his Jewish wife, and\nwhen he was three, his family relocated to Prague, then to Vienna when he was\n14. Interested in geology at a young age, he published his first paper (on the\ngeology of Carlsbad, now in the Czech Republic) when he was 19.\n\nBy 1857, he was a professor of geology at the University of Vienna, and from\nthere he gradually developed views on the connection between Africa and Europe;\neventually he came to the conclusion that the Alps to the north were once at the\nbottom of an ocean, of which the Mediterranean was a remnant. Suess was not\ncorrect; his analysis was predicated upon the notion of \"contractionism\": the\nidea that the Earth is cooling down and, therefore, contracting. Nevertheless,\nhe is credited with postulating the earlier existence of the Tethys Ocean, which\nhe named in 1893. He claimed in 1885 that there had once been land bridges\nconnecting South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica. He named\nthis ancient broken continent Gondwanaland.\n\nIn volume two of his massive, three-volume Das Antlitz der Erde', Suess,\nEduard (1885-1908)Das Antlitz der Erde'' F. Tempsky, Vienna,\n[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2903551 OCLC 2903551], Note: volume 3 was\npublished in two parts Suess set out his belief that across geologic time,\nthe rise and fall of sea levels were mappable across the earth, that is, that\nthe periods of ocean transgression and regression were correlatable from one\ncontinent to another.\n\nHis theory was based upon glossopteris fern fossils occurring in South America,\nAfrica, and India. His explanation was that the three lands were once connected\nin a supercontinent, which he named Gondwanaland. Again, this is not quite\ncorrect: Suess believed that the oceans flooded the spaces currently between\nthose lands.\n\nSuess, considered one of the early practitioners of ecology, published a\ncomprehensive synthesis of his ideas in 1885-1901, entitled Das Antlitz der Erde\n(translated as \"The Face of the Earth\"), which was a popular textbook for many\nyears. In this work, Suess also introduced the concept of the biosphere, which\nwas later extended by Vladimir I. Vernadsky in 1926. Smil, Vaclav. 2002.

But this life is limited to a determined zone\n::at the surface of the [[lithosphere]]. The plant, whose deep roots plunge into\n::the soil to feed, and which at the same time rises into the air to breathe, is\n::a good illustration of organic life in the region of interaction between the\n::upper sphere and the lithosphere, and on the surface of continents it is\n::possible to single out an independent biosphere\" - Eduard Suess\n\nHe was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1895 and he\nwon the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1903.\n\nThe crater Suess on the Moon and a crater on Mars are named after him. His son,\nFranz Eduard Suess (1867â1942), was superintendent and geologist at the Imperial\nGeological Institute in\nVienna.
