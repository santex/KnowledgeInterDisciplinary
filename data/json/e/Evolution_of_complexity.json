Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms -\nalthough the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure\naccurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of cell\ntypes or morphology all being used to assess an organism's\ncomplexity. This observation that complex organisms can be\nproduced from simpler ones has led to the common misperception of evolution\nbeing progressive and having a direction that leads towards what are viewed as\n\"higher organisms\".\n\nNowadays, this idea of \"progression\" in evolution is regarded as misleading,\nwith natural selection having no intrinsic direction and organisms selected for\neither increased or decreased complexity in response to local environmental\nconditions. Although there has been an increase in the\nmaximum level of complexity over the history of life, there has always been a\nlarge majority of small and simple organisms and the most common level of\ncomplexity (the mode) appears to have remained relatively constant.\n","linknr":358,"url":"Evolution_of_complexity","recorded":1362483407,"links":16,"instances":["biological_fallacy","statistics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Evolution by phenotype|Complexity"],"headings":["Selection for simplicity and complexity","Types of trends in complexity","History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Evolution_of_complexity.svg/300px-Evolution_of_complexity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["mode","statistics"],["mode","statistics"],["devolution","biological_fallacy"]],"members":["devolution","mode","morphology"],"related":["Evolution","Cell_type","Morphology_(biology)","Natural_selection","History_of_life","Mode_(statistics)","Malaria","Mycoplasma","Parasitic_organisms","Immune_system","African_trypanosomiasis","Antigen","Antigenic_variation","Co-evolution","Ecosystem","Predator","Prey","Parasite","Evolutionary_arms_race","Francis_Heylighen","Species_diversity","Mode_(statistics)","Artificial_life","Self-organization","Variance","Skewness","Microorganism","Prokaryote","Sampling_bias","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Ray_Lankester","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Herbert_Spencer","Devolution_(biological_fallacy)","Biocomplexity","Biodiversity","Biosphere","Complex_adaptive_system","Complexity","Ecosystem","Evolvability","Orthogenesis"]}
