In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level\nwhich is often associated with an atom being excited to an excited state.\n\nIn quantum mechanics an 'excited state' of a system (such as an atom, molecule\nor nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the\nground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). The temperature\nof a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the\nnotable exception of systems that exhibit Negative temperature).\n\nThe lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or\ninduced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually\noccurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the\nsystem to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state).\nThis return to a lower energy level is often loosely described as decay and is\nthe inverse of excitation.\n\nLong-lived excited states are often called metastable. Long-lived nuclear\nisomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Excited_state","recorded":1362477370,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.wavefun.com/support/AGuidetoMM.pdf","http://www.wavefun.com/support/AGuidetoMM.pdf"],"categories":["Quantum mechanics"],"headings":["Atomic excitation","Perturbed gas excitation","Calculation of excited states","Reaction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Energylevels.png/220px-Energylevels.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Energy_level","Quantum_mechanics","Atom","Molecule","Atomic_nucleus","Quantum_state","Energy","Ground_state","Temperature","Negative_temperature","Spontaneous_emission","Stimulated_emission","Photon","Phonon","Metastable","Nuclear_isomer","Singlet_oxygen","Hydrogen_atom","Electron","Atomic_orbital","Wavefunction","Quantum_number","Photon","Bound_state","Ion","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Emission_line","Hydrogen_spectral_series","Rydberg_atom","Rydberg_matter","Boltzmann_distribution","Two-dimensional_gas","Coupled_cluster","Møller–Plesset_perturbation_theory","Multi-configurational_self-consistent_field","Configuration_interaction","Time-dependent_density_functional_theory","Mechanistic_Organic_Photochemistry","Rydberg_formula","Stationary_state","Repulsive_state"]}
