{"cursor":"4884","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Explore Learning' is a British company founded in 2000 to provide private\nlearning centres located across the UK. The centres are located in places easy\nfor families to attend on a regular basis, such as Sainsbury's grocery\nstores, shopping centres and local high streets. Its first centre was\nopened in Chelmsford in October 2001. Explore Learning has expanded to 75\ncentres across the UK as of December 2012.\n\nThe concept of a network of learning centres is to place maths and English\ntutors working in a low ratio with children to meet their individual needs; and\nto complement childrenâs school experience in a positive way and feeding back\ninto the classroom environment. The maximum ratio is 1 tutor to 6 children. The\ntuition classes are aimed to boost confidence, enthusiasm and independence into\na childâs development.\n\nThe concept is based on the model of Sylvan Learning Centers in the United\nStates, but the teaching materials map to the English, Welsh and\nNorthern Irish National Curriculum and the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence.\nThe tutors develop relationships with local schools and are involved in school\nlife by running regular maths and English workshops for pupils. They are also\ninvolved in running local community activities such as providing story-based\nworkshops in local libraries.\n\nChildren are evaluated through a twelve session assessment which identifies\ntheir individual abilities to create a personalized learning program. The centres use SuccessMaker and Digitexts software in addition\nto written materials to provide hour-long sessions, and children can earn prizes\nfor answering more than 70% of the questions in a session correctly.\n\nTypically, children become members and attend sessions once or twice a week,\neach session is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes long. The monthly membership\nfee is subject to some regional variations, which entitles each child to a\nmaximum of two visits a week. Feedback is provided on progress at the end of\neach session, each child receives a chart summarising the lesson. These charts\ngive examples of the activities completed, as well as scores and comments from\nthe tutors. Parent Conferences are also available to discuss each childâs\nprogress and review their goals in more detail.\n\nThe centres are usually open seven day a week both in term time and during\nschool holidays. The attendance process is ad hoc and children are not required\nto book their places in advance. All of the Explore Learning centres are\nOfsted/Care Commission registered and inspected. This means that Explore\nmembership qualifies for a number of government initiatives including the\nChildcare Vouchers scheme, Accor, Allsave, Busy Bees, Care4, Faircare, Imagine,\nLeapfrog and Sodexho Pass. Members are also eligible for claims up to 70% of the\ncosts if they are within the âchild care elementâ of the Working Tax Credit.\nExplore Learning also offer scholarship places to support lower income families\nwho qualify for either Income Support or Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance.\n\nExplore Learning was named Supplementary Education Provider of the Year in 2011\nand 2012 in the Education Investor\nhttp://www.educationinvestor.co.uk/awards.aspx
