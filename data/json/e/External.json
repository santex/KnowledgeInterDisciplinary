Producers and consumers may neither bear all of the costs\nnor reap all of the benefits of the economic activity, and too much or too\nlittle of the goods will be produced or consumed in terms of overall costs and\nbenefits to society.\n\nFor example, manufacturing that causes air pollution imposes costs on the whole\nsociety, while fire-proofing a home improves the fire safety of neighbors. If\nexternal costs exist, such as pollution, the good will be overproduced by a\ncompetitive market, as the producer does not take into account the external\ncosts when producing the good. If there are external benefits, such as in areas\nof education or public safety, too little of the good would be produced by\nprivate markets as producers and buyers do not take into account the external\nbenefits to others. Here, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the\nsum of the economic benefits and costs for all parties involved.
