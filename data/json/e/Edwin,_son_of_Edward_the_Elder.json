He drowned at sea in circumstances which are unclear.\n\nEdward the Elder died in 924, leaving five sons by three marriages. Of these,\nEdmund and Eadred were infants and thus excluded from the succession. Edward's\ncareful work of expansion was undone when the Mercians chose Edward's oldest son\nÃthelstan—probably raised in Mercia at the court of ÃthelflÃ¦d—to be\ntheir king while the West Saxons picked Ãlfweard, elder son of Edward's second\nwife ÃlfflÃ¦d, who was perhaps Edward's own choice as successor. Ãlfweard's\n\"sudden and convenient\" Thacker, Dynastic\nmonasteries, pp. 254–255. death followed six weeks after that of his\nfather, but Ãthelstan appears not to have been recognised as king by the West\nSaxons until a year after his father's death, suggesting that there was\nconsiderable resistance to him and perhaps also support for Edwin. Hill, Age of Athelstan, pp. 101–105.\n\nThe contemporary evidence for Edwin's life is very limited. At some point during\nthe reign of his half-brother Ãthelstan, Edwin witnessed a charter, [http://www.anglo-\nsaxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1417 S 1417], at New Minster, Winchester,\ngranting lands to one Alfred, a thegn (minister) of King Ãthelstan. Edwin\nwitnesses the charter immediately after his half-brother and is described as\nÃ¦theling (clito). The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] states that Edwin drowned at sea\nin 933. Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933. The\nFrancian [[Annales Bertiniani]] compiled by Folcuin provide more detail:\n\n\n\nLater writers such as William of Malmesbury and Simeon of Durham rewrote Edwin's\ndeath. Sir Frank Stenton saw their reports as suggesting that \"a rebellion\nagainst Athelstan may have been organised within the royal house\nitself\". Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 355–356. Simeon's\nversion baldly states that \"King Ãthelstan commanded that his brother Edwin be\ndrowned at sea\". Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p. 107, note 11.\nWilliam's account is much longer and associates Edwin's death with an earlier\nplot to blind Ãthelstan and replace him with Edwin. In this version, Ãthelstan\nis convinced by jealous courtiers to have Edwin sent to sea in a leaky boat,\nwithout oars, without food, and without water. Despairing, Edwin throws himself\ninto the sea and drowns. Hill, Age of Athelstan, p. 202.\n\nThe Annales Bertiniani say that the monks of Saint Bertin were granted a\nmonastery at Bath by \"King Ãthelstan\" in 944—in fact King Edmund,\nÃthelstan having died in 939—in gratitude for their care of Edwin's\nremains. Whitelock, English Historical Documents, p. 346.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","recorded":1374547322,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Edward_the_Elder","/wiki/%C3%86lffl%C3%A6d,_wife_of_Edward_the_Elder","/wiki/Drowning","/wiki/Edmund_I_of_England","/wiki/Eadred","/wiki/Mercia","/wiki/%C3%86thelstan","/wiki/%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d","/wiki/West_Saxons","/wiki/%C3%86lfweard_of_Wessex","#cite_note-Thacker_254-5-1","#cite_note-Thacker_254-5-1","#cite_note-2","http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+1417","/wiki/New_Minster,_Winchester","/wiki/Thegn","/wiki/%C3%86theling","/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Francia","/wiki/Annales_Bertiniani","/w/index.php?title=Folcuin&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Adelolf,_Count_of_Boulogne","/wiki/Saint-Omer","#cite_note-4","/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury","/wiki/Simeon_of_Durham","/wiki/Frank_Stenton","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Bath,_Somerset","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Thacker_254-5_1-0","#cite_ref-Thacker_254-5_1-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Alfred_the_Great","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7524-2566-8","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-415-92129-5","/wiki/Frank_Stenton","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-821716-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-415-21497-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&oldid=485810444","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Anglo-Saxon_royalty","/wiki/Category:933_deaths","/wiki/Category:Deaths_by_drowning","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edwin%2C+son+of+Edward+the+Elder&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edwin%2C+son+of+Edward+the+Elder","/wiki/Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","/wiki/Talk:Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","#","/wiki/Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&oldid=485810444","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4368928","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Edwin%2C_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&id=485810444","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Edwin%2C+son+of+Edward+the+Elder","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Edwin%2C+son+of+Edward+the+Elder&oldid=485810444&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Edwin,_son_of_Edward_the_Elder&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4368928#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","
