{"cursor":"5753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Elias of Cortona' Elia Coppi, Elias Cortonensis, Elias Bonusbaro/Bombarone,\nBrother Elias was born, it is said, at Bevilia near Assisi, ca. 1180; he\ndied at Cortona, 22 April 1253. He was among the first to join St. Francis of\nAssisi in his newly founded Order of Friars Minor.\n\nChosen by St. Francis of Assisi to administer the Order in his name, he was\nelected Vicar General of the Order at the Chapter of Pentecost in 1221. He was\nchosen by Francis despite the fact that he was a lay member of the Order (lay\nBrother). It fell to him to announce the death of St. Francis in 1226 to the\nworldwide Order. Elias served in this position until the Chapter of 1227, the\nfirst after the founder's death, when he was replaced by Friar John Parenti,\nMinister Provincial of Spain, who was elected the first Minister General. A\ngreat patron of the Franciscans and their official Protector, Cardinal Ugolino\nhad shortly before been elected as Pope, and taken the name of Gregory IX. The\nnew Pope immediately declared his intention to build a splendid church to house\nthe body of the Little Poor Man he had known and venerated. The task for this\nwas entrusted to Brother Elias.\n\nThough Elias had tried for the office of Minister General at the General\nChapter of 1230, it was only at the Chapter of 1232 that he was elected. Thus\nhe became, after the founder, the second Minister General of the Order of\nFriars Minor. Almost immediately, his succession was a point of controversy and\ncreated a split within the Order. Among his supporters was St. Clare of Assisi,\nconsidered the cofounder of the Order. Some of his fiercest critics were the\nfirst companions of Saint Francis, such as the simple Brother Giles and Brother\nLeo, St. Francis' secretary and companion, who both opposed what they saw as an\nabandonment of St. Francis' beloved commitment to corporate poverty under\nElias' initiative. An example of this was the magnificence of the new Basilica\nof St. Francis and Sacro Convento Elias was designing as the holy founder's\nresting place.\n\nDuring his administration, Elias worked strenuously to promote the growth of the\nOrder. He dispatched friars to new lands. He authorized the building of large\nmonastic-style residences in the cities, which were to serve as centers of\nstudy. This was a departure from the wandering tradition of the Order, with its\nsmall and scattered residences or hermitages. This development was to have two\nconsequences. Firstly, it introduced large groups of the growing number of\nclergy in the Order. This became a source of friction with the local clergy of\nthe cities, as the faithful sought the spiritual services of the friars in\npreference to their own parish churches. Secondly, there grew a growing\ndistinction between the friars who lived in established communities (convents,\nthus termed the Conventuals) as opposed to the \"Spirituals\" who strove to follow\nFrancis' original lifestyle. History of the Franciscan Movement\nhttp://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht01.html\n\nAbout 1238, Pope Gregory sent Elias as an ambassador to the excommunicated Holy\nRoman Emperor Frederick II; apparently, as a result, Elias became a supporter of\nthe Emperor. A General Chapter of the Order was held in Rome in 1239. From Friar\nThomas of Eccleston's account of this Chapter, it appears that one of the chief\nspokesmen against Elias was Friar Haymo of Faversham. Elias was deposed from the\noffice of Minister General by the Chapter.\n\nAfter the deposition of Elias, Albert of Pisa, Minister Provincial of England,\nwas elected as Minister General, and Haymo succeeded him as the Minister of the\nEnglish Province. Albert, however died during the first year of his Generalate,\nand Haymo was then elected to that office in 1240.\n\nAs a consequence of his behaviour, Elias himself received excommunication from\nPope Gregory, declared in 1240, in consequence of which he was expelled from the\nOrder. In that same year, Elias definitively embraced the Emperor in his strife\nwith Rome and joined the Emperor's army, riding on a magnificent charger at the\nsiege of Faenza and at that of Ravenna.\n\nAttribution to him of some alchemistic manuscripts E.g. in\n[http://www.levity.com/alchemy/almss17.html Mellon Collection: Database of\nalchemical manuscripts]. Related to Helias: Ms. 29 (ca. 1525); Ms. 7 - first\nscript (ca. 1440) is often questioned.\n\nHe was reconciled with both the Holy See and the Order before his death.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Elias_of_Cortona","recorded":1375077744,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Assisi","/wiki/Cortona","/wiki/St._Francis_of_Assisi","/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor","/wiki/Vicar_General","/wiki/Lay_Brother","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)","/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX","/wiki/General_Chapter","/wiki/Minister_General_of_the_Order_of_Friars_Minor","/wiki/St._Clare_of_Assisi","/wiki/Brother_Leo","/wiki/Corporate_poverty","/wiki/Basilica_of_St._Francis","/wiki/Sacro_Convento","/wiki/Parish","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Excommunication","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor","/wiki/Frederick_II","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Thomas_of_Eccleston","/wiki/Haymo_of_Faversham","/wiki/Albert_of_Pisa","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_Province","/wiki/Siege_of_Faenza","/wiki/Ravenna","/wiki/Alchemy","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Holy_See","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht01.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.levity.com/alchemy/almss17.html","/wiki/Manuscript","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Paschal_Robinson","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Elias_of_Cortona","/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia","http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd02970.htm","/wiki/Giovanni_Parenti","/wiki/Minister_General_of_the_Order_of_Friars_Minor","/wiki/Albert_of_Pisa","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Province_of_Perugia","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Cortona","/wiki/Tuscany","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&oldid=549998412","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1180s_births","/wiki/Category:1253_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_the_Province_of_Perugia","/wiki/Category:Italian_Friars_Minor","/wiki/Category:Ministers_General_of_the_Order_of_Friars_Minor","/wiki/Category:People_excommunicated_by_the_Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1913_Catholic_Encyclopedia_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_January_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elias+of+Cortona&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elias+of+Cortona","/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona","/wiki/Talk:Elias_of_Cortona","#","/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Elias_of_Cortona","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Elias_of_Cortona","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&oldid=549998412","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1329212","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Elias_of_Cortona&id=549998412","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Elias+of+Cortona","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Elias+of+Cortona&oldid=549998412&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Elias_of_Cortona&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_von_Cortona","//eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Cortonakoa","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_de_Cortone","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_da_Cortona","//sw.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Bombarone","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_van_Cortona","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliasz_Bonbarone","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_av_Cortona","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1329212#si
