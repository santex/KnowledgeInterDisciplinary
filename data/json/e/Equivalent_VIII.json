{"cursor":"1099","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Equivalent VIII', usually referred to as \"The Bricks\", is the last and most\nfamous of a series of minimalist sculpture by Carl Andre. Constructed in 1966,\nit was bought by The Tate Gallery in 1972. The exhibit comprises one-hundred-and-\ntwenty fire bricks, arranged in two layers, in a six-by-ten rectangle. All eight\nstructures in the series have the same height, mass and volume, but different\nshapes. Thus they are all \"equivalent\".\n\nWhen first exhibited at the Tate Gallery at Millbank in 1976, the piece drew\nmuch criticism in the press because of the perception that taxpayers' money had\nbeen spent on paying an inflated price for a collection of bricks.\n\n\nThe exhibit is now housed in the Tate Modern gallery on\nBankside.
