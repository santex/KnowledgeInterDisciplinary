{"cursor":"12037","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" and groundwater recharge.]]\n\n'Evapotranspiration' ('ET') is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration\nfrom the Earth's land surface to atmosphere. Evaporation accounts for the\nmovement of water to the air from sources such as the soil, canopy interception,\nand waterbodies. Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a plant\nand the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves.\nEvapotranspiration is an important part of the water cycle. An element (such as\na tree) that contributes to evapotranspiration can be called an\n'evapotranspirator'. http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2000/0031.pdf\n\n'Potential evapotranspiration' ('PET') is a representation of the environmental\ndemand for evapotranspiration and represents the evapotranspiration rate of a\nshort green crop, completely shading the ground, of uniform height and with\nadequate water status in the soil profile. It is a reflection of the energy\navailable to evaporate water, and of the wind available to transport the water\nvapour from the ground up into the lower atmosphere. Actual evapotranspiration\nis said to equal potential evapotranspiration when there is ample water.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Evapotranspiration","recorded":1362371799,"links":35,"instances":["agriculture","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2000/0031.pdf"],"categories":["Hydrology","Climatology","Agronomy","Ecological processes","Irrigation","Water conservation","Water and the environment"],"headings":["Evapotranspiration and the water cycle","Estimating evapotranspiration","Potential evapotranspiration","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Surface_water_cycle.svg/260px-Surface_water_cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/a/2baeadbc22b0859c419d16159972decd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/d/a1de643b4a26c32b415736fd0b88a86e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/6/07628de0af01ed965fad0f5eb77412d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Potential_evapotranspiration_Hawaii.gif/350px-Potential_evapotranspiration_Hawaii.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["hydrology","agriculture"]],"members":["hydrology","precipitation"],"related":["Groundwater_recharge","Evaporation","Plant","Transpiration","Atmosphere","Soil","Canopy_interception","Waterbody","Plant","Stomata","Leaf","Water_cycle","Energy","Wind","Earth's_atmosphere","Drainage_basin","Herbaceous_plant","Woody_plant","Conifer","Deciduous","Solar_radiation","Humidity","Temperature","Wind","Cloud_forests","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Percolation","Water_table","Capillary_action","Soil_matrix","Irrigation","Pan_evaporation","Groundwater_recharge","Penman_equation","Penman-Monteith","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","Blaney-Criddle_equation","United_States","Crop_coefficient","Stress_coefficient","Coefficient","Sensible_heat_flux","Scintillometer","SEBAL","SEBAL","Lysimeter","Eddy_covariance","Vapor_density","Water","Lake","Ocean","Soil","Vegetation","Irrigation_scheduling","Aridity_index","Eddy_covariance","Hydrology_(agriculture)","Hydrologic_Evaluation_of_Landfill_Performance","Latent_heat_flux","Weap","Soil_plant_atmosphere_continuum","Deficit_irrigation"]}
