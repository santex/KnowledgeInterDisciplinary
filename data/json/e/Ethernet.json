{"cursor":"34539","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n (often called ''RJ45'') commonly used on cat 5 cables in Ethernet networks]]\n\n'Ethernet' is a family of computer networking technologies for local area\nnetworks (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized\nin 1985 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN\ntechnologies.\n\nThe comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer in\nuse with Ethernet. The original 10BASE5 Ethernet used coaxial cable as a shared\nmedium. Later the coaxial cables were replaced by twisted pair and fiber optic\nlinks in conjunction with hubs or switches. Data rates were periodically\nincreased from the original 10 megabits per second to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nSystems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter\npieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses and\nerror-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted.\nAs per the OSI model Ethernet provides services up to and including the data\nlink layer.\n\nSince its commercial release, Ethernet has retained a good degree of\ncompatibility. Features such as the 48-bit MAC address and Ethernet frame format\nhave influenced other networking protocols.\n","linknr":639,"url":"Ethernet","recorded":1362676821,"links":99,"instances":["networking","chip","communication","company","networking","political"],"pdf":["http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetEvolution.pdf","http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetEvolution.pdf","http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetSpec.pdf","http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetSpec.pdf","http://decnet.ipv7.net/docs/dundas/aa-k759b-tk.pdf","http://decnet.ipv7.net/docs/dundas/aa-k759b-tk.pdf","http://www.ieeeusa.org/policy/policy/2001/01aug27IEEE802.pdf","http://www.ieeeusa.org/policy/policy/2001/01aug27IEEE802.pdf","http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/WRL-88-4.pdf","http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/WRL-88-4.pdf","http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/Fibernet.pdf","http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/Fibernet.pdf"],"categories":["Ethernet|","American
