{"cursor":"19775","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ns are fish capable of generating an electrical field.]] An 'electric fish' is a\nfish that can generate electric fields. A fish that can generate electric fields\nis said to be [[electrogenic]] while a fish that has the ability to detect\nelectric fields is said to be [[electroreceptive]]. Most electrogenic fish are\nalso electroreceptive. Except stargazers.  Electric\nfish species can be found both in the ocean and in freshwater rivers of South\nAmerica (Gymnotiformes) and Africa (Mormyridae). Many fish such as sharks, rays\nand catfishes can detect electric fields and are thus electroreceptive, but they\nare not classified as electric fish because they cannot generate electricity.\nMost common bony fish (teleosts), including most fish kept in aquaria or caught\nfor food, are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive.\n","linknr":734,"url":"Electric_fish","recorded":1362485512,"links":28,"instances":["nervous_system","fish"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electric fish|","Neuroethology"],"headings":["Strongly and weakly electric fish","Jamming avoidance response","Species","See also","References","Other reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Electric-eel2.jpg/250px-Electric-eel2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Antennarius_striatus.jpg/140px-Antennarius_striatus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ray","fish"],["feature_detection","nervous_system"]],"members":["feature_detection","ray"],"related":["Fish","Electric_field","Stargazer","Gymnotiformes","Mormyridae","Shark","Ray_(fish)","Catfish","Teleost","Aquarium","Electric_organ","Muscle","Nerve","Bioelectric","Amplitude","Volt","Ampere","Electric_eel","True_eel","Gymnotiformes","Electric_catfish","Electric_ray","Electric_organ","Impedance_matching","Electroreception","Electrocommunication","Peters'_elephantnose_fish","Black_ghost_knifefish","Sine_wave","Jamming_avoidance_response","Walter_Heiligenberg","Neuroethology","Walter_Heiligenberg","Electrocyte","Electrolocation","Curare","Electroreception","Feature_detection_(nervous_system)","Passive_electrolocation_in_fish","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign"]}
