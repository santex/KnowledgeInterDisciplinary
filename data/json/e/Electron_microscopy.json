{"cursor":"28638","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n electron microscope, MusÃ©e des Arts et MÃ©tiers, Paris]] An 'electron\n microscope' is a type of microscope that uses an electron beam to illuminate a\n specimen and produce a magnified image. An electron microscope (EM) has greater\n resolving power than a light microscope and can reveal the structure of smaller\n objects because electrons have wavelengths about 100,000 times shorter than\n visible light photons. They can achieve better than 50 pm resolution and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas\n ordinary, non-confocal light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about\n 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.\n\nThe electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control\nthe electron beam and focus it to form an image. These electron optical lenses\nare analogous to the glass lenses of a light optical microscope.\n\nElectron microscopes are used to investigate the ultrastructure of a wide range\nof biological and inorganic specimens including microorganisms, cells, large\nmolecules, biopsy samples, metals, and crystals. Industrially, the electron\nmicroscope is often used for quality control and failure analysis. Modern\nelectron microscopes produce electron micrographs, using specialized digital\ncameras or frame grabbers to capture the image.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Electron_microscopy","recorded":1362509615,"links":75,"instances":["electricity","physicist","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/821768-E3YVgN/native/821768.pdf","http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/821768-E3YVgN/native/821768.pdf"],"categories":["Electron
