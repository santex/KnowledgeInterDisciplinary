[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] '1982'; 299; 352 - 355.\nresearch has been conducted to develop technologies, commonly referred to as\nelectronic noses, that could detect and recognize odors and flavors. The stages\nof the recognition process are similar to human olfaction and are performed for\nidentification, comparison, quantification and other applications, including\ndata storage and retrieval. However, hedonic evaluation is a specificity of the\nhuman nose given that it is related to subjective opinions. These devices have\nundergone much development and are now used to fulfill industrial needs.\n","linknr":424,"url":"Electronic_nose","recorded":1362509862,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.chemosensory.com/chemosense/chemosense-Sept03.pdf","http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/gimzewski/publications/219_2010_SensorsActuatorsB.pdf"],"categories":["Laboratory equipment","Olfaction","Emerging technologies"],"headings":["Other techniques to analyze odors","History","Working principle","How to perform an analysis","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Odor","Flavor","Pattern_recognition","Olfaction","Quantification","Computer_data_storage","Hedonic","Chemosensor","Gas_chromatography","Volatile_organic_compound","Wasp_Hound","Alexander_Graham_Bell","Sensor_array","Adsorption","Olfactory_receptors","Metal–oxide–semiconductor","Conducting_polymer","Quartz_crystal_microbalance","Surface_acoustic_wave","Sensory_panel","Gas_chromatography","GC/MS","Artificial_neural_network","Fuzzy_logic","Volatile_organic_compound","Anosmia","Machine_olfaction","Chemical_field-effect_transistor","Olfactometer","Electronic_tongue","Fluctuation-enhanced_sensing"]}
