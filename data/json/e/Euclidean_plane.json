{"cursor":"50410","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n or Archimedes) performing a geometric construction with a compass, from [[The\n School of Athens]] by Raphael]]\n\n\n'Euclidean geometry' is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian\nGreek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the\n[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set\nof intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems)\nfrom these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier\nmathematicians, Eves, vol. 1., p. 19 Euclid was the first to show how\nthese propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical\nsystem. Eves (1963), vol. 1, p. 10 The Elements begins with plane\ngeometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the\nfirst examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three\ndimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra\nand number theory, couched in geometrical language. Eves, p. 19\n\nFor over two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because\nno other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so\nintuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that\nany theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical,\nsense. Today, however, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are\nknown, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An\nimplication of Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space\nitself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only\nwhere the gravitational field is weak.
