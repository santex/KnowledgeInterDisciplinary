It is the statewide authority advocating for\nLGBT families with over 30,000 members. It is headquartered in Columbus,\nOhio. It was\nfounded in 2005 following the passage of Ohio Issue 1, which banned state\nrecognition of same-sex relationships. Equality Ohio's first\nExecutive Director, Lynne Bowman is one of the founders of Equality Ohio and\nserved as its executive director for over 5 years. Sue Doerfer, became Executive\nDirector in December 2009 and announced her resignation in November 2010. She\nwas replaced by Ed Mullen, a former candidate for Illinois State Representative\nand civil rights lawyer from Chicago., Equality Ohio\naccepted the resignation of Ed Mullen, effective 29 June 2012. During his tenure\nEd brought tremendous vitality and keen legal insights to Equality Ohio,\nstabilized operations and financial support, and led the development of a\nnationally recognized strategic plan. Kim Welter then served as the Interim\nExecutive Director, has served as the Director of Programs and Outreach at\nEquality Ohio and with five years of experience, she is the most seasoned staff\nmember. She joined the organization in 2008 after serving as the Executive\nDirector of Equality Toledo for over 2 years. In November 2012 the organization\nhired its fourth Executive Director, Elyzabeth Joy Holford.\n\nIn addition to other efforts, Equality Ohio has worked for several years toward\npassing state legislation to prohibit employment or housing discrimination based\non sexual orientation.\n\nIn early 2011, Equality Ohio embarked on a strategic planning process to guide\nits work from 2011 to 2014. Equality Ohio solicited input on its strategic plan\nfrom its founders and early leaders, LGBT community leaders and members, and\nallies around the state. On 17 May 2011, the Boards of Equality Ohio and\nEquality Ohio Education Fund each adopted the strategic plan.\n\nPart of that plan was to develop legislative and public policy strategies on the\nstate and local level to enact the Equal Housing and Employment Act and Safe\nSchools bills during the 2011-12 or 2013-14 legislative sessions; enact\nadditional local non-discrimination and relationship recognition ordinances\nthroughout Ohio; increase Equality Ohio Campaign Fund's influence in the 2012\nand 2014 elections; and, seize favorable opportunities as they emerge and\nprotect against anti-equality legislative or public policy efforts.\n\nThe two current legislative priorities are the passage of the Equal Housing and\nEmployment Act (HB335 / SB231) and enumeration of the safe schools legislation\nwhich was passed January 2012 (HB208). Equality Ohio will continue to work with\nLGBT rights organizations throughout Ohio and nationally to achieve those goals.\nEquality Ohio will also continue its leadership in the formation of the broad\nstatewide coalition pursuing marriage equality for all Ohio families.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Equality_Ohio","recorded":1375075229,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_OH.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Map_of_USA_OH.svg/225px-Map_of_USA_OH.svg.png","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio","http://www.EqualityOhio.org/","/wiki/Nonpartisan","/wiki/Nonprofit","/wiki/LGBTQ","/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio","#cite_note-gps-1","#cite_note-bj-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Ohio_State_Issue_1_(2004)","#cite_note-gps-1","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit&section=1","http://www.equalityohio.org","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States","/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-gps_1-0","#cite_ref-gps_1-1","http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories05/march/0311051.htm","/wiki/Gay_People%27s_Chronicle","#cite_ref-bj_2-0","http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2009/11/30/daily25.html","#cite_ref-3","http://books.google.com/books?id=JCfa3v1RUjQC&pg=PA46&dq=%22equality+ohio%22&hl=en&ei=46vuTK3HDojWtQO7kY2bCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22equality%20ohio%22&f=false","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-470-12077-4","#cite_ref-4","http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/124894265828630.xml&coll=2","/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cleveland.com/mycleveland/index.ssf/2010/08/equality_ohio_director_loves_w.html","/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer","#cite_ref-6","http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories10/november/1119101.htm","/wiki/Gay_People%27s_Chronicle","#cite_ref-7","http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=13572&MediaType=1&Category=26","#cite_ref-8","http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2009/09/15/gay_discriminate.html?sid=101","/wiki/Columbus_Dispatch","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&oldid=563832175","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:LGBT_in_Ohio","/wiki/Category:LGBT_political_advocacy_groups_in_Ohio","/wiki/Category:2005_establishments_in_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_2005","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Equality+Ohio&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Equality+Ohio","/wiki/Equality_Ohio","/wiki/Talk:Equality_Ohio","#","/wiki/Equality_Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Equality_Ohio","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Equality_Ohio","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&oldid=563832175","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5384185","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Equality_Ohio&id=563832175","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Equality+Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Equality+Ohio&oldid=563832175&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Equality_Ohio&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5384185#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Pri
