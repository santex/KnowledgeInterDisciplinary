{"cursor":"21709","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn electricity supply systems, an 'earthing system' defines the electrical\npotential of the conductors relative to the Earth's conductive surface. The\nchoice of earthing system can affect the safety and electromagnetic\ncompatibility of the power supply, and regulations can vary considerably among\ncountries. Most electrical systems connect one supply conductor to earth\n(ground). If a fault within an electrical device connects a \"hot\" (unearthed)\nsupply conductor to an exposed conductive surface, anyone touching it while\nelectrically connected to the earth (e.g., by standing on it, or touching an\nearthed sink) will complete a circuit back to the earthed supply conductor and\nreceive an electric shock.\n\nA protective earth, known as an equipment grounding conductor in the US National\nElectrical Code, avoids this hazard by keeping the exposed conductive surfaces\nof a device at earth potential. To avoid possible voltage drop no current is\nallowed to flow in this conductor under normal circumstances, but fault currents\nwill usually trip or blow the fuse or circuit breaker protecting the circuit. A\nhigh impedance line-to-ground fault insufficient to trip the overcurrent\nprotection may still trip a residual-current device (ground fault circuit\ninterrupter or GFCI in North America) if one is present.\n\nIn contrast, a functional earth connection serves a purpose other than shock\nprotection, and may normally carry current. Examples of devices that use\nfunctional earth connections include surge suppressors and electromagnetic\ninterference filters, certain antennas and measurement instruments. But the most\nimportant example of a functional earth is the neutral in an electrical supply\nsystem. It is a current-carrying conductor connected to earth, often but not\nalways at only one point to avoid earth currents. The NEC calls it a groundED\nsupply conductor to distinguish it from the equipment groundING conductor.\n\nIn most developed countries, 220/230/240V sockets with earthed contacts were\nintroduced either just before or soon after WW2, though with considerable\nnational variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120 volt\npower outlets installed before the mid 1960s generally did not include a ground\n(earth) pin. In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a\nconnection to an earthing pin of an outlet.\n\nIn the absence of a supply earth, devices needing an earth connection often used\nthe supply neutral. Some used dedicated ground rods. Many 110V appliances have\npolarized plugs to maintain a distinction between \"live\" and \"neutral\", but\nusing the supply neutral for equipment earthing can be highly problematical.\n\"Live\" and \"neutral\" might be accidentally reversed in the outlet or plug, or\nthe neutral-to-earth connection might fail or be improperly installed. Even\nnormal load currents in the neutral might generate hazardous voltage drops. For\nthese reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth\nconnections that are now almost universal.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Earthing_system","recorded":1362559836,"links":37,"instances":["electricity","electrical","us","radio"],"pdf":["http://www.theiet.org/publishing/wiring-regulations/mag/2005/16-earthing-questions.cfm?type=pdf","http://www.electrical-installation.schneider-electric.com/ei-guide/pdf_files/EIG-E-LV-distribution.pdf"],"categories":["Electric power distribution","Electrical engineering","Electrical wiring","Electrical safety","IEC 60364"],"headings":["IEC terminology","Other terminologies","Properties","Regulations","Application examples","Comparison of Earthing systems","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/TN-S-earthing.svg/350px-TN-S-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/TN-S-earthing.svg/250px-TN-S-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/TN-C-earthing.svg/250px-TN-C-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/TN-C-S-earthing.svg/250px-TN-C-S-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/TT-earthing.svg/350px-TT-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/IT-earthing.svg/350px-IT-earthing.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/28px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ground","electricity"],["fuse","electrical"],["antenna","radio"],["ground","electricity"],["ground","electricity"],["national_electrical_code","us"],["ground","electricity"]],"members":["ground","fuse","national_electrical_code","antenna"],"related":["Electricity_supply","Electrical_potential","Safety","Electromagnetic_compatibility","Ground_(electricity)","Electric_shock","National_Electrical_Code","Voltage_drop","Fuse_(electrical)","Circuit_breaker","Electrical_impedance","Residual-current_device","Surge_suppression","Electromagnetic_interference","Antenna_(radio)","Neutral_wire","Groundbed","International_standard","IEC_60364","Ground_(electricity)","Electrical_generator","Transformer","Ground_(electricity)","Three-phase","Single-phase","Residual-current_device","Residual-current_device","Variable_frequency_drive","Switched-mode_power_supplies","Electrical_impedance","Insulation_monitoring_device","IEC_60364","Residual_current_device","Residual-current_device","Residual-current_device","Concentric_cable","National_Electrical_Code_(US)","Canadian_Electrical_Code","Argentina","France","Australia","PSE_law","United_Kingdom","Norway","Isolation_transformer","Insulation_monitoring_device","Australia","Israel","Ground_(electricity)","Ground_and_neutral","Electrical_wiring","Single-wire_earth_return","Soil_resistivity","International_Electrotechnical_Commission"]}
