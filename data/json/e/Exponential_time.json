{"cursor":"35580","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science, the 'time complexity' of an algorithm quantifies the amount\nof time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string\nrepresenting the input . The time complexity of an\nalgorithm is commonly expressed using big O notation, which excludes\ncoefficients and lower order terms. When expressed this way, the time complexity\nis said to be described asymptotically, i.e., as the input size goes to\ninfinity. For example, if the time required by an algorithm on all inputs of\nsize n is at most , the asymptotic time complexity is O(n 3).\n\nTime complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary\noperations performed by the algorithm, where an elementary operation takes a\nfixed amount of time to perform. Thus the amount of time taken and the number\nof elementary operations performed by the algorithm differ by at most a\nconstant factor.\n\nSince an algorithm's performance time may vary with different inputs of the same\nsize, one commonly uses the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm, denoted\nas 'T(n)', which is defined as the maximum amount of time taken on any input of\nsize n. Time complexities are classified by the nature of the function T(n). For\ninstance, an algorithm with T(n) = O(n) is called a linear time algorithm, and\nan algorithm with T(n) = O(2 n) is said to be an exponential
