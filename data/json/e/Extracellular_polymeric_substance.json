EPS establish the functional and structural integrity of\nbiofilms, and are considered the fundamental component that determines the\nphysiochemical properties of a biofilm.\n\nEPS are mostly composed of polysaccharides and proteins, but include other macro-\nmolecules such as DNA, lipids and humic substances. EPS are the construction\nmaterial of bacterial settlements and either remain attached to the cell's outer\nsurface, or are secreted into its growth medium. These compounds are important\nin biofilm formation and cells attachment to surfaces. EPS constitutes 50% to\n90% of a biofilm's total organic matter. \n","linknr":135,"url":"Extracellular_polymeric_substance","recorded":1362511407,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology terms","Bacteria","Bacteriology","Environmental soil science","Membrane biology","Biological matter","Microbiology"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Biofilm_Formation.jpg/220px-Biofilm_Formation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Paramecium.jpg/35px-Paramecium.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Exopolysaccharide","Microorganism","Biofilm","Polysaccharide","DNA","Lipid","Humic_acid","Exopolysaccharide","Biofilm"]}
