      "text" : "\n\n\nThe 'centimetre–gram–second system' (abbreviated 'CGS' or 'cgs') is a variant of\nthe metric system of physical units based on centimetre as the unit of length,\ngram as a unit of mass, and second as a unit of time. All CGS mechanical units\nare unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several\ndifferent ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism.\n\nThe CGS system has been largely supplanted by the MKS system, based on metre,\nkilogram, and second. MKS was in turn extended and replaced by the\nInternational System of Units (SI). The latter adopts the three base units of\nMKS, plus the ampere, mole, candela and kelvin. In many fields of science and\nengineering, SI is the only system of units in use. However, there remain\ncertain subfields where CGS is prevalent. In the United States, the FPS system\nis still widely used.\n\nIn measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass,\nforce, energy, pressure, and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are\nstraightforward and rather trivial; the unit-conversion factors are all powers\nof 10 arising from the relations and . For example, the CGS-derived unit of\nforce is the dyne, equal to , while the SI-derived unit of force is the newton,\n. Thus it is straightforward to show that .\n\nOn the other hand, in measurements of electromagnetic phenomena (involving units\nof charge, electric and magnetic fields, voltage, and so on), converting between\nCGS and SI is much more subtle and involved. In fact, formulas for physical laws\nof electromagnetism (such as Maxwell's equations) need to be adjusted depending\non which system of units one uses. This is because there is no one-to-one\ncorrespondence between electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the\ncase for mechanical units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible\nchoices of electromagnetic units, leading to different unit \"sub-systems\",\nincluding Gaussian, \"ESU\", \"EMU\", and Heaviside–Lorentz. Among these choices,\nGaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase \"CGS units\" is\noften used to refer specifically to CGS-Gaussian units.\n",
