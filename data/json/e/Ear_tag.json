{"cursor":"9986","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n with an ear tag.]]\n\nAn 'ear tag' is a plastic or metal object used for identification of domestic\nlivestock and other animals. If the ear tag uses Radio Frequency Identification\nRFID technology, then it is often referred to as an 'electronic ear tag'.\nElectronic ear tags conform international standards ISO 11784 and ISO 11785\nworking at 134,2 kHz, as well as ISO/IEC 18000-6C operating in the UHF spectrum.\nThere are other non-standard systems such as Destron working at 125 kHz.\nAlthough there are many shapes of ear tags, these can be classified in two\nsimple types:\n\n* Flag shape ear tags Those with flat wide plastic surfaces designed to present\n  the ID code handwritten or printed by laser, ink or both.\n* Button shape ear tags Those small, flat and cylindrical. Although it can be\n  printed with an ID code, since the size is small it is mainly designed to\n  carry an RFID coil.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Ear_tag","recorded":1362575038,"links":21,"instances":["digestion","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/movements/sheep/documents/eid-quickguide.pdf"],"categories":["Livestock","Animal equipment","Radio-frequency identification","Animal identification"],"headings":["Overview","History","Other forms of animal identification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Sheep%27s_face%2C_Malta.jpg/220px-Sheep%27s_face%2C_Malta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ursus_maritimus_mother_with_cub.jpg/220px-Ursus_maritimus_mother_with_cub.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Black-tailed_Prairie_Dog-Wichita_Mountain_Wildlife_Refuge-1.jpg/220px-Black-tailed_Prairie_Dog-Wichita_Mountain_Wildlife_Refuge-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bolus","digestion"],["earmark","agriculture"],["earmark","agriculture"]],"members":["bolus","earmark"],"related":["Animal_identification","Livestock","RFID","ISO_11784","ISO_11785","ISO/IEC_18000","Herd","Property_IdentiÔ¨Åcation_Code","Farmer","National_Livestock_Identification_System","Australia","Rumen","Bolus_(digestion)","European_Union","Laboratory_mouse","Laboratory_rat","Earmark_(agriculture)","RFID","Dye","Joseph_Banks","Royal_Society","Merino","George_III","Matthew_Boulton","Cattle","Tuberculosis","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Steel","Nickel","World_War_II","Plastic","Blood-borne_disease","National_Animal_Identification_System","Earmark_(agriculture)","Branding_iron","British_Cattle_Movement_Service","Cattle_crush","Livestock_branding"]}
