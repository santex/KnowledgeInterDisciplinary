Cf.\nfor example the resume submitted by Noether to Erlangen University in 1907\n(Erlangen University archive, Promotionsakt Emmy Noether (1907/08, NR. 2988);\nreproduced in: Emmy Noether, Gesammelte Abhandlungen – Collected Papers, ed. N.\nJacobson 1983; online facsimile at\n[http://www.physikerinnen.de/noetherlebenslauf.html\nphysikerinnen.de/noetherlebenslauf.html]). Sometimes Emmy is mistakenly reported\nas a short form for Amalie, or misreported as \"Emily\". e.g. .</ref> 23 March\n1882 – 14 April 1935), was an influential German mathematician known for her\ngroundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics.\nDescribed by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl,\nNorbert Wiener and others as the most important woman in the history of\nmathematics,<ref name = \"einstein\" /> she revolutionized the theories of rings,\nfields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the fundamental\nconnection between symmetry and conservation laws.<ref name = \"neeman_1999\" />\n\nShe was born to a Jewish family in the Bavarian town of Erlangen; her father was\nmathematician Max Noether. Emmy originally planned to teach French and English\nafter passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the\nUniversity of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her\ndissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the\nMathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years (at the time\nwomen were largely excluded from academic positions). In 1915, she was invited\nby David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the\nUniversity of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The\nphilosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing\nunder Hilbert's name. Her [[habilitation]] was approved in 1919, allowing her to\nobtain the rank of [[Privatdozent]].\n\nNoether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until\n1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch\nmathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the\nleading expositor of Noether's ideas: her work was the foundation for the second\nvolume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her\nplenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich,\nher algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year,\nGermany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether\nmoved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in\nPennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite\nsigns of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.\n\nNoether's mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\".<ref\nname=Weyl></ref> In the first (1908–19), she made significant contributions to\nthe theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on\ndifferential invariants in the calculus of variations, [[Noether's theorem]],\nhas been called \"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in\nguiding the development of modern physics\". In the second epoch (1920–26), she\nbegan work that \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\".<ref name=\"weyl_128\"\n/> In her classic paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring\nDomains, 1921) Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into\na powerful tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the\nascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named [[Noetherian\n(disambiguation)|Noetherian]] in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–35), she\npublished major works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and\nunited the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and\nideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her\nideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other\nmathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as\nalgebraic topology.\n",
