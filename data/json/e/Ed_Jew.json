He\ngraduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in economics and\nlater earned a masters degree in business administration at Golden Gate\nUniversity. After spending several years as a businessman managing his family\nenterprises, he entered politics in 1980s and went on to serve in various\ncommunity organizations. In 1996, he was the volunteer liaison for then\nDistrict 4 supervisor Leland Yee. In 2002, Yee successfully ran for a seat\nin the California Assembly, and Jew ran for Yee's seat on the Board of\nSupervisors in the 2002 election, but was defeated. When Yee's successor Fiona\nMa in 2006 ran for state assembly, Jew again ran for supervisor in\nDistrict 4, which comprises most of the Sunset District. After winning a\nhighly competitive election decided by instant-runoff voting, he was elected to\nthe San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n\nSix months after taking office, the FBI raided his office and homes for\nallegedly extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly\nafter the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating\nresidency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September\n2007, he was suspended by Mayor Gavin Newsom and later resigned in the face of\nextortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pled guilty to both charges. He\nwas sentenced to 64 months in state prison for extortion, and a year in\ncounty jail for perjury.\n","linknr":379,"url":"Ed_Jew","recorded":1362557074,"links":16,"instances":["united_states","business","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1960 births","Living people","Politicians convicted of extortion under color of official right","Politicians convicted of program bribery","Politicians convicted of mail and wire fraud","American perjurers","American politicians of Chinese descent","California Democrats","California Republicans","City College of San Francisco alumni","Golden Gate University alumni","People from Burlingame, California","People from San Francisco, California","Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government","San Francisco Board of Supervisors members","San Francisco State University alumni"],"headings":["Personal life","Political career","Controversies","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/DennisHerreraEdJewLetter.JPG/220px-DennisHerreraEdJewLetter.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/SF_From_Marin_Highlands3.jpg/32px-SF_From_Marin_Highlands3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["democratic_party","united_states"],["republican_party","united_states"],["administration","business"]],"members":["republican_party","administration","democratic_party"],"related":["San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors","Fiona_Ma","Carmen_Chu","San_Francisco,_California","California","United_States","United_States","Democratic_Party_(United_States)","Republican_Party_(United_States)","San_Francisco","Burlingame,_California","California","United_States","San_Francisco_State_University","Golden_Gate_University","San_Francisco","California","Chinese_American","San_Francisco_State_University","Economics","Administration_(business)","Golden_Gate_University","Leland_Yee","California_State_Assembly","San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors_elections,_2002","Fiona_Ma","Sunset_District,_San_Francisco,_California","Instant-runoff_voting","San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors","Gavin_Newsom","People's_Republic_of_China","Chinatown,_San_Francisco","San_Francisco_School_of_the_Arts","City_College_of_San_Francisco","San_Francisco_State_University","Economics","Master_of_Business_Administration","Golden_Gate_University","Burlingame,_California","Leland_Yee","California_State_Assembly","Fiona_Ma","Ron_Dudum","Gavin_Newsom","Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","San_Francisco_City_Hall","Bubble_tea","Quickly","Gavin_Newsom","Kamala_Harris","Dennis_Herrera","California_Attorney_General","Jerry_Brown","United_States_Postal_Service","San_Francisco,_California","California","Bribery","Mail_fraud","Extortion","Perjury","Carmen_Chu","Safford,_Arizona","Kern_County","Chinese_American","Extortion","San_Francisco,_California"]}
