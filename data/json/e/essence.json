      "text" : "\n\nIn philosophy, 'essence' is the attribute or set of attributes that make an\nentity or substance what it fundamentally is, and which it has by necessity, and\nwithout which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident: a\nproperty that the entity or substance has contingently, without which the\nsubstance can still retain its identity. The concept originates with Aristotle,\nwho used the Greek expression to ti ên einai, literally 'the what it was to be',\nor sometimes the shorter phrase to ti esti, literally 'the what it is,' for the\nsame idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for his Latin translators\nthat they coined the word essentia (English \"essence\") to represent the whole\nexpression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers the notion of essence is\nclosely linked to that of definition (horismos).<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-\nmetaphysics/ S. Marc Cohen, \"Aristotle's Metaphysics\"], Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, accessed 20 April 2008.</ref>\n\nIn the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle\nfor doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well\nas different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this\neminently logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and\ncommon-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the\n\"possible worlds\" analogy set up by Leibniz and developed in the\nintensional logic from Carnap to Kripke, which was later challenged by\n\"extensionalist\" philosophers such as Quine.\n",
