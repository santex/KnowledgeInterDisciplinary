War films and epic films often employ background\nactors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of\npaid background actors as cast members (hence the term 'cast of thousands').\nLikewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in\nspectacular productions.\n\nOn a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as\n\"background talent\", \"background performers\", \"background artists\",\n\"background cast members\" or simply \"background\" while the term \"extra\" is\nrarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred\nto as \"supernumeraries\". In opera and ballet, they are called either\n\"extras\" or \"supers\".\n","linknr":149,"url":"Extra_(actor)","recorded":1362676442,"links":38,"instances":["trade_union"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stage terminology","Acting"],"headings":["Casting","Salary and working conditions","In popular culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["equity","trade_union"]],"members":["equity"],"related":["Performer","Film","Television_show","War_film","Epic_film","Grand_opera","Supernumeraries","Acting","Rollerblading","James_Cameron","Screen_Actors_Guild","AFTRA","Equity_(trade_union)","BECTU","Trade_Union","Hollywood","Bit_part","Character_actor","Supporting_actor","Under-Five","The_Guardian"]}
