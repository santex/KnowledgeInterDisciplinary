Experiments provide\ninsight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a\nparticular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and\nscale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the\nresults. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand the nature of\ngravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to\nadvance the understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments can vary from personal\nand informal (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly\ncontrolled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists\nthat hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of\nexperiments vary considerably between the natural and social sciences.\n",
