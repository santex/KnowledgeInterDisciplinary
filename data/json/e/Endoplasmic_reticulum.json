Dark small circles in the\n network are mitochondria.]]\n\nThe 'endoplasmic reticulum' ('ER') is an organelle of cells in eukaryotic\norganisms that forms an interconnected network of membrane vesicles.The lacey\nmembranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen by Keith R. Porter,\nAlbert Claude, and Ernest F. Fullam in the year 1945.\nAccording to the structure the endoplasmic reticulum is classified into two\ntypes, that is, 'rough endoplasmic reticulum' rough endoplasmic\nreticulum '(RER)' and 'smooth endoplasmic reticulum' smooth\nendoplasmic reticulum '(SER)'. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded\nwith ribosomes ribosomes on the cytosolic face. These are the sites\nof protein synthesis. protein synthesis The rough endoplasmic\nreticulum is predominantly found in hepatocytes hepatocytes where\nprotein synthesis occurs actively. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is a smooth\nnetwork without the ribosomes. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned\nwith lipid metabolism, lipid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism\ncarbohydrate metabolism and detoxification. detoxification\nThe smooth endoplasmic reticulum is abundantly found in mammalian testis.\n","linknr":417,"url":"Endoplasmic_reticulum","recorded":1362486587,"links":76,"instances":["biology","protein","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles","Cell anatomy"],"headings":["Structure","Functions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Clara_cell_lung_-_TEM.jpg/300px-Clara_cell_lung_-_TEM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Nucleus_ER_golgi.svg/300px-Nucleus_ER_golgi.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Translation.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vesicle","biology"],["rab","g-protein"],["chaperone","protein"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","chaperone","rab","cell"],"related":["Mitochondria","Organelle","Cell_(biology)","Eukaryote","Keith_R._Porter","Albert_Claude","Nuclear_pore","Ribosome","Protein","Vesicle_(biology)","Golgi_apparatus","Cisterna","Cytoskeleton","Phospholipid_membrane","Perinuclear_space","Cytosol","Ribosome","Translocon","Secretory_pathway","Signal_recognition_particle","Signal_peptide","Hydrophobic","Amino_acid","Peptidase","Nuclear_envelope","Golgi_apparatus","McGraw-Hill_Encyclopedia_of_Science_and_Technology","COPII","COPI","Golgi_complex","Protein_targeting","Membrane_contact_site","Lysosome","Mannose-6-phosphate","Secretion","Clathrin","Signal_peptide","Integral_membrane_proteins","Rab_(G-protein)","SNAP-25","SNARE","Glycosylation","Glycosyltransferase","Asparagine","Serine","Asparagine","Threonine","Mannose","Glucose","Nitrogen","Unfolded_protein_response","Lipids","Phospholipids","Steroids","Steroid_metabolism","Nuclear_envelope","Glucose-6-phosphatase","Glucose-6-phosphate","Gluconeogenesis","Smooth_muscle","Striated_muscle","Excitation-contraction_coupling","Cisternae","Chaperone_(protein)","Protein_disulfide_isomerase","Hsp70","Calnexin","Calreticulin","Golgi_complex","Glycoproteins","Signal_peptide","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Vesicle_(biology)","Cytoskeleton","ERAD","Protein_targeting","Secretory_pathway","Reticulon","OPM_database"]}
