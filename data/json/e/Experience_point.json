{"cursor":"22065","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'experience point' (often abbreviated to 'Exp' or 'XP') is a unit of\nmeasurement used in many role-playing games (RPGs) and role-playing video games\nto quantify a player character's progression through the game. Experience points\nare generally awarded for the completion of quests, overcoming obstacles and\nopponents, and for successful role-playing.\n\nIn many RPGs, characters start as fairly weak and untrained. When a sufficient\namount of experience is obtained, the character \"levels up\", achieving the next\nstage of character development. Such an event usually increases the character's\nstatistics, such as health points and strength, and may permit the character to\nacquire new abilities or improve existing ones.\n\nIn some role-playing games, particularly those derived from [[Dungeons &\nDragons]], experience points are used to improve characters in discrete\nexperience levels; in other games, such as [[GURPS]] and the [[World of\nDarkness]] games, experience points are spent on specific abilities or\nattributes chosen by the player.\n\nIn most games, as the difficulty of the challenge increases, the experience\nrewarded for overcoming it also increases. As players gain more experience\npoints, the amount of experience needed to gain new abilities typically\nincreases. Alternatively, games keep the amount of experience points per level\nconstant, but progressively lower the experience gained for the same tasks as\nthe character's level increases. Thus, as the player character strengthens from\ngaining experience, they are encouraged to accept tasks that are commensurate\nwith their improved abilities in order to advance.\n","linknr":537,"url":"Experience_point","recorded":1362543787,"links":34,"instances":["paranormal","gaming","virtual_reality","gaming","fantasy","mud","gaming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Game terminology","MUD terminology","Player progress tracking in video games","Role-playing game terminology","Video game terminology"],"headings":["Types","Video games","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["magic","paranormal"],["statistic","role-playing_games"],["spell","gaming"],["race","fantasy"],["avatar","virtual_reality"],["immortal","mud"],["optimization","role-playing_games"],["grind","gaming"],["health","gaming"]],"members":["magic","optimization","spell","avatar","health","statistic","race","immortal","grind"],"related":["Role-playing_game","Role-playing_video_game","Player_character","Role-playing","Hit_point","Player_character","Character_class","Magic_(paranormal)","GURPS","Hero_System","Prestige_class","IGN","IGN","Statistic_(role-playing_games)","Hero_System","World_of_Darkness","Archery","Dexterity","Spell_(gaming)","Final_Fantasy_XIII","Minecraft","Dice_&_Glory","Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay","Dungeons_&_Dragons","Ragnarok_Online","Hit_point","Magic_point","Role-playing_video_game","Non-player_character","MUD","Massively_multi-player_online_role-playing_game","Powerleveling","Video_game","Power-up","Nintendo_Entertainment_System","Action_role-playing_game","Action-adventure_game","Role-playing_video_game","First-person_shooter","Action_game","New_game_plus","Race_(fantasy)","Avatar_(virtual_reality)","Character_class","MUD","Immortal_(MUD)","Designing_Virtual_Worlds","Optimization_(role-playing_games)","Internet","Kill_stealing","Powergaming","Game_designer","Kill_stealing","Computer_game_bot","Gold_farming","Gold_farming","Grind_(gaming)","Health_(gaming)","Magic_point","Multiboxing","Virtual_economy","Virtual_world"]}
