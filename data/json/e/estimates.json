They consist of detailed\nreports on how each department or ministry will spend its money. The estimates\nare normally introduced in the House of Commons just prior to the main budget,\nwhich gives them time to be analyzed by House committees. Unlike the budget the\nestimates contain no references to fiscal policy, long term goals, or where the\nmoney is coming from. After each section is reviewed by the relevant committee\nthe entire Estimates are voted on as one bill. This \"supply\" vote is a matter of\nconfidence. Unlike tax proposals in the budget, the Estimates are rarely\ncontroversial, with most issues being dealt with in committee.\n\nMost of the countries also mandate an update or series of updates to the\nEstimates to account for changes in the economy or in government policy. In\nCanada, for instance, this update must be passed in December each year.\n","title":"estimates","headings":["References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Westminster_system","1: House_of_Commons","1: Budget","1: Fiscal_policy","1: Motion_of_no_confidence"]}
