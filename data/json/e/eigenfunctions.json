More\n precisely, one has\n\n:<math>\n\\mathcal A f = \\lambda f </math>\n\nfor some scalar, λ, the corresponding eigenvalue. The solution of the\ndifferential eigenvalue problem also depends on any boundary conditions required\nof <math>f</math>. In each case there are only certain eigenvalues\n<math>\\lambda=\\lambda_n</math> (<math>n=1,2,3,...</math>) that admit a\ncorresponding solution for <math>f=f_n</math> (with each <math>f_n</math>\nbelonging to the eigenvalue <math>\\lambda_n</math>) when combined with the\nboundary conditions. Eigenfunctions are used to analyze <math>A</math>.\n\nFor example, <math>f_k(x) = e^{kx}</math> is an eigenfunction for the\ndifferential operator\n\n:<math>\n\\mathcal A = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} - \\frac{d}{dx} </math>\n\nfor any value of <math>k</math>, with corresponding eigenvalue <math>\\lambda =\nk^2 - k</math>.
