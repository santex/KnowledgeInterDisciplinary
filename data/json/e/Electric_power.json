{"cursor":"10753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" like these, and also on underground high voltage cables.]]\n\n\n'Electric power' is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an\nelectric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.\n\nElectric power is usually produced by electric generators, but can also be\nsupplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries. Electric power is\ngenerally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry.\n","linknr":363,"url":"Electric_power","recorded":1362664891,"links":52,"instances":["unit","physics","number","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electric power|","Electromagnetism"],"headings":["Definition","Explanation","Electric power supply","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Electricalgrid.jpg/220px-Electricalgrid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Current_in_beton.jpg/220px-Current_in_beton.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/0/860d18a24006f347f08216c7f90a89a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/7/937323dd28549fa6caa60f2178c5a867.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Power_Triangle_01.svg/200px-Power_Triangle_01.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/a/17ab38e556945345408a20dfdee5455a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/3/8433951967936135d05c2cfc1e323904.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/2/b/22b48c780d7e705c861fa3b535f2b3c1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/0/f70e972eb1af03b247c9c9218966a9e7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["watt","unit"],["power","physics"],["vector","geometric"],["1000000000","number"]],"members":["watt","power","1000000000","vector"],"related":["High_voltage_cable","Electric_energy","Electric_circuit","SI","Power_(physics)","Watt_(unit)","Joule","Second","Electric_generator","Electric_batteries","Electric_power_industry","Power_(physics)","Work","Watt","Watt","Electric_potential","Voltage","Coulomb","Ampere","Volt","Electric_charge","Electric_potential","Voltage","Work","Kinetic_energy","Electrical_appliance","Light_bulb","Electric_motor","Electric_generator","Electric_battery","Resistive","Ohm's_law","Electrical_resistance","AC_power","Inductance","Capacitance","Real_power","Reactive_power","Pythagorean_Theorem","Sine_wave","Power_factor","Integral","Cross_product","Vector_(geometric)","Michael_Faraday","Magnet","Electric_utility","Electric_power_transmission","Electric_power_distribution","Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity","Electric_power_industry","Power_station","Electrical_generator","Heat_engine","Combustion","Nuclear_fission","Kinetic_energy","Photovoltaics","Geothermal_power","Electrochemical_cell","Energy","Voltaic_pile","Alessandro_Volta","Daniell_cell","United_States_dollar","1000000000_(number)","Primary_battery","Secondary_battery","Hearing_aid","Telephone_exchange","Data_center","Electricity","Grid_connection","Power_station","Distributed_generation","Developed_nation","Developing_nation","Domestic_appliance","Office_equipment","Industry","Machinery","Public_utility","Infrastructure","High_voltage_cable","EGRID","Electric_energy_consumption","Rural_electrification"]}
