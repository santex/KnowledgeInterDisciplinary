The simplest photoreceptor cells in conscious vision\nconnect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical\nsystem which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its\nintensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of\nlenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals,\nand transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that\nconnect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the\nbrain. Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms,\nand 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system.<ref\nname=Land1992></ref> Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and\narthropods.<ref name=Frentiu2008>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1002/bies.20828 title = A butterfly eye's view of birds year = 2008\n | author = Frentiu, Francesca D. coauthors = Adriana D.
