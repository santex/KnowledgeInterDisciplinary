{"cursor":"4515","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biology, 'energy balance' is the biological homeostasis of energy in living\nsystems. It is measured with the following equation: Energy intake =\ninternal heat produced + external work + energy stored. It is also an\naspect of bioenergetics, concerning energy flow through living systems.\n\nIn the US, it is generally measured using the energy unit Calorie (i.e. kilogram\ncalorie), which equals the energy needed to increase the temperature of\n1 kg of water by 1 Â°C. This is about 4.184 kJ.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Energy_balance_(biology)","recorded":1362505027,"links":12,"instances":["nutrition","symptom"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nutrition"],"headings":["Energy intake","Energy expenditure","Imbalance between intake and expenditure","Energy requirement","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diet","nutrition"],["anorexia","symptom"]],"members":["diet","anorexia"],"related":["Biology","Energy","Bioenergetics","Energy","Calorie","Joule","Diet_(nutrition)","Hunger","Food_energy","Basal_metabolic_rate","Thermic_effect_of_food","Physical_activity_level","Overeating","Sedentary_lifestyle","Fat","Weight_gain","Overweight","Obesity","Anorexia_(symptom)","Anorexia_nervosa","Digestive_disease","Fasting","Famine","Overpopulation","Physical_activity_level","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","United_Nations","Harris-Benedict_equation","Calorie_restriction","Dynamic_Energy_Budget","Mass_balance","Time_balance"]}
