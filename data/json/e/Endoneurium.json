These are bundled up\ninto groups called nerve fascicles, which have a protective sheath called a\nperineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood\nsupply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. The\nendoneurium contains a low protein liquid known as endoneurial fluid that is the\nperipheral nervous system equivalent to cerebro-spinal fluid in the central\nnervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries can be identified by checking for\nincreased amounts of endoneurial fluid using magnetic resonance neurography.\n\nIt is continuous with septa which pass inward from the innermost layer of the\nperineurium, and shows a ground substance in which are imbedded fine bundles of\nfibrous connective tissue, primarily collagen, running for the most part\nlongitudinally. It serves to support capillary blood vessels, arranged so as to\nform a network with elongated meshes. It is found in other places too, such as\nsurrounding the Schwann cells on the peripheral side of the transitional zone on\nthe auditory nerve.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Endoneurium","recorded":1362554494,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soft tissue","Nervous system","Neuroanatomy"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Gray636.png/250px-Gray636.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Illu_nerve_structure.jpg/250px-Illu_nerve_structure.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Cat_brain.jpg/40px-Cat_brain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tibial_nerve","Terminologia_Anatomica","Connective_tissue","Myelin_sheath","Spinal_cord","Nerve_fiber","Nerve_fascicle","Perineurium","Blood","Protein","Peripheral_nervous_system","Cerebro-spinal_fluid","Central_nervous_system","Magnetic_resonance_neurography","Fibrous_connective_tissue","Collagen","Capillary","Blood_vessel","Schwann_cell","Auditory_nerve","Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system","Epineurium","Nerve_fascicle","Nerve_fiber","Perineurium","University_of_California,_Los_Angeles","Howard_University"]}
