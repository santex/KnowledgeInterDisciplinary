{"cursor":"21031","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Entrepreneurship' is the act and art of being an entrepreneur or one who\nundertakes innovations or introducing new things, finance and business acumen in\nan effort to transform innovations into economic goods. This may result in new\norganizations or may be part of revitalizing mature organizations in response to\na perceived opportunity. The most obvious form of entrepreneurship is that of\nstarting new businesses (referred as startup company); however, in recent years,\nthe term has been extended to include social and political forms of\nentrepreneurial activity. When entrepreneurship is describing activities within\na firm or large organization it is referred to as intra-preneurship and may\ninclude corporate venturing, when large entities spin-off\norganizations.\n\nAccording to Paul Reynolds, entrepreneurship scholar and creator of the Global\nEntrepreneurship Monitor, \"by the time they reach their retirement years, half\nof all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-\nemployment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-employment\nfor six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is a common\nactivity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers.\" And in\nrecent years has been documented by scholars such as David Audretsch to be a\nmajor driver of economic growth in both the United States and Western Europe.\n\"As well, entrepreneurship may be defined as the pursuit of opportunity without\nregard to resources currently controlled (Stevenson,1983)\"\n\nEntrepreneurial activities are substantially different depending on the type of\norganization and creativity involved. Entrepreneurship ranges in scale from solo\nprojects (even involving the entrepreneur only part-time) to major undertakings\ncreating many job opportunities. Many \"high value\" entrepreneurial ventures seek\nventure capital or angel funding (seed money) in order to raise capital to build\nthe business. Angel investors generally seek annualized returns of 20-30% and\nmore, as well as extensive involvement in the business. Many kinds of\norganizations now exist to support would-be entrepreneurs including specialized\ngovernment agencies, business incubators, science parks, and some NGOs. In more\nrecent times, the term entrepreneurship has been extended to include elements\nnot related necessarily to business formation activity such as\nconceptualizations of entrepreneurship as a specific mindset (see also\nentrepreneurial mindset) resulting in entrepreneurial initiatives e.g. in the\nform of social entrepreneurship, political entrepreneurship, or knowledge\nentrepreneurship have emerged.\n","linknr":397,"url":"Entrepreneurship","recorded":1362568850,"links":23,"instances":["corporate","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Entrepreneurship|"],"headings":["History","Characteristics of an entrepreneur","Concept","Promotion","Financial Bootstrapping","External financing","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Entrepreneurship_history.png/250px-Entrepreneurship_history.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Chicklet-currency.jpg/90px-Chicklet-currency.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capital","economics"],["capital","economics"],["stakeholder","corporate"]],"members":["stakeholder","capital"],"related":["Entrepreneur","Innovations","Organization","Organization","Business","Startup_company","Global_Entrepreneurship_Monitor","David_Audretsch","Venture_capital","Angel_investors","Seed_money","Capital_(economics)","Business_incubator","Science_park","Non-governmental_organization","Mindset","Entrepreneurial_mindset","Social_entrepreneurship","Political_entrepreneur","Knowledge_entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur","Microeconomics","Richard_Cantillon","Adam_Smith","Joseph_Schumpeter","Austrian_school","Carl_Menger","Ludwig_von_Mises","Friedrich_von_Hayek","Invention","Creative_destruction","Business_model","Economic_growth","Endogenous_growth_theory","Israel_Kirzner","Microeconomic","X-efficiency","Frank_H._Knight","Peter_Drucker","Risk","Capital_(economics)","Theory","William_Baumol","American_Economic_Association","Robert_Sobel","Zoltan_Acs","David_Audretsch","Global_Entrepreneurship_Monitor","Entrepreneur","Leadership","Great_man_theory","Creative_entrepreneurship","Global_Entrepreneurship_Week","Bootstrapping","Investor","Credit_card","Entrepreneur","Stakeholder_(corporate)","Dell","Facebook","Sweat_equity","Angel_Investors","Venture_capital","Crowd_funding","Hedge_Funds","Alternative_Asset_Management","Business_opportunity","Business_plan","Corporate_Social_Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneurship_Ecosystem","Entrepreneurship_education","Junior_enterprise","University_spin-off"]}
