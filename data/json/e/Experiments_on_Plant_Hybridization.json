Naturforsch. Ver. BrÃ¼nn\n4: 3â47 (in English in 1901, J. R. Hortic. Soc. 26: 1â32) (German:\nVersuche Ã¼ber Pflanzen-Hybriden) was the result after years spent studying\ngenetic traits in pea plants. Mendel read his paper to the Natural History\nSociety of BrÃ¼nn (Brno) on February 8 and March 8, 1865. It was published in the\n[[Proceedings of the Natural History Society of BrÃ¼nn]] the following year.\n\nIn his paper, Mendel compared seven discrete characters:\n\n* Color and smoothness of the seeds (yellow and round or green and wrinkled)\n* Color of the cotyledons (yellow or green)\n* Color of the flowers (white or violet)\n* Shape of the pods (full or constricted)\n* Color of unripe pods (yellow or green)\n* Position of flowers and pods on the stems\n* Height of the plants (short or tall)\n\nThrough experimentation, Mendel discovered that one inheritable trait would\ninvariably be dominant to its recessive alternative. This model, later known as\nMendelian inheritance or Mendelian genetics, provided an alternative to blending\ninheritance, which was the prevailing theory at the time. Mendel's work received\nlittle attention from the scientific community and was largely forgotten. It was\nnot until the early 20th century that Mendel's work was rediscovered and his\nideas used to help form the modern synthesis.\n\nIn 1936, the statistician R.A. Fisher used a chi-squared test to analyze\nMendel's data and concluded that Mendel's results with the predicted ratios were\nfar too perfect, indicating that adjustments (intentional or unconscious) had\nbeen made to the data to make the observations fit the hypothesis.\nLater authors have claimed Fisher's analysis was flawed, proposing various\nstatistical and botanical explanations for Mendel's numbers. It is\nalso possible that Mendel's results are \"too good\" merely because he reported\nthe best subset of his data — Mendel mentioned in his paper that the data\nwas from a subset of his experiments.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Experiments_on_Plant_Hybridization","recorded":1362486446,"links":15,"instances":["language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics experiments","1860s in science","1865 works","Botany books"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Mendel_seven_characters.svg/592px-Mendel_seven_characters.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["german","language"]],"members":["german"],"related":["Gregor_Mendel","German_(language)","Genetics","Brno","Cotyledons","Mendelian_inheritance","The_modern_synthesis","Ronald_Fisher","Pearson's_chi-squared_test"]}
