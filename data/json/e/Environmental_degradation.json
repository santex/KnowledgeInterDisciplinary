It is defined as any\n change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or\n undesirable. Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E.\n Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson.\n 1997. Meanings of environmental terms. Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581-\n 589.\n\nEnvironmental degradation is one of the Ten Threats officially cautioned by the\nHigh Level Threat Panel of the United Nations.\n\nThe United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines\nenvironmental degradation as âThe reduction of the capacity of the environment\nto meet social and ecological objectives, and needsâ.\n\nEnvironmental degradation is of many types. When natural habitats are destroyed\nor natural resources are depleted, environment is degraded.\n\n\nEnvironmental Change and Human Health, a special section of World Resources 1998-\n99 in this report describes how preventable illnesses and premature deaths are\nstill occurring in very large numbers. If vast improvements are made in human\nhealth, millions of people will be living longer, healthier lives than ever\nbefore. In these poorest regions of the world an estimated 11 million children,\nor about one in five, will not live to see their fifth birthday, primarily\nbecause of environment-related diseases. Child mortality is larger than the\ncombined populations of Norway and Switzerland, and mostly due to malaria, acute\nrespiratory infections or diarrhea â illnesses that are largely preventable.\n","linknr":253,"url":"Environmental_degradation","recorded":1362373409,"links":27,"instances":["biophysical"],"pdf":["http://www.cedem.ulg.ac.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf","http://meta2.com/PDB/Weekly/PDBEnvironmentalDegradation.pdf","http://www.thenewpublicfinance.org/background/Measuring%20country%20performance_nov2006%20update.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental issues","Environmental science"],"headings":["Water deterioration","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Wallaroo-mines-0749.jpg/220px-Wallaroo-mines-0749.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"]],"members":["environment"],"related":["Kadina,_South_Australia","Environment_(biophysical)","Air","Water","Soil","Ecosystems","Wildlife","Ten_Threats","High_Level_Threat_Panel","United_Nations","Illness","Premature_death","World","Child_mortality","Norway","Switzerland","Malaria","Acute_respiratory_infection","Diarrhea","Ice_caps","Biosphere","Irrigation","Developing_country","Climate_change","Atmospheric_CO2","Evaporation","Groundwater","Transpiration","Snowpack","Glaciers","Thermal_expansion","Salinity","Hydrologic_cycle","Meltwater","Positive_feedback","Bacterial_growth","Ecosystems","Soil_erosion","Water_quality","Greenhouse_effect","Evapotranspiration","Henrik_Urdal","Urbanization","Surface_runoff","Carbon_footprint","Human_migration","Environmental_issue","Ecological_collapse","Ecologically_sustainable_development","Exploitation_of_natural_resources","High_Level_Threat_Panel","United_Nations","Ten_Threats","United_Nations_Decade_on_Biodiversity","United_Nations_Development_Programme","United_Nations_Environment_Programme","World_Resources_Institute"]}
