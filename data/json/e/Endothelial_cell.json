The cells that form the endothelium are called 'endothelial\ncells'. Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular\nendothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as\nlymphatic endothelial cells.\n\nVascular endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to\nthe smallest capillaries. These cells have very distinct and unique functions\nthat are paramount to vascular biology. These functions include fluid\nfiltration, such as in the glomeruli of the kidney, blood vessel tone,\nhemostasis, neutrophil recruitment, and hormone trafficking. Endothelium of the\ninterior surfaces of the heart chambers are called endocardium.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Endothelial_cell","recorded":1362484932,"links":47,"instances":["biochemistry","kidney","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Angiology","Tissues"],"headings":["Terminology","Function","Pathology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Endothelial_cell.jpg/250px-Endothelial_cell.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Microvessel.jpg/250px-Microvessel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["lumen","anatomy"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["glomerulus","kidney"]],"members":["cofactor","glomerulus","lumen","cell"],"related":["Tunica_intima","Cell_(biology)","Blood_vessel","Lymphatic_vessels","Blood","Lymph","Lumen_(anatomy)","Circulatory_system","Heart","Capillaries","Ultrafiltration","Glomeruli","Muscle_tone","Hemostasis","Neutrophil","Hormone_trafficking","Endocardium","Vimentin","Keratin","Epithelial","White_blood_cell","Edema","Coagulation","Thrombosis","Fibrinolysis","Heparan_sulfate","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Antithrombin","Inflammation","Angiogenesis","Vasoconstriction","Vasodilation","Blood_pressure","Glomerulus_(kidney)","Bloodâ€“brain_barrier","Endothelial_dysfunction","Atherosclerosis","Coronary_artery_disease","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Hypercholesterolemia","Nitric_oxide","Asymmetric_dimethylarginine","Arginine","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Reactive_oxygen_species","ERK5","Von_Willebrand_factor","Epithelium","Apelin","Caveolae","Endocardium","Endothelial_activation","Endothelial_microparticle","Endothelial_progenitor_cell","Endothelium-derived_relaxing_factor","EDRF","Robert_F._Furchgott","Platelet_activation","Susac's_syndrome","Tunica_intima","VE-cadherin","Weibel-Palade_body","Informa_Healthcare","University_of_Washington"]}
