Trained within the Neo-Kantian Marburg School, he initially\nfollowed his mentor Hermann Cohen in attempting to supply an idealistic\nphilosophy of science; after Cohen's death, he developed a theory of\nsymbolism, and used it to expand phenomenology of knowledge into a more\ngeneral philosophy of culture.
