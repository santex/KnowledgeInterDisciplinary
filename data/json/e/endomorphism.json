For example, an endomorphism of a vector space V\nis a linear map ƒ:&nbsp;V&nbsp;→&nbsp;V, and an endomorphism of a group G is a\ngroup homomorphism ƒ:&nbsp;G&nbsp;→&nbsp;G. In general, we can talk about\nendomorphisms in any category. In the category of sets, endomorphisms are simply\nfunctions from a set S into itself.\n\nIn any category, the composition of any two endomorphisms of X is again an\nendomorphism of X. It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of X forms a\nmonoid, denoted End(X) (or End<sub>C</sub>(X) to emphasize the category C).\n\nAn invertible endomorphism of X is called an automorphism. The set of all\nautomorphisms is a subset of End(X) with a group structure, called the\nautomorphism group of X and denoted Aut(X). In the following diagram, the arrows\ndenote implication: {| border=\"0\"\n|- align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | automorphism align=\"center\" width=\"16%\" |\n|<math>\\Rightarrow</math> align=\"center\" width=\"42%\" | isomorphism -\n|align=\"center\" | <math>\\Downarrow</math>\n|\n| align=\"center\" | <math>\\Downarrow</math> - align=\"center\" | endomorphism\n| align=\"center\" | <math>\\Rightarrow</math> align=\"center\" | (homo)morphism }\n\nAny two endomorphisms of an abelian group A can be added together by the rule\n(ƒ&nbsp;+&nbsp;g)(a)&nbsp;=&nbsp;ƒ(a)&nbsp;+&nbsp;g(a). Under this addition, the\nendomorphisms of an abelian group form a ring (the endomorphism ring). For\nexample, the set of endomorphisms of 'Z'<sup>n</sup> is the ring of all\nn&nbsp;×&nbsp;n matrices with integer entries. The endomorphisms of a vector\nspace or module also form a ring, as do the endomorphisms of any object in a\npreadditive category. The endomorphisms of a nonabelian group generate an\nalgebraic structure known as a nearring. Every ring with one is the endomorphism\nring of its regular module, and so is a subring of an endomorphism ring of an\nabelian group,<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 162, Theorem 3.2.</ref> however there are\nrings which are not the endomorphism ring of any abelian group.\n","title":"endomorphism","headings":["Operator theory","Endofunctions in mathematics","Notes","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Homomorphism","2: Mathematics","2: Vector_space","2: Automorphism","1: Morphism","1: Mathematical_object","1: Linear_map","1: Group_homomorphism","1: Category_theory","1: Function_composition","1: Monoid","1: Inverse_element","1: Subset","1: Automorphism_group","1: Isomorphism","1: Abelian_group","1: Endomorphism_ring","1: Preadditive_category","1: Nearring","1: Regular_module","1: Concrete_category","1: Unary_operator","1: Topology","1: Boundedness","1: Operator_theory","1: Codomain","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Permutation","1: Bijection","1: Adjoint_endomorphism","1: Frobenius_endomorphism"]}
