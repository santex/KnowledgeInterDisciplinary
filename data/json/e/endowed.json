The total value of an institution's investments is often referred\nto as the institution's endowment and is typically organized as a public\ncharity, private foundation, or trust.\n\nAmong the institutions that commonly manage an endowment are academic\ninstitutions (e.g., colleges, universities, private schools), cultural\ninstitutions (e.g., museums, libraries, theaters, hospitals), and religious\nestablishments.\n\nAn endowment may come with stipulations regarding its usage. In some\ncircumstances an endowment may be required to be spent in a certain way or\nalternatively invested, with the to remain intact in perpetuity or for a defined\ntime period. This allows for the donation to have an impact over a longer period\nof time than if it were spent all at once.\n","title":"Financial%20endowment","headings":["College and university endowments","Financial operation","Quasi-endowments","Types of endowment funds","Criticisms","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Scholarship","2: Stoicism","2: Harvard_University","2: Stanford_University","1: Money","1: Property","1: Institution","1: Public_charity","1: Private_foundation","1: College","1: Universities","1: Private_school","1: Invest","1: University_of_Cambridge","1: University_of_Oxford","1: Paola,_Kansas","1: Professor","1: College_and_university_rankings","1: Roman_Empire","1: Emperor","1: Philosophy","1: Marcus_Aurelius","1: Athens","1: Platonism","1: Aristotelianism","1: Epicureanism","1: Lady_Margaret_Beaufort","1: Henry_VIII_of_England","1: Lady_Margaret's_Professor_of_Divinity","1: Regius_Professorships","1: University_of_Glasgow","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics","1: Stephen_Hawking","1: Doctorate","1: Financial_crisis_of_2007–2010","1: Yale_University","1: Private_equity","1: Brown_University","1: Bloomberg_L.P.","1: George_Washington_University","1: University_of_Toronto","1: Nobel_laureate","1: James_Tobin","1: Intergenerational_equity","1: Academia","1: Harvard","1: Yale","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: Princeton_University","1: Rice_University","1: Charles_Grassley","1: Scholarships","1: List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_by_endowment","1: List_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations","1: Lists_of_institutions_of_higher_education_by_endowment","1: Endowment_tax","1: Endowment_invasion"]}
