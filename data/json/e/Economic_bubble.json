{"cursor":"27212","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'economic bubble' (sometimes referred to as a 'speculative bubble', a 'market\nbubble', a 'price bubble', a 'financial bubble', a 'speculative mania' or a\n'balloon') is \"trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance\nwith intrinsic values\". It\ncould also be described as a trade in products or assets with inflated values.\n\nWhile some economists deny that bubbles occur, the cause of bubbles\nremains a challenge to those who are convinced that asset prices often deviate\nstrongly from intrinsic values.\n\nWhile many explanations have been suggested, it has been recently shown that\nbubbles appear even without uncertainty,\nspeculation, or bounded rationality. It has also been suggested that bubbles might\nultimately be caused by processes of price coordination or emerging\nsocial norms.\n\nBecause it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets,\nbubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, when a sudden drop\nin prices appears. Such a drop is known as a [[asset price crash|crash]] or a\nbubble burst. Both the boom and the burst phases of the bubble are examples of a\npositive feedback mechanism, in contrast to the negative feedback mechanism that\ndetermines the equilibrium price under normal market circumstances. Prices in an\neconomic bubble can fluctuate erratically, and become impossible to predict from\nsupply and demand alone.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Economic_bubble","recorded":1362480504,"links":57,"instances":["finance"],"pdf":["http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2003/01/pdf/chapter2.pdf"],"categories":["Economic bubbles|","Financial crises","Economic problems","Business cycle","Business failures","Behavioral and social facets of systemic risk"],"headings":["Origin of term","Impact","Possible causes","Examples of bubbles and purported bubbles","Examples of aftermaths of bubbles","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/South_Sea_Bubble_Cards-Tree.png/250px-South_Sea_Bubble_Cards-Tree.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intrinsic_value","finance"],["intrinsic_value","finance"]],"members":["intrinsic_value"],"related":["Intrinsic_value_(finance)","Uncertainty","Speculation","Bounded_rationality","Intrinsic_value_(finance)","Economic_boom","Recession","Positive_feedback","Negative_feedback","Equilibrium_price","South_Sea_Bubble","Tulip_mania","Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr.","Debt-deflation","Financial_Instability_Hypothesis","Schools_of_economic_thought","Mainstream_economics","Financial_crises","Monetary_policy","Fiscal_policy","Austrian_economics","Austrian_business_cycle_theory","Political_economist","Robert_E._Wright","Ex_ante","Debt-deflation","Irving_Fisher","Post-Keynesian_economics","Great_Depression","Japanese_asset_price_bubble","Wealth_effect","Real_estate_economics","United_Kingdom","Australia","New_Zealand","Spain","United_States","Interest_rate","Subprime_mortgage","Fed_funds_rate","Bounded_rationality","Greater_fool_theory","Speculation","Bank","Axel_A._Weber","Deutsche_Bundesbank","Equities","Real_estate","Financial_leverage","Debt_to_GDP_ratio","Greater_fool_theory","Extrapolation","Behavioral_finance","Herd_behavior","Technical_analysis","Self-fulfilling_prophecy","Mutual_fund","Moral_hazard","Risk-return_spectrum","Government_policy","Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program","The_Economist","Cartel","Oligopoly","Collusion","Mergers_and_acquisitions","Inflation","Asset","Fundamental_analysis","Tipper_and_See-Saw_Time","Tulip_mania","South_Sea_Company","Mississippi_Company","Railway_Mania","Encilhamento","Florida_land_boom_of_the_1920s","Roaring_Twenties","Poseidon_bubble","Japanese_asset_price_bubble","1997_Asian_Financial_Crisis","Dot-com_bubble","Real_estate_bubble","Australian_property_bubble","Indian_property_bubble","British_property_bubble","Irish_property_bubble","United_States_housing_bubble","Florida_swampland","Spanish_property_bubble","China_stock_and_property_bubble","Romanian_property_bubble","Uranium_bubble_of_2007","Rhodium","Stamp_collecting","Coin_collecting","Great_Depression","Panic_of_1837","Stock_market_bubble","Real_estate_bubble","Economic_collapse","Financial_crisis","Fictitious_capital","Boom_and_bust","Speculation","Business_cycle","Hyman_Minsky","Jesse_Lauriston_Livermore","Robert_Shiller"]}
