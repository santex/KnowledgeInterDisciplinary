There are however several characteristics common to most extreme\nsports. [http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-athletes-told-\nme.html What the Athletes Told Me. CQ Researcher Blog] While not the\nexclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average\ntarget demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools. Extreme\nsports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports . (Rafting and paintballing are notable\nexception, as they are done in teams.) In addition, beginning extreme athletes\ntend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may\nhire a coach later).\n\nActivities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports\ndue to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These\nenvironmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including\nwind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be\ncontrolled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.\n\nIn a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under\ncontrolled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled\nsporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot\nbe held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions\nfor snowboarders, rock and ice quality for climbers, and wave height and\nshape for surfers.\n\nWhilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing\nperformance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often\nevaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.
