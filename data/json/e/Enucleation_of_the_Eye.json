This\ntype of ocular surgery is indicated for a number of ocular tumors, in eyes that\nhave suffered severe trauma, and in eyes that are otherwise blind and\npainful.\n\n'Auto-enucleation' ('oedipism') and other forms of serious self-inflicted eye\ninjury are an extremely rare form of severe self-harm that usually results from\nmental illnesses involving acute psychosis.
