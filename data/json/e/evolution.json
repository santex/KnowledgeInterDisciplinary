This lead has been discussed and there is general\nconsensus that this is the best one for now. Thanks.--> 'Evolution' is the\nchange in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over\nsuccessive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every\nlevel of biological organisation, including species, individual organisms and\nmolecules such as DNA and proteins.<ref name=\"Hall08\"></ref>\n\nAll life on Earth is descended from a last universal ancestor that lived\napproximately 3.8 billion years ago. Repeated speciation and the divergence of\nlife can be inferred from shared sets of biochemical and morphological traits,\nor by shared DNA sequences.<ref name=\"The Cell by Panno\"></ref> These homologous\ntraits and sequences are more similar among species that share a more recent\ncommon ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct evolutionary histories, using\nboth existing species and the fossil record. Existing patterns of biodiversity\nhave been shaped both by speciation and by extinction.<ref\nname=\"Cracraft05\"></ref>\n\nCharles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory\nof evolution by means of natural selection. Evolution by natural selection is a\nprocess that is inferred from three facts about populations: 1) more offspring\nare produced than can possibly survive, 2) traits vary among individuals,\nleading to different rates of survival and reproduction, and 3) trait\ndifferences are heritable.<ref name=\"Lewontin70\"></ref> Thus, when members of a\npopulation die they are replaced by the progeny of parents that were better\nadapted to survive and reproduce in the environment in which natural selection\ntook place. This process creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted\nfor the functional roles they perform.<ref name=\"On The Origin of\nSpecies\"></ref> Natural selection is the only known cause of adaptation, but not\nthe only known cause of evolution. Other, nonadaptive causes of evolution\ninclude mutation and genetic drift.<ref name=\"Kimura M 1991 367–86\"></ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, genetics was integrated with Darwin's theory of\nevolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics.\nThe importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into\nother branches of biology. Moreover, previously held notions about evolution,\nsuch as orthogenesis and \"progress\" became obsolete.<ref></ref> Scientists\ncontinue to study various aspects of evolution by forming and testing\nhypotheses, constructing scientific theories, using observational data, and\nperforming experiments in both the field and the laboratory. Biologists agree\nthat descent with modification is one of the most reliably established facts in\nscience.<ref name=\"NAS\"></ref> Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a\nsignificant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also\nin other academic disciplines (e.g., anthropology and psychology) and on society\nat large.<ref name=\"Moore09\"></ref><ref
