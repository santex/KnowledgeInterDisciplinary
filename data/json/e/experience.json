The\nactual observation of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]\n4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of\nbeing consciously affected by an event. [...] b. In religious use: A state of\nmind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of\na person) with regard to religious emotion. [...] 6. What has been experienced;\nthe events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a\ncommunity, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally.\n[...] 7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has\nundergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study\nor practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to\nwhich, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the\naptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired.\" </ref> The history of the\nword experience aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]]. For\nexample, the word experience could be used in a statement like: \"I have\nexperience in fishing\".\n\nThe concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge,\nrather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-\nlearning. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience \"empirical knowledge\"\nor \"a posteriori knowledge\".\n\nThe interrogation of experience has a long tradition in continental philosophy.\nExperience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. The\nGerman term [[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]], often translated into English as\n\"experience\", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of\nlife's experiences.\n\nA person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation\nas an expert.\n\nCertain religious traditions (such as types of Buddhism, Surat Shabd Yoga,\nmysticism and Pentecostalism) and educational paradigms with, for example, the\nconditioning of military recruit-training (also known as \"boot camps\"), stress\nthe experiential nature of human epistemology. This stands in contrast to\nalternatives: traditions of dogma, logic or reasoning. Participants in\nactivities such as tourism, extreme sports and recreational drug-use also tend\nto stress the importance of experience.\n",
