Although those\nsessions produced good results—the leadoff single, \"Love Untold\", among\nthem—Westerberg and O'Brien parted ways. O'Brien was pressed for time, and\nWesterberg needed more time to write enough songs to fill out a full album.\nWesterberg regrouped with Lou Giordano.\n\nThe song \"Good Day\" was written for late Replacements guitarist Bob Stinson. It\nreferences \"Hold My Life\", a track from the album [[Tim (album)|Tim]].\n","title":"eventually","headings":["Track listing","Personnel","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Paul_Westerberg","2: Lou_Giordano","1: Alternative_rock","1: Reprise_Records","1: Allmusic","1: Bob_Stinson","1: Barry_Mann","1: Cynthia_Weil","1: Guitar","1: Singing","1: Bass_guitar","1: Piano","1: Saxophone","1: Keyboard_instrument","1: Tommy_Stinson","1: Trombone"]}
