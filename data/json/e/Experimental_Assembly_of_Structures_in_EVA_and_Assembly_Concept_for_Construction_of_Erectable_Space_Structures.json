The purpose of the experiments was to study how quickly\nastronauts would become proficient at assembling space structures during\nextravehicular activity, and how quickly they would become fatigued, and to\nexplore various construction and maintenance techniques. In particular,\nresearchers studied the applied moments of inertia arising in the manual\nassembly of a large space structure.\n\nEASE was a project of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Space Systems\nLaboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and later at the\nUniversity of Maryland, while ACCESS was developed by NASA's Langley Research\nCenter.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Experimental_Assembly_of_Structures_in_EVA_and_Assembly_Concept_for_Construction_of_Erectable_Space_Structures","recorded":1362553381,"links":16,"instances":["physics","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_023_STS-61B_Press_Kit.pdf","http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_023_STS-61B_Press_Kit.pdf","http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/OConnorBD/OConnorBD_3-17-04.pdf"],"categories":["Space Shuttle program","Space science experiments"],"headings":["Experiment and EVAs","Results","Conclusion","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Ease_assembly.jpg/297px-Ease_assembly.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Structures_in_Space_-_GPN-2000-001080.jpg/252px-Structures_in_Space_-_GPN-2000-001080.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/STS-61-B_access_practice.jpg/260px-STS-61-B_access_practice.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drag","physics"],["impulse","physics"]],"members":["impulse","drag"],"related":["Remote_Manipulator_System","Space_Shuttle","STS-61-B","Astronaut","Extravehicular_activity","Moment_of_inertia","NASA","Marshall_Space_Flight_Center","Space_Systems_Laboratory","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","University_of_Maryland,_College_Park","Langley_Research_Center","Jerry_L._Ross","Sherwood_C._Spring","Tetrahedron","Truss","Extra-vehicular_activity","Aluminum","Remote_Manipulator_System","Mary_L._Cleave","Stereoscopy","Inertia","Drag_(physics)","Mass","Neutral_buoyancy","IMAX","Learning_curve","Space_suit","Impulse_(physics)","List_of_spacewalks_and_moonwalks_1965â€“1999","Space_Shuttle_program","Human_factors"]}
