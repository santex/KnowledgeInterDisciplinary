Symptoms of economic water scarcity include a lack\nof infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers or lakes\nfor domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic\nwater scarcity; developing water infrastructure there could therefore help to\nreduce poverty.\n\nThe term was first defined in a wide-ranging 2007 study on the use of water in\nagriculture over the past 50 years Molden, D. (Ed). of practitioners,\nresearchers and policymakers, overseen by the International Water Management\nInstitute in Sri Lanka, with the aim of finding out if the world had sufficient\nwater resources to produce food in future for the growing population.\n\nThe term physical water scarcity was used by the study to define situations\nwhere there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for\necosystems to function effectively.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Economic_water_scarcity","recorded":1362372045,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Water","Land management"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Water_scarcity","Water","Infrastructure","Africa","Poverty","Agriculture","International_Water_Management_Institute","Sri_Lanka","Physical_water_scarcity","Ecosystem"]}
