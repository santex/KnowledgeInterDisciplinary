{"cursor":"2052","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]]\n\nAn 'endoskeleton' (From Greek á¼Î½Î´Î¿Î½, Ã©ndon = \"within\", \"inner\" + ÏÎºÎµÎ»ÎµÏÏÏ,\nskeletos = \"skeleton\") is an internal support structure of an animal, composed\nof mineralized tissue. Endoskeleton develops within the skin or in the deeper\nbody tissues. The vertebrate is basically an endoskeleton made up of two types\nof tissues (bone and cartilage). During early embryonic development the\nendoskeleton is composed of notochord and cartilage. The notochord in most\nvertebrates is replaced by vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in\nmost adults.In three phyla and one subclass of animals, endoskeletons of various\ncomplexity are found: Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera, and Coleoidea. An\nendoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of sponges), but\noften serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting\nmuscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. Such a\nskeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton'\nconsists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules or a spongin network.\nThe Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a\nmollusk exoskeleton evolved into several sorts of internal structure, the\n\"cuttlebone\" of cuttlefish being the best-known version. Yet they do have\ncartilaginous tissue in their body, even if it is not mineralized, especially in\nthe head, where it forms a primitive cranium.The endoskeleton gives\nshape,support and protection to the body and provides a means of locomotion.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Endoskeleton","recorded":1362557208,"links":33,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal anatomy","Biomechanics","Skeletal system","Zoology"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Swordfish_skeleton.jpg/200px-Swordfish_skeleton.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Skeletons.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Veterinary_Surgeon.jpg/40px-Veterinary_Surgeon.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Kaprosuchus.jpg/70px-Kaprosuchus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","biology"]],"members":["class"],"related":["Animal","Mineralized_tissues","Notochord","Cartilage","Phylum","Class_(biology)","Chordata","Echinoderm","Porifera","Coleoidea","Porifera","Skeleton","Spicule","Spongin","Mollusk","Exoskeleton","Evolution","Cuttlefish","Exoskeleton","Hydrostatic_skeleton"]}
