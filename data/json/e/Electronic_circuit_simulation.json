Simulation software allows\nfor modeling of circuit operation and is an invaluable analysis tool. Due to its\nhighly accurate modeling capability, many Colleges and Universities use this\ntype of software for the teaching of electronics technician and electronics\nengineering programs. Electronics simulation software engages the user by\nintegrating them into the learning experience. These kinds of interactions\nactively engage learners to analyze, , organize, and evaluate content and result\nin learners constructing their own knowledge. http://e-articles.info/e/a/title/Disadvantages-and-Advantages-\nof-Simulations-in-Online-Education/\n\nSimulating a circuitâs behavior before actually building it can greatly improve\ndesign efficiency by making faulty designs known as such, and providing insight\ninto the behavior of electronics circuit designs. In particular, for integrated\ncircuits, the tooling (photomasks) is expensive, breadboards are impractical,\nand probing the behavior of internal signals is extremely difficult. Therefore\nalmost all IC design relies heavily on simulation. The most well known analog\nsimulator is SPICE. Probably the best known digital simulators are those based\non Verilog and VHDL.\n\nSome electronics simulators integrate a schematic editor, a simulation engine,\nand on-screen waveforms (see Figure 1), and make âwhat-ifâ scenarios easy and\ninstant. They also typically contain extensive model and device libraries. These\nmodels typically include IC specific transistor models such as BSIM, generic\ncomponents such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transformers, user\ndefined models (such as controlled current and voltage sources, or models in Verilog-\nA or VHDL-AMS). Printed circuit board (PCB) design requires specific models as\nwell, such as transmission lines for the traces and IBIS models for driving and\nreceiving electronics. waveform displays.|thumb|right]]\n","linknr":181,"url":"Electronic_circuit_simulation","recorded":1362480364,"links":19,"instances":["design_software"],"pdf":["http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~vignat/Signal/oslo.pdf","http://dragao.co.it.pt/conftele2001/proc/pap006.pdf"],"categories":["Electronic design automation","Simulation programming languages"],"headings":["Types","Complexities","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/CircuitLogix1.jpg/220px-CircuitLogix1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/CircuitLogix3.jpg/220px-CircuitLogix3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["proteus","design_software"]],"members":["proteus"],"related":["Colleges","Universities","Electronics_technician","Electronics_engineering","Organize","Integrated_circuits","Photomask","Breadboard","Integrated_circuit_design","SPICE","Verilog","VHDL","Schematic_editor","Waveforms","Transistor_models","Resistor","Capacitor","Inductor","Transformer","Verilog-A","VHDL-AMS","Printed_circuit_board","Transmission_line","IBIS_Interconnect_Modeling_Specification","Analog_signal","Signal_analysis","Algorithm","Integrated_circuit","Boolean_logic","Transmission_line","Signal_integrity","Power_electronics","Piecewise_linear","Power_electronics","Process_variation","List_of_free_electronics_circuit_simulators","CircuitLogix","Micro-Cap","Multisim","PLECS","Proteus_(design_software)","Qucs","SPICE","Transistor_models","Verilog","VHDL","Yenka"]}
