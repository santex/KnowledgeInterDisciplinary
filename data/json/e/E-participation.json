Processes may concern administration,\nservice delivery, decision making and policy making. E-participation is hence\nclosely related to e-government and (e-)governance participation. The need for\nthe term has emerged as citizen benefits and values have often received less\nattention in e-government development than those of the service providers, and\nthe need to distinguish the roles of citizen and customer has become clearer.\n\nA more detailed definition sees e-participation as \"the use of information and\ncommunication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by\nenabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected\nrepresentatives\" . This definition includes all stakeholders in democratic decision-\nmaking processes and not only citizen related top-down government initiatives.\nSo e-participation can be seen as part of e-democracy, whereas e-democracy\nmeans the use of ICT by governments in general used by elected officials,\nmedia, political parties and interest groups, civil society organizations,\ninternational governmental organizations, or citizens/voters within any of the\npolitical processes of states/regions, nations, and local and global\ncommunities .\n\nThe complexity of e-participation processes results from the large number of\ndifferent participation areas, involved stakeholders, levels of engagement, and\nstages in policy making, which characterize the research and applications .\n","linknr":216,"url":"E-participation","recorded":1362688483,"links":19,"instances":["decision_making"],"pdf":["http://projects.ischool.washington.edu/mcdonald/papers/Kriplean.et.al.SMTWorkshop.CHI09.pdf","http://projects.ischool.washington.edu/mcdonald/papers/Kriplean.et.al.SMTWorkshop.CHI09.pdf","http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan028607.pdf"],"categories":["E-democracy","Democracy","Collective intelligence","Government"],"headings":["History","On the definition","Models and tools for e-participation","European eParticipation actions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["participation","decision_making"]],"members":["participation"],"related":["Information_and_communication_technologies","E-government","Governance","Participation_(decision_making)","Citizen","Customer","E-democracy","CSCW","Groupware","E-democracy","Internet_petition","E-government","Structuration_theory","Institutional_theory","Actor-Network_Theory","Web_2.0","Wikis","Online_social_networking","Blogs","EVoting","Reputation_system","Internet_petition","Social_translucence","Digital_traces","Data_mining","Data_visualization","Simulations","Agent-based_social_simulation","European_Parliament","European_Commission","Seventh_Framework_Programme","European_Commission","E-democracy","Direct_democracy","EGovernment","Electronic_civil_disobedience","ERulemaking","Emergent_democracy","Hacktivism","Internet_activism","Online_consultation","Online_deliberation","Online_participation","Open_politics","Open_source_governance","Collaborative_e-democracy","Participatory_democracy","Parliamentary_informatics","Radical_transparency","Second_Superpower","Smart_mob","Social_translucence","Virtual_volunteering"]}
