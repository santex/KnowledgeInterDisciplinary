The moment of extinction is generally\nconsidered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the\ncapacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. Because a\nspecies' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is\ndifficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to\nphenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly \"re-\nappears\" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.\n\nThrough evolution, new species arise through the process of speciationâwhere new\nvarieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit\nan ecological nicheâand species become extinct when they are no longer able to\nsurvive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship\nbetween animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established. A typical species\nbecomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance, Newman, Mark.\n\"[http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/newmme/science/extinction.html A Mathematical\nModel for Mass Extinction]\". Cornell University. May 20, 1994. Retrieved July\n30, 2006. although some species, called living fossils, survive virtually\nunchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Most extinctions have occurred\nnaturally, prior to Homo sapiens walking on Earth: it is estimated that 99.9% of\nall species that have ever existed are now extinct. Raup, David M.

Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have\nbecome alarmed at the high rates of recent extinctions.
