communication","Measurement"],"text":"\n\n at Montparnasse, France, 1895 ]]\n\nThe word 'error' entails different meanings and usages relative to how it is\nconceptually applied. The concrete meaning of the Latin word \"error\" is\n\"wandering\" or \"straying\". Unlike an illusion, an error or a mistake can\nsometimes be dispelled through knowledge (knowing that one is looking at a\nmirage and not at real water does not make the mirage disappear). For example, a\nperson who uses too much of an ingredient in a recipe and has a failed product\ncan learn the right amount to use and avoid repeating the mistake. However, some\nerrors can occur even when individuals have the required knowledge to perform a\ntask correctly. Examples include forgetting to collect change after buying\nchocolate from a vending machine, forgetting the original document after making\nphotocopies, and forgetting to turn the gas off after cooking a meal. Some\nerrors occur when an individual is distracted by something else.\n","title":"error","headings":["Human behavior","Science and engineering","Numerical analysis","Cybernetics","Biology","Philately","Law","Governmental policy","Numismatics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Faux_pas","2: Error_analysis","2: Spoonerism","2: Malapropism","2: System","2: Cognitive_bias","1: Gare_Montparnasse","1: France","1: Conceptually","1: Illusion","1: Adolph_Northen","1: Human_behavior","1: Social_norms","1: Misdemeanor","1: Crime","1: Sin","1: Language","1: Grammar","1: Syntax","1: Pronunciation","1: Punctuation","1: Social_class","1: Linguistics","1: Descriptive","1: Prescriptive","1: Arnold_Zwicky","1: Aphasia","1: Speech_disorder","1: Runway","1: Airfield_traffic_pattern","1: Devon","1: Gaff","1: Social_environment","1: Body_language","1: Gilles_Deleuze","1: Medical_error","1: Statistics","1: Performance","1: Behavior","1: Control_system","1: Type_I_and_type_II_errors","1: Engineer","1: Gadget","1: Machine","1: Hanlon's_Razor","1: Design","1: Human_error","1: Human_factors","1: Error-tolerant","1: Computational_mechanics","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Approximation","1: Floating-point_arithmetic","1: Rational_number","1: Approximation_error","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Government","1: Cybernetics","1: Norbert_Wiener","1: Noise","1: Gordon_Pask","1: Servomechanism","1: Management_cybernetics","1: Stafford_Beer","1: Viable_System_Model","1: Biology","1: Information","1: DNA","1: Nucleotide","1: Child","1: Parent","1: Evolution","1: Natural_selection","1: Offspring","1: Philately","1: Postage_stamp","1: Postal_stationery","1: Inverted_Jenny","1: Appeal","1: Trial_court","1: Legal_case","1: Jury_instruction","1: Jury","1: Legal_burden_of_proof","1: Central_Intelligence_Agency","1: General_public","1: Citizenry","1: United_States","1: Numismatics","1: Coin","1: Medal","1: Anomaly_in_software","1: Blooper","1: Error_message","1: Kinsley_gaffe","1: Observational_error","1: Popular_errors","1: Refractive_error","1: Trial_and_error","1: Uncertainty","1: Absent-mindedness","1: Freudian_slip","1: Lapsus","1: Fallacy","1: Typographical_error","1: Custom_error_page","1: Error_detection_and_correction","1: Error_Detection_and_Handling","1: Forensic_engineering","1: Root_cause","1: Root_cause_analysis","1: Spell_checking","1: Swiss_cheese_model"]}
