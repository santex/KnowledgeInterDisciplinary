The blue arrow is\n an eigenvector of this shear mapping, and since its length is unchanged its\n eigenvalue is 1.]]\n\nAn 'eigenvector' of a square matrix <math>A</math> is a non-zero vector\n<math>v</math> that, when multiplied by <math>A</math>, yields the eigen vector\nmultiplied by a single number <math>\\lambda</math>; that is:\n\n<math>A v = \\lambda v</math>\n\nThe number <math>\\lambda</math> is called the 'eigenvalue' of <math>A</math>\ncorresponding to <math>v</math>.<ref name=WolframEigenvector> Wolfram Research,\nInc. (2010) [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eigenvector.html Eigenvector].\nAccessed on 2010-01-29. </ref>\n\nIn analytic geometry, for example, a three-element vector may be seen as an\narrow in three-dimensional space starting at the origin. In that case, an\neigenvector of a 3×3 matrix <math>A</math> is an arrow whose direction is either\npreserved or exactly reversed after multiplication by <math>A</math>. The\ncorresponding eigenvalue determines how the length of the arrow is changed by\nthe operation, and whether its direction is reversed or not.\n\nIn abstract linear algebra, these concepts are naturally extended to more\ngeneral situations, where the set of real scale factors is replaced by any field\nof scalars (such as algebraic or complex numbers); the set of Cartesian vectors\n<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is replaced by any vector space (such as the\ncontinuous functions, the polynomials or the trigonometric series), and matrix\nmultiplication is replaced by any linear operator that maps vectors to vectors\n(such as the derivative from calculus). In such cases, the \"vector\" in\n\"eigenvector\" may be replaced by a more specific term, such as \"eigenfunction\",\n\"eigenmode\", \"eigenface\", or \"eigenstate\". Thus, for example, the exponential\nfunction <math>f(x) = a^x</math> is an eigenfunction of the derivative operator\n\" <math>{}'</math> \", with eigenvalue <math>\\lambda = \\ln a</math>, since its\nderivative is <math>f'(x) = (\\ln a)a^x = \\lambda f(x)</math>.\n\nThe set of all eigenvectors of a matrix (or linear operator), each paired with\nits corresponding eigenvalue, is called the 'eigensystem' of that\nmatrix.<ref>William H.

The prefix '[[wikt:eigen|eigen-]]' is\nadopted from the German word eigen for \"self\" or \"proper\".\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors have many applications in both pure and applied\nmathematics. They are used in matrix factorization, in quantum mechanics, and in\nmany other areas.\n","title":"Eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors","headings":["Definition","Generalizations to infinite-dimensional
