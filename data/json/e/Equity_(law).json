In civil\nlegal systems, broad \"general clauses\" allow judges to have similar leeway in\napplying the code. Glendon MA et al. (2008). Comparative Legal Traditions In\na Nutshell, 3rd edition, pp. 142â143. Thomson-West. For example, Glendon et al.\nArticle 138 of the German Civil Code states that \"a transaction that offends\ngood morals (guten Sitten) is void\".\n\nEquity is commonly said to \"mitigate the rigor of common law\", allowing courts\nto use their discretion and apply justice in accordance with natural law. In\npractice, modern equity is limited by substantive and procedural rules, and\nEnglish and Australian legal writers tend to focus on technical aspects of\nequity. There are 12 \"vague ethical statements\", known as the Maxims of\nequity, Hudson states that these are primarily \"culled\nfrom Snell's Equity, the 4th edition of which can be read online.

Routledge-Cavendish.\n\nAs noted below, a historical criticism of equity as it developed was that it had\nno fixed rules of its own, with the Lord Chancellor occasionally judging in the\nmain according to his own conscience. The rules of equity later lost much of\ntheir flexibility, and from the 17th century onwards equity was rapidly\nconsolidated into a system of precedents much like its common-law cousin.\n","linknr":392,"url":"Equity_(law)","recorded":1362570281,"links":40,"instances":["legal","medieval_office","law","legal_system","law"],"pdf":["http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-260.pdf"],"categories":["Common law","Core issues in ethics","Equity (law)|","Legal doctrines and principles|"],"headings":["History","Comparison of equity traditions in common law countries","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Court_of_Chancery_edited.jpg/250px-Court_of_Chancery_edited.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/70px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["civil_law","legal_system"],["code","law"],["chancery","medieval_office"],["use","legal"],["will","law"]],"members":["use","chancery","will","civil_law","code"],"related":["London","English_law","Common_law","Law","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Code_(law)","Bürgerliches_Gesetzbuch","Justice","Substantive_law","Procedural_law","Maxims_of_equity","Lord_Chancellor","Common_law","History","Medieval","Lord_Chancellor","Confessor","Chancery_(medieval_office)","Court_of_Chancery","Use_(legal)","The_Crown","Parliament","Thomas_More","John_Selden","Jurisdiction_shopping","Injunction","King’s_Bench","Edward_Coke","Thomas_Egerton,_1st_Viscount_Brackley","Attorney-General","Francis_Bacon","James_I_of_England","Judicature_Act","Statute_of_Uses","Reception_of_the_common_law","Philip_Yorke,_1st_Earl_of_Hardwicke","Writ","Habeas_corpus","Injunction","Trier_of_fact","Jury_trial","Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Injunction","Declaratory_judgment","Specific_performance","Thomas_Jefferson","Contract","Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act","David_Dudley_Field_II","Field_Code","Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure","Delaware","Delaware_Court_of_Chancery","Delaware_corporation","Courts_of_Mississippi","Courts_of_Tennessee","Courts_of_Arkansas","New_Jersey","Corporate_law","Trust_law","Will_(law)","Probate","Adoption","Guardianship","Marriage","Divorce","Joinder","Counterclaim","Cross-claim","Interpleader","Class_action","India","Common_law","Specific_Relief_Act_1963","Parliament_of_India","Law_Commission_of_India","Contract","Injunction","Inherent_Powers","Civil_court","High_Courts_of_India","Supreme_Court_of_India","Constitution_of_India","Case_law","Common_law","Court_of_Chancery","Delaware_Court_of_Chancery","Equitable_remedy","Inequity_aversion","Maxims_of_equity","Restitution","Statutory_law","Trust_Law","Undue_influence","Unjust_enrichment"]}
