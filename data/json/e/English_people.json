The English identity is of early mediaeval origin, when they were known\nin Old English as the Anglecynn. England is a country of the United Kingdom, and\nEnglish people in England are British Citizens. Their ethnonym is derived from\nthe Angles, Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain after the fifth\ncentury AD.\n\nHistorically, the English population is descended from several genetically\nsimilar peoplesâthe earlier Britons (or Brythons), the Germanic tribes that\nsettled in the region, including Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, collectively known\nas the Anglo-Saxons, who founded what was to become England (from the Old\nEnglish Englaland), and the later Danes, Normans and other groups. Following the\nAct of Union in 1707, in which the Kingdom of England became part of the Kingdom\nof Great Britain, English customs and identity became closely aligned\nwith British customs and identity.\n\nToday, some English people have recent forbears from other parts of the United\nKingdom, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other\nEuropean countries and from the Commonwealth.\n\nThe English people are the source of the English language, the parliamentary\nsystem, the common law system and numerous major sports. These and other English\ncultural characteristics have spread worldwide, in part as a result of the\nformer British Empire.\n","linknr":1141,"url":"English_people","recorded":1362480751,"links":125,"instances":["ireland","country_subdivision","musician","writer","historical","population_genetics","checkmark"],"pdf":["http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf","http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/71887/sample/9780521771887ws.pdf","http://www.institute-of-governance.org/forum/Leverhulme/briefing_pdfs/IoG_Briefing_07.pdf","http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/macepdf/Thomas-PRSB-06-Apartheid.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/macepdf/Thomas-PRSB-06-Apartheid.pdf","http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/606961/nat%20british%20social%20attitudes%20survey%20summary%207.pdf","http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/606961/nat%20british%20social%20attitudes%20survey%20summary%207.pdf","http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf","http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf","http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/PDR%202006%20Tables%2019-30.pdf","http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf","http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/ethnicorigin/pdf/97-562-XIE2006001.pdf","http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/SusanCondor20080120T164935.pdf","http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/SusanCondor20080120T164935.pdf"],"categories":["English
