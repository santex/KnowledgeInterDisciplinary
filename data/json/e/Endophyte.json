Many economically important forage and turfgrasses\n(e.g.,Â Festuca spp., Lolium spp.) carry fungal endophytes ([[Neotyphodium]]\nspp.) which may improve the ability of these grasses to tolerate abiotic\nstresses such as drought, as well as improve their resistance to insect and\nmammalian herbivores.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Endophyte","recorded":1362372972,"links":24,"instances":["biology","molecular_biology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbial growth and nutrition","Fungi","Bacteriology","Symbiosis"],"headings":["Transmission","Endophyte-host relationship","Use","Identification","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["amplification","molecular_biology"]],"members":["mutualism","amplification","vector"],"related":["Endosymbiont","Bacterium","Fungus","Plant","Mammal","Herbivore","Asexual_reproduction","Fungus","Hypha","Seed","Mutualism_(biology)","Sexual_reproduction","Spore","Vector_(epidemiology)","Pathogen","Plant_use_of_endophytic_fungi_in_defense","Arbuscular_mycorrhizal_fungi","Gary_Strobel","Himalayan_yew","Taxol","Biofuel","Microbial_inoculant","Sebacinales","Biodiversity","Climate_change","Carbon_dioxide","Amplification_(molecular_biology)","DNA_sequencing","DNA","Hypha","Aniline_Blue_WS","Biofertilizer","List_of_endophytes"]}
