{"cursor":"21181","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nAn 'endosymbiont' is any organism that lives within the body or cells of another\norganism, i.e. forming an 'endosymbiosis' (Greek: á¼Î½Î´Î¿Î½ endon \"within\", ÏÏÎ½ syn\n\"together\" and Î²Î¯ÏÏÎ¹Ï biosis \"living\"). Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria\n(called rhizobia) which live in root nodules on legume roots, single-celled\nalgae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide\nessential nutrients to about 10â15% of insects.\n\nMany instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont\nor the host cannot survive without the other, such as the gutless marine worms\nof the genus [[Riftia]], which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria.\nThe most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are mitochondria and\nchloroplasts. Some human parasites, e.g. : [[Wuchereria bancrofti]] and\n[[Mansonella perstans]] thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an\nobligate endosymbiosis with [[Wolbachia]] spp.. They can both be eliminated from\nsaid hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all\nendosymbioses are obligate. Also, some endosymbioses can be harmful to either of\nthe organisms involved.\n\nIt is generally agreed that certain organelles of the eukaryotic cell,\nespecially mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplasts, originated as\nbacterial endosymbionts. This theory is called the endosymbiotic theory, and was\nfirst articulated by the Russian botanist Konstantin Mereschkowski in\n1905.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Endosymbiont","recorded":1362509214,"links":29,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.somosbacteriasyvirus.com/retrovirus.pdf"],"categories":["Symbiosis","Microbial population biology","Environmental microbiology"],"headings":["Endosymbiosis theory and mitochondria and chloroplasts","Bacterial endosymbionts in marine invertebrates","''Symbiodinium'' dinoflagellate endosymbionts in marine metazoa and protists<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker AC |title=FLEXIBILITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=34 |pages=661–89 |month=November |year=2003 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}</ref>","Endosymbionts in protists","Bacterial endosymbionts in insects","Viral endosymbionts and endogenous retrovirus","See also","Notes","References and external links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Endosymbiosis.PNG/200px-Endosymbiosis.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"]],"members":["egg"],"related":["Organism","Greek_language","Nitrogen-fixing","Bacteria","Rhizobia","Root_nodules","Legume","Algae","Corals","Siboglinidae","Genus","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Symbiosis","Organelle","Eukaryote","Mitochondria","Plastid","Chloroplast","Endosymbiotic_theory","Russia","Botanist","Konstantin_Mereschkowski","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Eukaryote","Cytosis","Aerobic_organism","Bacterium","Cytoplasm","Molecule","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","Chloroplast","Photosynthesis","Cilia","Flagella","Centriole","Microtubule","Spirochaete","DNA","Genome","Phylogenetic","Tree","Alphaproteobacteria","Coral","Clam","Snail","Algae","Biological_inheritance","Evolution","Nucleotide","Adenine","Thymine","Guanine","Cytosine","Gene","Echinodermata","Crinoidea","Ophiuroidea","Echinoidea","Holothuroidea","Phylogenetic","Proteobacteria","Subcuticular_bacteria","Oligochaeta","Olavius","Inanidrillus","Chemoautotroph","Nephridia","Dinoflagellate","Zooxanthella","Corals","Mollusk","Giant_clam","Sea_sponge","Foraminifera","Coral_reefs","Carbonate","Phylogenetic","Coral_bleaching","Ecology","Ciliate","Insect","Hemolymph","Aphid","Tsetse_fly","Protists","Termite","Bacteriocyte","Egg_(biology)","Trophallaxis","Essential_amino_acid","Vitamin","Blood","Predator","Genome_reduction","Phylogeny","African_trypanosomiasis","Genetics","Molecular_biology","Viviparous","Viral_fusion_proteins","Syncytium","Epithelium","HIV","AIDS","Vivipary","Protobiont","Endophyte","Multigenomic_organism","Anagenesis","List_of_symbiotic_organisms","List_of_symbiotic_relationships"]}
