{"cursor":"19688","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn genetics, an 'enhancer' is a short region of DNA that can be bound with\nproteins (namely, the trans-acting factors, much like a set of transcription\nfactors) to enhance transcription levels of genes (hence the name) in a gene\ncluster. While enhancers are usually cis-acting, an enhancer does not need to be\nparticularly close to the genes it acts on, and sometimes need not be located on\nthe same chromosome.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Enhancer_(genetics)","recorded":1362480967,"links":34,"instances":["biology","coactivator","dna","biology","biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.bch.msu.edu/faculty/arnosti/Arnosti&Kulkarni2005JCB.pdf","http://www.bch.msu.edu/faculty/arnosti/Arnosti&Kulkarni2005JCB.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["Enhancer locations","Theories","Examples in the human genome","Enhancers in developmental biology","Enhancers and the evolution of developmental mechanisms","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Gene_enhancer.svg/250px-Gene_enhancer.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["transcription","genetics"],["mediator","coactivator"],["polymorphism","biology"],["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["segmentation","biology"]],"members":["polymorphism","mediator","upstream_and_downstream","promoter","segmentation","translation","transcription"],"related":["Genetics","DNA","Protein","Trans-acting_factor","Transcription_factors","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene","Gene_cluster","Cis-acting","Chromosome","Eukaryotic","Chromatin","Prokaryotic","Promoter_(biology)","General_transcription_factor","RNA_polymerase_II","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Transcription_(genetics)","Base_pairs","Mediator_(coactivator)","Intron","Polymorphism_(biology)","Translation_(biology)","Enhanceosome","Point_mutations","CENTG2","Human_accelerated_regions","Human","Thumb","Ankle","Foot","Walk","Genome","Evolution","Chimpanzee","Gene_expression","Cis-regulatory_element","Transcription_(genetics)","Transcription_factors","Enhancer_trap","P_element","Green_fluorescent_protein","Zebrafish","Segmentation_(biology)","Gap_gene","Pair_rule_genes","Maternal_effect","NODAL","Transforming_growth_factor-beta","Primitive_streak","Primitive_node","Fork_head_domain","Mesoderm","Germ_layers","Gastrulation","Endoderm","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Stickleback","Homeobox","Allele","Chromosomal_fragile_site","DNA_repair","Melanin","Wnt_signaling_pathway","Phenotype"]}
