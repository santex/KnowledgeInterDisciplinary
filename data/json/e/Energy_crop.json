Energy crops are generally categorized as woody or\nherbaceous plants; many of the latter are grasses ([[Graminaceae]]).\n\nCommercial energy crops are typically densely planted, high-yielding crop\nspecies where the energy crops will be burnt to generate power.

However, high energy yield can be realized with existing cultivars. __TOC__\n","linknr":325,"url":"Energy_crop","recorded":1362500124,"links":35,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.birdlife.org/eu/pdfs/RenewableSummaryreportfinal.pdf"],"categories":["Anaerobic digestion","Energy crops","Biomass","Biofuels"],"headings":["Types of energy crops","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Today%27s_Article_For_Improvement_star.svg/48px-Today%27s_Article_For_Improvement_star.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/DEFRA_Energy_Crops_scheme_plantation_-_geograph.org.uk_-_848101.jpg/200px-DEFRA_Energy_Crops_scheme_plantation_-_geograph.org.uk_-_848101.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Public_Footpath_Through_Elephant_Grass_-_geograph.org.uk_-_291522.jpg/220px-Public_Footpath_Through_Elephant_Grass_-_geograph.org.uk_-_291522.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Kerala_coconut.jpg/220px-Kerala_coconut.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Bequer-B100-SOJA-SOYBEAM.jpg/170px-Bequer-B100-SOJA-SOYBEAM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/32px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sugarcane_field.jpg/120px-Sugarcane_field.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Crop","Fossil_fuel","Carbon_dioxide","Plant","Harvest","Biofuel","Bioethanol","Crop","Herbaceous","Salix","Populus","Biogas","Maize","Sudan_grass","Millet","Melilotus_albus","Genetic_modification","Biotechnology","Combined_heat_and_power","Anaerobic_digesters","Silage","Renewable_energy","Kerala","Coconut","Coconut_oil","Fodder","Biodiesel","Rapeseed","Crop_rotation","Clubroot","Copra","Castor_oil_plant","Sesame","Peanut","Jatropha","Rapeseed","Arecaceae","Mustard_seed","Sunflower","Arecaceae","Soybean","Cotton","Biobutanol","Grasses","Cellulosic_ethanol","Switchgrass","Giant_miscanthus","Bioethanol","Food","Giant_miscanthus","Switchgrass","Jatropha","Fungi","Algae","Sustainability","Byproduct","Green_waste","Agricultural_byproduct","Algal_fuel","Anaerobic_digestion","Biogas","Biotech_crop","Cellulosic_ethanol","Non-food_crop","Short_rotation_coppice","Short_rotation_forestry","Table_of_biofuel_crop_yields","Vegoil"]}
