{"cursor":"51490","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Self-esteem' is a term used in psychology to reflect a person's overall\nemotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is a judgement of oneself as\nwell as an attitude toward the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs (for\nexample, \"I am competent\", \"I am worthy\") and emotions such as triumph, despair,\npride and shame. Smith and Mackie define it by saying \"The self-\nconcept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or\nnegative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it.\" E. R.\nSmith/D. M. Mackie, Social Psychology (2007)p. 107 Self-esteem is also\nknown as the evaluative dimension of the self that includes feelings of\nworthiness, prides and discouragement.

One's self-esteem is also closely associated with self-\nconsciousness. Schacter, Daniel.

Social Psychology Alive(1st ed.) Canada:Nelson. In the mid-\n1960s, Morris Rosenberg and social-learning theorists defined self-esteem as a\npersonal worth or worthiness. Baumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996\nNathaniel Branden in 1969 defined self-esteem as \"the experience of being\ncompetent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of\nhappiness.\" According to Branden, self-esteem is the sum of self-confidence (a\nfeeling of personal capacity) and self-respect (a feeling of personal worth).\nIt exists as a consequence of the implicit judgement that every person has of\ntheir ability to face life's challenges, to understand and solve problems, and\ntheir right to achieve happiness, and be given respect.

In addition, self-esteem has also been treated as an important\noutcome due to its close relation with psychological well-being (Marsh 1989).\nSelf-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension (for example, \"I\nbelieve I am a good writer and I feel happy about that\") or a global extent (for\nexample, \"I believe I am a bad person, and feel bad about myself in general\").\nPsychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality\ncharacteristic (\"trait\" self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations\n(\"state\" self-esteem) also exist.
