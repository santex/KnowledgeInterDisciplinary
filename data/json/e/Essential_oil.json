Essential oils are also known as 'volatile oils',\n'ethereal oils' or 'aetherolea', or simply as the \"oil of\" the plant from which\nthey were extracted, such as oil of clove. An oil is \"essential\" in the sense\nthat it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant. Essential oils\ndo not form a distinctive category for any medical, pharmacological, or\nculinary purpose.\n\nEssential oils are generally extracted by distillation. Steam distillation is\noften used. Other processes include expression or solvent extraction. They are\nused in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps and other products, for flavoring food and\ndrink, and for adding scents to incense and household cleaning products.\n\nEssential oils have been used medicinally in history. Medical applications\nproposed by those who sell medicinal oils range from skin treatments to remedies\nfor cancer and often are based solely on historical accounts of use of essential\noils for these purposes. Claims for the efficacy of medical treatments, and\ntreatment of cancers in particular, are now subject to regulation in most\ncountries.\n\nAs the use of essential oils has declined in evidence-based medicine, one\nmust consult older textbooks for much information on their use. Sapeika, Norman. Actions and uses of Drugs, Pub: A.A. Balkema,\n1963 Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry, vol.\n8, 4th ed. Pub: Longmans Green. 1947 Modern works are less inclined\nto generalize; rather than refer to \"essential oils\" as a class at all,\nthey prefer to discuss specific compounds, such as methyl salicylate,\nrather than \"oil of wintergreen\".\n\nInterest in essential oils has revived in recent decades with the popularity of\naromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine that claims that essential oils\nand other aromatic compounds have curative effects. Oils are volatilized or\ndiluted in a carrier oil and used in massage, diffused in the air by a\nnebulizer, heated over a candle flame, or burned as incense.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of the techniques and methods used to produce\nessential oils is believed to be that of Ibn al-Baitar (1188â1248), an\nAndalusian physician, pharmacist and chemist.
