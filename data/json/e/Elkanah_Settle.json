{"cursor":"5675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Elkanah Settle' (1 February 1648 â 12 February 1724) was an English poet and\nplaywright.\n\nHe was born at Dunstable, and entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1666, but left\nwithout taking a degree. His first tragedy, Cambyses, King of Persia, was\nproduced at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1667. The success of this play led the earl\nof Rochester to encourage the new writer as a rival to John Dryden. Through his\ninfluence, Settle's Empress of Morocco (1673) was twice performed at Whitehall,\nand proved a great success. It is said by John Dennis to have been \"the first\nplay that was ever sold in England for two shillings, and the first play that\nwas ever printed with cuts.\" These illustrations represent scenes in the\ntheatre, and make the book very valuable.\n\nThe play was printed with a preface to the Earl of Norwich, in which Settle\ndescribed with scorn the effusive dedications of other dramatic poets. Dryden\nwas obviously aimed at, and he co-operated with John Crowne and Thomas Shadwell\nin an abusive pamphlet entitled \"Notes and Observations on the Empress of\nMorocco\" (1674), to which Settle replied in \"Some Notes and Observations on the\nEmpress of Morocco revised\" (1674). In the second part of Absalom and\nAchitophel, in a passage certainly by Dryden's hand, he figures as \"Doeg.\"\n\nNeglected by the court party he took an active share in the anti-popish\nagitation. When this subsided he helped expose Titus Oates, and with the\nRevolution of 1688, he veered towards the Whig party. Having lost the confidence\nof both sides, \"recanting Settle\" abandoned politics for the appointment (1691)\nof city poet.\n\nFrom 1700 he initiated what has been called a \"successful racket\" where he would\nwrite occasional poems, typically eulogistic or nuptial verse, have them bound\nup in notably ostentatious armorial bindings, which he would send to the wealthy\nperson whose arms he used. The economics of the practice are unclear; he may\nhave had them commissioned, or been offering them for sale, or (a subtle\ndistinction) have offered to present them in return for literary patronage in\ncash or some other form. If the book was returned he would try another patron\nwith a new set of arms, altering personal references as required; where the\nsubject matter was shared (as in a wedding) much of the verse could be recycled\nfrom one poem to another, and the scholar F. C. Brown has noticed that as many\nas two-thirds of the lines in Settle's wedding poems are \"common to all.\" The\nbooks were bound for Settle by an unknown binder, whose work is remarkable for\nbeing \"the only instance in which a particular binder has consistently\nornamented a large series of bindings with heraldic designs\" outside of Royal\nbinders. F. C. Brown, Elkanah Settle: His Life and Works, University of\nChicago Press (1910). p. 109. The bindings are sufficiently distinctive to\nbe known as Settle bindings. More than 100 examples survive, from between 1700\nand 1723. [http://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2011/08/settle_bindings_rec-\nonsidered.html Princeton rare books blog] In his old age he kept a booth\nat Bartholomew Fair, where he is said to have played the part of the dragon in a\ngreen leather suit devised by himself. He became a poor brother of the\nCharterhouse, where he died.\n\nSettle is one of the dunces in Alexander Pope's [[The Dunciad]], handing over\nhis authority to Lewis Theobald and in the 1742 edition Colley Cibber.\n\nSettle's numerous works include, beside numerous political pamphlets and\noccasional poems: *Ibrahim, the Illustrious Bassa (1676), a tragedy taken from\nMadeleine de ScudÃ©ry's romance *The Female Prelate: being the History of the\nLife and Death of [[Pope Joan]] (1680), a tragedy *The Ambitious Slave: or A\nGenerous Revenge (1694) *The World in the Moon (1697), an opera inspired by\nFrancis Godwin's [[The Man in the Moone]], of which the first scene\nwas formed by a moon fourteen feet across *The Virgin Prophetess, or The Fate of\nTroy (1701), an opera\n","linknr":134,"url":"Elkanah_Settle","recorded":1375080806,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/England","/wiki/Poet","/wiki/Playwright","/wiki/Dunstable","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Lincoln%27s_Inn_Fields","/wiki/John_Dryden","/wiki/Whitehall","/wiki/John_Dennis_(dramatist)","/wiki/John_Crowne","/wiki/Thomas_Shadwell","/wiki/Pamphlet","/wiki/Doeg_the_Edomite","/wiki/Titus_Oates","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Occasional_poetry","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Bartholomew_Fair","/wiki/London_Charterhouse","/wiki/Alexander_Pope","/wiki/The_Dunciad","/wiki/Lewis_Theobald","/wiki/Colley_Cibber","/wiki/Occasional_poems","/wiki/Madeleine_de_Scud%C3%A9ry","/wiki/Pope_Joan","/wiki/Opera","/wiki/Francis_Godwin","/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Moone","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2011/08/settle_bindings_reconsidered.html","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-55111-896-3","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=edit&section=2","http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/bookbindings/","http://www.gutenberg.org/author/Elkanah_Settle","/wiki/Project_Gutenberg","http://www.letrs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/eprosed/eprosed-idx?type=boolean;layer=2;rgn1=period;q1=Res&size=100&slice=2","/w/index.php?title=Matthew_Taubman&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Corporation_of_London","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/2480468","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&oldid=556777929","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1648_births","/wiki/Category:1724_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_poets","/wiki/Category:English_librettists","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dunstable","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Popish_Plot","/wiki/Category:Bookbinders","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elkanah+Settle&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elkanah+Settle","/wiki/Elkanah_Settle","/wiki/Talk:Elkanah_Settle","#","/wiki/Elkanah_Settle","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Elkanah_Settle","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Elkanah_Settle","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&oldid=556777929","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5364188","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Elkanah_Settle&id=556777929","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Elkanah+Settle","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Elkanah+Settle&oldid=556777929&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Elkanah_Settle&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkanah_Settle","//simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkanah_Settle","#","//www.wikidata.
