{"cursor":"21993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Enhanced Oil Recovery' (abbreviated EOR) is a generic term for techniques for\nincreasing the amount of crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field.\nEnhanced oil recovery is also called 'improved oil recovery' or 'tertiary\nrecovery' (as opposed to primary and secondary recovery). Sometimes the term\n'quaternary recovery' is used to refer to more advanced, speculative, EOR\ntechniques.
