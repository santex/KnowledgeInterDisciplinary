{"cursor":"14773","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nAn 'erection', or 'penile erection', is a physiological phenomenon where the\npenis becomes firmer, engorged and enlarged. Penile erection is the result of a\ncomplex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular and endocrine factors,\nand is usually, though not exclusively, associated with sexual arousal or sexual\nattraction. The angle of an erect penis varies from pointing downwards, upwards\nor sideways, and the penis may also bend.\n\nErections during sleep or when waking up are known as nocturnal penile\ntumescence (NPT). A penis which is partly, but not fully, erect is sometimes\nknown as a semi-erection; a penis which is not erect is typically referred to as\nbeing flaccid, or soft.\n","linknr":583,"url":"Erection","recorded":1362373521,"links":73,"instances":["expression","medication"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Penis","Sexual arousal","Andrology"],"headings":["Terminology","Physiology","Shape and size","Spontaneous or random erections","Medical conditions","In non-human animals","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Erection_Development_V2.jpg/300px-Erection_Development_V2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Erect_penis_shaved.JPG/220px-Erect_penis_shaved.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg/32px-Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lithium","medication"],["conspiracy_of_silence","expression"]],"members":["conspiracy_of_silence","lithium"],"related":["Penis","Sexual_arousal","Sexual_attraction","Nocturnal_penile_tumescence","Corpus_cavernosum_penis","Venous_blood","Physiology","Sexual_arousal","Corpus_spongiosum","Urethra","Urine","Semen","Urination","Ejaculation","Engorged","Sexual_arousal","Sexual_intercourse","Scrotum","Foreskin","Glans_penis","Masturbation","Parasympathetic","Autonomic_nervous_system","Central_nervous_system","Sacral_plexus","Arteries","Nitric_oxide","Endothelial_cell","Trabeculae_of_corpora_cavernosa_of_penis","Smooth_muscle","Vasodilation","Ischiocavernosus_muscle","Bulbospongiosus_muscle","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Cerebral_cortex","Spinal_cord","Puberty","Penis_enlargement","Peyronie's_disease","Erectile_dysfunction","Colchicine","Embarrassment","Classroom","Living_room","Nocturnal_penile_tumescence","Puberty","Sexual_dysfunction","Andrology","Urology","Physiological","Psychological","Lithium_(medication)","Paroxetine","Virility","Social_status","Masculinity","Shame","Grief","Conspiracy_of_silence_(expression)","Priapism","Baculum","Placental_mammals","Clitoral_erection","Death_erection","Erectores_pilorum","Issues_in_social_nudity","Nipple_erection","Nocturnal_penile_tumescence","Priapism","Sexual_function"]}
