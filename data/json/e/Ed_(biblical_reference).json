{"cursor":"2923","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Witness' is the name of an altar in . The name appears in this form in the New\nKing James Version, the English Standard Version and the New Living Translation.\nThe King James Version merely transliterates the original Hebrew word 'Ed',\nwhile the New International Version regards the all of the following words as\nthe name of the altar: \"A Witness Between Us that the LORD is God.\"\n\nIn Joshua 22, the Transjordanian tribes cross over the Jordan River after having\nassisted in the conquest of the land. They then build a massive altar by the\nJordan. This causes the \"whole congregation of the Israelites\" to prepare for\nwar, but they first send to the Transjordanian tribes a delegation led by\nPhinehas. They accuse them of making God angry and suggesting that their land\nmay be unclean. In response to this, the Transjordanian tribes say that the\naltar is not for offerings, but is only a \"witness\". The western tribes are\nsatisfied, and return home.\n\nThe altar's construction concerned the other tribes who felt that there should\nonly be one altar, but the eastern tribes built it only as a testimony to their\nfaith, and not as a working altar. The eastern tribes named the altar \"Witness\"\nto fit this.\n\nAssis argues that the unusual dimensions of the altar suggest that it \"was not\nmeant for sacrificial use,\" but was, in fact, \"meant to attract the attention of\nthe other tribes\" and provoke a reaction. Elie Assis, \"For it\nshall be a witness between us: a literary reading of Josh 22,\" [[Scandinavian\nJournal of the Old Testament]] 18 (2004), 216-217. Davis regards the\nTransjordanians' action as \"the first in a series of independent acts on the\npart of the various tribes which would lead to a later fragmentation of the\ntribes of Israel,\" and the construction of the altar as a \"departure of God's\nplan for centralized worship.\" John J. Davis, Conquest and Crisis: Studies\nin Joshua, Judges and Ruth (Grand Rapids, Baker, 1977), 86â87.\n\nThe location of the altar has also been disputed. Snaith asserts that it was \"at\nGilgal, on the west bank of the Jordan,\" N. H. Snaith, \"The Altar at Gilgal:\nJoshua 22:23-29,\" [[Vetus Testamentum]] 28 (1978) 335. while Assis argues\nthat it was built east of the Jordan.\n\nThe name of the altar is not clear in the Masoretic Text, and the text could be\ncorrupted at this point. It reads \"The Reubenites and the Gadites named the\naltar because it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.\" Some textual\nscholars suspect that the name of the altar must have been dropped by a copyist,\neither deliberately or unintentionally.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Ed_(biblical_reference)","recorded":1374547212,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Witness_(altar)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Ed_(biblical_reference)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Altar","http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Joshua&verse=22:34&src=!","/wiki/New_King_James_Version","/wiki/English_Standard_Version","/wiki/New_Living_Translation","/wiki/King_James_Version","/wiki/Hebrew_language","/wiki/New_International_Version","/wiki/Yahweh","/wiki/Book_of_Joshua","/wiki/Transjordan_(Bible)","/wiki/Jordan_River","/wiki/Phinehas","#cite_note-Assis-1","/wiki/Re%27eh#Centralized_worship","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Gilgal","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-Assis-1","/wiki/Masoretic_Text","/wiki/Yahweh","/wiki/Textual_criticism","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Assis_1-0","#cite_ref-Assis_1-1","/wiki/Scandinavian_Journal_of_the_Old_Testament","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Vetus_Testamentum","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&oldid=546366952","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Altars","/wiki/Category:Book_of_Joshua","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Witness+%28altar%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Witness+%28altar%29","/wiki/Witness_(altar)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Witness_(altar)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Witness_(altar)","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Witness_(altar)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Witness_(altar)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&oldid=546366952","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8028381","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Witness_%28altar%29&id=546366952","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Witness+%28altar%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Witness+%28altar%29&oldid=546366952&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Witness_(altar)&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(Biblia)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8028381#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_(altar)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["bible"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Altars","Book
