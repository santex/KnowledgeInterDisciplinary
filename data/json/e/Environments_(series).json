{"cursor":"10014","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Environments' is a series of LPs, cassettes, 8-Track cartridges and CDs created\nby producer and sound recordist Irving Solomon Teibel (1938-2010 ) for\nSyntonic Research Inc. between 1970 and 1979. The series consists of recordings\nof natural sounds such as a seashore with crashing waves or a thunderstorm with\nfalling rain, without musical accompaniment. The series ignited a worldwide\ninterest in field recordings which resulted in literally thousands of imitations\nbeing released throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s both with, and\nwithout, music (i.e.: Moods, Solitudes, Echoes of Nature, Nature Recordings,\nMagic Moods, etc.).\n\nThe Environments albums were considered definitive enough to have excerpts\nincluded on the Voyager Gold Record. The Environments series also\npresented some of the longest album-sides ever released.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Environments_(series)","recorded":1362669144,"links":10,"instances":["brand"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Album series"],"headings":["Environments LPs","Environments cassettes","Environments CDs","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["uher","brand"]],"members":["uher"],"related":["LP_album","Compact_Cassette","Stereo_8","Compact_Disc","Natural_sounds","Field_recordings","Solitudes","Voyager_Gold_Record","Atlantic_Records","Tony_Conrad","Walter_De_Maria","Uher_(brand)","IBM_360","Bronx_Zoo","Aviary","Central_Park","Aum","Electronic_Music_Laboratories","Stockbridge,_Massachusetts","Sussex","Long_Man_of_Wilmington","Cicada"]}
