It concerned âtransnational co-operation to promote new means of\ncombating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the\nlabour marketâ. It ran from 2001 till 2007 with a budget of some â¬3 billion of\nEU resources, matched by a similar sum from national resources.\n\nEQUAL was part of the European Union's strategy for \"more and better jobs\" and\nfor ensuring that no-one is denied access to them. It tested new ways of\ntackling discrimination and inequality experienced by those in work and those\nlooking for a job. From 2008 it has been discontinued as such, but its\nprinciples have been incorporated, at least in theory, into the mainstream\nStructural Funds. In practice, transnational work in the ESF is virtually\nlimited to the Learning Networks or Communities of practice that are being\nestablished under the Learning for Change programme. These involve the 117 ESF\nManaging Authorities (mostly national ministries and regions) and their key\nexternal patners, but have a much more limited budget and reach than EQUAL did.\n\nEQUAL co-financed activities in all 27 EU Member States - the 12 new countries\nactually joined in January 2004, 4 months before their official accession. The\nEU contribution to EQUAL of â¬3.274 billion was matched by national funding.\nEQUAL differed from the European Social Fund mainstream programmes in its\nfunction as a laboratory (principle of innovation) and in its emphasis on active\nco-operation between Member States. Two calls for proposals for EQUAL projects\nin the Member States took place, the first in 2001 and the second in 2004.\nResponsibility for the implementation of the Community Initiative programmes in\nthe Member States lies with the national authorities.\n","linknr":115,"url":"EQUAL_Community_Initiative","recorded":1362570526,"links":13,"instances":["value_and_practice"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Economy of the European Union","Employment","Social inclusion"],"headings":["Themes","The building blocks of EQUAL","Links to development partnerships","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["inclusion","value_and_practice"]],"members":["inclusion"],"related":["European_Social_Fund","European_Union","Structural_Funds","Communities_of_practice","European_Employment_Strategy","Employability","Racism","Xenophobia","Entrepreneurship","Social_economy","Adaptability","Lifelong_learning","Inclusion_(value_and_practice)","Recruitment","Information_technology","Equal_opportunity","Asylum_seeker","Project","Development_partnership","Partnership","Innovation","Empowerment","Transnationality","Mainstreaming","CAP_Markets","INSPIRE_project","RepaNet","Valnalón"]}
