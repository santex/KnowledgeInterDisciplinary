This mechanism is important in medicine as it can\ncontribute to bacterial antibiotic resistance.\n\nEfflux systems function via an energy-dependent mechanism (Active transport) to\npump out unwanted toxic substances through specific efflux pumps. Some efflux\nsystems are drug-specific, whereas others may accommodate multiple drugs, and\nthus contribute to bacterial multidrug resistance (MDR).\n","linknr":159,"url":"Efflux_(microbiology)","recorded":1362504869,"links":15,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Membrane biology","Antibiotics"],"headings":["Bacteria","Eukaryotes","Efflux inhibitors","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","substrate","ligand"],"related":["Antibiotic","Xenobiotic_metabolism","Antibiotic_resistance","Active_transport","Protein","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Active_transport","Adenosine_triphosphate","Uniporter","Symporter","Antiporter","Electrochemical_potential","Hydrogen","Sodium","Ions","Amino_acid","Peptide_sequence","Major_facilitator_superfamily","Adenosine_triphosphate","Multi_antimicrobial_extrusion_protein","Secondary_transporters","Proton","Ion_gradient","Gram_positive_bacteria","Gram-negative","Escherichia_coli","Streptomyces_pristinaespiralis","Autoimmunity","Neisseria_gonorrhoeae","Virulence","Physicochemical","Hydrophobicity","Aromaticity","Ionization","Enzyme","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Amphiphilic","Gene","Chromosome","Plasmids","Mutant","Gene_expression","Plasmids","Transposon","Gene_expression","Verapamil","Carotenoid","Paprika","Rotenone","Chrysin","Phloretin","Sakuranetin","Antibiotic_resistance"]}
