The point estimators yield single-\nvalued results, although this includes the possibility of single vector-valued\nresults and results that can be expressed as a single function. This is in\ncontrast to an interval estimator, where the result would be a range of\nplausible values (or vectors or functions).\n\nStatistical theory is concerned with the properties of estimators; that is, with\ndefining properties that can be used to compare different estimators (different\nrules for creating estimates) for the same quantity, based on the same data.\nSuch properties can be used to determine the best rules to use under given\ncircumstances. However, in robust statistics, statistical theory goes on to\nconsider the balance between having good properties, if tightly defined\nassumptions hold, and having less good properties that hold under wider\nconditions.\n","title":"estimator","headings":["Background","Definition","Quantified properties","Behavioural properties","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Interval_estimator","2: Point_estimator","2: Robust_statistics","2: Parameter","2: Mean_squared_error","2: CramÃ©râ€“Rao_bound","1: Statistics","1: Statistical_theory","1: Point_estimate","1: Statistic","1: Statistical_model","1: Parametric_model","1: Semi-parametric_model","1: Semi-nonparametric_model","1: Non-parametric_model","1: Circumflex","1: Unbiasedness","1: Mean_square_error","1: Consistent_estimator","1: Asymptotic_distribution","1: Estimation_theory","1: Decision_theory","1: Decision_rule","1: Loss_function","1: Density_estimation","1: Probability_density_function","1: Spectral_density","1: Time_series","1: Sample_space","1: Algebra_of_random_variables","1: Random_variable","1: Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics","1: Expected_value","1: Accuracy_and_precision","1: If_and_only_if","1: Median","1: Central_tendency","1: Bias_of_an_estimator#Median-unbiased_estimators,_and_bias_with_respect_to_other_loss_functions","1: Standard_deviation","1: Square_root","1: Convergence_in_probability","1: Sample_size","1: Almost_sure_convergence","1: Scale_factor","1: Scale_parameter#Estimation","1: Statistical_dispersion#Measures_of_statistical_dispersion","1: Asymptotic_distribution#Asymptotic_normality","1: Normal_distribution","1: Convergence_of_random_variables#Convergence_in_distribution","1: Asymptotic_normality","1: Central_limit_theorem","1: Sample_mean","1: Maximum_likelihood","1: Maximum_likelihood#Asymptotics","1: Estimator_bias","1: MVUE","1: Gaussâ€“Markov_theorem","1: Lehmannâ€“ScheffÃ©_theorem","1: Raoâ€“Blackwell_theorem","1: Robust_estimator","1: Best_linear_unbiased_estimator","1: Invariant_estimator","1: Kalman_filter","1: Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo","1: Maximum_a_posteriori","1: Generalized_method_of_moments","1: Minimum_mean_squared_error","1: Particle_filter","1: Pitman_closeness_criterion","1: Shrinkage_estimator","1: Signal_Processing","1: Testimator","1: Wiener_filter","1: Well-behaved_statistic","1: Sensitivity_and_specificity"]}
