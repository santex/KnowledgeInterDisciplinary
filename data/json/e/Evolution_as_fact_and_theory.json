{"cursor":"34119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nMany scientists and philosophers of science have described 'evolution as fact\nand theory', a phrase which was used as the title of an article by Stephen Jay\nGould in 1981. He describes fact in science as meaning data, not absolute\ncertainty but \"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold\nprovisional assent.\" A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of\nsuch facts. The facts of evolution come from observational evidence of current\nprocesses, from imperfections in organisms recording historical common descent,\nand from transitions in the fossil record. Theories of evolution provide a\nprovisional explanation for these facts.\n\n\n\nEach of the words evolution, fact and theory has several meanings in different\ncontexts. Evolution means change over time, as in stellar evolution. In biology\nit refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common\nancestor, and at a technical level to a change in gene frequency over time; it\ncan also refer to explanatory theories such as Darwin's theory of natural\nselection which explain the mechanisms of evolution. Fact can mean to a\nscientist a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can mean something\nthat is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; it can\nalso refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public theory can\nmean an opinion or conjecture (\"it's only a theory\"), but in the scientific\nworld it has a much stronger connotation of \"well-substantiated explanation\".\nWith this number of choices, people often end up talking past each other, and\nmeanings become the subject of linguistic analysis.\n\nEvidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific\nliterature includes statements by evolutionary biologists and philosophers of\nscience demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact\nand theory.\n","linknr":528,"url":"Evolution_as_fact_and_theory","recorded":1362483074,"links":46,"instances":["scientist","science"],"pdf":["http://www.aseanbiodiversity.info/Abstract/51012382.pdf","http://www.aseanbiodiversity.info/Abstract/51012382.pdf","http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/evolucionmolecular/images/file/ClaseEvolucion1/Ricardo/Gregory_2008.pdf","http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/evolucionmolecular/images/file/ClaseEvolucion1/Ricardo/Gregory_2008.pdf","http://www.rsscse-edu.org.uk/tsj/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bissell1.pdf","http://www.rsscse-edu.org.uk/tsj/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bissell1.pdf","http://www.cdl.cbcb.umd.edu/files/PDF/strong-infrerence.pdf","http://www.cdl.cbcb.umd.edu/files/PDF/strong-infrerence.pdf","http://http-server.carleton.ca/~rgorelic/Publications/Gorelick%20%282011%29%20Ideas%20Ecol%20Evol%204;%201-10.pdf","http://http-server.carleton.ca/~rgorelic/Publications/Gorelick%20%282011%29%20Ideas%20Ecol%20Evol%204;%201-10.pdf","http://www.petergodfreysmith.com/PGS-StrategyMBS-06.pdf","http://www.petergodfreysmith.com/PGS-StrategyMBS-06.pdf","http://img.signaly.cz/upload/1/0/9a462eb6be1ed7828f57a184cde3c0/Dobzhansky.pdf","http://img.signaly.cz/upload/1/0/9a462eb6be1ed7828f57a184cde3c0/Dobzhansky.pdf","http://www.mobot.org/plantscience/ResBot/EvSy/PDF/Fitzhugh%202007%20-%20Zoologica%20Scripta.pdf","http://www.mobot.org/plantscience/ResBot/EvSy/PDF/Fitzhugh%202007%20-%20Zoologica%20Scripta.pdf","http://post.queensu.ca/~biol440/KlugeCladistics1999.pdf","http://post.queensu.ca/~biol440/KlugeCladistics1999.pdf","http://max2.ese.u-psud.fr/epc/conservation/Publi/abstracta/AE_TREE2000.pdf","http://max2.ese.u-psud.fr/epc/conservation/Publi/abstracta/AE_TREE2000.pdf","http://cognition.berkeley.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LombrozoThanukosWeisberg-EEO-2008.pdf","http://cognition.berkeley.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LombrozoThanukosWeisberg-EEO-2008.pdf"],"categories":["Creationist objections to evolution","Biology theories","Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Evolution, fact and theory","Evolution as theory and fact in the literature","Related concepts and terminology","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["objectivity","science"],["neil_campbell","scientist"]],"members":["neil_campbell","objectivity"],"related":["Stephen_Jay_Gould","Data","Scientific_theory","Evolution","Common_descent","Fossil","Stellar_evolution","Gene_frequency","Charles_Darwin","Natural_selection","Ordinary_language_philosophy","Zoology","Botany","Genetics","Geology","Paleontology","Gene_frequency","Gregor_Mendel","Genetics","Mutation","Paleontology","Developmental_biology","Douglas_Futuyma","Allele","Blood_types","Obcell","Common_descent","Solar_System","Objectivity_(science)","Charles_Darwin","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Biogeography","Amazon_River","Malay_Archipelago","Population_genetics","DNA","Conjecture","Opinion","Speculation","Scientific_theory","Reproducibility","Observation","Experiment","Hypothesis","Falsifiability","Natural_selection","Research_program","Anagenesis","Speciation","Natural_selection","Common_descent","Phylogenetic","Phylogenetic_tree","Monophyly","Systematics","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","George_Gaylord_Simpson","H._J._Muller","Kenneth_R._Miller","Ernst_Mayr","Paleontology","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Richard_Lenski","T._Ryan_Gregory","R._C._Lewontin","Douglas_Futuyma","Richard_Dawkins","Neil_Campbell_(scientist)","Kirk_J._Fitzhugh","Science","Formal_sciences","Mathematical_proof","Infinite_sets","Scientific_laws","Price_equation","Epistemology","Evidence_of_common_descent","Objections_to_evolution","List_of_misconceptions","Creation-evolution_controversy"]}
