It is secreted from\nintestinal glands (the crypts of LieberkÃ¼hn) following the entry of ingested\nfood passing from the stomach. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen (a\nzymogen) into its active form trypsin, resulting in the subsequent\nactivation of pancreatic digestive enzymes.\n\nEnteropeptidase is a serine protease () consisting of a disulfide-linked 82â140\nkDa heavy chain which anchors enterokinase in the intestinal brush border\nmembrane and a 35â62 kDa light chain which contains the catalytic subunit. Enteropeptidase is a part of the chymotrypsin-clan of\nserine proteases, and is structurally similar to these proteins.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Enterokinase","recorded":1362484501,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://wolfson.huji.ac.il/expression/local/tag-protein-fusions.pdf","http://wolfson.huji.ac.il/expression/local/tag-protein-fusions.pdf"],"categories":["EC 3.4.21"],"headings":["Activity","Genetics","Applications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/1EKB.png/220px-1EKB.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png/40px-Acethylcholinesterase_TC_1EA5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["X-ray_crystallography","Enzyme_inhibitor","Enzyme","Duodenum","Digestion","Crypts_of_Lieberkühn","Trypsinogen","Zymogen","Trypsin","Pancreas","Serine_protease","Chymotrypsin","Aspartate","Lysine","Catalysis","Val","Gene","Chromosome_21","Nonsense_mutation","Frameshift_mutation","Recessive","Histidine","Protein_purification"]}
