More precisely, there is\nagreement that ecology emerged as a distinct discipline at the turn of the 20th\ncentury, and that it gained public prominence in the 1960s, due to widespread\nconcern for the state of the environment. {{cite book\n|last1=McIntosh |first1=R. P. |year=1985 |title=The Background of Ecology:\nConcept and Theory |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn= }} Nonetheless, ecological thinking at some level has been around\nfor a long time, and the principles of ecology have developed gradually, closely\nintertwined with the development of other biological disciplines. It is likely\nthat early humans had an ecological understanding of at least those aspects of\ntheir environment that enhanced their survival. One of the first ecologists\nwhose writings survive may have been Aristotle or perhaps his student,\nTheophrastus, both of whom had interest in many species of animals. Theophrastus\ndescribed interrelationships between animals and their environment as early as\nthe 4th century BC.\n\nThe history of ecology is intertwined with the history of conservation efforts,\nin particular the founding of the Nature Conservancy. {{cite journal\n|last1=Smith |first1=S. |last2=Mark |first2=S. |year=2009 |title=The Historical\nRoots of the Nature Conservancy in the Northwest
