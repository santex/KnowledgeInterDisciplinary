A building as a shelter represents a physical\ndivision of the (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at\ntimes may be harsh and harmful).\n\nEver since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or\ncanvasess of artistic expression. In recent years, interest in sustainable\nplanning and building practices has also become part of the design process of\nmany new buildings.\n",
