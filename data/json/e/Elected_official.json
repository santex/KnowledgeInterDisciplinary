{"cursor":"6964","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'official' is someone who holds an office (function or mandate, regardless\nwhether it carries an actual working space with it) in an organization or\ngovernment and participates in the exercise of authority (either his own or that\nof his superior and/or employer, public or legally private).\n\nA 'government official' or 'functionary' is an official who is involved in\npublic administration or government, through either election, appointment,\nselection, or employment. A bureaucrat is a member of the bureaucracy. An\n'elected official' is a person who is an official by virtue of an election.\nOfficials may also be appointed [[ex officio]] (by virtue of another office,\noften in a specified capacity, such as presiding, advisory, secretary). Some\nofficial positions may be inherited.\n\nA person who currently holds an office is referred to as an '[[incumbent]]'.\n\nThe word official as a noun has been recorded since the Middle English period,\nfirst seen in 1314. It comes from the Old French official (12th century), from\nthe Latin officialis (\"attendant to a magistrate, public official\"), the noun\nuse of the original adjective officialis (\"of or belonging to duty, service, or\noffice\") from officium (\"office\"). The meaning \"person in charge of some public\nwork or duty\" was first recorded in 1555. The adjective is first attested in\nEnglish in 1533, via the Old French {{lang|fr|oficial}}.\n\nThe informal term officialese, the jargon of \"officialdom\", was first\nrecorded in 1884.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Elected_official","recorded":1362667532,"links":28,"instances":["government_department","officer","catholic_church","politics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecclesiastical titles","Positions of authority","Government occupations|"],"headings":["Roman Antiquity","Ecclesiastical judiciary","Other","Max Weber on bureaucratic officials","Adjective","See also","Sources and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Justice_and_law.svg/100px-Justice_and_law.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mandate","politics"],["canon_law","catholic_church"],["ordinary","officer"],["ministry","government_department"]],"members":["ministry","ordinary","canon_law","mandate"],"related":["Mandate_(politics)","Office","Organization","Government","Authority","Public_administration","Election","Employment","Bureaucrat","Bureaucracy","Inheritance","Noun","Middle_English","Old_French","Latin","Adjective","Jargon","Officium","Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)","Judicial_vicar","Ordinary_(officer)","Ecclesiastical_court","Judicial_Vicar","Vicar_general","Vicar-general","Diocesan_chancellor","Sports","Linesman","Referee","Umpire","American_football_official","Ice_hockey_official","Connotation","Noun","Bureaucrat","Ceremony","Government","Max_Weber","Adjective","Public_holiday","Official_language","Signpost","Ministry_(government_department)","Mass_media","Strike_action","Labour_union","School","Private_school","Religious_school","War","Military_unit","Editorial_independence","Bureaucrat","Pauly-Wissowa"]}
