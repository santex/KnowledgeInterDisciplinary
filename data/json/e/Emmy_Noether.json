In physics, Noether's theorem explains the fundamental\nconnection between symmetry and conservation laws.\n\nShe was born to a Jewish family in the Bavarian town of Erlangen; her father was\nmathematician Max Noether. Emmy originally planned to teach French and English\nafter passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the\nUniversity of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her\ndissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the\nMathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years (at the time\nwomen were largely excluded from academic positions). In 1915, she was invited\nby David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the\nUniversity of GÃ¶ttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The\nphilosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing\nunder Hilbert's name. Her [[habilitation]] was approved in 1919, allowing her to\nobtain the rank of [[Privatdozent]].\n\nNoether remained a leading member of the GÃ¶ttingen mathematics department until\n1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch\nmathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the\nleading expositor of Noether's ideas: her work was the foundation for the second\nvolume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her\nplenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in ZÃ¼rich,\nher algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year,\nGermany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether\nmoved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in\nPennsylvania. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite\nsigns of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.\n\nNoether's mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\". In the first (1908â19), she made significant contributions to\nthe theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential\ninvariants in the calculus of variations, [[Noether's theorem]], has been called\n\"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the\ndevelopment of modern physics\". In the second epoch (1920â26), she began work\nthat \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\". In her\nclassic paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains,\n1921) Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a\npowerful tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the\nascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named [[Noetherian]] in\nher honor. In the third epoch (1927â35), she published major works on\nnoncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation\ntheory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals. In addition to her own\npublications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several\nlines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed\nfrom her main work, such as algebraic topology.\n","recorded":1362124435,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"767","instances":["lodging","german_reich","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","crater","mathematics","1917","crater","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematician","mathematics","exhibition","data_type","ring_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~mduchin/UCD/111/readings/genius.pdf","http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~mduchin/UCD/111/readings/genius.pdf","http://mcc1.mccfl.edu/fl_maa/proceedings/2001/blue.pdf","http://mcc1.mccfl.edu/fl_maa/proceedings/2001/blue.pdf","http://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/hasse-noether/hasse_noether_web.pdf","http://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/hasse-noether/hasse_noether_web.pdf"],"categories":["1882
