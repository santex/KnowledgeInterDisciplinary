It conducts\nrespiration through its skin. An earthworm has a double transport system\ncomposed of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a\nsimple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral\nnervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the\nmouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its\nlength to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of\nchemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and\nlongitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move.\nSimilar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food\ntoward the worm's anus.\nEarthworms are hermaphroditesâeach individual carries both male and female sex\norgans. As an invertebrate, it lacks a skeleton, but it maintains its structure\nwith fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\n\n\"Earthworm\" is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is\neither a class or a subclass depending on the author) in the phylum Annelida. In\nclassical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of\nthe male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male\nsegments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed\nthem, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may\nagain soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\",\n\"night crawler\", and \"angleworm\" (due to its use as fishing bait).\n\nLarger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (or big worms), as\nopposed to the microdriles (or small worms) in the semiaquatic families\nTubificidae, Lumbriculidae, and Enchytraeidae, among others. The megadriles are\ncharacterized by having a distinct clitellum (which is more extensive than that\nof microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"earthworm","recorded":1372154361,"links":[],"instances":["anatomy","silk","bird","animal","worms","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Annelids","Soil biology"],"headings":["Anatomy","Regeneration","Locomotion and importance to soil","Benefits","Earthworms as an invasive species","Special habitats","Economic impact","Taxonomy and distribution","See also","References","Further reading","External links",""],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["posterior","anatomy"],["cocoon","silk"],["thrush","bird"],["mole","animal"],["noke","worms"]],"members":["posterior","cocoon","thrush","mole","noke","family"],"related":["Animal","Annelida","Oligochaeta","Oligochaeta","Haplotaxida","NODC","Family_(biology)","Acanthodrilidae","Ailoscolecidae","Almidae","Benhamiinae","Criodrilidae","Diplocardiinae","Eudrilidae","Exxidae","Glossoscolecidae","Hormogastridae","Kynotidae","Lumbricidae","Lutodrilidae","Megascolecidae","Microchaetidae","Moniligastridae","Ocnerodrilidae","Octochaetidae","Octochaetinae","Sparganophilidae","Tumakidae","Coelom","Hermaphrodite","Invertebrate","Hydrostatic_skeleton","Oligochaeta","Annelid","Cladistics","Fishing_bait","Tubificidae","Lumbriculidae","Enchytraeidae","Clitellum","Seta","Prostomium","Clitellum","Posterior_(anatomy)","Periproct","Cuticle","Coelom","Nephridium","Alimentary_canal","Septum","Alimentary_canal","Nephridia","Motile_cilia","Nephrostome","Hermaphrodites","Testes","Seminal_vesicles","Spermatheca","Spermatophore","Animal_sexual_behavior","Reproduction","Ventral","Clitellum","Cocoon_(silk)","Parthenogenesis","Linnaeus","Seta","Piston","Organic_gardening","Charles_Darwin","Humus","Organic_matter","Nitrogen","Phosphate","Potassium","Permaculture","Bill_Mollison","Bioturbation","Shewell_Cooper","Arable_land","Rothamsted_Experimental_Station","Vancouver_Island","Olympic_Peninsula","Serpentine_group","PH","Megascolecidae","Diapause","Bird","Starling","Thrush_(bird)","Gull","Crow","European_robin","American_robin","Bear","Fox","Hedgehog","Mole_(animal)","Ground_beetle","Beetle","Snail","Slug","Parasite","Protozoa","Platyhelminthes","Nematode","Blood","Seminal_vesicles","Coelom","Intestine","Silkworm_cocoons","Soil_pH","DDT","Lime_sulphur","Lead_arsenate","Australia","Superphosphate","Pasture","Pastoral_farming","Agronomy","Gippsland_earthworm","Protected_species","Vermiculture","Noke_(worms)","Māori_people","New_Zealand","Acanthodrilidae","Ailoscolecidae","Almidae","Benhamiinae","Criodrilidae","Diplocardiinae/-idae","Enchytraeidae","Eudrilidae","Exxidae","Glossoscolecidae","Haplotaxidae","Hormogastridae","Kynotidae","Lumbricidae","Lutodrilidae","Megascolecidae","Microchaetidae","Moniligastridae","Ocnerodrilidae","Octochaetidae","Octochaetinae","Sparganophilidae","Tumakidae","Drilosphere","Invasive_earthworms_of_North_America","Soil_life","Vermicompost","Worm_charming","Caecilians_of_the_Western_Ghats","Darwin,_Charles","The_Linnean_Society_of_London","University_of_California,_Davis"]}
