{"cursor":"3211","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'exoribonuclease' is an exonuclease ribonuclease, which are enzymes that\ndegrade RNA by removing terminal nucleotides from either the 5' end or the 3'\nend of the RNA molecule. Enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 5' end are\ncalled 5'-3' exoribonucleases, and enzymes that remove nucleotides from the 3'\nend are called 3'-5' exoribonucleases.\n\nExoribonucleases can use either water to cleave the nucleotide-nucleotide bond\n(which is called hydrolytic activity) or inorganic phosphate (which is called\nphosphorolytic activity). Hydrolytic exoribonucleases are classified under EC\nnumber 3.1 and phosphorolytic exoribonucleases under EC number 2.7.7. As the\nphosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave bonds they release\nnucleotide disphosphates), whereas the hydrolytic enzymes (which use water)\nrelease nucleotide monosphosphates).\n\nExoribonucleases exist in all kingdoms of life, the bacteria, archaea, and\neukaryotes. Exoribonucleases are involved in the degradation of many different\nRNA species, including messenger RNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA and miRNA.\nExoribonucleases can be single proteins (like RNase D or RNase PH) but also can\nbe complexes of multiple proteins, like the exosome complex (in which four of\nthe major exoribonuclease families are represented).\n","linknr":463,"url":"Exoribonuclease","recorded":1362569274,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ribonucleases"],"headings":["Major families","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/3%27_RNA_degradation.png/220px-3%27_RNA_degradation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Exonuclease","Ribonuclease","RNA","Nucleotide","5'_end","3'_end","Inorganic_phosphate","Enzyme_Commission_number","Adenosine_diphosphate","Adenosine_monophosphate","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Messenger_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","MiRNA","RNase_D","RNase_PH","Exosome_complex","RNase_R","RNase_II","RNase_D","RNase_T","Oligoribonuclease","RNase_BN","Polynucleotide_Phosphorylase","RNase_PH","Exoribonuclease_I","Exoribonuclease_II","Endoribonuclease","Nuclease","Deoxyribonuclease","Exodeoxyribonuclease","Endodeoxyribonuclease"]}
