{"cursor":"12183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Environmental science' is an multidisciplinary academic field that integrates\nphysical and biological sciences, (including but not limited to ecology,\nphysics, chemistry, biology, soil science, geology, atmospheric science and\ngeography) to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental\nproblems. Environmental science provides an integrated, quantitative, and\ninterdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental\nsystems. Environmental Science: Iowa State University.Environmental Sciences\nprovides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate\nhazards arising from anthropogenic and natural activities by focusing on key\nareas of environmental chemistry, earth sciences, environmental engineering,\natmospheric sciences, and sustainable systems. http://www.ensci.iastate.edu\n(Accessed 17 February 2010)\n\nRelated areas of study include environmental studies and environmental\nengineering. Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for\nunderstanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the\nenvironment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for\nimproving environmental quality in every aspect. Environmental scientists work\non subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating alternative\nenergy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management,\nand the effects of global climate change. Environmental issues almost always\ninclude an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes.\nEnvironmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of\nenvironmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist\ninclude the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as\nquantitative analysis.\n\nEnvironmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific\ninvestigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a multi-\ndisciplinary approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the\narrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental\nprotocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for\naction in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this\ndevelopment included the publication of Rachael Carson's landmark environmental\nbook [[Silent Spring]] Carson, Rachel.Silent Spring(Boston: Houghton\nMifflin, 1962), Mariner Books, 2002, ISBN 0-618-24906-0 along with major\nenvironmental issues becoming very public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil\nspill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio, \"catching fire\" (also in\n1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create\nthis new field of study.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Environmental_science","recorded":1362665084,"links":57,"instances":["biologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Natural sciences","Environmental science|"],"headings":["Terminology","Components","Regulations driving the studies","Notable environmental scientists","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg/300px-BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/100px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG/220px-Blue_Linckia_Starfish.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Tagebau_Garzweiler_Panorama_2005.jpg/2015px-Tagebau_Garzweiler_Panorama_2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Glen_Canyon_Dam_%26_Lake_Powell.jpg/220px-Glen_Canyon_Dam_%26_Lake_Powell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_lawton","biologist"]],"members":["john_lawton"],"related":["Academic_field","Ecology","Physics","Chemistry","Biology","Soil_science","Geology","Atmospheric_science","Geography","Interdisciplinary","Environmental_studies","Environmental_engineering","Natural_resource_management","Global_climate_change","Environmental_issues","1969_Santa_Barbara_oil_spill","Cuyahoga_River","Meteorological","Greenhouse_gas","Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling","Noise_pollution","Light_pollution","Global_warming","Computer_model","Carbon_dioxide","Meteorologist","Oceanographer","Calcium_carbonate","Water_pollution","Air_pollution","Biologist","Chemist","Physicist","Geologist","Soil_contamination","Solvent","Endangered_species","Arthropod","Environmental_geology","Environmental_soil_science","Hydrology","Oceanography","Erosion","Surface_runoff","Sediment_transport","Coal","Garzweiler_open_pit_mine","Germany","National_Environmental_Policy_Act","Environmental_Impact_Statement","Environment_Agency","Environment_Act_1995","Philip_Weller","John_Lawton_(biologist)","Actinides_in_the_environment","American_Geophysical_Union","Association_of_Environmental_Professionals","Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling","Bachelor_of_Environmental_Science","Biogeochemistry","Ecological_sanitation","Environmental_chemistry","Environmental_epidemiology","Environmental_health","Environmental_movement","Environmental_toxicology","Environmental_Impact_Statement","Environmental_monitoring","Environmental_planning","Environmental_statistics","Environmental_studies","Environmental_informatics","Epidemiology","Earth_Summit","Freshwater_environmental_quality_parameters","Geoprofessions","Glossary_of_environmental_science","List_of_environmental_degree-granting_institutions","List_of_environmental_studies_topics","Lists_of_environmental_topics","Natural_landscape","Phase_I_Environmental_Site_Assessment","Physical_geography","Sustainable_development"]}
