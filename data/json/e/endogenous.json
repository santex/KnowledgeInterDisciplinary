These sequences, which may\nbe fragments of viruses, or entire viral genomes (proviruses), can persist in\nthe germline, being passed on from one generation to the next as host alleles.\n\nEndogenous processes include senescence, the menstrual cycle and the self-\nsustained circadian rhythms of plants and animals.\n\nIn some biological systems, endogeneity refers to the recipient of DNA (usually\nin prokaryotes). However, because of homeostasis, discerning between internal\nand external influences is often difficult.\n\nEndogenous transcription factors refers to those that are manufactured by the\ncell, as opposed to cloned transcription factors.\n",
