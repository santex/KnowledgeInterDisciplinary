{"cursor":"5202","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Embedded software' is computer software, written to control machines or devices\nthat are not typically thought of as computers. It is typically specialized for\nthe particular hardware that it runs on and has time and memory\nconstraints. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with\nfirmware, although firmware can also be applied to ROM-based code on a computer,\non top of which the OS runs, whereas embedded software is typically the only\nsoftware on the device in question.\n\nManufacturers 'build in' embedded software in the electronics in cars,\ntelephones, modems, robots, appliances, toys, security systems, pacemakers,\ntelevisions and set-top boxes, and digital watches, for example.\nThis software can be very simple, such as lighting controls running on an 8-\nbit microprocessor and a few kilobytes of memory, or can become very\nsophisticated in applications such as airplanes, missiles, and process control\nsystems. http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/02/embsoft-\n/embsoftwre.pdf\n","linknr":160,"url":"Embedded_software","recorded":1362671130,"links":18,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","operating_system","micro_ip"],"pdf":["http://www.stroustrup.com/abstraction-and-machine.pdf","http://www.stroustrup.com/abstraction-and-machine.pdf","http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/02/embsoft/embsoftwre.pdf"],"categories":["Computing terminology","Embedded systems"],"headings":["Operating Systems","Differences from Application Software","Communication Protocols","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["integrity","operating_system"],["c","programming_language"],["ada","programming_language"],["uip","micro_ip"]],"members":["c","ada","integrity","uip"],"related":["Software","Electronic_hardware","Firmware","Cars","Robot","Pacemaker","Digital_watches","Kilobytes","Airplane","Missile","Process_control","Real-time_operating_system","LynxOS","VxWorks","BeRTOS","ThreadX","Windows_CE","Linux","OpenWrt","PikeOS","ECos","Fusion_RTOS","Nucleus_RTOS","RTEMS","Integrity_(operating_system)","UC/OS","QNX","Operating_System_Embedded","C_(programming_language)","C++","Ada_(programming_language)","Application_software","Device_driver","Schematic","Decimal","Hexadecimal","Binary_numeral_system","Bit_manipulation","Cross_compiler","In-circuit_emulator","JTAG","Embedded_C++","BASIC","Java_programming_language","Memory_address","I2C","Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus","Serial_port","Universal_Serial_Bus","Embedded_systems","Closed_source","NicheStack_TCP/IPv4","CMX_Systems","Open-source","UIP_(micro_IP)","LwIP","Embedded_system"]}
