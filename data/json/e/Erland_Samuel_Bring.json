{"cursor":"1763","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Erland Samuel Bring' (19 August 1736 â 20 May 1798) was a Swedish\nmathematician.\n\nBring studied at Lund University between 1750 and 1757. In 1762 he obtained a\nposition of a reader in history and was promoted to professor in 1779. At Lund\nhe wrote eight volumes of mathematical work in the fields of algebra, geometry,\nanalysis and astronomy, including Meletemata quaedam mathematematica circa\ntransformationem aequationum algebraicarum (1786). This work describes Bring's\ncontribution to the algebraic solution of equations.\n\nBring had developed an important transformation to simplify a quintic equation\nto the form x^5 + px + q = 0 (see Bring radical). In 1832â35 the\nsame transformation was independently derived by George Jerrard. However,\nwhereas Jerrard knew from the past work by Paolo Ruffini and Niels Henrik Abel\nthat a general quintic equation can not be solved, this fact was not known to\nBring, putting him in a disadvantage.
