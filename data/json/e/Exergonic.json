In thermodynamics, work is defined as\nthe energy moving from the system (the internal region) to the surroundings (the\nexternal region) during a given process. An exergonic process is one in which\nthere is a positive flow of energy from the system to the surroundings. This is\nin contrast with an endergonic process.\n\nConstant pressure, constant temperature reactions are exergonic if and only if\nthe Gibbs free energy is negative (âG ","linknr":111,"url":"Exergonic","recorded":1362504986,"links":18,"instances":["thermodynamics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thermodynamics","Chemical thermodynamics"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work","thermodynamics"]],"members":["work"],"related":["Work_(thermodynamics)","System","Surroundings","Endergonic","If_and_only_if","Gibbs_free_energy","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Endergonic","Endergonic_reaction","Exothermic","Endothermic","Exergonic_reaction","Exothermic_reaction","Endothermic_reaction","Warm-blooded","Warm-blooded"]}
