{"cursor":"17613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Entomology' (from Greek , entomos, \"that which is cut in pieces or\nengraved/segmented\", hence \"insect\"; and , [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]] ) is the scientific study of insects, a branch of\narthropodology, which in turn is a branch of biology. In the past the term\n\"insect\" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included\nthe study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such\nas arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning\nmay still be encountered in informal use.\n\nLike several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology\nis a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a\nfocus on insect related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology\ntherefore includes a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics,\nbehavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental\nbiology, ecology, morphology, paleontology, mathematics, anthropology, robotics,\nagriculture, nutrition, forensic science, and more.\n\nAt some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-\nthirds of all known organisms, date back some 400\nmillion years, and have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms\nof life on earth.\n","linknr":574,"url":"Entomologist","recorded":1362511823,"links":99,"instances":["1958_film","journal","writer","insect","bones","daisy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Entomology|*","Subfields
