Most experts\nbelieve all the inclusions are proper. It's also known that if , then\nNEXPTIME}}, the class of problems solvable in exponential time by a\nnondeterministic Turing machine. Section 20.1, page 491. More\nprecisely, 'EXPTIME' â  'NEXPTIME' if and only if there exist sparse languages in\n'NP' that are not in 'P'.

[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808769\nAt ACM Digital Library]\n\nEXPTIME can also be reformulated as the space class APSPACE, the problems that\ncan be solved by an alternating Turing machine in polynomial space. This is one\nway to see that PSPACE \\subseteq EXPTIME, since an alternating\nTuring machine is at least as powerful as a deterministic Turing\nmachine. Papadimitriou (1994), section 20.1, corollary 3, page 495.\n\nEXPTIME is one class in an exponential hierarchy of complexity classes with\nincreasingly higher time bounds. The class 2-EXPTIME is defined similarly to\nEXPTIME but with a doubly exponential time bound 2^{2^n} . This can\nbe generalized to higher and higher time bounds.\n","linknr":217,"url":"EXPTIME","recorded":1362543782,"links":23,"instances":["complexity","complexity","board_game","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~umans/cs21/lec18.pdf","http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~umans/cs21/lec18.pdf"],"categories":["Complexity classes"],"headings":["EXPTIME-complete","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Complexity_subsets_pspace.svg/200px-Complexity_subsets_pspace.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/5/035b91422e08a52acf14ffca04864c75.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d5557175d90cbb263ae71f0dfebbf732.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d5557175d90cbb263ae71f0dfebbf732.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d5557175d90cbb263ae71f0dfebbf732.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/7/a07903a0504f50f27e2a85c27e47fbd5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/1/b7118a777168022f01f7439db6d769ad.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["p","complexity"],["np","complexity"],["go","board_game"]],"members":["np","p","go","set"],"related":["EXPTIME-complete","EXPSPACE","Computational_complexity_theory","Complexity_class","Set_(mathematics)","Decision_problem","Deterministic_Turing_machine","Big_O_notation","DTIME","P_(complexity)","NP_(complexity)","PSPACE","NEXPTIME","EXPSPACE","Time_hierarchy_theorem","Space_hierarchy_theorem","NEXPTIME","Nondeterministic_Turing_machine","Sparse_language","APSPACE","Alternating_Turing_machine","Exponential_hierarchy","2-EXPTIME","Double_exponential_function","Polynomial-time_many-one_reduction","Algorithm","Polynomial_time","Time_hierarchy_theorem","Computability_theory","Deterministic_Turing_machine","P-complete","Generalized_game","Chess","Checkers","Go_(board_game)","PSPACE-complete","Succinct_circuit","P-complete","Adjacency_matrix"]}
