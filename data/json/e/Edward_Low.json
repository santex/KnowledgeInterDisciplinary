He was born around 1690 into poverty\nin Westminster, London, and was a thief from a young age. Low moved to Boston,\nMassachusetts, as a young man. His wife died in childbirth in late 1719. Two\nyears later, he became a pirate, operating off the coasts of New England and the\nAzores, and in the Caribbean.\n\nHe captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or\nfour. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his\nshort career, burning most of them. Although he was active\nfor only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates\nof the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing\nthem. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described Low as\n\"savage and desperate,\" and a man of \"amazing and grotesque brutality\". [[The New York Times]] called him a torturer, whose methods\nwould have \"done credit to the ingenuity of the Spanish Inquisition in its\ndarkest days\". The circumstances of Low's death, which\ntook place around 1724, have been the subject of much speculation.\n","linknr":923,"url":"Edward_Low","recorded":1362477727,"links":45,"instances":["pirates_of_the_caribbean","reward","ship","royal_navy","pirate","sailing","author","ship","pirate","pirate_biographer","ship","anaheim","unit","film_series"],"pdf":["http://www.beacon.org/client/pdfs/5025_ch1.pdf"],"categories":["1690
