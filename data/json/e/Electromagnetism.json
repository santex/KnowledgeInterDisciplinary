{"cursor":"26187","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Electromagnetism' is the branch of science concerned with the forces that occur\nbetween electrically charged particles. In electromagnetic theory these forces\nare explained using electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic force is one of\nthe four fundamental interactions in nature, the other three being the strong\ninteraction, the weak interaction and gravitation.\n\nThe word is a compound from two Greek terms, á¼¢Î»ÎµÎºÏÏÎ¿Î½, Älektron, \"amber\" (as\nelectrostatic phenomena were first described as properties of amber by the\nphilosopher Thales), and Î¼Î±Î³Î½Î®ÏÎ·Ï, magnÄtÄs, \"magnet\" (the magnetic stones\nfound in antiquity in the vicinity of the Greek city of Magnesia, in Lydia,\nAsia Minor).\n\nElectromagnetism is the interaction responsible for almost all the phenomena\nencountered in daily life, with the exception of gravity. Ordinary matter takes\nits form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual molecules in\nmatter. Electrons are bound by electromagnetic wave mechanics into orbitals\naround atomic nuclei to form atoms, which are the building blocks of molecules.\nThis governs the processes involved in chemistry, which arise from interactions\nbetween the electrons of neighboring atoms, which are in turn determined by the\ninteraction between electromagnetic force and the momentum of the electrons.\n\nThere are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field.\nElectromagnetism manifests as both electric fields and magnetic fields. Both\nfields are simply different aspects of electromagnetism, and hence are\nintrinsically related - a changing electric field generates a magnetic field;\nconversely a changing magnetic field generates an electric field. This effect is\ncalled electromagnetic induction, and is the basis of operation for electrical\ngenerators, induction motors, and transformers. Mathematically speaking,\nmagnetic fields and electric fields are convertible with relative motion as a\n2nd-order tensor or bivector.\n\nElectric fields are the cause of several common phenomena, such as electric\npotential (such as the voltage of a battery) and electric current (such as the\nflow of electricity through a flashlight). Magnetic fields are the cause of the\nforce associated with magnets.\n\nIn quantum electrodynamics, electromagnetic interactions between charged\nparticles can be calculated using the method of Feynman diagrams, in which we\npicture messenger particles called virtual photons being exchanged between\ncharged particles. This method can be derived from the field picture through\nperturbation theory.\n\nThe theoretical implications of electromagnetism led to the development of\nspecial relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905.\n","linknr":661,"url":"Electromagnetism","recorded":1362485746,"links":118,"instances":["unit","unit","electromagnetism","unit","unit","unit","astronomer","quantum_mechanics"],"pdf":["http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf","http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf","http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/0708/notes/hamclassemf.pdf","http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/0708/notes/radnmatt.pdf"],"categories":["Electromagnetism|","Electrodynamics|"],"headings":["History
