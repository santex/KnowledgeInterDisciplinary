This is the meaning covered by this article. This may\nbe a limited edition, with a fixed number of impressions produced on the\nunderstanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an\nopen edition limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the\nplate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed\nby the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of\nthat impression and the total edition size.\n","title":"edition","headings":["Original or reproduction?","Development of the concept","Modern practice","Numbering","Consumer protection laws","References","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Special_edition","1: Printmaking","1: Old_master_print","1: Paper","1: Watermark","1: Francisco_de_Goya","1: Los_Caprichos","1: Aquatint","1: Goya","1: Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn","1: Monotyping","1: Artist's_proof","1: Print_run","1: Artist's_multiple"]}
