an assertion.\nThis support may be strong or weak. The strongest type of evidence is that which\nprovides direct proof of the truth of an assertion. At the other extreme is\nevidence that is merely consistent with an assertion but does not rule out\nother, contradictory assertions, as in circumstantial evidence.\n\nIn law, rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a\nlegal proceeding, as well as the quality and quantity of evidence that are\nnecessary to fulfill the legal burden of proof. Types of legal evidence include\ntestimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence.\n\nScientific evidence consists of observations and experimental results that serve\nto support, refute, or modify a scientific hypothesis or theory, when collected\nand interpreted in accordance with the scientific method.\n\nIn philosophy, the study of evidence is closely tied to epistomology, which\nconsiders the nature of knowledge and how it can be acquired.\n","title":"Evidence","headings":["Burden of proof","Evidence in science","Evidence in law","Types of evidence","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Scientific_evidence","2: Legal_burden_of_proof","2: Testimony","2: Experiment","2: Hypothesis","2: Reasonable_doubt","2: Anecdotal_evidence","1: Truth","1: Circumstantial_evidence","1: Law","1: Admissible_evidence","1: Documentary_evidence","1: Real_evidence","1: Observation","1: Scientific_theory","1: Scientific_method","1: Philosophy","1: Epistomology","1: Knowledge","1: Criminal_procedure","1: Prosecutor","1: Defendant","1: Presumption_of_innocence","1: Civil_procedure","1: Plaintiff","1: Arrest","1: Debate","1: Laboratory","1: Experimenter's_regress","1: Refutation","1: Bias","1: Preponderance_of_evidence","1: Crime","1: Personal_experience","1: Argument","1: Belief","1: Empiricism","1: Falsifiability","1: Logical_positivism","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Reason","1: Skepticism","1: Theory_of_justification","1: Validity","1: ASTM"]}
