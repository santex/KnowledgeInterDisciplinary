It is an interlinear\ntranslation with the original Greek text and a word-for-word English translation\nin the left column, and a full English translation in the right column. It is\nbased on the interlinear translation, the renderings of eminent critics, and\nvarious readings of the Vatican Manuscript. It includes illustrative and\nexplanatory footnotes, references, and an alphabetical appendix.\n\nThe Greek text is that of Johann Jakob Griesbach. The English text uses\n\"Jehovah\" for the divine name a number of times where the New Testament writers\nused \"ÎºÏÏÎ¹Î¿Ï\" (the Lord) when quoting Hebrew scriptures. For example, at it\nreads: \"For David himself says in the book of Psalms, Jehovah said to my Lord,\nsit thou at my Right hand, 'till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet\", where\nJesus quoted Psalm 110:1.\n\nThe text of the original edition's title page is as follows:\n\n:The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the Original Greek Text of what is Commonly\nStyled the New Testament (According to the Recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach),\nwith an Interlineary Word for Word English Translation; A New Emphatic Version,\nbased on the Interlineary Translation, on the Renderings of Eminent Critics, and\non the various readings of the Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209 in the Vatican\nLibrary: Together with Illustrative and Explanatory Footnotes, and a copious\nselection of references; to the whole of which is added a valuable Alphabetical\nAppendix.
