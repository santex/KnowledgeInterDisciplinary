Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects,\nsuch as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and the flow of\nelectrical current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception\nof electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.\n\nIn electricity, charges produce electromagnetic fields which act on other\ncharges. Electricity occurs due to several types of physics:\n* '[[electric charge]]': a property of some subatomic particles, which\n  determines their electromagnetic interactions. Electrically charged matter is\n  influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields.\n* '[[electric current]]': a movement or flow of electrically charged particles,\n  typically measured in amperes.\n* '[[electric field]]' (see electrostatics): an especially simple type of\n  electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge even when it is not\n  moving (i.e., there is no electric current). The electric field produces a\n  force on other charges in its vicinity. Moving charges additionally produce a\n  magnetic field.\n* '[[electric potential]]': the capacity of an electric field to do work on an\n  electric charge, typically measured in volts.\n* '[[electromagnets]]': electrical currents generate magnetic fields, and\n  changing magnetic fields generate electrical currents\n\nIn electrical engineering, electricity is used for:\n* '[[electric power]]' where electric current is used to energise equipment\n* '[[electronics]]' which deals with electrical circuits that involve active\n  electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated\n  circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\n\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though advances in the\nscience were not made until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Practical\napplications for electricity however remained few, and it would not be until the\nlate nineteenth century that engineers were able to put it to industrial and\nresidential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time\ntransformed industry and society. Electricity's extraordinary versatility as a\nmeans of providing energy means it can be put to an almost limitless set of\napplications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and\ncomputation. Electrical power is the backbone of modern industrial society.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| first = D.A. | last = Jones title = Electrical engineering: the backbone of\n| society journal = Proceedings of the

\"amber-like\", coined in\nthe year 1600 from the Greek ŒÆŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøŒΩ (electron) meaning amber, because\nelectrical effects were produced classically by rubbing amber.\n","title":"Electricity","headings":["History","Concepts","Electric circuits","Production and uses","Electricity and the natural world","Cultural perception","See
