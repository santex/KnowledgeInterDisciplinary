Earth formed about 4.5 Ga (billion years ago) and life\nappeared on its surface within one billion years. The similarities between all\npresent-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all\nknown species have diverged through the process of evolution.\n\nMicrobial mats of coexisting bacteria and archaea were the dominant form of life\nin the early Archean and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought\nto have taken place within them. - abstract with link to free\nfull content (PDF) The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, around 3.5\nGa, eventually led to the oxygenation of the atmosphere, beginning around 2.4\nGa. The earliest evidence of eukaryotes (complex\ncells with organelles), dates from 1.85 Ga, {{cite journal\n | first = Andrew H. last = Knoll coauthors = Javaux, E.J, Hewitt, D. and Cohen,\n | P. title = Eukaryotic organisms in Proterozoic oceans journal = Philosophical\n | Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Part B year=2006 | volume=361 |\n | issue=1470 | pages=1023â38 pmc=1578724 doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1843 pmid =\n | 16754612\n}}  and while they may have been\npresent earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using\noxygen in their metabolism.

After the CretaceousâPaleogene\nextinction event killed off the dinosaurs, mammals increased rapidly\nin size and diversity. Such mass extinctions may have accelerated\nevolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to\ndiversify.\n\nFossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified\nin the Early Cretaceous () probably helped by coevolution with pollinating\ninsects. Flowering plants and marine phytoplankton are still the dominant\nproducers of organic matter. Social insects appeared around the same time as\nflowering plants. Although they occupy only small parts of the insect \"family\ntree\", they now form over half the total mass of insects. Humans evolved from a\nlineage of upright-walking apes whose earliest fossils date from over 6 Ma.\nAlthough early members of this lineage had chimpanzee-sized brains, there are\nsigns of a steady increase in brain size after about 3 Ma.\n","linknr":2817,"url":"Evolutionary_history_of_life","recorded":1362477490,"links":121,"instances":["biology","biology","sense","biology","journal","genetics","geology","physiology","geology","biology","journal","biology","biology","genus"],"pdf":["http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf","http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025225841/http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071025225841/http://nmnaturalhistory.org/pdf_files/TJB.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jessci/dec2005/ilc-3.pdf","http://www.geology.wisc.edu/zircon/Valley2002Cool_Early_Earth.pdf","http://www.geology.wisc.edu/zircon/Valley2002Cool_Early_Earth.pdf","http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~higgsp/3D03/BrasierArchaeanFossils.pdf","http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~higgsp/3D03/BrasierArchaeanFossils.pdf","http://courses.washington.edu/biol354/The%20Origin%20of%20Life%20on%20Earth.pdf","http://courses.washington.edu/biol354/The%20Origin%20of%20Life%20on%20Earth.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf","http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2003/vol4-2//pdf/gmr0070.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070106201614/http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf","http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070106201614/http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/10173.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/10173.full.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/00770/EGU06-J-00770.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU06/00770/EGU06-J-00770.pdf","http://euplotes.biology.uiowa.edu/web/jmlpubls/rml05.pdf","http://euplotes.biology.uiowa.edu/web/jmlpubls/rml05.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/GAIDOS/geobiology2007.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/GAIDOS/geobiology2007.pdf","http://www.uwm.edu/~sdornbos/PDF's/Chen%20et%20al.%202002.pdf","http://www.uwm.edu/~sdornbos/PDF's/Chen%20et%20al.%202002.pdf","http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/965.pdf","http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/965.pdf","http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://www.bios.niu.edu/davis/bios458/Shu1.pdf","http://www.bios.niu.edu/davis/bios458/Shu1.pdf","http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_940/06EvidEvol/papers/KendrickCrane1997.pdf","http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_940/06EvidEvol/papers/KendrickCrane1997.pdf","http://www.com.univ-mrs.fr/~boudouresque/Publications_DOM_2006_2007/Daeschler_et_al_2006_Nature.pdf","http://www.com.univ-mrs.fr/~boudouresque/Publications_DOM_2006_2007/Daeschler_et_al_2006_Nature.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/4689/1/VZ_1989GauthieretalHierLife.pdf","http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/4689/1/VZ_1989GauthieretalHierLife.pdf","http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/1983success.pdf","http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/1983success.pdf","http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/00-08-044.pdf","http://www.santafe.edu/research/publications/workingpapers/00-08-044.pdf","http://muller.lbl.gov/papers/Rohde-Muller-Nature.pdf","http://muller.lbl.gov/papers/Rohde-Muller-Nature.pdf"],"categories":["History
