{"cursor":"12546","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Endonucleases' are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bond within a\npolynucleotide chain. There is a small number of significant classes of\nendonucleases that cleave only at the specific nucleotide sequences (such as the\nrestriction endonucleases which are so vital in biotechnology). At the extreme ends of a sequence there are\nrestriction endonucleases, usually called restriction enzymes. These are\nendonucleases from eubacteria and archea that recognize a specific DNA\nsequence. The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a\nrestriction enzyme is called the restriction site. Typically, a restriction site\nwill be a palindromic sequence of about four to six nucleotides long. Most\nrestriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary\nsingle-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are\ntermed \"sticky ends.\" Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can\nbe joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known,\neach attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the\nsame endonuclease can be joined together regardless of the origin of the DNA.\nSuch DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new\ncombinations. Restriction endonucleases\n(restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and\nType III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used\nin genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial,\nplant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.\n","linknr":369,"url":"endonuclease","recorded":1362561182,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.1"],"headings":["Categories","Notations","Further Discussions","DNA repair","Common endonucleases","Mutations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Endonuclease.jpg/220px-Endonuclease.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Restriction_enzyme_Eco_RI.JPG/220px-Restriction_enzyme_Eco_RI.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/APEndonucleasecartoon.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enzyme","Phosphodiester_bond","Polynucleotide","Restriction_endonucleases","Palindromic","DNA_ligase","Recombinant_DNA","Restriction_enzyme","Genetic_engineering","Recombinant_DNA","Synthetic_biology","Restriction_endonucleases","Endonucleases","Methylase","Restriction_enzyme","Holliday_junction","Triple-stranded_DNA","G-quadruplex","Eric_T._Kool","Codons","Proteomics","Restriction_enzymes","AP_endonuclease","Exonuclease","Restriction_endonuclease","Nuclease","Ribonuclease","AP_endonuclease"]}
