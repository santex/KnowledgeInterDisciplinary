In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level\nwhich is often associated with an atom being excited to an excited state.\n\nIn quantum mechanics an 'excited state' of a system (such as an atom, molecule\nor nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the\nground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). The temperature\nof a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the\nnotable exception of systems that exhibit Negative temperature).\n\nThe lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or\ninduced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually\noccurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the\nsystem to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state).\nThis return to a lower energy level is often loosely described as decay and is\nthe inverse of excitation.\n\nLong-lived excited states are often called metastable. Long-lived nuclear\nisomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this.\n","title":"Excited%20state","headings":["Atomic excitation","Perturbed gas excitation","Calculation of excited states","Reaction","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Photon","1: Energy_level","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Atom","1: Molecule","1: Atomic_nucleus","1: Quantum_state","1: Energy","1: Ground_state","1: Temperature","1: Negative_temperature","1: Spontaneous_emission","1: Stimulated_emission","1: Phonon","1: Metastable","1: Nuclear_isomer","1: Singlet_oxygen","1: Hydrogen_atom","1: Electron","1: Atomic_orbital","1: Wavefunction","1: Quantum_number","1: Bound_state","1: Ion","1: Electromagnetic_spectrum","1: Emission_line","1: Hydrogen_spectral_series","1: Rydberg_atom","1: Rydberg_matter","1: Boltzmann_distribution","1: Two-dimensional_gas","1: Coupled_cluster","1: Møller–Plesset_perturbation_theory","1: Multi-configurational_self-consistent_field","1: Configuration_interaction","1: Time-dependent_density_functional_theory","1: Mechanistic_Organic_Photochemistry","1: Rydberg_formula","1: Stationary_state","1: Repulsive_state"]}
