{"cursor":"3904","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Nicolette' (born 'Nicolette Suwoton') is a UK singer-songwriter of Nigerian\nparentage. Living in London , she was born 1964 in Glasgow, Scotland, and has\nlived in Nigeria, Switzerland, France, and Belgium. Her music, although falling\nbroadly into the field of electronica, is characterised by many influences,\nincluding, jazz, classical, blues, folk, and African. This has resulted in a\nhighly individualistic sound due in part to the diverse variety of music her\nfather played and taught her as a child. Known for her distinctive sensual,\nchildlike voice, she has been described as \"Billie Holiday on acid\".\n\nShe has released three solo albums, as well as a DJ mix album for the DJ-Kicks\nseries, and featured on \"Three\" and \"Sly\", two songs on Massive Attack's 1994\n[[Protection (album)|Protection]] album. She has worked with many other\ncollaborators in the electronic music field, including Plaid, Alec Empire, and 4\nHero. In 1999 she set up her own record label, Early Records, upon leaving\nTalkinâ Loud to release quirky pop anthems. According to Nicolette, Early\nRecords' music policy is: \"innovative pop music.\" Nicolette's 2005\nalbum, Life Loves Us, was released through the label. One single and a 6-track\nEP were released from the album in the following year.\n\nIn 2007 Nicolette's \"No Government\" was re-released and remixed by DJ Tocadisco\nand Makossa & Megablast.\n\nIn 2008 Nicolette contributed vocals to John Tejada's album \"Where\", she sings\nand co-wrote the track \"Desire\". Nicolette released a single called \"Love\" with\nDJ Cam in March 2010. Her fourth studio album is almost complete and is\nexpected in 2013.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Early_Records","recorded":1363184250,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Nicolette_(musician)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Early_Records&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Singer-songwriter","/wiki/Nigeria","/wiki/London","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit","/wiki/Glasgow","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Switzerland","/wiki/France","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Electronica","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/European_classical_music","/wiki/Blues","/wiki/Folk_music","/wiki/African_music","/wiki/Billie_Holiday","/wiki/LSD","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Disc_Jockey","/wiki/DJ-Kicks","/wiki/Massive_Attack","/wiki/Protection_(album)","/wiki/Plaid_(band)","/wiki/Alec_Empire","/wiki/4_Hero","/wiki/Early_Records","/wiki/Pop_music","#cite_note-2","/wiki/DJ_Tocadisco","#Discography","#Albums","#Non_album_tracks","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Now_is_Early","/wiki/Let_No-One_Live_Rent_Free_in_Your_Head","/wiki/DJ-Kicks:_Nicolette","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/L.A._Style","/wiki/Massive_Attack","/wiki/Plaid_(band)","/wiki/Bang_Gang","/w/index.php?title=Filewile&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ddance.nl/en/nicolette-suwoton","http://www.ddance.nl/en/nicolette-suwoton","#cite_ref-2","http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/nicoletteiw.htm","http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/nicoletteiw.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p109773/songs/all-songs","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.earlyrecords.org","http://www.myspace.com/nicolettemusic","http://www.facebook.com/pages/NICOLETTE/7833427366","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56806050","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&oldid=523861710","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1964_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Scottish_female_singers","/wiki/Category:Black_Scottish_people","/wiki/Category:Black_British_musicians","/wiki/Category:Musicians_from_Glasgow","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2009","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements_from_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_containing_potentially_dated_statements","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nicolette+%28musician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nicolette+%28musician%29","/wiki/Nicolette_(musician)","/wiki/Talk:Nicolette_(musician)","#","/wiki/Nicolette_(musician)","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nicolette_(musician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nicolette_(musician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&oldid=523861710","/w/index.php?title=Nicolette_(musician)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Sp
