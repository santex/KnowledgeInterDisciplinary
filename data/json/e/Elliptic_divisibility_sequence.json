They attracted only sporadic attention until around 2000, when EDS\nwere taken up as a class of nonlinear recurrences that are more amenable to\nanalysis than most such sequences. This tractability is due primarily to the\nclose connection between EDS and elliptic curves. In addition to the intrinsic\ninterest that EDS have within number theory, EDS have applications to other\nareas of mathematics including logic and cryptography.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Elliptic_divisibility_sequence","recorded":1362535234,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/files/alumni/thesis/swart_c.pdf","http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/Presentations/ICMSEDSLecture.pdf"],"categories":["Number theory","Integer sequences"],"headings":["Definition","Divisibility property","General recursion","Nonsingular EDS","Examples","Periodicity of EDS","Elliptic curves and points associated to EDS","Growth of EDS","Primes and primitive divisors in EDS","EDS over finite fields","Applications of EDS","References","Further material","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/4/6/146ef9dae4a1462482a691b8908926a5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/e/5/8e590e966fcd96a752b96063537b9fa4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/3/073c1e6a6ecbf7d48efcd9b3529926bf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/e/3/be3f0271732a638bc8cb74c8a971d51f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/9/d49fc72f6177fbf77447a9264a3501e4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/5/54549a07a8e737c027e757da7ab34830.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/f/f4fc6a0a3bfe7b40a1bdd6a3b56937aa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/b/9/3b9a1a2af1d4a6c12c1a55fad504a513.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/a/e/0ae80a14cfa58b6736d636ac1a25d521.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/3/86385e3a5397581497186923a8b4003e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/4/3f48b33caf80f93ee9a3276e7c9c0573.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Division_polynomial","Elliptic_curve","Morgan_Ward","Logic","Cryptography","Divisibility_sequence","Fibonacci_sequence","Division_polynomial","Canonical_height","Zsigmondy's_theorem","Tate_pairing","Bjorn_Poonen","Hilbert's_tenth_problem","Katherine_Stange","Elliptic_nets","Weil_pairing","Pairing-based_cryptography"]}
