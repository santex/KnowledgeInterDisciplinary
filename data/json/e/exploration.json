is the act of for the purpose of discovery of information or\nresources. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including\nhumans. In human history, its most dramatic rise is arguably seen during the Age\nof Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the\nworld, largely in a pursuit of material wealth. Since then, major explorations\nafter the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons more aimed at information\ndiscovery.\n\nIn scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of empirical\nresearch (the other two being description and explanation). The term is also\ncommonly used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring\nthe internet, sexuality, etc.\n","title":"exploration","headings":["Notable Periods of Human Exploration","Terrains and Places Explored by Humans","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Iceland","3: India","2: Age_of_Discovery","2: Asia_Minor","2: North_Africa","2: East_Africa","2: Spanish_people","1: Information","1: History","1: European_peoples","1: Major_explorations_after_the_Age_of_Discovery","1: Scientific_research","1: Explanation","1: Phoenicia","1: Mediterranean_Sea","1: United_Kingdom","1: Central_America","1: Aeneid","1: Hanno_the_Navigator","1: Carthage","1: Africa","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Marseille","1: Pytheas","1: Great_Britain","1: Germany","1: Shetland_Islands","1: Xu_Fu","1: Qin_Dynasty","1: Zhang_Qian","1: Han_Dynasty","1: Silk_Road","1: Vikings","1: Norway","1: Viking","1: Erik_the_Red","1: Greenland","1: Leif_Ericson","1: Europe","1: North_America","1: Wang_Dayuan","1: Floruit","1: South_China_Sea","1: Southeast_Asia","1: South_Asia","1: Sri_Lanka","1: Zheng_He","1: Treasure_voyages","1: Arabia","1: Indonesia","1: Thailand","1: Afanasy_Nikitin","1: Russian_People","1: Europeans","1: Bartolomeu_Dias","1: Portuguese_people","1: Cape_of_Good_Hope","1: Christopher_Columbus","1: Genoa","1: Spain","1: Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus","1: Vasco_Núñez_de_Balboa","1: Panama","1: Circumnavigation","1: Ferdinand_Magellan","1: Juan_Sebastian_Elcano","1: Jacques_Cartier","1: French_people","1: Francisco_de_Orellana","1: Amazon_River","1: Pedro_Fernandes_de_Queirós","1: Portugal","1: Spanish_Crown","1: Australia","1: Arctic_exploration","1: Cave_exploration","1: Desert_exploration","1: Ocean_exploration","1: Urban_exploration","1: Exploration_of_the_Moon","1: Heliosphere","1: Solar_System","1: Milky_Way","1: Space_exploration","1: List_of_explorations","1: List_of_explorers","1: List_of_maritime_explorers","1: List_of_Russian_explorers","1: Adventure","1: Chronology_of_European_exploration_of_Asia","1: European_exploration_of_Africa","1: Explorers_Grand_Slam","1: History_of_Antarctica","1: Timeline_of_European_exploration"]}
