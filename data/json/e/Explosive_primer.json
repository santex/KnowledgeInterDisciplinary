{"cursor":"10547","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'blasting cap' is a small sensitive primary explosive device generally used to\ndetonate a larger, more powerful and less sensitive secondary explosive such as\nTNT, dynamite, or plastic explosive.\n\nBlasting caps come in a variety of types, including non-electric caps, electric\ncaps, and fuse caps. They are used in commercial mining, excavation, and\ndemolition. Electric types are set off by a short burst of current conducted\nfrom a blasting machine by a long wire to the cap to ensure safety. Traditional\nfuse caps have a fuse which is lit by a match.\n\nThe need for blasting caps arises from sensitivity issues of an explosive\ncompound. All explosive compounds require a certain amount of energy to\ndetonate. If an explosive is too sensitive, it may go off unexpectedly, so most\ncommercial explosives are formulated to be stable and safe to handle and will\nnot explode if accidentally dropped, mishandled, or exposed to fire. However,\nsuch explosives (called secondary explosives) are hard to detonate intentionally\nas well, and require a small initiating explosion. A blasting cap contains an\neasy-to-ignite explosive that provides the initial activation energy to start a\ndetonation in a more stable explosive. The blasting cap is stored separately and\nnot inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the\nmain charge safe.\n\nMost blasting caps contain what is called a primary explosive, which is a high\nexplosive compound that will explode from flame, heat or shock. A blasting cap\nmay also contain a booster, another less sensitive but more energetic explosive\nthat makes the cap more powerful, and thus more reliable for detonating\nsecondary explosives.\n\nExplosives commonly used in blasting caps include mercury fulminate, lead azide,\nlead styphnate and tetryl. The recommended primary explosive is DDNP because it\nis nontoxic, easy to make and not too sensitive.\n\nBecause they contain easy-to-detonate primary explosives, blasting caps are\nhazardous for untrained personnel to handle. They are sometimes not recognized\nas explosives due to their appearance, leading to injuries.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Explosive_primer","recorded":1362544514,"links":21,"instances":["biaxially_oriented","explosives_","explosive"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Detonators","Explosives"],"headings":["Types","Laser ordnance initiators","History","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nalleja.jpg/250px-Nalleja.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/BlastingCapsAndDetonators.png/400px-BlastingCapsAndDetonators.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sensitivity","explosives"],["fuse","explosive"],["sensitivity","explosives_"],["pet_film","biaxially_oriented"]],"members":["pet_film","sensitivity","fuse"],"related":["Sensitivity_(explosives)","Primary_explosive","Detonator","Secondary_explosive","Trinitrotoluene","Dynamite","Plastic_explosive","Mining","Demolition","Blasting_machine","Fuse_(explosive)","Sensitivity_(explosives)_","Secondary_explosives","Activation_energy","Primary_explosive","High_explosive","Explosive_booster","Mercury_fulminate","Lead_azide","Lead_styphnate","Tetryl","Diazodinitrophenol","Primary_explosive","Bridgewire","Electric_match","Manhattan_project","PETN","PET_film_(biaxially_oriented)","Kapton","Nuclear_weapons","Laser","Fiber_optic","Royal_Society","Electric_spark","Leyden_jar","Benjamin_Franklin","Black_powder","Alfred_Nobel","Mercury_fulminate","Nitroglycerin","Imperial_Chemical_Industries","Blasting_machine","Prelinger_Archives"]}
