{"cursor":"21852","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'exclusionary rule' is a legal principle in the United States, under\nconstitutional law, which holds that evidence collected or analyzed in violation\nof the defendant's constitutional rights is sometimes inadmissible for a\ncriminal prosecution in a court of law. This may be considered an example of a\nprophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a\nconstitutional right. However, in some circumstances at least, the exclusionary\nrule may also be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language,\nsuch as the Fifth Amendment's command that no person \"shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself\" and that no person \"shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law\".\n\n\"The exclusionary rule is grounded in the Fourth Amendment and it is intended to\nprotect citizens from illegal searches and seizures.\" Berg, p. 29 The\nexclusionary rule is also designed to provide a remedy and disincentive, which\nis short of criminal prosecution in response to prosecutors and police who\nillegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment in the Bill of\nRights compelled to self-incrimination. The exclusionary rule also applies to\nviolations of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to counsel.\n\nMost states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained\nevidence under their state constitutions and/or statutes, some of which predate\nthe federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and\ncompelled self-incrimination.\n\nThis rule is occasionally referred to as a legal technicality because it allows\ndefendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually\ncommitted. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth\nAmendment protecting people from double jeopardy. In strict cases, when an\nillegal action is used by police/prosecution to gain any incriminating result,\nall evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal actionâthis evidence is\nknown as \"fruit of the poisonous tree\"âcan be thrown out from a jury (or be\ngrounds for a mistrial if too much information has been irrevocably revealed).\n\nThe exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the United States regardless\nof whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors.\n","linknr":291,"url":"Exclusionary_rule","recorded":1362570662,"links":20,"instances":["law","law","common_law"],"pdf":["http://www.law.utah.edu/_personfiles/57/HIGHLIGHTS/C1993utahlr751.pdf","http://tiafp.org/restricted/TheForensicDigestVol2Issue1.pdf","http://tiafp.org/restricted/TheForensicDigestVol2Issue1.pdf"],"categories":["Evidence law","Searches and seizures","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["History of the rule","Limitations of the rule","Criticism","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["evidence","law"],["mistrial","law"],["civil_law","common_law"]],"members":["mistrial","evidence","civil_law"],"related":["United_States","United_States_constitutional_law","Evidence_(law)","Defendant","Constitutional_right","Admissible_evidence","Criminal_prosecution","Court","Prophylactic_rule","Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Legal_remedy","Prosecution","Police","United_States_Bill_of_Rights","Self-incrimination","Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Right_to_counsel","Legal_technicality","Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree","Mistrial_(law)","American_Revolution","William_Murray,_1st_Earl_of_Mansfield","Common_law","Replevin","U.S._Bill_of_Rights","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","English_law","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","General_warrant","Writs_of_assistance","Iowa_Supreme_Court","Prohibition","Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Volstead_Act","Supreme_Court_of_California","U.S._state","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Due_process","Civil_law_(common_law)","Grand_jury","Parole","Antonin_Scalia","Inevitable_discovery","Good-faith_exception","Corporate_personhood","Florida_v._Jimeno","Benjamin_Cardozo","New_York_Court_of_Appeals","Harvard_University_Press","Dallin_H._Oaks","Ronald_Reagan","Good_faith","PDF","United_States_Congress","Restitution","Police_misconduct"]}
