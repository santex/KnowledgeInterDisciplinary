      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n'Divorce' (or the 'dissolution of marriage') is the termination of a marital\nunion, the canceling of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage and\nthe dissolving of the bonds of matrimony between a married couple. Divorce is\nunlike annulment which declares the marriage null and void. Divorce laws vary\nconsiderably around the world, but in most countries it requires the sanction\nof a court or other authority in a legal process. The legal process of divorce\nmay also involve issues of alimony (spousal support), child custody, child\nsupport, distribution of property, and division of debt. In most countries\nmonogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former partner to marry\nanother; where polygyny is legal but polyandry is not, divorce allows the woman\nto marry a new husband.\n\nDivorce can be a stressful experience affecting finances, living arrangements,\nhousehold jobs, schedules and more. If the family includes children, they may be\ndeeply affected.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/divorce.html NIH]</ref>\n\nThe only countries which do not allow divorce are the Philippines (though\nMuslims have the right to divorce) and the Vatican City, an ecclesiastical\nstate, which has no procedure for divorce. Countries that have relatively\nrecently allowed divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Spain (1981),\nIreland (1996) and Malta (2011).\n\n\"Divorcing one's parents\" is a term sometimes used to refer to emancipation\nof minors.\n",
