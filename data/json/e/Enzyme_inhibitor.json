{"cursor":"55268","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n protease in a complex with the protease inhibitor ritonavir. The structure of\n the protease is shown by the red, blue and yellow ribbons. The inhibitor is\n shown as the smaller ball-and-stick structure near the center. Created from PDB\n [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1HXW 1HXW].]] An 'enzyme\n inhibitor' is a molecule which binds to enzymes and decreases their activity.\n Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic\n imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. They are also used as herbicides\n and pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; [[enzyme\n activator]]s bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while\n enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic\n cycle of the enzyme.\n\nThe binding of an inhibitor can stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's\nactive site and/or hinder the enzyme from catalyzing its reaction. Inhibitor\nbinding is either reversible or irreversible. Irreversible inhibitors usually\nreact with the enzyme and change it chemically (e.g. via covalent bond\nformation). These inhibitors modify key amino acid residues needed for enzymatic\nactivity. In contrast, reversible inhibitors bind non-covalently and different\ntypes of inhibition are produced depending on whether these inhibitors bind to\nthe enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both.\n\nMany drug molecules are enzyme inhibitors, so their discovery and improvement is\nan active area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme\ninhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other\nproteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the\nconcentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency\nensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.\n\nEnzyme inhibitors also occur naturally and are involved in the regulation of\nmetabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by\ndownstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line\nwhen products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis\nin a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind\nto and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be\ndamaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of\nthis is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the\ntightest known proteinâprotein interactions. Natural enzyme\ninhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as\nways of killing prey.\n","linknr":913,"url":"Enzyme_inhibitor","recorded":1362504889,"links":64,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","molecular","pharmacology","tests","biochemistry","biology","biochemistry","legume"],"pdf":["http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/36518/InTech-Alternative_perspectives_of_enzyme_kinetic_modeling.pdf"],"categories":["Medicinal
