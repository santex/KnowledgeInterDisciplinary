It is usually used in molecular\nbiology as a way of introducing some substance into a cell, such as loading it\nwith a molecular probe, a drug that can change the cell's function, or a piece\nof coding DNA.\n\nElectroporation is a dynamic phenomenon that depends on the local transmembrane\nvoltage at each point on the cell membrane. It is generally accepted that for a\ngiven pulse duration and shape, a specific transmembrane voltage threshold\nexists for the manifestation of the electroporation phenomenon (from 0.5 V\nto 1 V). This leads to the definition of an electric field magnitude\nthreshold for electroporation (E th ). That is, only the cells within\nareas where Eâ§E th are electroporated. If a second threshold\n(E ir ) is reached or surpassed, electroporation will compromise the\nviability of the cells, i.e., irreversible electroporation. {{cite web |url=\nhttp://www.freshpatents.com/Gels-with-predetermined-conductivity-used-in-\nelectroporation-of-tissue-dt20080904ptan20080214986.php|title=Gels with\npredetermined conductivity used in electroporation of tissue USPTO Application\n#: 20080214986 - Class: 604 21 (USPTO) |author=Antoni Ivorra, Boris\nRubinsky}}\n\nIn molecular biology, the process of electroporation is often used for the\n[[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] of bacteria, yeast, and plant\nprotoplasts. In addition to the lipid membranes, bacteria also have cell walls\nwhich are different from the lipid membranes and are made of peptidoglycan and\nits derivatives. However, the walls are naturally porous and only act as stiff\nshells that protect bacteria from severe environmental impacts. If bacteria and\nplasmids are mixed together, the plasmids can be transferred into the cell after\nelectroporation. Several hundred volts across a distance of several millimeters\nare typically used in this process. Afterwards, the cells have to be handled\ncarefully until they have had a chance to divide producing new cells that\ncontain reproduced plasmids. This process is approximately ten times as\neffective as chemical transformation.\n\nThis procedure is also highly efficient for the introduction of foreign genes in\ntissue culture cells, especially mammalian cells. For example, it is used in the\nprocess of producing knockout mice, as well as in tumor treatment, gene therapy,\nand cell-based therapy. The process of introducing foreign DNAs into eukaryotic\ncells is known as transfection.\n","linknr":359,"url":"Electroporation","recorded":1362480575,"links":31,"instances":["biology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Molecular biology","Gene delivery"],"headings":["Laboratory practice","Electroporators","Medical applications","Physical mechanism","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Electroporation_Diagram.png/230px-Electroporation_Diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/EberhardNeumann.jpg/220px-EberhardNeumann.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Electroporation_Cuvettes.jpg/230px-Electroporation_Cuvettes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Pore_schematic.svg/250px-Pore_schematic.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["suspension","chemistry"]],"members":["cell","suspension"],"related":["Cuvette","Electrical_conductivity","Cell_membrane","Electrical_field","Molecular_biology","Electrochemotherapy","DNA","Bacterium","Yeast","Plant","Protoplast","Cell_wall","Peptidoglycan","Plasmid","Cell_(biology)","Volt","Gene","Mammal","Knockout_mice","Transfection","Aluminium","Electrodes","Litre","Suspension_(chemistry)","Pipette","Electrode","Plasmid","Eppendorf_tube","Temperature","Antibiotic","Agar","Salt","Electric_arc","Output_impedance","Input_impedance","Salt","Electrolysis","Pipectrode","Voltage","Electrochemotherapy","Gene_electrotransfer","DNA","Lipid_bilayer","Dielectric_breakdown","Capacitor"]}
