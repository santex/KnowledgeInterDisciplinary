{"cursor":"32178","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'electromagnetic spectrum' is the range of all possible frequencies of\nelectromagnetic radiation. The \"electromagnetic spectrum\" of an\nobject has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution\nof electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for\nmodern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short-wavelength (high-\nfrequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down\nto a fraction of the size of an atom. The limit for long wavelengths is the size\nof the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is\nin the vicinity of the Planck length, although in principle the\nspectrum is infinite and continuous.\n\nMost parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic\nand other probing interactions, as ways to study and characterize matter. In addition, radiation from various parts of the\nspectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing (see\nelectromagnetic radiation for more applications).\n\n lecture slides {|
