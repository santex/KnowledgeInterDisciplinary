The entire system\nconveys burnt gases from the engine and includes one or more 'exhaust pipes'.\nDepending on the overall system design, the exhaust gas may flow through one or\nmore of: *Cylinder head and exhaust manifold *A turbocharger to increase engine\npower. *A catalytic converter to reduce air pollution. *A muffler (North\nAmerica) / silencer (Europe), to reduce noise.\n",
