For a\ntenant, rent is an expense. For students or parents, tuition is an expense.\nBuying food, clothing, furniture or an automobile is often referred to as an\nexpense. An expense is a cost that is \"paid\" or \"remitted\", usually in exchange\nfor something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is\n\"expensive\". Something that seems to cost little is \"inexpensive\". \"Expenses of\nthe table\" are expenses of dining, refreshments, a feast, etc.\n\nIn accounting, 'expense' has a very specific meaning. It is an outflow of cash\nor other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company.\nThis outflow of cash is generally one side of a trade for products or services\nthat have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the\nseller. Technically, an expense is an event in which an asset is used up or a\nliability is incurred. In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce\nowners' equity. The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as\n:...decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of\n:outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in\n:decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity\n:participants.
