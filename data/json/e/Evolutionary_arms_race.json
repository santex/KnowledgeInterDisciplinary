{"cursor":"7053","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In evolutionary biology, an 'evolutionary arms race' is an evolutionary struggle\nbetween competing sets of co-evolving genes that develop adaptations and counter-\nadaptations against each other, resembling an arms race, which are also examples\nof positive feedback. Dawkins, R. 1996. [[The Blind\nWatchmaker]] New York: W. W. Norton. Note: This book was also published by\nPenguin in 1991. While the text is identical, page numbers differ The co-\nevolving gene sets may be in different species, as in an evolutionary arms race\nbetween a predator species and its prey (Vermeij, 1987), or a parasite and its\nhost. Alternatively, the arms race may be between members of the same species,\nas in the manipulation/sales resistance model of communication (Dawkins & Krebs,\n1979) or as in runaway evolution or Red Queen effects. One example of an\nevolutionary arms race is in sexual conflict between the sexes. Thierry\nLodÃ© Thierry LodÃ© \"La guerre des sexes chez les animaux\" Eds Odile Jacob,\nParis ISBN 2-7381-1901-8; emphasized the role of such antagonist\ninteractions in evolution leading to character displacements and antagonist\ncoevolution. The escalation hypothesis put forward by Geerat Vermeij speaks of\nmore general conflicts and was originally based on his work with marine\ngastropod fossils.\n\nCo-evolution itself is not necessarily an arms race. For example, mutualism may\ndrive co-operative adaptations in a pair of species. This is the case with\ncertain flowers' ultra-violet color patterns, whose function is to guide bees to\nthe center of the flower and promote pollination. Co-evolution is also\ninterspecific by definition; it excludes intraspecific (within species) arms\nraces such as sexual conflict.\n\nEvolutionary arms races can even be displayed between humans and micro-\norganisms, where medical researchers make antibiotics, and micro-organisms\nevolve into new strains which are more resistant.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Evolutionary_arms_race","recorded":1362506177,"links":18,"instances":["biology","ecology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology|Arms race","Mating|Arms race","Technological races"],"headings":["Symmetrical versus asymmetrical arms races","Host-parasite dynamic","Examples","Introduced species","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bufo_marinus_1_%281%29.jpg/200px-Bufo_marinus_1_%281%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adaptation","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["indigenous","ecology"],["host","biology"]],"members":["mutualism","indigenous","adaptation","host"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Evolution","Co-evolution","Gene","Adaptation_(biology)","Arms_race","Positive_feedback","Species","Predator","Prey","Parasitism","Runaway_evolution","Red_Queen's_Hypothesis","Sexual_conflict","Thierry_Lodé","Thierry_Lodé","Character_displacement","Escalation_hypothesis","Geerat_Vermeij","Gastropod","Mutualism_(biology)","Flowers","Ultra-violet","Bee","Pollination","Interspecific_interaction","Sexual_conflict","Host-parasite_coevolution","Red_Queen's_hypothesis","Leigh_Van_Valen","R_gene","Gene-for-gene_relationship","Bat","Moth","Extinction","Australia","Hawaiian_Islands","Invasive_species","Cane_toad","Rabbits_in_Australia","Bufotenine","Indigenous_(ecology)","Endangered","Extinct","Dodo","Antipredator_adaptation","Parent–offspring_conflict","Parasite","Host_(biology)","Richard_Dawkins","John_Krebs","Geerat_Vermeij","Leigh_Van_Valen"]}
