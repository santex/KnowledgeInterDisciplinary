{"cursor":"19682","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Electrostatics' is the branch of physics that deals with the phenomena and\nproperties of stationary or slow-moving (without acceleration) electric charges.\n\nSince classical antiquity, it has been known that some materials such as amber\nattract lightweight particles after rubbing. The Greek word for amber, {{lang|grc-\nLatn|electron}}, was the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic\nphenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert on each other. Such\nforces are described by Coulomb's law. Even though electrostatically induced\nforces seem to be rather weak, the electrostatic force between e.g. an electron\nand a proton, that together make up a hydrogen atom, is about 40 orders of\nmagnitude stronger than the gravitational force acting between them.\n\nElectrostatic phenomena include many examples, some as simple as the attraction\nof the plastic wrap to your hand after you remove it from a package, to the\napparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, to damage of electronic\ncomponents during manufacturing, to the operation of photocopiers.\nElectrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the surface of objects due to\ncontact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two\nsurfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only\nnoticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical\nflow. This is because the charges that transfer to or from the highly resistive\nsurface are more or less trapped there for a long enough time for their effects\nto be observed. These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed\noff to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar\nphenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built\nup in the body from contact with nonconductive surfaces.\n","linknr":387,"url":"electrostatic","recorded":1362544987,"links":68,"instances":["electricity","unit","electricity","material","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.zeusinc.com/pdf/Zeus_Static.pdf","http://blazelabs.com/inversecubelaw.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Electrostatics|*"],"headings":["Fundamental concepts","Electrostatic approximation","Electrostatic energy","Triboelectric series","Electrostatic generators","Charge neutralization","Charge induction","'Static' electricity","Electrostatic induction in commercial applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/190px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Paper_shavings_attracted_by_charged_cd.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/0/1105dc5e3c5a368c1afd2c9721017a8c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/c/b0ced63b749ae46dfdc457cbbdd7e3bf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/3/cb32074493711c49d5165531eccba591.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/1/c81829086fb0953e7080deb4687c3a93.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/f/5aff4d9ef93668003e36aacb82a1c55d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/c/5/cc59c22c0423cd8bf87d43f289dcc7cb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/e/b7e13be20f10882c75bd1402f4611b62.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/e/31ee6c18d199b1bc7895ce2a122bdace.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/b/1cb3e2754d42025598422b0b51e83ad0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/b/57b8c44c850a990d1d55c6e6d539e112.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/7/1/6717f9575c3b32b7d901c8f61da1eb12.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/e/e0ee8455901a1e861f5ddc4cd0a8e9ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/f/06ff69a020856243c152a91923da773f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/5/8756d3053a903b8971297ea48c9ede5a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/6/bf68e63916520483a22f5e399c09d643.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Electrostatic_induction.svg/440px-Electrostatic_induction.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/3/3a3ea00cfc35332cedf6e5e9a32e94da.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/6/85670077e6533f44cb9dc913ff1b1c72.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/1/2/91267c59c8b159d2c0a9393a77341a1d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Lightning_over_Oradea_Romania_3.jpg/220px-Lightning_over_Oradea_Romania_3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resistance","electricity"],["neutralization","chemistry"],["newton","units"],["newton","unit"],["work","physics"],["insulator","electricity"],["conductor","material"]],"members":["insulator","newton","resistance","conductor","work","neutralization"],"related":["Physics","Electric_charge","Classical_antiquity","Amber","Triboelectric_effect","Greek_language","Force","Coulomb's_law","Electron","Proton","Hydrogen","Atom","Order_of_magnitude","Gravitation","Surface","Charge_exchange","Resistance_(electricity)","Neutralization_(chemistry)","Electrostatic_discharge","Equation","Coulomb's_law","Point_charge","Vacuum_permittivity","Ampere","Second","Coulomb","Newton_(units)","Farad","Electric_field","Volt","Newton_(unit)","Coulomb","Test_charge","Charge_density","Triple_integral","Gauss'_law","Electric_charge","Divergence","Poisson's_equation","Laplace's_equation","Irrotational","Faraday's_law_of_induction","Magnetostatics","Electrostatic_induction","Electrostatic_potential","Irrotational","Gradient","Electrostatic_potential","Voltage","Work_(physics)","Triboelectric_effect","Thales_of_Miletus","Surface_charge","Contact_electrification","Triboelectric_effect","Insulator_(electricity)","Rubber","Plastic","Glass","Pith","Conductor_(material)","Electrostatic_generator","Electric_current","Corona_discharge","MOSFET","Electrostatic_discharge","Oradea","Romania","Michael_Faraday","Xerography","Air_filter","Antistatic_devices","RC_circuit","Dielectric_constant","Electromagnetism","Permittivity","Relative_permittivity","Ionic_bond","Electronegativity","Electrostatic_discharge","Electrostatic_separator","Electrostatic_voltmeter","William_Cecil_Dampier","William_Thomson_Kelvin","Alexander_MacAulay","Quaternions"]}
