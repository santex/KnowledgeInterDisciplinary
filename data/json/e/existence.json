In common usage, it is the\nworld one is aware or conscious of through one's senses, and that persists\nindependently in one's absence. Other definitions describe it as everything that\n'is', or more simply, everything. Some define it to be everything that most\npeople believe in.<ref></ref> Aristotle relates the concept to causality.\n\nOntology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, existence or\nreality in general, as well as of the basic categories of being and their\nrelations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy\nknown as metaphysics, ontology deals with questions concerning what entities\nexist or can be said to exist (for instance: \"Does [[UDFj-39546284]] exist?\"),\nand how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and\nsubdivided according to similarities and differences. A lively debate continues\nabout the existence of God.\n\nEpistemology studies criteria of truth, defining \"primary truths\" inherently\naccepted in the investigation of knowledge. The first is existence. It is\ninherent in every analysis. Its self-evident, a priori nature cannot be\nconsistently doubted, since a person objecting to existence according to some\nstandard of proof must implicitly accept the standard's existence as a\npremise.<ref name=\"dolhenty\"></ref>\n\nMaterialism holds that the only thing that exists is matter, that all things are\ncomposed of material, and all phenomena (including consciousness) are the result\nof material interactions.\n\nLife is a characteristic that distinguishes objects that have self-sustaining\nbiological processes from those that do not<ref name=Koshland ></ref><ref\nname=AHDLife>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th\nedition, published by Houghton Mifflin Company, via\n[http://www.answers.com/topic/life Answers.com]: *\"The property or quality that\ndistinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter,\nmanifested in functions such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and response\nto stimuli or adaptation to the environment originating from within the\norganism.\" *\"The characteristic state or condition of a living organism.\"</ref>\n– either because such functions have ceased (death), or else because they lack\nsuch functions and are classified as\n\"\".<ref>[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=inanimate Definition of\ninanimate.] WordNet Search by Princeton University.</ref>\n",
