The entropy of an isolated\nsystem never decreases, because isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards\nthermodynamic equilibrium, which is the state of maximum entropy.\n\nEntropy is a thermodynamic quantity that helps to account for the flow of energy\nthrough a thermodynamic process. Entropy was originally defined for a\nthermodynamically reversible process as\n\n:<math>\\Delta S = \\int \\frac {dQ_{rev}}T </math>\n\nwhere the entropy () is found from the uniform thermodynamic temperature () of a\nclosed system divided into an incremental reversible transfer of heat into that\nsystem (). The above definition is sometimes called the macroscopic definition\nof entropy because it can be used without regard to any microscopic picture of\nthe contents of a system. In thermodynamics, entropy has been found to be more\ngenerally useful and it has several other formulations. Entropy was discovered\nwhen it was noticed to be a quantity that behaves as a function of state.\nEntropy is an extensive property, but it is often given as an intensive property\nof specific entropy as entropy per unit mass or entropy per mole.\n\nIn the modern microscopic interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics,\nentropy is the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact\nphysical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. The role of\nthermodynamic entropy in various thermodynamic processes can thus be understood\nby understanding how and why that information changes as the system evolves from\nits initial condition. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the\ndisorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it\n(which on some views of probability, amounts to the same thing as randomness).\nThe second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate\nof statistical mechanics via the modern definition of entropy.\n","title":"entropy","headings":["History","Definitions and descriptions","Second law of thermodynamics","Applications","Entropy change formulas for simple processes","Approaches to understanding entropy","Interdisciplinary applications of entropy","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["8: Thermodynamic_system","6: Heat","6: Isolated_system","5: Second_law_of_thermodynamics","4: Energy","3: Statistical_mechanics","3: First_law_of_thermodynamics","3: Rudolf_Clausius","3: Statistical_thermodynamics","3: Classical_thermodynamics","3: Absolute_zero","3: Density_matrix","3: Equilibrium_state","3: Information_theory","2: Thermodynamic_temperature","2: Function_of_state","2: Caloric_theory","2: Ludwig_Boltzmann","2: Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","2: Ideal_gas","2: Thermodynamics","2: Functions_of_state","2: Temperature","2: Carnot_cycle","2: Thermodynamic_equilibrium","2: Absolute_temperature","2: State_function","2: Boltzmann_constant","2: Perpetual_motion","2: Arrow_of_time","2: Standard_molar_entropy","2: Joule","2: Kelvin","2: Heat_capacity","2: Entropy_of_mixing","2: Intensive_and_extensive_properties","2: Phase_transition","2: Quantum_mechanics","1: Closed_system","1: Intensive_and_extensive_properties#Extensive_properties","1: Intensive_and_extensive_properties#Intensive_properties","1: Fundamental_postulate_of_statistical_mechanics","1: Lazare_Carnot","1: Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot","1: Motive_power","1: Water_wheel","1: Count_Rumford","1: Engine_cycle","1: James_Joule","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: Friction","1: Dissipation","1: Working_body","1: Chemical_species","1: Thermodynamic_state","1: Isaac_Newton","1: James_Clerk_Maxwell","1: Erwin_Schrödinger","1: Carathéodory","1: Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics","1: Thermodynamic_properties","1: Line_integral","1: Reversible_process","1: Lord_Kelvin","1: James_Prescott_Joule","1: Clausius_theorem","1: Path_independent","1: Third_Law_of_Thermodynamics","1: Boltzmann's_constant","1: Macrostate","1: Logarithmic_scale","1: Microcanonical_ensemble","1: Markov_process","1: Reversible_dynamics","1: Detailed_balance","1: Probability","1: Combination","1: Physics","1: Chemistry","1: Time_reversal","1: Science","1: Oxford_University_Press","1: International_System_of_Units","1: Arieh_Ben-Naim","1: Adiabatic_cooling","1: Adiabatic_work","1: Chemical_reaction","1: Air_conditioner","1: Fundamental_thermodynamic_relation","1: Maxwell_relations","1: Relations_between_heat_capacities","1: Chemical_thermodynamics","1: Kilogram","1: Gibbs_free_energy","1: Chemical_engineering","1: Mass","1: Shaft_work","1: Extensive_quantity","1: Entropy_production","1: Chemical_potential","1: Electric_potential","1: Ideal_gas_constant","1: Melting","1: Entropy_of_fusion","1: Vaporization","1: Entropy_of_vaporization","1: Energy_dispersal","1: Thermal_energy","1: Randomness","1: Chaos_theory","1: Channel_capacity","1: Peter_Atkins","1: Heat_death_of_the_Universe","1: Adiabatic_accessibility","1: Elliott_H._Lieb","1: Jakob_Yngvason","1: Constantin_Carathéodory","1: Mathematische_Annalen","1: Quantum_statistical_mechanics","1: John_von_Neumann","1: Von_Neumann_entropy","1: Correspondence_principle","1: Classical_limit","1: Wave_function_collapse","1: Maximum_entropy_thermodynamics","1: Claude_Shannon","1: Psychodynamics","1: Thermoeconomics","1: Ecological_economics","1: Evolution","1: Calorie","1: Joules","1: Gibbs_entropy","1: Boltzmann_entropy","1: Tsallis_entropy","1: Residual_entropy","1: Chemical_substance","1: Loop_entropy","1: Conformational_entropy","1: Polymer","1: Globular_protein","1: Entropic_force","1: Free_entropy","1: Entropic_explosion","1: Sackur-Tetrode_entropy","1: Heat_death_of_the_universe","1: Sir_Roger_Penrose","1: Gravity","1: Black_hole","1: Black_hole_entropy","1: Jacob_Bekenstein","1: Stephen_Hawking","1: Autocatalytic_reactions_and_order_creation","1: Brownian_ratchet","1: Clausius–Duhem_inequality","1: Configuration_entropy","1: Departure_function","1: Enthalpy","1: Entropy_and_life","1: Entropy_rate","1: Geometrical_frustration","1: Laws_of_thermodynamics","1: Multiplicity_function","1: Stirling's_formula","1: Thermodynamic_databases_for_pure_substances","1: Thermodynamic_potential"]}
