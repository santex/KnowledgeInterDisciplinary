It was commonly associated with\nqualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world. Due to the hero cults,\nand chthonic underworld deities, the elemental of earth is also associated with\nthe sensual aspects of both life and death in later occultism.\n\nEmpedocles of Acragas proposed four [[arche|archai]] by which to understand the\ncosmos: [[Fire (classical element)|fire]],[[Air (classical element)|air]],\n[[Water (classical element)|water]], and earth. Plato believed the elements were\ngeometric forms (the platonic solids) and he assigned the cube to the element of\nearth in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]. Plato, Timaeus, chap.\n22â23; Gregory Vlastos, Plato's Universe, pp. 66â82. Aristotle, (384â322\nBCE), believed earth was the heaviest element, and his theory of [[Aristotelian\nphysics#Natural place|natural place]] suggested that any earthâladen substances,\nwould fall quickly, straight down, toward the center of the cosmos. G. E. R.\nLloyd, Aristotle, chapters 7â8.\n\nIn Classical Greek and Roman myth, various goddesses represented the Earth,\nseasons, crops and fertility, including Demeter and Persephone; Ceres; the Horae\n(goddesses of the seasons), and Proserpina; and Hades (Pluto) who ruled the\nsouls of dead in the Underworld.\n\nIn ancient Greek medicine, each of the four humours became associated with an\nelement. Black bile was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold\nand dry. Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and\nmedieval medicine included the season of fall, since it increased the qualities\nof cold and aridity; the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the\nblack bile humour); the feminine; and the southern point of the compass.\n\n\n\nIn alchemy, earth was believed to be primarily cold, and secondarily dry, (as\nper Aristotle). Beyond those classical attributes, the chemical substance salt,\nwas associated with earth and its alchemical symbol was a downward-pointing\ntriangle, bisected by a horizontal line.\n\nIndian tradition\n\n'Prithvi' (Sanskrit: {{IAST|pá¹thvÄ«}}, also {{IAST|pá¹thivÄ«}}) is the Hindu earth\nand mother goddess. According to one such tradition, she is the personification\nof the Earth itself; according to another, its actual mother, being\n[[Prithvi|Prithvi Tattwa]], the essence of the element earth.\n\nAs [[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]], or \"Mother Earth\", she contrasts with [[Dyaus\nPita]], \"father sky\". In the Rigveda, earth and sky are frequently addressed as\na duality, often indicated by the idea of two complementary \"half-shells.\" In\naddition, the element Earth is associated with Budha or Mercury who represents\ncommunication, business, mathematics and other practical matters.\n\nAstrological personalities People born under the astrological signs of Taurus,\nVirgo and Capricorn are thought to have dominant earth personalities. Earth\npersonalities tend to be calm, practical, hard-working, brave, smart, wise,\nstable and patient; however, they can also be stubborn, possessive, nearsighted\nand very harsh.\n\nCeremonial magic Earth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated\ninto the Golden Dawn system despite being considered obsolete by modern science.\nZelator (1=10) is the elemental grade attributed to earth; this grade is also\nattributed to the Qabalistic sphere Malkuth. Israel Regardie, The Golden\nDawn, pp. 154-65. The elemental weapon of earth is the\nPentacle. Regardie, Golden Dawn, p.322; Kraig, Modern Magick, pp. 149-\n53. Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The\narchangel of earth is Uriel, the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king\nis Ghob, and the earth elementals (following Paracelsus) are called\ngnomes. Regardie, Golden Dawn, p. 80. Earth is considered to be\npassive; it is represented by the symbol for Taurus, and it is referred to the\nlower left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the\nPentagram. Regardie, Golden Dawn, pp. 280-286; Kraig, Modern Magick, pp. 206-\n209. Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult\ncommunity.\n\nIt is sometimes represented by its Tattva or by a downward pointing triangle\nwith a horizontal line through it.\n\nModern witchcraft Earth is one of the five elements that appear in most Wiccan\nand Pagan traditions. Wicca in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn\nsystem of magic, and Aleister Crowley's mysticism which was in turn inspired by\nthe Golden Dawn. Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, witchcraft for tomorrow, p.\n17. Common Wiccan attributions include:\n* Cardinal direction: North\n* Season: Autumn\n* Time of life: Old age\n* Time of day: Twilight\n* Regent Planet: Saturn\n* Elemental being: Gnome\n* Colors: Brown and green\n* Magical tools: Pentacle and staff\n* Tarot reading: Coins in the Minor Arcana\n* Altar tool: Pentacle\n* Feminine energy\n* Other: Correspondences include strength, stability and abundance.\n\nIn rituals earth is represented by burying objects in the ground, carving images\nout of wood or stone, herbalism or using animal fur and bones.\n\nThe manifestations of the earth element are found in plants, trees, mountains,\nforests, caves and gardens. The bear, boar, bull, sow and stag are also thought\nto personify the element as are all burrowing animals, such as the mole or\nrabbit. Other legendary and mythical creatures of earth include the Faun,\nGoblin, Satyr and Sylvan.\n\nOther traditions In East Asia, metal is sometimes seen as the equivalent of\nearth and is represented by the White Tiger (Chinese constellation), known as ç½è\n(BÃ¡i HÇ) in Chinese, Byakko in Japanese, Báº¡ch Há» in Vietnamese and Baekho (ë°±í¸,\nHanja:ç½è) in Korean. Earth is represented in the Aztec religion by a house; to\nthe Hindus, a lotus; to the Scythians, a plough; to the Greeks, a wheel; and in\nChristian iconography by a bull.\n\nSee also\n* Mother goddess\n* Mother nature\n* Gaia (mythology)\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n* [http://www.friesian.com/elements.htm Different versions of the\n  classical elements]\n","linknr":295,"url":"Earth_(classical_element)","recorded":1362372198,"links":21,"instances":["paranormal","chinese_constellation","astrology","animal","roman_mythology","mythology","mythology","astrology","archangel","geology","astrology","classical_element"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical elements","Numerology","Esoteric cosmology","History of astrology","Technical factors of astrology","Obsolete scientific theories"],"headings":["European tradition","Indian tradition","Astrological personalities","Ceremonial magic","Modern witchcraft","Other traditions","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/La_Terre_Benoit_Massou_original.jpg/150px-La_Terre_Benoit_Massou_original.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Alchemy_earth_symbol.svg/100px-Alchemy_earth_symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ceres","roman_mythology"],["pluto","mythology"],["taurus","astrology"],["virgo","astrology"],["capricorn","astrology"],["uriel","archangel"],["taurus","astrology"],["magic","paranormal"],["rock","geology"],["mole","animal"],["metal","classical_element"],["white_tiger","chinese_constellation"],["gaia","mythology"]],"members":["magic","white_tiger","virgo","mole","ceres","pluto","gaia","capricorn","uriel","rock","taurus","metal"],"related":["Classical_element","Greek_philosophy","Hero_cult","Chthonic","Occultism","Empedocles","Cosmos","Plato","Platonic_solid","Cube","Gregory_Vlastos","Aristotle","G._E._R._Lloyd","Greek_mythology","Roman_mythology","Demeter","Persephone","Ceres_(Roman_mythology)","Horae","Proserpina","Hades","Pluto_(mythology)","Underworld","Medicine_in_ancient_Greece","Four_humours","Melancholia","Medieval_medicine","Fall","Femininity","Alchemy","Salt","Alchemical_symbol","Sanskrit","Hinduism","Mother_goddess","Earth","Mother","Mother_Nature","Sky_Father","Rigveda","Dualism","Budha","Astrological_sign","Taurus_(astrology)","Virgo_(astrology)","Capricorn_(astrology)","Magical_weapon","Pentacle","Uriel_(archangel)","Elemental","Paracelsus","Gnome","Taurus_(astrology)","Tattva","Wicca","Pagan","Wicca","Magic_(paranormal)","Aleister_Crowley","Cardinal_directions","Autumn","Saturn","Gnome","Pentacle","Tarot_reading","Minor_Arcana","As_Above,_So_Below","Wood","Rock_(geology)","Herbalism","Animal_fur","Bone","Plant","Tree","Mountain","Forest","Cave","Garden","Bear","Boar","Bull","Pig","Stag","Burrow","Mole_(animal)","Rabbit","Faun","Goblin","Satyr","Sylvan","East_Asia","Metal_(classical_element)","White_Tiger_(Chinese_constellation)","Chinese_language","Japanese_language","Vietnamese_language","Hanja","Korean_language","Aztec","Hindu","Scythians","Culture_of_Greece","Christian","Iconography","Mother_goddess","Mother_nature","Gaia_(mythology)"]}
