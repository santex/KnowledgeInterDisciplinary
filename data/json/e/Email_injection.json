{"cursor":"1879","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Email injection' is a security vulnerability that can occur in Internet\napplications that are used to send email messages. It is the email equivalent of\nHTTP Header Injection. Like SQL injection attacks, this vulnerability is one of\na general class of vulnerabilities that occur when one programming language is\nembedded within another.\n\nWhen a form is added to a Web page that submits data to a Web application, a\nmalicious user may exploit the MIME format to append additional information to\nthe message being sent, such as a new list of recipients or a completely\ndifferent message body. Because the MIME format uses a carriage return to\ndelimit the information in a message, and only the raw message determines its\neventual destination, adding carriage returns to submitted form data can allow a\nsimple guestbook to be used to send thousands of messages at once. A malicious\nspammer could use this tactic to send large numbers of messages anonymously.\n\nMore information on this topic, including examples and ways to avoid the\nvulnerability, can be found at the [http://www.damonkohler.com/2008/12/email-\ninjection.html SecurePHP Wiki]. However, this vulnerability is not limited to\nPHP; it can potentially affect any application that sends email messages based\non input from arbitrary users.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Email_injection","recorded":1362891907,"links":17,"instances":["electronic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Injection exploits","Computer security exploits"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Crystal_Clear_app_network.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_app_network.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spam","electronic"]],"members":["spam"],"related":["Security_vulnerability","Internet","Application_software","Email","HTTP_Header_Injection","SQL_injection","Programming_language","World_Wide_Web","MIME","Carriage_return","Spam_(electronic)","PHP"]}
