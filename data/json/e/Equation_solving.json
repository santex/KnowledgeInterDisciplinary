These expressions contain one or more\n'unknowns', which are free variables for which values are sought that cause the\ncondition to be fulfilled. To be precise, what is sought are often not\nnecessarily actual values, but, more in general, mathematical expressions. A\n'solution' of the equation is an assignment of expressions to the unknowns that\nsatisfies the equation; in other words, expressions such that, when they are\nsubstituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes an identity.\n\nFor example, the equation is solved for the unknown x by the solution , since\nsubstituting for x in the equation results in , a true statement. It is also\npossible to take the variable y to be the unknown, and then the equation is\nsolved by . Or x and y can both be treated as unknowns, and then there are many\nsolutions to the equation, some of which are â that is, and â and , and, in\ngeneral, for all possible values of a.\n\nDepending on the problem, the task may be to find one solution â any solution\nwill do â or all solutions. The set of all solutions is called the solution set.\nIt is also possible that the task is to find a solution, among possibly many,\nthat is best in some respect. Problems of that nature are called optimization\nproblems; solving an optimization problem is generally not referred to as\n\"equation solving\".\n\nA wording such as \"an equation 'in' x and y\", or \"solve 'for' x and y\", implies\nthat the unknowns are as indicated: in these cases x and y.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Equation_solving","recorded":1362482550,"links":18,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematics_and_physics","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Equations","Inverse functions"],"headings":["Overview","Solution sets","Methods of solution","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/2/6e27fa2c5e31778d422c4c910ab08505.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/b/92bb85806701120416349706eae1ebd9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/d/69d081aa2eda33e8a0e8de703baf2ab4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/8/54846df55201955d98c2d94ada809a7d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/d/9/7d90850a8c46c6235d55e1e6c0646ad6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/6/866e1ff73c490ce8c63ebcdebce109fe.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["equality","mathematics"],["substitution","logic"],["identity","mathematics"],["and","logic"],["singleton","mathematics"],["line","geometry"],["projection","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["vector","mathematics_and_physics"]],"members":["equality","function","substitution","matrix","singleton","identity","expression","projection","and","vector","line","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Number","Function_(mathematics)","Set_(mathematics)","Equation","Expression_(mathematics)","Equality_(mathematics)","Free_variable","Substitution_(logic)","Identity_(mathematics)","And_(logic)","Solution_set","Optimization_problem","Inverse_image","Domain_of_a_function","Singleton_(mathematics)","Solution_set","Integer","Real_number","Line_(geometry)","Vector_space","Hyperplane","Algorithm","Unsolvable_problem","Hilbert's_tenth_problem","Computer_algebra_system","Heuristic","Modular_arithmetic","Diophantine_equation","Brute-force_search","Exhaustive_search","Encryption","Problem_solving","Trial_and_error","Elementary_algebra","System_of_linear_equations","Linear_algebra","Polynomial","Quadratic_formula","Bring_radical","Rational_root_theorem","Quadratic_equation","Diophantine_equations","Integer","Rational_number","Rational_root_theorem","Projection_(mathematics)","Nth_root","Logarithm","Inverse_trigonometric_function","Lambert's_W_function","Factorization","Complex_number","Root-finding_algorithm","Newton–Raphson_method","Taylor_series","Matrix_(mathematics)","Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)","Real_number","Linear_algebra","Differential_equation","Numerical_mathematics","Calculus","Integral","Risch_algorithm","Simultaneous_equations","Equating_coefficients","Solving_the_geodesic_equations"]}
