The town is located 3&nbsp;km. from Gulpen and\n17&nbsp;km. from provincial capital Maastricht. Furthermore, it is characterised\nby its location in the hilly landscape of South Limburg. The village was first\nmentioned in 1193 in a document of the Sint-Pauluskapittel of Liège, Belgium.\n\nThe Eyserbosweg (the road ('weg') that leads from the village to the forest\n('bos')) is one of the hills to be climbed in the yearly professional cycle race\nAmstel Gold Race, first held in 1966. The organiser is not sure when the\nEyserbosweg was first involved in the race.\n\nIt was also the hill that featured in the Open Dutch Championship Bag Carrying\n('zakkendragen'), a race against the clock in which people had to carry a bag\nwith sand up the one kilometer long hill. The weight of the bag was 25 kg\n(women), 50 kg, 75 kg or 100 kg (men). That championship had its roots in a bet\nmade by a farmer who claimed in 1956 that his farm help would be able to carry a\n100 kg bag to the top.\n","title":"eys","headings":["Impressions"]},"micro-relation":["2: Gulpen-Wittem","1: Netherlands","1: Central_European_Time","1: Central_European_Summer_Time","1: Limburgish","1: The_Netherlands","1: Gulpen","1: Maastricht","1: Hill","1: South_Limburg","1: Liège"]}
