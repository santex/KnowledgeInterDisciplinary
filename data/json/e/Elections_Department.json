{"cursor":"2654","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Elections Department' is a department of the government of Singapore that\noversees the procedure for elections in Singapore, including parliamentary\nelections and presidential elections. It sees that elections are fairly carried\nout and has a supervisory role to safeguard against electoral fraud. It has the\npower to create constituencies and redistrict them, with the justification of\npreventing malapportionment.\n\nAlthough the President of Singapore has the authority to create group\nrepresentation constituencies of Singapore from several electoral wards, the\nElections Department is generally the government authority which advises the\nPresident on which constituencies are created, and which constituencies are\nredistricted.\n\nThe Elections Department is supposedly a neutral and impartial entity, but the\nopposition parties in the politics of Singapore question whether there are true,\nclear separation of powers between the current ruling party of Singapore, the\nPeople's Action Party (PAP), and the Elections Department.\n\nThe Elections Department is under the office of the Prime Minister of Singapore,\nand is able to draw polling districts and polling sites with pinpoint precision.\nOpposition leaders such as Chee Soon Juan of the Singapore Democratic Party\n(SDP) accuse the Elections Department of not being politically separate from the\nruling party. This, the opposition argues, leads to intentional carrying out of\ngerrymandering on behalf of the PAP, like in the cases of Cheng San GRC and\nEunos GRC. It is unlike an Electoral Commission in most other Commonwealth\ncountries which is clearly independent of the ruling government. The redrawing\nhas been mocked on a widespread basis, including satire websites such as\nTalkingCock.com. This criticism and mocking is thought to partially due to the\nelectoral boundaries being redrawn shortly before each election, often with the\ncreation of new single member constituencies, or the merging of single member\nconstituencies into group representation constituencies.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Elections_Department","recorded":1375085049,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Elections_Department,_Jan_06.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Elections_Department%2C_Jan_06.JPG/250px-Elections_Department%2C_Jan_06.JPG","/wiki/File:Elections_Department,_Jan_06.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Government_department","/wiki/Government_of_Singapore","/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore","/wiki/Parliamentary_elections_in_Singapore","/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore","/wiki/Electoral_fraud","/wiki/Redistricting","/wiki/Malapportionment","/wiki/President_of_Singapore","/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore","/wiki/Politics_of_Singapore","/wiki/Separation_of_powers","/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore","/wiki/Chee_Soon_Juan","/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Separation_of_powers","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/wiki/Election_management_body","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit&section=1","http://www.elections.gov.sg/","/wiki/Singapore","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flag_of_Singapore.svg/30px-Flag_of_Singapore.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Singapore-org-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Singapore-org-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Singapore-org-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Vote_icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Vote_icon.svg/30px-Vote_icon.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Asia-election-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Asia-election-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Asia-election-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&oldid=436926973","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Elections_in_Singapore","/wiki/Category:Organisations_of_the_Singapore_Government","/wiki/Category:Singapore_organisation_stubs","/wiki/Category:Asian_election_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elections+Department&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Elections+Department","/wiki/Elections_Department","/wiki/Talk:Elections_Department","#","/wiki/Elections_Department","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Elections_Department","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Elections_Department","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&oldid=436926973","/w/index.php?title=Elections_Department&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5354577","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Elections_Department&id=436926973","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Elections+Department","/w/i
