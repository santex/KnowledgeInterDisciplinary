{"cursor":"2980","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Equitable conversion' is a doctrine of the law of real property under which a\npurchaser of real property becomes the equitable owner of title to the property\nat the time he/she signs a contract binding him/her to purchase the land at a\nlater date. The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of\nconveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to\nthe payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is\nthen transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the\ncontract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will\nnevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land. Such\nissues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who\nwill bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction,\nbut is the general rule.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Equitable_conversion","recorded":1362684493,"links":11,"instances":["law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Property law","Equity (law)"],"headings":["Effect of death of a party","Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["will","law"]],"members":["will"],"related":["Law","Real_property","Equitable_title","Contract","Legal_title","Personal_property","Risk_of_loss","Will_(law)","Personal_property","U.S._state","New_York","Uniform_Vendor_and_Purchaser_Risk_Act","New_York_Statutes","Land_Sale_Contract"]}
