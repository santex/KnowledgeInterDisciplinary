It also includes how\nthese various agencies and institutions are linked to one another, how\ninformation flows between them, and the social relations within the system\n(including property rights and the structure of management). A related concept\nis the mode of production.\n\nAmong actual economic systems, distinctive methods of analysis have developed,\nsuch as socialist economics and Islamic economic jurisprudence. Today the\ndominant form of economic organization at the global level is based on\ncapitalist mixed economies. â¢ Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus\n(2004).
