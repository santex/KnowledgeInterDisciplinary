{"cursor":"2792","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'elementary reaction' is a chemical reaction in which one or more of the\nchemical species react directly to form products in a single reaction step and\nwith a single transition state.\n\nIn a unimolecular elementary reaction, a molecule A dissociates or isomerises to\nform the products(s)\n: \\mbox{A} \\rightarrow \\mbox{products.}\nAt constant temperature, the rate of such a reaction is proportional to the\nconcentration of the species A\n: \\frac{d[\\mbox{A}]}{dt}=-k[\\mbox{A}].\nIn a bimolecular elementary reaction, two atoms, molecules, ions or radicals, A\nand B, react together to form the product(s)\n: \\mbox{A + B} \\rightarrow \\mbox{products.}\nThe rate of such a reaction, at constant temperature, is proportional to the\nproduct of the concentrations of the species A and B\n: \\frac{d[\\mbox{A}]}{dt}=\\frac{d[\\mbox{B}]}{dt}=-\n:k[\\mbox{A}][\\mbox{B}].\nThe rate expression for an elementary bimolecular reaction is sometimes referred\nto as the Law of Mass Action as it was first proposed by Guldberg and Waage in\n1864. An example of this type of reaction is a cycloaddition reaction. This rate\nexpression can be derived from first principles by using collision theory for\nideal gases. For the case of dilute fluids equivalent results have been obtained\nfrom simple probabilistic arguments.
