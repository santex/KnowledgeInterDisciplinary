{"cursor":"58823","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Electronic voting' (also known as 'e-voting') is a term encompassing several\ndifferent types of voting, embracing both electronic means of casting a vote and\nelectronic means of counting votes.\n\nElectronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting\nsystems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording\nelectronic voting systems, or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots\nand votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet.\n\nIn general, two main types of e-Voting can be identified:\n* e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or\n  independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at\n  polling stations);\n* remote e-Voting where voting is performed within the voter's sole influence,\n  and is not physically supervised by representatives of governmental\n  authorities (e.g. voting from one's personal computer, mobile phone,\n  television via the internet (also called i-voting)).\n\nElectronic voting technology can speed the counting of ballots and can provide\nimproved accessibility for disabled voters. However, there has been contention,\nespecially in the United States, that electronic voting, especially DRE voting,\ncould facilitate electoral fraud.\n","linknr":705,"url":"E-voting","recorded":1362667691,"links":54,"instances":["organization","netherlands","united_states","2006_film"],"pdf":["http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/NBS_SP_500-30.pdf","http://www.vote.caltech.edu/events/2007/VendorWkshp/Backert-Handout.pdf","http://www.kidsvotingoh.org/insidefiles/activities/Voting%20Systems%20Handout-3copy.pdf","http://www.kidsvotingoh.org/insidefiles/activities/Voting%20Systems%20Handout-3copy.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04766t.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05956.pdf","http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf","http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf","http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/boe/documents/flyer_workshop_I_(02-19-09).pdf","http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/boe/documents/flyer_workshop_I_(02-19-09).pdf","http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/images/9/91/Es3b-en.pdf","http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/images/9/91/Es3b-en.pdf","http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/voting_systems/diebold_cert.pdf","http://www.minbzk.nl/contents/pages/82071/briefstemmachinses.pdf","http://electionarchive.org/ucvInfo/US/legislation/SummaryFlyer5036.pdf","http://elara.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/publications/2006/StefanWeber.diplom.pdf"],"categories":["Electronic
