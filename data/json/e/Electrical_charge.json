{"cursor":"19422","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of a positive and a negative point charge.]]\n\n\n\n'Electric charge' is a physical property of matter that causes it to experience\na force when near other electrically charged matter. There exist two types of\nelectric charges, called positive and negative. Positively charged substances\nare repelled from other positively charged substances, but attracted to\nnegatively charged substances; negatively charged substances are repelled from\nnegative and attracted to positive. An object will be negatively charged if it\nhas an excess of electrons, and otherwise be positively charged or uncharged.\nThe SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C), although in electrical\nengineering it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and in chemistry it\nis common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q is often used\nto denote a charge. The study of how charged substances interact is classical\nelectrodynamics, which is accurate insofar as quantum effects can be ignored.\n\nThe electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic\nparticles, which determines their electromagnetic interaction. Electrically\ncharged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields. The\ninteraction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source\nof the electromagnetic force, which is one of the four fundamental forces (See\nalso: magnetic field).\n\nTwentieth-century experiments demonstrated that electric charge is [[charge\nquantization|quantized]]; that is, it comes in multiples of individual small\nunits called the elementary charge, e, approximately equal to (except for\nparticles called quarks, which have charges that are multiples of âe). The\nproton has a charge of e, and the electron has a charge of âe. The study of\ncharged particles, and how their interactions are mediated by photons, is\nquantum electrodynamics.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Electrical_charge","recorded":1362581620,"links":101,"instances":["physics","geometry","scientist","scientist","astronomer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrostatics|*","Electricity","Physical
