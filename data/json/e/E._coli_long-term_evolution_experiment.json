{"cursor":"15185","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'E. colilong-term evolution experiment' is an ongoing study in experimental\nevolution led by Richard Lenski that has been tracking genetic changes in 12\ninitially identical populations of asexual [[Escherichia coli]] bacteria since\n24 February 1988. The populations reached the milestone\nof 50,000 generations .\n\nSince the experiment's inception, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide\narray of genetic changes; some evolutionary adaptations have occurred in all 12\npopulations, while others have only appeared in one or a few populations. One\nparticularly striking adaption was the evolution of a strain of E. coli that was\nable to use citric acid as a carbon source in an aerobic environment.\n","linknr":219,"url":"E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment","recorded":1362483427,"links":23,"instances":["biology","population_genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biology experiments","Molecular evolution","Evolutionary biology","Escherichia coli"],"headings":["Experimental approach","Results","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Lenski%27s_12_long-term_lines_of_E._coli_on_25_June_2008.jpg/300px-Lenski%27s_12_long-term_lines_of_E._coli_on_25_June_2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Lenski10.png/220px-Lenski10.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Lenski%27s_long-term_lines_of_E._coli_on_25_June_2008%2C_close-up_of_citrate_mutant.jpg/220px-Lenski%27s_long-term_lines_of_E._coli_on_25_June_2008%2C_close-up_of_citrate_mutant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["fitness","biology"]],"members":["fitness","fixation"],"related":["Experimental_evolution","Richard_Lenski","Adaptation","Citric_acid","Evolutionary_biology","Phenotypic","Genomic","Molecular_biology","Asexual_reproduction","Bacterial_conjugation","Mutation","Genetic_marker","Common_descent","Michigan_State_University","Minimal_growth_medium","Cryoprotectant","Mean_fitness","Spontaneous_mutation","Point_mutation","Seymour_Lederberg","Bruce_Levin","Arabinose","Point_mutation","Operon","DNA_repair","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Neutral_mutation","Citrate","Citrate","Citric_acid_cycle","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Clades","Gene_expression","Penicillin_binding_protein","Fitness_(biology)","Osmotic_stress"]}
