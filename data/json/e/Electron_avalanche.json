{"cursor":"6011","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'electron avalanche' is a process in which a number of free electrons in a\nmedium (usually a gas) are subjected to strong acceleration by an electric\nfield, and subsequently collide with other atoms of the medium and thereby\nionize them in a process called impact ionization. This releases additional\nelectrons which are themselves accelerated and collide with further atoms,\nreleasing more electrons, in a chain reaction. The result is the affected region\nof gas becomes a plasma, making it electrically conductive. The avalanche effect\nwas discovered by John Sealy Townsend in his work between 1897 and 1901, and is\nalso known as the Townsend discharge.\n\nElectron avalanches are essential to the dielectric breakdown process within\ngases. The process can culminate in corona discharges, streamers, leaders, or in\na spark or continuous arc that completely bridges the gap between the electrical\nconductors that are applying the voltage. The process extends to huge sparks â\nstreamers in lightning discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches\ncreated in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips.\nOnce begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of photoelectrons\nas a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in\nthe aft-tip region.\n\nThe process can also be used to detect ionizing radiation by using the gas\nmultiplication effect of the avalanche process. This is the ionisation mechanism\nof the GeigerâMÃ¼ller tube and, to a limited extent, of the proportional\ncounter Glenn F Knoll, 'Radiation Detection and Measurement'\n3rd edition, 2000, John Wiley and sons Inc. and is also used in spark\nchambers and other wire chambers.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Electron_avalanche","recorded":1362544230,"links":15,"instances":["physics_articles","physics","spark"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrical breakdown"],"headings":["Analysis","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/1/1/f1136d6454b1e6a7aebccf581f57725b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/e/9/1e9dd91210524f6e327f606b6267d6c4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["leader","spark"],["plasma","physics"],["list_of_plasma","physics_articles"]],"members":["list_of_plasma","plasma","leader"],"related":["Free_electron","Transmission_medium","Gas","Electric_field","Ion","Impact_ionization","Chain_reaction","Plasma_(physics)","Electrically_conductive","John_Sealy_Townsend","Townsend_discharge","Dielectric_breakdown","Corona_discharge","Streamer","Leader_(spark)","Electric_spark","Electric_arc","Lightning","Potential_gradient","Photoelectron","Ultraviolet","Geiger–Müller_tube","Proportional_counter","Spark_chamber","Wire_chamber","Photoexcitation","Background_radiation","Potential_gradient","Electric_charge","Ion","Electrode","Acceleration","Velocity","Chain_reaction","Electronegativity","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Nanosecond","Exponential_growth","Corona_discharge","Plasma_(physics)","Electrode","Secondary_electrons","Energy","Photon","Ionise","Avalanche_breakdown","Electrostatic_discharge","Townsend_discharge","Avalanche_breakdown","Avalanche_diode","Corona_discharge","Multipactor","Geiger–Müller_tube","Geiger_counter","Spark_chamber","Wire_chamber","List_of_plasma_(physics)_articles"]}
