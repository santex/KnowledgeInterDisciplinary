      "text" : "\n\n\n\nAn 'erection' (clinically: 'penile erection' or 'penile tumescence';\ninformal/slang: 'stiffy', 'hard-on', 'boner' and many others) is a\nphysiological phenomenon of the male genitalia of many species, in which the\npenis becomes firmer, engorged and enlarged. Penile erection is the result of a\ncomplex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular and endocrine factors,\nand is usually, though not exclusively, associated with sexual arousal or\nsexual attraction. The shape, angle and direction of an erection varies\nconsiderably in humans.\n\nPhysiologically, erection is triggered by the parasympathetic division of the\nautonomic nervous system (ANS), causing nitric oxide (a vasodilator) levels to\nrise in the trabecular arteries and smooth muscle of the penis. The arteries\ndilate causing the corpora cavernosa of the penis (and to a lesser extent the\ncorpora spongiosum) to fill with blood; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and\nbulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting\nthe egress and circulation of this blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic\nactivity reduces to baseline.\n\nAs an autonomic response, erection may result from a variety of stimuli,\nincluding sexual stimulation and sexual arousal, and is therefore not entirely\nunder conscious control. Erection during sleep or upon waking up are known as\nnocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). Absence of nocturnal erection is commonly\nused to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of erectile\ndysfunction and impotence.\n\nA penis which is partly, but not fully, erect is sometimes known as a semi-\nerection (clinically: 'partial tumescence'); a penis which is not erect is\ntypically referred to as being flaccid, or soft.\n",
