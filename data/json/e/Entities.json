In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually\nregarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity\nis animate.\n\nIn business, an entity is a person, department, team, corporation, cooperative,\npartnership, or other group with whom it is possible to conduct business.\n\nSometimes, the word entity is used in a general sense of a being, whether or not\nthe referent has material existence, e.g., is often referred to as an entity\nwith no corporeal form (non-physical entity), such as a language. It is also\noften used to refer to ghosts and other spirits.\n\nThe word entitative is the adjective form of the noun entity. Something that is\nentitative is \"considered as pure entity; abstracted from all circumstances\",\nthat is, regarded as entity alone, apart from attendant circumstances.\n","linknr":370,"url":"Entities","recorded":1362371469,"links":46,"instances":["philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in metaphysics","Data modeling diagrams","Objects"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["object","philosophy"]],"members":["object"],"related":["Abstraction","Legal_fiction","Life","Being","Matter","Non-physical_entity","Ghost","Spirit","Digital_identity","Entity_class","Entity_realism","Scientific_realism","Entitativity","Object_(philosophy)","Ontology"]}
