It\nreflects medium-frequency radio waves, and because of this reflection, radio\nwaves can be propagated beyond the horizon.\n\nPropagation is affected by time of day. During the daytime the solar wind\npresses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect\nradio waves. Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar wind\ndrags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which\nradio waves can travel by reflection, called skywave. The extent of the effect\nis further influenced by the season, and the amount of sunspot activity.\n",
