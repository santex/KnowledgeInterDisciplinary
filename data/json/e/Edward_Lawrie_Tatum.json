He shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958\nwith George Wells Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in\nmetabolism. The other half of that year's award went to Joshua Lederberg.\n\nBeadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread mold [[Neurospora\ncrassa]] to x-rays, causing mutations. In a series of experiments, they showed\nthat these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic\npathways. These experiments, published in 1941, led them to propose a direct\nlink between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the \"one gene, one enzyme\"\nhypothesis.\n\nTatum went on to study genetics in bacteria. An active area of research in his\nlaboratory was to understand the basis of Tryptophan biosynthesis in\n[[Escherichia coli]]. Later, Tatum and his student Joshua Lederberg showed that\nE. coli could share genetic information through recombination.\n\nTatum was born in Boulder, Colorado. He attended college at the University of\nChicago and received his PhD in biochemistry from the University of\nWisconsinâMadison in 1934. Starting in 1937, he worked at Stanford University,\nwhere he began his collaboration with Beadle. He then moved to Yale University\nin 1945 where he mentored Lederberg. He returned to Stanford in 1948 and then\njoined the faculty of Rockefeller Institute in 1957. A heavy cigarette smoker,\nhe died in New York City of heart failure complicated by chronic emphysema.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Edward_Lawrie_Tatum","recorded":1362374056,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1909 births","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","1975 deaths","American geneticists","American Nobel laureates","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","People from Boulder, Colorado","Stanford University Department of Biology faculty","Stanford University School of Medicine faculty","University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni","University of Chicago alumni","Rockefeller University faculty"],"headings":["References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Edward_Lawrie_Tatum_nobel.jpg/220px-Edward_Lawrie_Tatum_nobel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Boulder,_Colorado","United_States","New_York_City","United_States","Genetics","University_of_Chicago","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison","Stanford_University","Yale_University","Rockefeller_University","Esther_M._Lederberg","Gene","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","United_States_of_America","Genetics","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","George_Wells_Beadle","Gene","Metabolism","Joshua_Lederberg","X-rays","Mutation","Enzyme","Metabolic_pathway","\"one_gene,_one_enzyme\"_hypothesis","Bacterium","Tryptophan","Biosynthesis","Genetic_recombination","Boulder,_Colorado","University_of_Chicago","Biochemistry","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison","Stanford_University","Yale_University","Rockefeller_University","Cigarette","New_York_City","Heart_failure","Emphysema","Genetics","Boulder,_Colorado","New_York_City"]}
