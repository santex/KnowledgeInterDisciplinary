[http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=715 Law.com Legal\nDictionary Online]\n\nAlthough it has been observed, by the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J.\nBrennan, Jr., in his dissent to Watkins v. Sowders, that witness testimony is\nevidence that \"juries seem most receptive to, and not inclined to\ndiscredit\"., [http://supreme.justia.com/us/449/341/case.html\nWatkins v. Sowders, 449 U.S. 341 (1980)] Justice Brennan also observed\nthat \"At least since United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), the Court has\nrecognized the inherently suspect qualities of eyewitness identification\nevidence, and described the evidence as \"notoriously unreliable\". The Innocence Project, a non-profit organization which has\nworked on using DNA evidence in order to reopen criminal convictions that were\nmade before DNA testing was available as a tool in criminal investigations,\nstates that \"Eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of\nwrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in more than 75% of convictions\noverturned through DNA testing.\" [http://innocenceproject.org/understand/Eyewitness-\nMisidentification.php \"Eyewitness Misidentification\"]. In the United\nKingdom, the Criminal Law Review Committee, writing in 1971, stated that cases\nof mistaken identification \"constitute by far the greatest cause of actual or\npossible wrong convictions\". Criminal Law Review Committee Eleventh Report,\nCmnd 4991\n\nHistorically, eyewitness testimony had what Brennan described as \"a powerful\nimpact on juries\", who noted in his dissent that \"All the\nevidence points rather strikingly to the conclusion that there is almost nothing\nmore convincing [to a jury] than a live human being who takes the stand, points\na finger at the defendant, and says 'That's the one!'\". Watkins v. Souders,\n449 U.S. 341, 352 (1982) (Brennan, J. dissenting). Another commentator\nobserved that the eyewitness identification of a person as a perpetrator was\npersuasive to jurors even when \"far outweighed by evidence of\ninnocence.\" Elizabeth Loftus, Eyewitness Evidence 9 (1979).\n","linknr":399,"url":"Eyewitness_identification","recorded":1362668550,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/178240.pdf","http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/178240.pdf","http://web.augsburg.edu/~steblay/Improving_Eyewitness_Identifications.pdf","http://www.chicagopolice.org/IL%20Pilot%20on%20Eyewitness%20ID.pdf","http://eyewitness.utep.edu/Documents/IllinoisPilotStudyOnEyewitnessIDAddendum.pdf","http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/extra/policyforum.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/ell57888206m4766/fulltext.pdf","http://www.pdsdc.org/SpecialLitigation/SLDSystemResources/Beyond%20the%20Ken,%20Testing%20Jurors%20Understanding%20of%20Eyewitness%20Reliability%20Evidence.pdf","http://web.augsburg.edu/%7Esteblay/WeaponFocusMetaAnalysis.pdf","https://www.cs.dm.u-tokai.ac.jp/Publication/csv/pdfs/hypothesis-afss.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-8974.pdf","http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-8974.pdf","http://www.wrongfulconvictionlawsuitdefense.com/uploads/file/Illinois%20field%20study.pdf"],"categories":["Criminal justice","Criminal law"],"headings":["Known Cases of Eyewitness Error","Causes of Eyewitness Error","The Law of Eyewitness Identification Evidence in Criminal Trials","Reform Efforts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Ambox_scales.svg/40px-Ambox_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/DNA_Overview.png/80px-DNA_Overview.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Pistol_Browning_SFS.jpg/120px-Pistol_Browning_SFS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/ForgettingCurve.svg/120px-ForgettingCurve.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Witness","William_J._Brennan,_Jr.","Innocence_Project","DNA_evidence","United_States_Department_of_Justice","Double-blind","Experimenter's_bias","2006_Duke_University_lacrosse_case","Freedom_of_Information_Act","Daniel_Kahneman","Weapon_focus","Forgetting_curve","Hermann_Ebbinghaus","Eyewitness_memory","Cross-race_effect","New_Jersey","Special_master","Expert_testimony","Due_process","U.S._Supreme_Court","Expert_witness","PACE","Police_and_Criminal_Evidence_Act_1984","Eyewitness_memory"]}
