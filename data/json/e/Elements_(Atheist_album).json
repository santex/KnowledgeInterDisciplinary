It was\nreleased on August 30, 1993 by Music for Nations in Europe and by Metal Blade\nRecords in the US. Elements was reissued by Relapse Records in 2005 and was\ndigitally remastered with the addition of six bonus tracks.\n\nThe album has more of a jazz influenced style than their two previous albums,\nbut it remains highly technically complex. Elements was written, recorded and\nmixed in forty days in Pro Media Studios. [http://metal-\narchives.com/release.php?id=1149 Elements] at Encyclopaedia Metallum The\nband wanted to dissolve but they were required to finish their third album in\norder to fulfill a contract to their record label. Elements features the\naddition of a third guitarist, Frank Emmi. Initially, Rand Burkey was not going\nto appear on the album, and as Kelly Shaefer had developed carpal tunnel\nsyndrome, (preventing him from playing anything but rhythm guitar) a new lead\nguitar player was needed. Before recording, Burkey rejoined the band, and thus\nthe band ended up with three guitarists. Shaefer plays rhythm guitar, while Emmi\nand Burkey share responsibilities for leads and solos.\n\nElements was Atheist's last studio album for 17 years, until the 2010 release of\n[[Jupiter (Atheist_album)|Jupiter]].\n","linknr":171,"url":"Elements_(Atheist_album)","recorded":1362585166,"links":24,"instances":["recorded_music","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Atheist (band) albums","1993 albums","Metal Blade Records albums","Relapse Records albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Credits"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Atheist_-_Elements.jpg/220px-Atheist_-_Elements.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg/32px-Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atheist","band"],["atheist","band"],["atheist","band"],["atheist","band"],["audio_mixing","recorded_music"]],"members":["audio_mixing","atheist"],"related":["Atheist_(band)","Gainesville,_Florida","Florida","Technical_death_metal","Progressive_metal","Jazz_fusion","Music_for_Nations","Metal_Blade_Records","Relapse_Records","Atheist_(band)","Allmusic","Album","Progressive_metal","Technical_death_metal","Atheist_(band)","Music_for_Nations","Europe","Metal_Blade_Records","United_States","Relapse_Records","Jazz","Encyclopaedia_Metallum","Frank_Emmi","Rand_Burkey","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","Rhythm_guitar","Lead_guitar","Relapse_Records","Bonus_tracks","Singing","Electric_guitar","Electric_guitar","Electric_guitar","Tony_Choy","Bass_guitar","Drum_kit","Piano","Atheist_(band)","Audio_engineering","Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"]}
