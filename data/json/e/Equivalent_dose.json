{"cursor":"9251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'equivalent absorbed radiation dose', usually shortened to 'equivalent\ndose', or formerly 'dose equivalent', is a computed average measure of the\nradiation absorbed by a fixed mass of biological tissue, that attempts to\naccount for the different biological damage potential of different types of\nionizing radiation. It is therefore a less fundamental quantity than the total\nradiation energy absorbed per mass (the absorbed dose), but is a more\nsignificant quantity for assessing the health risk of radiation exposure.\n\nIt is adequate for assessing risk due to external radiation fields that\npenetrate uniformly through the whole body, but needs further corrections when\nthe field is applied only to part(s) of the body or when it is due to an\ninternal source. A further quantity called effective dose can be calculated if\nthe fractionation of radiation to different parts of the body is known, to\ntake into account the varying sensitivity of different organs to radiation.\nAnother quantity called committed dose is used when the radiation source has\nentered the body.\n\nEquivalent dose is dimensionally a quantity of energy per unit of mass, and is\nmeasured in sieverts or rems.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Equivalent_dose","recorded":1362676196,"links":35,"instances":["unit","radiation_safety","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.icrp.org/docs/The%20History%20of%20ICRP%20and%20the%20Evolution%20of%20its%20Policies.pdf","http://www.icrp.org/docs/The%20History%20of%20ICRP%20and%20the%20Evolution%20of%20its%20Policies.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"],"categories":["Physical quantities","Radiobiology"],"headings":["Computation","History","Units","Related quantities","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/d/bbdeb9a486a98bfa7759134c9de283b8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Neutron_radiation_weighting_factor_as_a_function_of_kinetic_energy.gif/350px-Neutron_radiation_weighting_factor_as_a_function_of_kinetic_energy.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["effective_dose","radiation"],["effective_dose","radiation_safety"],["gray","unit"],["rad","unit"],["roentgen","unit"]],"members":["gray","effective_dose","roentgen","rad"],"related":["Radiation","Ionizing_radiation","Absorbed_dose","Effective_dose_(radiation)","Committed_dose","Dimensional_analysis","Energy","Mass","Sievert","Roentgen_equivalent_man","Relative_biological_effectiveness","X-ray","Gamma_ray","Beta_ray","Muon","Neutron","Proton","Pion","Alpha_ray","Nuclear_fission_product","Atomic_nucleus","Relative_biological_effectiveness","Effective_dose_(radiation_safety)","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission","SI_unit","Sievert","Joule","Kg","Roentgen_equivalent_man","Linear_energy_transfer","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission","Dosimetry","Deep-dose_equivalent","Banana_equivalent_dose","Becquerel","Counts_per_minute","Curie","Gray_(unit)","Ionizing_radiation_units","Ionisation_chamber","Rad_(unit)","Roentgen_(unit)","Roentgen_equivalent_man","Sievert"]}
