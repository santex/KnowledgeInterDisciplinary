Based on the\n\"interference\" entry of The Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th edition,\nonline The disturbance may interrupt, obstruct, or otherwise degrade or\nlimit the effective performance of the circuit. These effects can range from a\nsimple degradation of data to a total loss of data. The source may be\nany object, artificial or natural, that carries rapidly changing electrical\ncurrents, such as an electrical circuit, the Sun or the Northern Lights.\n\nEMI can be intentionally used for radio jamming, as in some forms of electronic\nwarfare, or can occur unintentionally, as a result of spurious emissions for\nexample through intermodulation products, and the like. It frequently affects\nthe reception of AM radio in urban areas. It can also affect cell phone, FM\nradio and television reception, although to a lesser extent.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename = Buzzing_Speakers.ogg title = EMI sound sample 1 description = A GSM\n| mobile phone signal interferes with a speaker system.\n}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename = 802_11bg_interference.ogg title = EMI sound sample 2 description =\n| A Wi-Fi signal interferes with a speaker system.\n}}\n","linknr":290,"url":"Electromagnetic_interference","recorded":1362567187,"links":37,"instances":["communication","electronics","astronomy","oscillation","electronic"],"pdf":["http://www.national.com/ds/LM/LMV831.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20103%20-%20APR2011%20-%20Snubbers.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20103%20-%20APR2011%20-%20Snubbers.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20104%20-%20APR2011%20-%20EMI%20Reduction.pdf","http://arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/Documents/Lab%20Note%20104%20-%20APR2011%20-%20EMI%20Reduction.pdf","http://rfdesign.com/mag/510RFD33.pdf","http://www.ieee.li/pdf/viewgraphs/emc_design_fundamentals.pdf"],"categories":["Electromagnetic compatibility","Television terminology"],"headings":["Types","Susceptibilities of different radio technologies","Interference to consumer devices","History","Standards","EMI in integrated circuits","Electromagnetic interference manufacturers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Analog_TV_EMI.jpg/300px-Analog_TV_EMI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aurora","astronomy"],["selectivity","electronic"],["transient","oscillation"],["choke","electronics"],["interference","communication"]],"members":["interference","choke","aurora","transient","selectivity"],"related":["Electromagnetic_radiation","Electrical_circuit","Sun","Aurora_(astronomy)","Radio_jamming","Electronic_warfare","Spurious_emission","Intermodulation","AM_radio","Cell_phone","FM_radio","Television","Television_antenna","GSM","Wi-Fi","Narrowband","Broadband","Broadcasting","Cell_phone","Frequency","Electric_power_transmission","Electric_motor","Thermostat","Bug_zapper","Synchrotron_radiation","Modulation","Computer","Digital","Television","Harmonic","Radio_frequency_spectrum","Radio_receiver","Amplitude_modulation","Dipole_antenna","Selectivity_(electronic)","Wi-Fi","Error-correction","Spread-spectrum","Frequency_hopping","Directivity","Parabolic_antenna","Antenna_diversity","Spread-spectrum","Ultra-wideband","Ultra-wideband","United_States","Federal_Communications_Commission","Voluntary_compliance","Broadcast","Transmitter","Two-way_radio","Cable_TV","Toaster_oven","Electric_blanket","Bug_zapper","Heating_pad","Cathode_ray_tube","Degaussing","Electromagnetic_interference_at_2.4_GHz","802.11b","802.11g","Bluetooth","Baby_monitor","Cordless_telephone","Video_sender","Microwave_oven","Switch","Inductance","Capacitor","Electrical_resistance_and_conductance","Ampere","Snubber","Capacitor","Electromechanics","Switched-mode_power_supply","Power_factor_correction","Electromagnetic_compatibility","Red_Queen's_race","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","CISPR","Electromagnetic_compatibility","Integrated_circuit","Decoupling_capacitor","Rise_time","IC_power_supply_pin","Ground_plane","Power_plane","Radio_frequency","Fundamental_frequency","Harmonic","Transient_(oscillation)","MHz","IC_power_supply_pin","Common-mode_interference","Differential_pair","Capacitive_coupling","Braid-breaker","Choke_(electronics)","Microphone","Loudspeaker","Anechoic_chamber","MILMEGA","ON_Semiconductor","Electromagnetic_radiation","Faraday_cage","Radio_receiver","Signal_noise","Twisted_pair","Interference_(communication)"]}
