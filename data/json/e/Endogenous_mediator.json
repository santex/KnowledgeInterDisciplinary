{"cursor":"1338","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Endogenous mediators' are intracellular proteins that enhance and activate the\nfunctions of other proteins. This term is commonly used in molecular biology and\ncell biology to describe a specific protein complex that acts in transcription\nas a coactivator. This Mediator complex is located within the cell nucleus.\n\nThe Mediator complex is required for the successful transcription of nearly all\nclass II gene promoters in yeast. It works in the same manner in\nmammals. The mediator functions as a coactivator and binds to the C-terminal\ndomain of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, acting as a bridge between this enzyme\nand transcription factors.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Endogenous_mediator","recorded":1362510344,"links":13,"instances":["coactivator","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["coactivator","genetics"],["mediator","coactivator"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["mediator","coactivator","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Cell_biology","Transcription_(genetics)","Coactivator_(genetics)","Mediator_(coactivator)","Cell_nucleus","Transcription_(genetics)","Class_II_gene","C-terminal_domain","RNA_polymerase_II","Holoenzyme","Transcription_factor"]}
