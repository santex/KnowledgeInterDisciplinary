{"cursor":"19028","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Germany]] The 'European Patent Office' (EPO) is one of the two organs of the\nEuropean Patent Organisation (EPOrg), the other being the Administrative\nCouncil. The EPO acts as executive body for the Organisation [http://www.hm-\ntreasury.gov.uk/media/6/E/pbr06_gowers_report_755.pdf Gower's Report on\nIntellectual Property], para 1.34 while the Administrative Council acts as\nits supervisory body as well as, to a limited extent, its\nlegislative body. The actual\nlegislative power to revise the European Patent Convention lies with the\nContracting States themselves when meeting at a Conference of the Contracting\nStates.\n\nWithin the European Patent Office, examiners are in charge of studying European\npatent applications, filed by applicants, in order to decide whether to grant a\npatent for an invention. The patents granted by the European Patent Office are\ncalled European patents.\n","linknr":453,"url":"European_Patent_Office","recorded":1362891591,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/6/E/pbr06_gowers_report_755.pdf","http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pctndocs/en/2010/pct_news_2010_04.pdf","http://www.wipo.int/pct/guide/en/gdvol1/annexes/annexsisa/ax_sisa_ep.pdf","http://public.ffpe-epo.org/sites/public.ffpe-epo.org/files/Statutes-EN_inofficial_translation.pdf"],"categories":["European Patent Organisation","Patent offices"],"headings":["Function, status and location","Management","Languages","Departments and Directorates-General","Activities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty","Online services","Cooperations","Staff unions","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Europ%C3%A4isches_Patentamt_in_M%C3%BCnchen.jpg/320px-Europ%C3%A4isches_Patentamt_in_M%C3%BCnchen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Berlin%2C_Kreuzberg%2C_Gitschiner_Strasse_97-103%2C_Kaiserliches_Patentamt_01.jpg/260px-Berlin%2C_Kreuzberg%2C_Gitschiner_Strasse_97-103%2C_Kaiserliches_Patentamt_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/European_Patent_Office_Munich-sign.JPG/220px-European_Patent_Office_Munich-sign.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/EPO_Hague.JPG/220px-EPO_Hague.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Germany","European_Patent_Organisation","Administrative_Council_of_the_European_Patent_Organisation","European_Patent_Convention","Grant_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Search_report","Juristic_person","Juristic_person","Munich","Germany","Rijswijk","The_Hague","Netherlands","Berlin","Germany","Vienna","Austria","Brussels","Belgium","Extraterritoriality","Netherlands","Switzerland","Germany","France","United_Kingdom","EU_internal_market","German_language","English_language","French_language","English_language","French_language","German_language","European_Patent_Bulletin","Official_Journal_of_the_European_Patent_Office","Patent_application","Dutch_language","Italian_language","Spanish_language","Grant_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Opposition_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Appeal_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Appeal","Enlarged_Board_of_Appeal","Netherlands","Rijswijk","Patent_infringement","Court","Jurisdiction","Enforcement_of_European_patents","Opposition_procedure_before_the_European_Patent_Office","Sir_Robin_Jacob","GRUR_Int.","Patent_Cooperation_Treaty","Espacenet","Official_Journal_of_the_European_Patent_Office","European_Patent_Register","Epoline","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","Japan_Patent_Office","Trilateral_Patent_Offices","Korean_Intellectual_Property_Office","State_Intellectual_Property_Office_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","The_Hague","Law_of_the_Netherlands","Chamber_of_commerce","European_Civil_Service_Federation","French_language"]}
