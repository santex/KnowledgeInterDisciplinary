{"cursor":"27639","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Electronegativity', symbol '[[Chi (letter)| Ï ]]', is a chemical property that describes the\ntendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron\ndensity) towards itself. An atom's\nelectronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance that\nits valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated\nelectronegativity number, the more an element or compound attracts electrons\ntowards it. First proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932 as a development of valence\nbond theory, {{cite journal |author= Pauling, L.\n|authorlink=Linus Pauling |year= 1932 |journal= Journal of the American Chemical\nSociety |volume= 54 |issue= 9 |pages= 3570â3582 |title= The Nature of the\nChemical Bond. IV. The Energy of Single Bonds and the Relative Electronegativity\nof Atoms |doi= 10.1021/ja01348a011}} it has been shown to correlate with a\nnumber of other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly\nmeasured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties.\nSeveral methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be\nsmall differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods\nshow the same periodic trends between elements.\n\nThe most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by\nLinus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to as the\n'Pauling scale', on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98\n(hydrogen = 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is\nconventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on a scale that\ncovers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity\nin 'Pauling units'.\n\nElectronegativity, as it is usually calculated, is not strictly a property of an\natom, but rather a property of an atom in a molecule.\nProperties of a free atom include ionization energy and electron affinity. It is\nto be expected that the electronegativity of an element will vary with its\nchemical environment, but it is usually considered to be a\ntransferable property, that is to say that similar values will be valid in a\nvariety of situations.\n\nOn the most basic level, electronegativity is determined by factors like the\nnuclear charge (the more protons an atom has, the more \"pull\" it will have on\nnegative electrons) and the number/location of other electrons present in the\natomic shells (the more electrons an atom has, the farther from the nucleus the\nvalence electrons will be, and as a result the less positive charge they will\nexperienceâboth because of their increased distance from the nucleus, and\nbecause the other electrons in the lower energy core orbitals will act to shield\nthe valence electrons from the positively charged nucleus).\n\nThe opposite of electronegativity is '[[electropositivity]]': a measure of an\nelement's ability to donate electrons.\n","linknr":836,"url":"Electronegative","recorded":1362481755,"links":84,"instances":["periodic_table","data_page","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Chemical
