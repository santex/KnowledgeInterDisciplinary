{"cursor":"8768","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy' (EDS, EDX, or XEDS) is an analytical\ntechnique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a\nsample. It relies on the investigation of an interaction of some source of X-ray\nexcitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part\nto the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure\nallowing unique set of peaks on its X-ray spectrum. To stimulate the\nemission of characteristic X-rays from a specimen, a high-energy beam of charged\nparticles such as electrons or protons (see PIXE), or a beam of X-rays, is\nfocused into the sample being studied. At rest, an atom within the sample\ncontains ground state (or unexcited) electrons in discrete energy levels or\nelectron shells bound to the nucleus. The incident beam may excite an electron\nin an inner shell, ejecting it from the shell while creating an electron hole\nwhere the electron was. An electron from an outer, higher-energy shell then\nfills the hole, and the difference in energy between the higher-energy shell and\nthe lower energy shell may be released in the form of an X-ray. The number and\nenergy of the X-rays emitted from a specimen can be measured by an energy-\ndispersive spectrometer. As the energy of the X-rays are characteristic of the\ndifference in energy between the two shells, and of the atomic structure of the\nelement from which they were emitted, this allows the elemental composition of\nthe specimen to be measured.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy","recorded":1362535234,"links":25,"instances":["materials_science"],"pdf":["http://www.ifremer.fr/docelec/doc/2008/publication-4702.pdf","http://www.ifremer.fr/docelec/doc/2008/publication-4702.pdf","http://www.charfac.umn.edu/instruments/eds_on_sem_primer.pdf"],"categories":["Scientific techniques","Measuring instruments","Spectroscopy","X-rays"],"headings":["X-ray measurement","Equipment","Technological variants","Accuracy of EDS","Emerging technology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/EDS_-_Rimicaris_exoculata.png/400px-EDS_-_Rimicaris_exoculata.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/EDX-scheme.svg/220px-EDX-scheme.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["characterization","materials_science"]],"members":["characterization"],"related":["Chemical_element","Characterization_(materials_science)","Atom","Electron","Proton","Particle-Induced_X-ray_Emission","Ground_state","Electron_shell","Electron_hole","Electron_microscope","Scanning_electron_microscope","Scanning_transmission_electron_microscope","X-ray_fluorescence","Voltage","Silicon_drift_detector","Auger_electron","Auger_electron_spectroscopy","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Kinetic_energy","Binding_energy","Wavelength_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy","Diffraction","Microphonic","Spectrum","Silicon_drift_detector","Liquid_nitrogen","Calorimeter","Thermistor","Thermometer","Time_constant","Heat_capacity","Optical_resolution","Elemental_mapping","Transmission_electron_microscopy","Wavelength_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy","X-ray_fluorescence","X-ray_microtomography","Scanning_electron_microscopy"]}
