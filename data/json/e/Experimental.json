Experiments\nprovide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when\na particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in their goal and\nscale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the\nresults. A child may carry out basic experiments to understand the nature of\ngravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to\nadvance the understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments can vary from personal\nand informal (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly\ncontrolled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists\nthat hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of\nexperiments vary considerably between the natural and social sciences.\n","linknr":638,"url":"Experimental","recorded":1362560574,"links":73,"instances":["epidemiology","statistics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://depts.washington.edu/methods/readings/Shadish.pdf"],"categories":["Research","Design of experiments","Science experiments|*","Evaluation methods","Causal inference","Experiments"],"headings":["Overview","History","Types of experiment","Contrast with Observational Study","Ethics","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Mirror_baby.jpg/160px-Mirror_baby.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg/300px-Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["replication","statistics"],["variable","mathematics"],["colorimetry","chemical_method#colorimetric_assays"],["cluster","epidemiology"]],"members":["cluster","replication","variable","colorimetry"],"related":["Hypothesis","Causality","Natural_science","Social_science","Scientific_method","Empirical_method","Scientific_models","Hypotheses","Theories","Hypothesis","Philosophy_of_science","Counterexample","Confounding","Scientific_control","Randomized_experiment","Random_assignment","Engineering","Replication_(statistics)","Social_sciences","Clinical_trial","Average_treatment_effect","Test_statistic","Systematic_review","Meta-analysis","Branches_of_science","Agriculture","Experimental_economics","Francis_Bacon","Philosophy","Scientist","Deductive_reasoning","Scientific_method","Galileo_Galilei","Antoine_Lavoisier","Combustion","Biochemistry","Conservation_of_mass","Louis_Pasteur","Spontaneous_generation","Germ_theory_of_disease","Laboratory","Ronald_Fisher","Jerzy_Neyman","Oscar_Kempthorne","Gertrude_Mary_Cox","William_Gemmell_Cochran","Rubin_causal_model","Psychology","Political_Science","Variable_(mathematics)","Independent_variable","Dependent_variable","Randomized_experiment","Confounding","Dependent_and_independent_variables","Treatment_group","Placebo","Control_group","Replicate","Standard_curve","Protein","Assay","Spectrophotometer","Statistics","Number","Microbiology","Chemistry","Solution","Human_experimentation","Research_subject","Stimulation","Measurement","Test_method","Cluster_(epidemiology)","Design_of_experiments","Average_treatment_effect","Response_variable","Scientific_method","Hypotheses","Null_hypothesis","System","Correlation","Explanatory_variables","Science","Economics","Political_science","Geology","Paleontology","Ecology","Meteorology","Astronomy","Laboratory","External_validity","Observational_study","Confounding","Oscar_Kempthorne","David_A._Freedman","David_A._Freedman","Selection_bias","Central_limit_theorem","Markov's_inequality","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Propensity_score_matching","Human_subjects_research","Informed_consent","Manhattan_Project","Design_of_experiments","Experimental_physics","List_of_experiments","Long-term_experiment","Concept_Development_and_Experimentation","Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
