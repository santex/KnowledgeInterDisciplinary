{"cursor":"25658","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\n'Electronics engineering', or 'electronic engineering', is an engineering\ndiscipline where non-linear and active electrical components such as electron\ntubes, and semiconductor devices, especially transistors, diodes and integrated\ncircuits, are utilized to design electronic circuits, devices and systems,\ntypically also including passive electrical components and based on printed\ncircuit boards. The term denotes a broad engineering field that covers important\nsubfields such as analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics,\nembedded systems and power electronics. Electronics engineering deals with\nimplementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many\nrelated fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering,\ntelecommunications, control systems, signal processing, systems engineering,\ncomputer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control,\nrobotics, and many others.

Darwazeh Analogue\nOptical Fibre Communications, p. xvi, Institution of Electrical Engineers, 1995\nISBN 978-0-85296-832-1\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is one of the most\nimportant and influential organizations for electronics engineers.\n","linknr":761,"url":"Electronic_engineering","recorded":1362683898,"links":46,"instances":["radio","information_theory","electronics","mathematics","material","telecommunications","communications","alphabetical","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic
