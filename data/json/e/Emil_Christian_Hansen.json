He isolated a pure cell of yeast and, after combining it with a\nsugary solution, produced more yeast than was in a yeast bank. It was known\nas Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, and is used in lager beers. See\nFermentation, Yeast.\n\n;Literature\n* Clausen, N.Hjelte (1932) Emil Christian Hansen, pp. 161â164 in: Meisen,\n  V.
