The anime contains several differences and the English dub anime is\ndifferent still. The specifically relevant differences have been noted but do\nnot belong as the main reference. Do not change character names or terminology\nunless based on the English Viz Media manga translation.-->\n\n\n\nThe [[Dragon Ball]] manga and anime series features an extensive cast of\ncharacters created by Akira Toriyama. The series takes place in a fictional\nuniverse, the same as Toriyama's previous series [[Dr. Slump]], and follows the\nadventures of martial artist Son Goku from childhood to adulthood as he searches\nfor the seven spheres known as the Dragon Balls, used to summon a wish-granting\ndragon. During the course of the story, he encounters allies such as Bulma,\nYamcha, Kuririn and Trunks, rivals such as Tenshinhan, Piccolo and Vegeta, and\nenemies such as Freeza and Cell.\n\nWhile many of the characters are humans with superhuman strength and/or\nsupernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals and\nlater, extraterrestrial lifeforms. The series also includes depictions of the\nafterlife, with several characters being gods that govern the universe.\n",
