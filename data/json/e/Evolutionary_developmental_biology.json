It addresses the origin and\nevolution of embryonic development; how modifications of development and\ndevelopmental processes lead to the production of novel features, such as the\nevolution of feathers; {{cite journal\n| author=Prum, R.O., Brush, A.H. month=March |year=2003 doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0303-\n| 84 title=Which Came First, the Feather or the Bird? |journal=Scientific\n| American |volume=288 |issue=3 |pages=84â93 |\npmid=12616863}} the role of developmental plasticity in evolution; how\necology impacts development and evolutionary change; and the developmental basis\nof homoplasy and homology.\n\nAlthough interest in the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny extends\nback to the nineteenth century, the contemporary field of evo-devo has gained\nimpetus from the discovery of genes regulating embryonic development in model\norganisms. General hypotheses remain hard to test because organisms differ so\nmuch in shape and form.\n\nNevertheless, it now appears that just as evolution tends to create new genes\nfrom parts of old genes (molecular economy), evo-devo demonstrates that\nevolution alters developmental processes to create new and novel structures from\nthe old gene networks (such as bone structures of the jaw deviating to the\nossicles of the middle ear) or will conserve (molecular economy) a similar\nprogram in a host of organisms such as eye development genes in molluscs,\ninsects, and vertebrates. {{cite journal |title=Squid Pax-6 and eye\ndevelopment\n| first=Stanislav I. |last=Tomarev |first2=Patrick |last2=Callaerts\n| |first3=Lidia |last3=Kos |first4=Rina |last4=Zinovieva |first5=Georg\n| |last5=Halder |first6=Walter |last6=Gehring |first7=Joram |last7=Piatigorsky\n| doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2421 year=1997 |journal=Proceedings of the National\n| Academy of Sciences |volume=94 |pmc=20103 |issue=6 |pages=2421â2426\n| |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/94/6/2421.full | pmid=9122210 |\n| bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2421T}}\n{{cite journal |title=Pax genes and eye organogenesis\n| first=Franck |last=Pichaud |first2=Claude |last2=Desplan |year=2002\n| |month=August doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00321-0 journal=Current opinion in\n| genetics and development |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=430â434 |pmid=12100888\n| }} Initially the major interest has been in the evidence of homology in\n| the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate body plan and organ\n| development.
