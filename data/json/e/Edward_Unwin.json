He trained at HMS ''Conway'' and joined the Royal Navy on 16\nOctober 1895 serving during the South African War. He was promoted to lieutenant\ncommander in 1903 and retired in 1909 with the rank of Commander. He was\nrecalled to the service on 29 July 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the\nFirst World War. Initially he served aboard HMS ''Iron Duke'' on the staff of\nAdmiral John Jellicoe but in February 1915 he took command of the torpedo\ngunboat HMS ''Hussar'' which had operated as a despatch vessel for the Commander\nin Chief, Mediterranean and was now a minesweeper.\n\nIn 1915, when planning began for the amphibious landing on the Gallipoli\npeninsula, Unwin proposed beaching the 4,000 ton collier SS ''River Clyde'' on\nthe narrow beach beneath Sedd el Bahr at Cape Helles, known as V Beach, thereby\nallowing 2,000 troops to be landed together. At the age of 51, Unwin was\npromoted to acting Captain and given command of the River Clyde for the\noperation.\n\n'' of the lighters and Sedd el Bahr castle, 25 April 1915.]]\n\nThe River Clyde beached at 06:22 on 25 April 1915, and the plan called for a\nsteam hopper to form a bridge from the ship to the shore. However, the\nDardanelles current swept the hopper away so Unwin, accompanied by Able Seaman\nWilliam Charles Williams, who had served under him on the Hussar and had been\nordered to stay by his side, dove overboard and manhandled two lighters into\nposition, lashing them together to form the bridge. All the while Unwin was\nunder fire from the Turkish defenders. When Williams was mortally wounded, Unwin\nwent to his aid and the lighter he was holding was swept away.\n\nUnwin collapsed from cold and exhaustion, his place being taken by other men.\nAfter an hour of rest, he returned to the lighters until he was wounded and\ncollapsed again. Once the attempts to land had ceased, Unwin went out a third\ntime to attempt to recover wounded from the beach; according to one account he\nretrieved seven men.\n\nIn August, when a new landing was to be made by the British IX Corps at Suvla as\npart of the Battle of Sari Bair, Unwin was given command of the landing boats,\nknown as Beetles. He was the first to report on the landing to the corps\ncommander, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stopford, and advised against\nlanding further troops inside Suvla Bay due to the darkness and reefs.\n\nUnwin was back at Suvla as Naval Transport Officer for the evacuation in\nDecember — he was aboard the last boat to leave the beach. When a soldier\nfell overboard, Unwin dived in to rescue him. Observing this act, General Julian\nByng, the new IX Corps commander, remarked to Commodore Roger Keyes:\n\n:\"You really must do something about Unwin. You should send him home; we want\n:several little Unwins.\"\n\nIn 1916 Unwin took command of HMS ''Amethyst'' and in 1917 became Naval\nTransport Officer, Egypt. He later achieved the rank of commodore. He died on 19\nApril 1950 and is buried in Grayshott, Surrey. His Victoria Cross has been\nloaned by his family to the Imperial War Museum, London, where it is on display.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Edward_Unwin","recorded":1364179043,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Edward_Unwin_VC.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Edward_Unwin_VC.jpg/175px-Edward_Unwin_VC.jpg","/wiki/Fawley","/wiki/England","/wiki/Hindhead","/w/index.php?title=Greyshott&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_Kingdom","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Commodore_(Royal_Navy)","/wiki/HMS_Hussar_(1894)","/wiki/HMS_Amethyst_(1903)","/wiki/Benin_Expedition_of_1897","/wiki/Second_Boer_War","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/File:Victoria_Cross_(UK)_ribbon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Victoria_Cross_%28UK%29_ribbon.png/30px-Victoria_Cross_%28UK%29_ribbon.png","/wiki/Victoria_Cross","/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath","/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Order_of_the_Nile","/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur","/wiki/Victoria_Cross","/wiki/Companion_of_The_Most_Honourable_Order_of_the_Bath","/wiki/Companion_of_The_Most_Distinguished_Order_of_Saint_Michael_and_Saint_George","/wiki/England","/wiki/Victoria_Cross","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Clipper","/wiki/Peninsular_and_Oriental_Steam_Navigation_Company","/wiki/HMS_Conway_(school_ship)","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/South_African_War","/wiki/Lieutenant_commander","/wiki/Commander","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/HMS_Iron_Duke_(1912)","/wiki/John_Jellicoe,_1st_Earl_Jellicoe","/wiki/Torpedo_gunboat","/wiki/HMS_Hussar_(1894)","/wiki/Mediterranean","/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)","/wiki/Gallipoli","/wiki/Collier_(ship_type)","/wiki/SS_River_Clyde","/wiki/Sedd_el_Bahr","/wiki/Cape_Helles","/wiki/Landing_at_Cape_Helles#V_Beach","/wiki/Captain_(naval)","/wiki/File:Sedd-el-Bahr_from_River_Clyde.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Sedd-el-Bahr_from_River_Clyde.jpg/220px-Sedd-el-Bahr_from_River_Clyde.jpg","/wiki/File:Sedd-el-Bahr_from_River_Clyde.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/SS_River_Clyde","/wiki/Sedd_el_Bahr","/wiki/Dardanelles","/wiki/Able_Seaman_(rank)","/wiki/William_Charles_Williams","/wiki/IX_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Suvla","/wiki/Battle_of_Sari_Bair","/wiki/Lieutenant_General","/wiki/Frederick_Stopford","/wiki/Julian_H.G._Byng,_1st_Viscount_Byng_of_Vimy","/wiki/Commodore_(Royal_Navy)","/wiki/Roger_Keyes","/wiki/HMS_Amethyst_(1903)","/wiki/Commodore_(rank)","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Imperial_War_Museum","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/London_Gazette","/wiki/File:VCEdwardUnwin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/VCEdwardUnwin.jpg","/wiki/File:VCEdwardUnwin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Monuments_to_Courage","/wiki/The_Register_of_the_Victoria_Cross","/wiki/Scotland%27s_Forgotten_Valour","/wiki/VCs_of_the_First_World_War_-_Gallipoli","/wiki/VCs_of_the_First_World_War_-_The_Naval_VCs","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&action=edit&section=3","http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/bbunwin.htm","http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/surrey.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Fawley","/wiki/Hindhead","/wiki/Surrey","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Unwin&oldid=543889442","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Royal_Navy_officers","/wiki/Category:British_Gallipoli_Campaign_recipients_of_the_Victoria_Cross","/wiki/Category:Companions_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath","/wiki/Category:Companions_of_the_Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George","/wiki/Category:1864_births","/wiki/Category:1950_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Waverley_(district)","/wiki/Category:Royal_Navy_recipients_of_the_Victoria_Cross","/wiki/Category:Royal_Navy_officers_of_World_War_I","/wiki/Category:Royal_Navy_personnel_of_the_Second_Boer_War","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Order_of_the_Nile","/wiki/Category:Chevaliers_of_the_L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur","/wiki/Category:British_military_
