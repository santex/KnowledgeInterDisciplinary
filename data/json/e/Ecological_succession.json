The community begins with\nrelatively few pioneering plants and animals and develops through increasing\ncomplexity until it becomes stable or self-perpetuating as a climax community.\n\nIt is a phenomenon or process by which an ecological community undergoes more or\nless orderly and predictable changes following disturbance or initial\ncolonization of new habitat. Succession may be initiated either by formation of\nnew, unoccupied habitat (e.g., a lava flow or a severe landslide) or by some\nform of disturbance (e.g. fire, severe windthrow, logging) of an existing\ncommunity. Succession that begins in new habitats, uninfluenced by pre-existing\ncommunities is called primary succession, whereas succession that follows\ndisruption of a pre-existing community is called secondary succession.\n\nSuccession was among the first theories advanced in ecology and the study of\nsuccession remains at the core of ecological science. Ecological succession was\nfirst documented in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2009).
