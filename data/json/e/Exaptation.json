{"cursor":"8998","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Exaptation', '[[Co-option (biology)|co-option]]', and '[[preadaptation]]' are\nrelated terms referring to shifts in the function of a trait during evolution.\nFor example, a trait can evolve because it served one particular function, but\nsubsequently it may come to serve another. Exaptations are common in both\nanatomy and behaviour. Bird feathers are a classic example: initially these may\nhave evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight.\nInterest in exaptation relates to both the process and products of evolution:\nthe process that creates complex traits and the products (functions, anatomical\nstructures, biochemicals, etc) that may be imperfectly developed. {{cite web\n  | last = first = authorlink = coauthors = title =Preadaptation work =\n  | publisher =Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary date = url =http://www.merriam-\n  | webster.com/dictionary/preadaptation doi = accessdate =2009-01-22 }}\n\n","linknr":204,"url":"Exaptation","recorded":1362483464,"links":27,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["History and definitions","Examples","Implications","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spandrel","biology"]],"members":["spandrel"],"related":["Evolution","Charles_Darwin","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Elisabeth_Vrba","Feathers","Gas_bladder","Gray_wolf","Human","George_Jackson_Mivart","Jury-rigged","Atavism","Vestigiality","Spandrel_(biology)","Preadaptation","Ecological_fitting"]}
