{"cursor":"2004","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'electronic page' is a term to encompass the grouping of content between\nbasic breaking points in presentations or documents that originate or remain as\nvisual electronic documents. This is a software file and recording format term\nin contrast to electronic paper, a hardware display technology. Electronic pages\nmay be a standard sized based on the document settings of a word processor file,\ndesktop publishing application file, or presentation software file. Electronic\npages may also be dynamic in size or content such as in the case of HTML pages.\nWhen end-user interactivity is part of the user experience design of an\nelectronic page, it is better known as a graphical user interface (GUI). The\nnumber and size of electronic pages in a document are limited by the amount of\ncomputer data storage, not by the display devices or amount of paper.\n\nMost electronic pages are for either display (screen output) on a computer\nmonitor or handheld device, or output to a printing device. PDF and some e-book\nfile format pages are designed to do both. Most applications will print\nelectronic pages without the need for a screen capture. However, not all\nsoftware supports WYSIWYG printing of pages. Pages exclusively for screen output\nare more commonly known as screens, windows, interfaces, scenes, or cards. In\nthe case of presentation software, electronic pages are known as slides.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Electronic_page","recorded":1362551511,"links":13,"instances":["paper","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic documents"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Laptop-ebook.jpg/220px-Laptop-ebook.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["window","computing"],["page","paper"]],"members":["page","window"],"related":["Presentation","Document","Electronic_document","Software","Computer_file","Recording_format","Electronic_paper","Display_technology","Word_processor","Desktop_publishing","Presentation_software","Web_page","End-user","Interactivity","Experience_design","Graphical_user_interface","Computer_data_storage","Electronic_display","Computer_monitor","Handheld_device","Computer_printer","Adobe_PDF","Comparison_of_e-book_formats","Screen_capture","WYSIWYG","Window_(computing)","Macromedia_Director","Hypercard","Slide_show","Page_(paper)","Layout_engine","Web_page","Web_document"]}
