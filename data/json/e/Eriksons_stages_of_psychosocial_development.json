In each stage, the person confronts, and hopefully\nmasters, new challenges. Each stage builds upon the successful completion of\nearlier stages. The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be\nexpected to reappear as problems in the future.\n\nHowever, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage.\nErikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight\nlife stages as a function of negotiating his or her biological forces and\nsociocultural forces. Each stage is characterized by a psychosocial crisis of\nthese two conflicting forces (as shown in the table below). If an individual\ndoes indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned\nattribute in the crisis), he or she emerges from the stage with the\ncorresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage\n(autonomy vs. shame & doubt) with more trust than mistrust, he or she carries\nthe virtue of hope into the remaining life stages.\n","linknr":357,"url":"Erikson's_stages_of_psychosocial_development","recorded":1362374705,"links":33,"instances":["activity"],"pdf":["http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf","http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf","http://www.lifemodel.org/download/Model%20Building%20Appendix.pdf","http://www.lifemodel.org/download/Model%20Building%20Appendix.pdf","http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf","http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1984/A1984TR91100001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1984/A1984TR91100001.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental psychology"],"headings":["The stages","Development of Freudian theory","Value of the theory","Critique","See also","References","Publications","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Freud-Museum.jpg/130px-Freud-Museum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["play","activity"]],"members":["play"],"related":["Erik_Erikson","Developmental_stage_theories","Human","Infant","Adulthood","Motor_skill","Play_(activity)","Oedipal","Space","Learn","Moral_values","Elementary_school","Self-confidence","Inferiority","Sexual_identity","Identity_Crisis","Generativity","Ego_integrity","Despair","Sigmund_Freud","Psychosexual_stages","James_Marcia","Neo-Freudianism","Child_development","Developmental_psychology","Ethnic_identity_development"]}
