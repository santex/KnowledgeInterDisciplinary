{"cursor":"57215","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Electric-power transmission' is the bulk transfer of electrical energy, from\ngenerating power plants to electrical substations located near demand centers.\nThis is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and\ncustomers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution.\n\nTransmission lines, when interconnected with each other, become transmission\nnetworks. In the US, these are typically referred to as \"power grids\" or\njust \"the grid.\" In the UK, the network is known as the \"National Grid\".\nNorth America has three major grids, the Western Interconnection, the\nEastern Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas\n(ERCOT) grid, often referred to as the Western System, the Eastern System\nand the Texas System.\n\nHistorically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same\ncompany, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the\nregulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of\nthe electricity transmission business from the distribution business.\n\nMost transmission lines use high-voltage three-phase alternating current (AC),\nalthough single phase AC is sometimes used in railway electrification systems.\nHigh-voltage direct-current (HVDC) technology is used for greater efficiency in\nvery long distances (typically hundreds of miles (kilometres)), or in submarine\npower cables (typically longer than 30 miles (50 km)). HVDC links are also\nused to stabilize against control problems in large power distribution networks\nwhere sudden new loads or blackouts in one part of a network can otherwise\nresult in synchronization problems and cascading failures.\n\n\n\nElectricity is transmitted at high voltages (110 kV or above) to reduce the\nenergy lost in long-distance transmission. Power is usually transmitted through\noverhead power lines. Underground power transmission has a significantly higher\ncost and greater operational limitations but is sometimes used in urban areas or\nsensitive locations.\n\nA key limitation in the distribution of electric power is that, with minor\nexceptions, electrical energy cannot be stored, and therefore must be generated\nas needed. A sophisticated control system is required to ensure electric\ngeneration very closely matches the demand. If the demand for power exceeds the\nsupply, generation plants and transmission equipment can shut down which, in the\nworst cases, can lead to a major regional blackout, such as occurred in the US\nNortheast blackouts of 1965, 1977, 2003, and other regional blackouts in 1996\nand 2011. To reduce the risk of such failures, electric transmission networks\nare interconnected into regional, national or continental wide networks thereby\nproviding multiple redundant alternative routes for power to flow should\n(weather or equipment) failures occur. Much analysis is done by transmission\ncompanies to determine the maximum reliable capacity of each line (ordinarily\nless than its physical or thermal limit) to ensure spare capacity is available\nshould there be any such failure in another part of the network.\n","linknr":729,"url":"Electric_power_transmission","recorded":1362673108,"links":71,"instances":["1886","electric_power_transmission","engineering","electrical","electric_power","unit"],"pdf":["http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/primer.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/primer.pdf","http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf","http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf","http://www.aep.com/about/transmission/docs/transmission-facts.pdf","http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/environment/info/aspen/deltasub/pea/16_corona_and_induced_currents.pdf","http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/docs/emf-02.pdf","http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/docs/emf-02.pdf","http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf","http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf"],"categories":["Electric
