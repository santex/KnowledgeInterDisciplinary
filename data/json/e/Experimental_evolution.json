{"cursor":"14676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn evolutionary and experimental biology, the field of 'experimental evolution'\nis concerned with testing hypotheses and theories of evolution by use of\ncontrolled experiments. Evolution may be observed in the laboratory as\npopulations adapt to new environmental conditions and/or change by such\nstochastic processes as random genetic drift. With modern molecular tools, it is\npossible to pinpoint the mutations that selection acts upon, what brought about\nthe adaptations, and to find out how exactly these mutations work. Because of\nthe large number of generations required for adaptation to occur, evolution\nexperiments are typically carried out with microorganisms such as bacteria,\nyeast or viruses. However, laboratory\nstudies with foxes [http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/2/early-canid-\ndomestication-the-farm-fox-experiment/2 Early Canid Domestication: The Fox Farm\nExperiment], p.2, by Lyudmila N. Trut, Ph.D., Retrieved February 19, 2011\nand with rodents (see below) have shown that notable adaptations can occur\nwithin as few as 10-20 generations and experiments with wild guppies have\nobserved adaptations within comparable numbers of generations.\n","linknr":305,"url":"Experimental_evolution","recorded":1362483415,"links":27,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/SwEA98SE.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Keeney_et_al_2008_rimonabant.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Keeney_et_al_2008_rimonabant.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Bennett2003.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Bennett2003.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garland_2003.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/EE_Book_TOC.pdf","http://biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/SwalGa05.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Biology experiments"],"headings":["Evolution experiments throughout human history","Early experimental evolution","Modern experimental evolution","Lenski's long-term evolution experiment with ''Escherichia coli''","Garland's long-term experiment with laboratory house mice","Other examples","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg/220px-Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Dallinger_Incubator_J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png/220px-Dallinger_Incubator_J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adaptation","biology"],["symmetry","biology"]],"members":["symmetry","adaptation"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Experimental_biology","Hypotheses","Evolution","Experiment","Stochastic","Genetic_drift","Molecular_biology","Mutation","Selection","Adaptation_(biology)","Generation","Microorganism","Bacterium","Yeast","Virus","Rodents","Guppy","Mixed-breed_dog","Great_Dane","Artificial_selection","Cabbage","Maize","Dog","Charles_Darwin","William_Dallinger","Unicellular_organism","Theodosius_Dobzhansky","Richard_Lenski","E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment","Theodore_Garland,_Jr.","Generations","VO2max","Adaptations","Endurance","Heart","Symmetry_(biology)","Motivation","Reward_system","Brain","Pharmacological","Dopamine","Endocannabinoid_system","ADHD","Ritalin","Stickleback","Artificial_selection","Domestication","Evolutionary_biology","Evolutionary_physiology","Genetics","Genomics_of_domestication","Quantitative_genetics","Selective_breeding","Tame_Silver_Fox","BIOS_Scientific_Publishers","Michigan_State_University","University_of_California","Inquiry-based_learning"]}
