Often\noperational efficiency is also greater with increasing scale, leading to lower\nvariable cost as well.\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations\nand at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an\nentire enterprise. For example, a large manufacturing facility would be expected\nto have a lower cost per unit of output than a smaller facility, all other\nfactors being equal, while a company with many facilities should have a cost\nadvantage over a competitor with fewer.\n\nSome economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and\nfriction loss of transportation an industrial equipment, have a physical or\nengineering basis.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger\nproduction returns through the use of division of labor. {{cite book\n  | last = Sullivan first = arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors =\n  | Steven M.

Common limits include\nexceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber and pulp\nand paper industry. A common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is\nsaturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomical\ndistances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher\ndefect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a\ncommodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will therefore\navoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller\n(usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from\ncommodity grade production to specialty products. Landes describes the\nproblem of new steel mills in late 19th century Britain being too large for the\nmarket and unable to economically produce short production runs of specialty\ngrades. Manufacture of specialty grades by small scale producers is a\ncommon practice in steel, paper and many commodity industries today.
