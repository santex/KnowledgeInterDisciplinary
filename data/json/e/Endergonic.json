By thermodynamic\nstandards, positive work, a form of energy, is defined as moving from the (the\nexternal region) to the system (the internal region). Thus, an endergonic\nprocess, as contrasted with an exergonic process, is one wherein the system\nabsorbs energy from the surroundings. As a result, during an endergonic process,\nenergy is put into the system, if the transformation occurs at constant pressure\nand temperature, âG > 0. An endergonic reaction is a chemical reaction that\nabsorbs energy in the form of work. A good example of a net endergonic process\nis photosynthesis. Also, in metabolism, an endergonic process is anabolic,\nmeaning, that energy is stored. In metabolism, catabolic and anabolic processes\nare coupled by ATP.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Endergonic","recorded":1362504985,"links":16,"instances":["thermodynamics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thermodynamics","Chemical thermodynamics"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work","thermodynamics"]],"members":["work"],"related":["Work_(thermodynamics)","Energy","System","Exergonic","Endergonic_reaction","Chemical_reaction","Photosynthesis","Metabolism","Anabolic","Adenosine_triphosphate","Exergonic","Exergonic_reaction","Exothermic","Endothermic","Exothermic_reaction","Endothermic_reaction","Warm-blooded","Warm-blooded"]}
