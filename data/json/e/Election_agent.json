{"cursor":"2674","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In elections in the United Kingdom, as well as in certain other similar\npolitical systems such as India's, an 'election agent' is the person legally\nresponsible for the conduct of a candidate's political campaign and to whom\nelection material is sent to by those running the election. In elections in the\nUnited Kingdom a candidate may be his or her own election agent. The Electoral\nCommission provides periodic guidance for candidates and agents of which the\nlatest is for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election.

Agents are also permitted to\noversee the polling and counting of votes to ensure the accuracy and\nimpartiality of the election, and may appoint polling and counting agents to\nassist them in these tasks. The number of polling and counting agents that can\nbe appointed is determined by the returning officer of the election and they\nmust be appointed by a set date laid out in the timetable of the election.\n\nAgents must usually have reached the age of majority and not be acting as a\nclerk or officer to the returning officer in the given election. Where a\ncandidate does not nominate an agent, they are their own agent.\n\nThe larger parties typically pay their election agents, and the role is\ngradually becoming a professional one as the similar (but not equivalent) role\nof campaign managers is in the United States.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Election_agent","recorded":1363352080,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/India","/wiki/Political_campaign","/wiki/Candidate","/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","#cite_note-EComm-1","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Returning_officer","/wiki/Count_(electoral)","/wiki/Voting","/wiki/Count_(electoral)","/wiki/Polling_agent","/wiki/Counting_agent","/wiki/Age_of_majority","/wiki/Polling_clerk","/wiki/Campaign_manager","/wiki/United_States","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Teller_(elections)","/wiki/Polling_agent","/wiki/Counting_agent","/wiki/Campaign_manager","/wiki/List_of_UK_Parliamentary_election_petitions","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-EComm_1-0","http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/83337/UKPGE-C-and-A-Final-web.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit&section=3","http://www.walsall.gov.uk/index/council_and_democracy/elections/becoming_a_councillor-faq.htm#10966","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&oldid=503180090","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_staffers","/wiki/Category:Legal_professions","/wiki/Category:Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Election+agent&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Election+agent","/wiki/Election_agent","/wiki/Talk:Election_agent","#","/wiki/Election_agent","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Election_agent","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Election_agent","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&oldid=503180090","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Election_agent&id=503180090","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Election+agent","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Election+agent&oldid=503180090&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Election_agent&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_agent","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["electoral","united_kingdom","elections"],"pdf":["http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/83337/UKPGE-C-and-A-Final-web.pdf"],"categories":["Political
