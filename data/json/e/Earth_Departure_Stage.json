The EDS is used to boost the rocket's payload into a parking orbit\naround the Earth and from there send the payload out of low Earth orbit to its\ndestination in a manner similar to that of the S-IVB rocket stage used on the\nSaturn V rockets that propelled the three-man Apollo missions to the Moon\nbetween 1968 and 1972.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Earth_Departure_Stage","recorded":1362535236,"links":30,"instances":["spacecraft","spacecraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ares (rocket family)","Rocket stages","Space Launch System"],"headings":["Ares V","Space Launch System","Other uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Earth_Departure_Stage_with_Altair_and_Orion_02-2008.jpg/270px-Earth_Departure_Stage_with_Altair_and_Orion_02-2008.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Constellation_logo_white.svg/100px-Constellation_logo_white.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/J-2X_concept_image_June_2006.png/60px-J-2X_concept_image_June_2006.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["altair","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft"],["altair","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft"]],"members":["orion","altair"],"related":["Ares_V","Altair_(spacecraft)","Orion_(spacecraft)","United_States","Ares_V","Space_Launch_System","S-IVB","Ares_V","Space_Launch_System","Orion_(spacecraft)","Altair_(spacecraft)","Ares_V","J-2X","Liquid_hydrogen","Liquid_oxygen","Space_Launch_System","J-2X","Liquid_hydrogen","Liquid_oxygen","Multistage_rocket","Shuttle-Derived_Launch_Vehicle","Ares_V","Space_Launch_System","Parking_orbit","Low_Earth_orbit","S-IVB","Saturn_V","Project_Apollo","Ares_V","J-2X","Liquid_oxygen","Liquid_hydrogen","NASA","Marshall_Space_Flight_Center","Huntsville,_Alabama","Project_Constellation","Space_Shuttle","Space_Shuttle_external_tank","Ares_V","Space_Shuttle_Main_Engine","Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster","RS-68","Delta_IV","Evolved_Expendable_Launch_Vehicle","Ares_V","Ullage_motor","Low-Earth_orbit","Ares_I","Orion_(spacecraft)","Trans_Lunar_Injection","Apollo_Spacecraft","Manned_Venus_Flyby","Apollo_Applications_Program","Heliocentric_orbit","Apollo_13","Apollo_17","Lunar_sortie","Space_Launch_System","J-2X","Lunar_sortie","Lunar_outpost","Orion_Asteroid_Mission","Near-Earth_Asteroid","Advanced_Technology_Large-Aperture_Space_Telescope","Sun","Lagrange_Point","Orion_Mars_Mission"]}
