The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment\nSoftware Association (formerly Interactive Digital Software Association), in\nresponse to criticism of violent content found in video games such as [[Night\nTrap]], [[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]], [[Lethal Enforcers]],\n[[Doom (video game)|Doom]], and other controversial video games portraying\nexcessively violent or intense sexual situations. The board assigns ratings to\ngames based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture\nrating systems used in many countries. In addition, content descriptors explain\nspecific types of content present in games. The ratings are intended to aid\nconsumers in determining a game's content and suitability. A game's rating is\ngenerally displayed on its box, in its media, in advertisements, and on the\ngame's website. [http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 What\nis the ESRB?] from the ESRB FAQ By July 2012 it had assigned more than\n22,000 ratings to titles submitted by more than 350\npublishers.

unless they\ncarry ESRB ratings.\n","linknr":550,"url":"Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board","recorded":1362892550,"links":60,"instances":["promotion","third_generation","content_delivery","ios","computing","united_states","series","computer_gaming"],"pdf":["http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf","http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf"],"categories":["Arts
