It secretes its essential product\nwithout the use of a duct directly into the bloodstream or else by diffusion\ninto its surrounding tissue (paracrine signaling) where it often affects only\ntarget cells near the release site.\n\nExamples of endocrine glands include the adrenal glands, located atop the\nkidneys and responsible for the secretion of certain hormones such as\nadrenaline, cortisol and others. The testes, sing: testicle, in males and\novaries in females are not only gonads, organs which generate male and female\ngerm cells respectively, but are also endocrine glands in that they produce\nvarious androgens and estrogens together known as steroidal sex hormones.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Exocrine","recorded":1362509117,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Exocrine system|","Glands"],"headings":["Further classification of exocrine glands","List of exocrine glands","See also","Additional images","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Gray1033.png/80px-Gray1033.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Gray1172.png/120px-Gray1172.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Gland","Sweat_gland","Salivary_gland","Mammary_gland","Pancreas","Liver","Paracrine","Adrenal_gland","Adrenaline","Cortisol","Testicle","Ovary","Gonad","Androgen","Estrogen","Steroid","Sex_hormone","Apocrine","Holocrine","Merocrine","Apocrine_sweat_glands","Skin","Bartholin's_glands","Vulva","Vagina","Anterior_lingual_glands","Tongue","Brunner's_glands","Duodenum","Bulbourethral_glands","Penis","Pre-ejaculate","Ciaccio's_glands","Lacrimal_glands","Human_eye","Cobelli's_glands","Esophagus","Cardia","Mucosa","Ebner's_glands","Tongue","Eccrine_sweat_glands","Skin","Esophageal_glands","Esophagus","Exocrine_pancreas","Pancreas","Fränkel's_glands","Vocal_cords","Gastric_chief_cell","Stomach","Glomus_coccygeum","Coccyx","Goblet_cells","Digestive_tract","Respiratory_tract","Crypts_of_Henle","Eyelids","Conjuctiva","Krause's_glands","Conjunctiva","Lieberkuhn's_gland","Intestines","Mucous_membrane","Littré's_glands","Spongy_portion_of_the_urethra","Mammary_gland","Breast","Meibomian_gland","Eyelids","Glands_of_Moll","Eyelids","Montgomery's_glands","Areola","Naboth's_glands","Cervix","Os_uteri","Olfactory_glands","Human_nose","Olfactory","Paneth_cells","Small_intestine","Parotid_gland","Mouth","Peyer's_patches","Ileum","Lymphatic","Prostate","Urethra","Urinary_bladder","Pyloric_glands","Stomach","Sebaceous_gland","Skin","Skene's_glands","Vagina","Sublingual_gland","Mouth","Submandibular_gland","Mouth","Sudoriparous_glands","Skin","Sigmund's_glands","Epitrochlear","Lymph_node","Suzanne's_gland","Alveolingual","Weber's_glands","Tongue","Glands_of_Zeis","Eyelids","List_of_specialized_glands_within_the_human_integumentary_system"]}
