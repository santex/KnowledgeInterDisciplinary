{"cursor":"30136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Enzyme catalysis' is the catalysis of chemical reactions by specialized\nproteins known as enzymes. Catalysis of biochemical reactions in the cell is\nvital due to the very low reaction rates of the uncatalysed reactions.\n\nThe mechanism of enzyme catalysis is similar in principle to other types of\nchemical catalysis. By providing an alternative reaction route the enzyme\nreduces the energy required to reach the highest energy transition state of the\nreaction. The reduction of activation energy (Ea) increases the number of\nreactant molecules with enough energy to reach the activation energy and form\nthe product.\n","linknr":476,"url":"Enzyme_catalysis","recorded":1362371307,"links":29,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf"],"categories":["Enzymes|*","Catalysis|*"],"headings":["Induced fit","Mechanisms of an alternative reaction route","Examples of catalytic mechanisms","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Induced_fit_diagram.svg/350px-Induced_fit_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Enzyme_catalysis_uniform%2Bdifferential_binding.png/200px-Enzyme_catalysis_uniform%2Bdifferential_binding.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Lysozyme_transition_state.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Inter_vs_intramolecular_reaction_rates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Serine_protease_catalysis.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Carboxypeptidase_catalysis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor","base","substrate","cell"],"related":["Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Protein","Enzymes","Biochemical","Cell_(biology)","Catalysis","Transition_state","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Conformational_change","Conformational_Proofreading","Active_site","Transition_state","Entropy","Intramolecular","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Nucleophile","Electrophile","Histidine","Acid_dissociation_constant","PH","Ionic_bonds","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Amino_acid","Lysine","Arginine","Aspartic_acid","Glutamic_acid","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Zinc","Protease","Chymotrypsin","Trypsin","Schiff_base","Amine","Lysine","Aldolase","Glycolysis","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Thiamine_pyrophosphate","Aspartate_transaminase","Pyruvate_dehydrogenase","Quantum_tunneling","Tryptamine","Triose_phosphate_isomerase","Triose","Isomer","Dihydroxyacetone_phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Trypsin","Serine_protease","Protein","Lysine","Arginine","Aldolase","Fructose_1,6-bisphosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Dihydroxyacetone_phosphate","DHAP","Enzyme_assay","Enzyme_kinetics","Protein_dynamics","Quantum_tunnelling","The_Proteolysis_Map","Time_resolved_crystallography","Enzyme_promiscuity"]}
