The following\nyear James Douglas went out to Vancouver Island intending to set up a trading\npost for the Hudson's Bay Company. After looking at the shores of Esquimalt\nHarbour he decided they were too densely wooded for development so he opted to\nbuild what would become Fort Victoria on the shores of the adjacent Victoria\nHarbour and thereby establish what would become the city of Victoria. Pandora\nAvenue in Victoria is named in honour of the survey ship, which in turn was\nnamed after Pandora of Greek mythology.\n\nIn 1848 arrived at Esquimalt and became the first Royal Navy vessel based there.\nShe was commanded by Captain George William Courtenay, after whom Courtenay,\nBritish Columbia is named.\n\nFrom 3 July 1850 to February 1854 Augustus Leopold Kuper was Captain of from her\ncommissioning at HMNB Devonport. He sailed her to the southeast coast of America\nand then to Esquimalt. Kuper Island in the Strait of Georgia, off the east coast\nof Vancouver Island, was named for Captain Kuper after he surveyed the area from\n1851–1853. Thetis Island and Thetis Lake are named for the survey ship. In\n1852 sailors from the Thetis built a trail through the forest linking the\nEsquimalt Harbour with the Victoria Harbour and Fort Victoria. The trail would\neventually be paved and is now known as Old Esquimalt Road (it runs parallel to\nand just north of Esquimalt Road).\n\nIn the summer of 1854 several ships, including , , , , and set out from\nValparaÃ­so and sailed across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Marquesas Islands\nthen on to Honolulu where they met a French fleet of warships. In late August\nthe combined fleets sailed to Russia to engage in the Siege of Petropavlovsk\nat which Commander-in-Chief Pacific Station David Price died. Captain of the\nPique Frederick William Erskine Nicolson was brevetted and took command of\nthe British naval forces from 31 August 1854 until the arrival of the next\nCommander-in-Chief.\n\nOn 25 November 1854 Rear Admiral Henry William Bruce who had been at the West\nAfrica Squadron was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Pacific. Upon arrival at\nEsquimalt Bruce asked Governor James Douglas to provide the navy with a hospital\nto receive the expected sick and wounded from the Crimean War. In 1855 three\nwooden huts were built on Duntze Head, which would also be known as Hospital\nPoint. The buildings\nwere the first shore establishment of the Royal Navy at Esquimalt.\n\nIn 1859 the British Colony of Vancouver Island started to construct lighthouses\non the approaches to Esquimalt and Victoria Harbours in part to support the\nRoyal Navy and in part to support civilian navigation amidst the Fraser gold\nrush and other gold rushes. Fisgard Light was illuminated on 16 November 1860\nand Race Rocks Light was lit on 26 December 1860.\n\nIn 1865 the facilities in Esquimalt were recognized as an alternate base for the\nPacific Station which was based in ValparaÃ­so. The emphasis of the station\nstarted shifting more to British Columbia as the United Kingdom's economic\ninterests shifted northward. The move also allowed the\nAdmiralty to avoid involvement in the Chincha Islands War (1864–1866)\nbetween Spain, Chile, and Peru.\n\nIn the late 1860s and early 1870s any navy vessel in need of hull repair at\nEsquimalt had to be taken to shipyards in Seattle, Washington in the United\nStates. To remove the dependence on American shipyards a graving dock was\nconstructed at Esquimalt starting in 1876. The\ngraving dock was commissioned in 1887, having cost $1,177,664\nto build. became the first vessel to use the new\ndrydock on 20 July 1887. In its first seven years\nof use the graving dock serviced 24 merchant ships and 70 navy ships. From 1887 through 1927 the graving dock averaged work\non 21 vessels per year. Although the original\ngraving dock was large enough to accommodate the largest ships in the British\nPacific fleet at the time of its construction, by the early 20th century larger\nships were routinely being built. In 1924 the government of Canada built a\nlarger graving dock at Esquimalt that could accommodate ships up to Panamax\nsize. The naval\ngraving dock was put out of use until HMCS Coaticook docked there on August 31,\n1945..\n\nEsquimalt was vacated by the British Royal Navy at sunset on 1 March 1905. The Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries took over control\nof the shore establishment and the responsibility of enforcing control of\nCanada's maritime interests in the area after the Royal Navy left. After passage\nof the Naval Service Bill in 1910 there was a Canadian Naval Service (CNS) that\ncontrolled the base and the CNS became the Royal Canadian Navy in 1911. In the\n1960s a consolidation of defence forces in Canada led to its reformation as the\nCanadian Forces Base Esquimalt. It is now home to the Pacific Fleet of the Royal\nCanadian Navy.\n\nThe dockyard, along with three nearby sites (the former Royal Navy Hospital, the\nVeteransâ Cemetery and the Cole Island Magazine) were designated the Esquimalt\nNaval Sites National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.\n","linknr":370,"url":"Esquimalt_Royal_Navy_Dockyard","recorded":1375083820,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Esquimalt_Royal_Navy_Dockyard&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Esquimalt_Royal_Navy_Dockyard&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Esquimalt","/wiki/British_Columbia","/wiki/File:Islander_(steamship)_in_Esquimalt_BC_drydock_1890s.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Islander_%28steamship%29_in_Esquimalt_BC_drydock_1890s.JPG/100px-Islander_%28steamship%29_in_Esquimalt_BC_drydock_1890s.JPG","/wiki/SS_Islander","/wiki/Graving_dock","/wiki/Shipyard","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Esquimalt_Royal_Navy_Dockyard&params=48_25_52_N_123_25_54_W_type:landmark_region:CA-BC","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Canada","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1868-1921.svg/23px-Canadian_Red_Ensign_1868-1921.svg.png","/wiki/Fisheries_and_Oceans_Canada","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Canadian_Blue_Ensign_1921-1957.svg/22px-Canadian_Blue_Ensign_1921-1957.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Naval_Jack_of_Canada.svg/22px-Naval_Jack_of_Canada.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy","/wiki/Pacific_Station","#cite_note-naden-1","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Navy","/wiki/Canadian_Forces","/wiki/Maritime_Forces_Pacific","#cite_note-bruce-2","/wiki/Robert_Lambert_Baynes","#cite_note-davis-3","#cite_note-bickford_tower-4","#cite_note-naden-1","/wiki/Oregon_boundary_dispute","/wiki/Crimean_War","/wiki/Pig_War","/wiki/Alaska_boundary_dispute","/wiki/Template:Royal_Navy_in_Canada","/wiki/Template_talk:Royal_Navy_in_Canada","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Royal_Navy_in_Canada&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Naval_Ensign_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/North_America_and_West_Indies_Station","/wiki/Pacific_Station","/wiki/Provincial_Marine","/wiki/Amherstburg_Royal_Naval_Dockyard","/wiki/Grand_River_Naval_Depot","/wiki/Royal_Naval_Dockyard,_Halifax","/wiki/Ile_aux_Noix","/wiki/Kingston_Royal_Naval_Dockyard","/wiki/Penetanguishene_Naval_Yard","/wiki/Navy_Island_Royal_Naval_Shipyard","/wiki/Naval_Shipyards,_York_(Upper_Canada)","/wiki/List_of_Royal_Navy_ships_in_North_America","/wiki/List_of_Royal_Navy_ships_in_the_Pacific_Northwest","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Esquimalt,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Esquimalt_Harbour","/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Valpara%C3%ADso","/wiki/Chile","/wiki/Pacific_Station","/wiki/Royal_Navy","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/HMS_Pandora","#cite_note-naden-1","/wiki/James_Douglas_(governor)","/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company","/wiki/Fort_Victoria_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/Victoria_Harbour_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia","/w/index.php?title=Pandora_Avenue&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pandora","/wiki/HMS_Constance","/wiki/Courtenay,_British_Columbia","#cite_note-naden-1","/wiki/Augustus_Leopold_Kuper","/wiki/HMS_Thetis_(1846)","/wiki/HMNB_Devonport","/wiki/Kuper_Island","/wiki/Strait_of_Georgia","/wiki/Vancouver_Island","/wiki/Thetis_Island","/wiki/Thetis_Lake","/wiki/HMS_President_(1829)","/wiki/HMS_Pique_(1834)","/wiki/HMS_Trincomalee","/wiki/HMS_Amphitrite","/wiki/HMS_Virago","/wiki/Pacific_Ocean","/wiki/Marquesas_Islands","/wiki/Honolulu","/wiki/Siege_of_Petropavlovsk","/wiki/David_Price_(Royal_Navy_officer)","/wiki/Brevet_(military)","/wiki/Rear_Admiral","/wiki/West_Africa_Squadron","/wiki/James_Douglas_(governor)","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Crimean_War","#cite_note-nicholson-5","#cite_note-bcgnis_15637-6","/wiki/Shore_establishment","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Colony_of_Vancouver_Island","/wiki/Fraser_gold_rush","/wiki/British_Columbia_gold_rushes","/wiki/Fisgard_Lighthouse_National_Historic_Site","/wiki/Race_Rocks_Light","#cite_note-fisgard-7","#cite_note-racerocks_history-8","/wiki/Pacific_Station","#cite_note-naden-1","/wiki/Admiralty","/wiki/Chincha_Islands_War","/w
