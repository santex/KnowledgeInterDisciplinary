property, or services from a\nperson, entity, or institution, through coercion. Refraining from doing harm is\nsometimes euphemistically called protection. Extortion is commonly practiced by\norganized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not\nrequired to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a\nrequirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is\nsufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the\nunlawful demanding and obtaining of something through force,<ref></ref> but\nadditionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such\nas pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant.<ref></ref>\n\nExtortion is distinguished from robbery. In armed robbery, the offender takes\ngoods from the victim with use of immediate force. In robbery, goods are taken\nor an attempt is made to take the goods against the will of another—with or\nwithout force. A bank robbery or extortion of a bank can be committed by a\nletter handed by the criminal to the teller. In extortion, the victim is\nthreatened to hand over goods, or else damage to their reputation or other harm\nor violence against them may occur. Under United States federal law extortion\ncan be committed with or without the use of force and with or without the use of\na weapon. A key difference is that extortion always involves a written or verbal\nthreat whereas robbery can occur without any verbal or written threat.\n\nBlackmail, which involves extortion, is when the offender threatens to reveal\ninformation about a victim or his family members that is potentially\nembarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money,\nproperty, or services is met.\n\nThe term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-\ngouging, though neither is legally considered extortion. It is also often used\nloosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against\ntheir will, to another, in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal\nconsequences.\n\nNeither extortion nor blackmail require a threat of a criminal act, such as\nviolence, merely a threat used to elicit actions, money, or property from the\nobject of the extortion. Such threats include the filing of reports (true or\nnot) of criminal behavior to the police, revelation of damaging facts (such as\npictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position), etc.\n","title":"extortion","headings":["United States","Similar crimes","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Blackmail","2: Coercion","2: Organized_crime","2: United_States","2: Price_gouging","1: Crime","1: Euphemism","1: Protection_racket","1: Groups_of_people","1: Threat","1: Violence","1: Pain_and_suffering","1: Robbery","1: Bank_robbery","1: Usury","1: Federal_crime","1: Interstate_commerce","1: Badger_game","1: Clip_joint","1: Confidence_trick","1: Fraud","1: Confidence","1: Cryptovirology","1: Danegeld","1: Dognapping","1: Dog","1: Purebred_dog","1: Loan_sharking","1: Nuclear_blackmail","1: Sextortion","1: Tallage","1: Terrorism","1: International_community","1: Tiger_kidnapping","1: Hostage","1: Ransom","1: Wheel_clamp","1: Protection_of_Freedoms_Act_2012","1: Bribery","1: Bid_rigging","1: Conflict_of_interest","1: Corruption_in_India","1: Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act","1: Group_of_States_Against_Corruption","1: Council_of_Europe","1: Influence_peddling","1: Money_trail","1: Pay_to_Play","1: Political_corruption","1: Principalâagent_problem","1: Transparency_International","1: Bribery_Act_2010","1: Canadian_criminal_law"]}
