It seeks to\nredefine the law in Scotland relating to the provision of special education to\nchildren with additional needs by establishing a framework for the policies of\ninclusion and generally practicing the \"presumption of mainstreaming\" in\nScottish education. The Act is an attempt to broaden the narrow definition of\nSpecial Educational Needs (SEN) which has typically been used to define children\nwith special needs.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004","recorded":1375055884,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg/140px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg.png","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Peter_Peacock","/wiki/Scottish_Executive","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Coming_into_force","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/11-educationAdditional/index.htm","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/asp_20040004_en_1.htm","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id?title=Education+%28Additional+Support+for+Learning%29+%28Scotland%29+Act+2004","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Royal_Assent#United_Kingdom","/wiki/Special_education","/wiki/Children","/wiki/Mainstreaming_in_education","/wiki/Education","#Special_Educational_Needs_.28SEN.29","#Principles","#Implementation","#Sources","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Human_resources","/wiki/Factors_of_production","/wiki/Special_school","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Bullied","/wiki/Gifted","/wiki/Bereavement","/wiki/Truant","/wiki/Behavioural","/wiki/Learning_disabilities","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Disabilities","/wiki/Deafness","/wiki/Blindness","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Duty","/wiki/Social_services","/wiki/Social_work","/wiki/Health_Boards","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Careers_Scotland","/wiki/Further_education","/wiki/Parents","/wiki/Carers","/wiki/Educational_assessment","/wiki/Mediation","/wiki/Disputes","/wiki/Grief_counseling","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=4","http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/inclusiveeducation/additionalsupportforlearning/theact.asp","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/20040004.htm","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/11-educationAdditional/11-EducationAdditionalSupportforLearningScotlandBillsummary.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2005/20050154.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2005/20050263.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2005/20050564.htm","#cite_ref-5","http://www.education.ed.ac.uk/adps/survey/02/record_of_needs/","#cite_ref-6","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2004/20040004.htm","/w/index.php?title=Education_(Additional_Support_for_Learning)_(Scotland)_Act_2004&action=edit&section=6","http://www.additionalsupportneeds.org.uk/","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/05/11112347/23484","http://www.cafamily.org.uk/eduscot.html","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_A
