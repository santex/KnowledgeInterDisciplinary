{"cursor":"3989","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Excretion' is the process by which waste products of metabolism and other non-\nuseful materials are eliminated from an organism. This is primarily carried out\nby the lungs, kidneys and skin. This is in contrast\nwith secretion, where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the\ncell. Excretion is an essential process in all forms of life.\n\nIn single-celled organisms, waste products are discharged directly through the\nsurface of the cell. Multicellular organisms utilize more complex excretory\nmethods. Higher plants eliminate gases through the stomata, or pores, on the\nsurface of leaves. Animals have special excretory organs.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Excreted","recorded":1362553581,"links":56,"instances":["physiology","biology","bird"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digestive system","Metabolism","Excretion"],"headings":["Non-mammalian","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Uric_Acid.svg/220px-Uric_Acid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Feces_and_uric-acid.jpg/220px-Feces_and_uric-acid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["egg","bird"],["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration","cell","egg"],"related":["Metabolism","Organism","Lungs","Kidneys","Skin","Secretion","Cell_(biology)","Microorganism","Multicellular_organism","Plant","Stomata","Carbon_dioxide","Photosynthesis","Guttation","Aquatic_animal","Ammonia","Solubility","Terrestrial_animal","Toxic","Bird","Uric_acid","Water","Egg_(bird)","Seabird","Beak","Insect","Malpighian_tubule","Metabolic_waste","Countercurrent_exchange","Eructation","Homeostasis","Osmoregulation","Respiration_(physiology)"]}
