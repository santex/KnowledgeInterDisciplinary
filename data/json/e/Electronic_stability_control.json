{"cursor":"44234","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Electronic Stability Control' ('ESC'), also referred to as 'electronic\nstability program' ('ESP') or 'dynamic stability control' ('DSC'), is a\ncomputerized technology [A. T. van Zanten, \"Bosch ESP Systems: 5 years of\nExperience\", SAE 2000-01-1633] [E. K. Liebemann, K. Meder, J. Schuh\nand G. Nenninger, \"Safety and Performance Enhancement: the Bosch Electronic\nStability Control (ESP).\" SAE 2004-21-0060.] that improves the safety of a\nvehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction\n(skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it\nautomatically applies the brakes to help \"steer\" the vehicle where the driver\nintends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as\nthe outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter\nundersteer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained.\nESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to\nminimize the loss of control. According to Insurance Institute for Highway\nSafety and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one-third of\nfatal accidents could have been prevented by the\ntechnology.\n","linknr":651,"url":"Electronic_stability_control","recorded":1362683899,"links":58,"instances":["carmaker","car","controls","company","automobile","automobile","automobile","tires","north_america_eighth_generation","motorsport","americas","automobile"],"pdf":["http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0136-O.pdf","http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0136-O.pdf","http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/resources/streaming/PDFs/2007annualreport.pdf","http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/resources/streaming/PDFs/2007annualreport.pdf","http://www.esafetyaware.eu/download/related_documents/esafetyaware_flyer.pdf","http://www.esafetyaware.eu/download/related_documents/esafetyaware_flyer.pdf","http://www.chooseesc.eu/download/press/University%20of%20Cologne_ESC_cost_benefit.pdf","http://www.chooseesc.eu/download/press/University%20of%20Cologne_ESC_cost_benefit.pdf","http://www.mazda.ca/Configurator/pdfs/eng/2010_Mazda3Sport_EN_EquipmentWalk.pdf","http://www.mazda.ca/Configurator/pdfs/eng/2010_Mazda3Sport_EN_EquipmentWalk.pdf","http://www.bendix.com/Lists/Bendix%20News/Attachments/122/Bendix_ESP_update.pdf","http://sites.google.com/site/jianbolu/PUBLICATION/SAE07.pdf","http://www.vv.se/filer/30825/11_1_antisladdsystem.pdf","http://www.vv.se/filer/30825/11_1_antisladdsystem.pdf","http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv19/05-0135-O.pdf","http://www.dot.gov.nt.ca/_live/documents/documentManagerUpload/Electronic%20Stability.pdf","http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv19/05-0135-O.pdf","http://www.carcrash.org/mediaweb/00003.pdf","http://idisk.mac.com/mpaineau-Public/PAINE_ESC_TESTS.pdf"],"categories":["Automotive
