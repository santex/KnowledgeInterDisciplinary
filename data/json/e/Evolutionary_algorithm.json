{"cursor":"11784","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In artificial intelligence, an 'evolutionary algorithm' (EA) is a subset of\nevolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization\nalgorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as\nreproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the\noptimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the\nfitness function determines the environment within which the solutions \"live\"\n(see also cost function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the\nrepeated application of the above operators. Artificial evolution (AE) describes\na process involving individual evolutionary algorithms; EAs are individual\ncomponents that participate in an AE.\n\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types\nof problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying\nfitness landscape; this generality is shown by successes in fields as diverse as\nengineering, art, biology, economics, marketing, genetics, operations research,\nrobotics, social sciences, physics, politics and chemistry.\n\nTechniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological\nevolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes.\nThe computer simulations [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] and [[Avida]]\nattempt to model macroevolutionary dynamics.\n\nIn most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting\nfactor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function\nevaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this\ndifficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems;\ntherefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem\ncomplexity.\n\nA possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear\ngenotype-phenotype distinction. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a\ncomplex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype. This\nindirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e.\nreduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the\nevolvability of the organism. G.S.

Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny, or\nartificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns.
