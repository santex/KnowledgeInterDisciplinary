      "text" : "\n\n\nAn 'expert' (; also called 'cognoscente'<ref></ref>) is someone widely\nrecognized as a reliable source of or skill whose faculty for judging or\ndeciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by their\npeers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more\ngenerally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research,\nexperience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called\nin for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the\nparticulars of a field of study. An expert can be, by virtue of credential,\ntraining, education, profession, publication or experience, believed to have\nspecial knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient\nthat others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion.\nHistorically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was\nusually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.\n\nExperts have a prolonged or intense experience through practice and education in\na particular field. In specific fields, the definition of expert is well\nestablished by consensus and therefore it is not necessary for an individual to\nhave a professional or academic for them to be accepted as an expert. In this\nrespect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely\nrecognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs\nand the care of sheep. Another example from computer science is that an expert\nsystem may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often\noutperforming human beings at particular tasks. In law, an expert witness must\nbe recognized by argument and authority.\n\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert\nknowledge and exceptional performance in terms of cognitive structures and\nprocesses. The fundamental research endeavor is to describe what it is that\nexperts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most\npeople assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have\ninvestigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.<ref\nname='Ericsson1989'></ref>\n",
