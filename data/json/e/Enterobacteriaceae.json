Other disease-causing bacteria in this family include [[Proteus]],\n[[Enterobacter]], [[Serratia]], and [[Citrobacter]]. This family is the only\nrepresentative in the order Enterobacteriales of the class Gammaproteobacteria\nin the phylum Proteobacteria. Phylogenetically, in the\nEnterobacteriales, several peptidoglycan-less insect endosymbionts form a sister\nclade to the Enterobacteriaceae, but as they are not validly described, this\ngroup is not officially a taxon; examples of these species are [[Sodalis]],\n[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]], [[Wigglesworthia]], [[Baumannia]] and\n[[Blochmannia]], but not formers rickettsias. Members of\nthe Enterobacteriaceae can be trivially referred to as enterobacteria, as\nseveral members live in the intestines of animals. In fact, the etymology of the\nfamily is enterobacterium with the suffix to designate a family (aceae) â not\nafter the genus [[Enterobacter]] (which would be \"Enterobacteraceae\")â and the\ntype genus is [[Escherichia]].\n","linknr":672,"url":"Enterobacteriaceae","recorded":1362500897,"links":47,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.hpa-standardmethods.org.uk/documents/bsopid/pdf/bsopid16.pdf"],"categories":["Proteobacteria","Enterobacteria|*","Gram-negative bacteria"],"headings":["Characteristics","Identification of Enterobacteriaceae","Antibiotic resistance","Examples/classification","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Citrobacter_freundii.jpg/240px-Citrobacter_freundii.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"]],"members":["fermentation"],"related":["Bacteria","Proteobacteria","Gammaproteobacteria","Gram-negative","Bacteria","Symbiosis","Pathogenic_bacteria","Gammaproteobacteria","Proteobacteria","Peptidoglycan","International_Code_of_Nomenclature_of_Bacteria","Genus","Bacillus","Gram-negative","Facultative_anaerobe","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Lactic_acid","Nitrate","Nitrite","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Flagella","Gut_flora","Intestines","Parasitism","Model_organism","Genetics","Biochemistry","Fimbriae","Endotoxin","Genera","Phenol_red","Tryptone","Phenylalanine","Methyl_red","Voges-Proskauer_test","Glucose","Catalase","Nutrient_agar","Oxidase_test","Nutrient_agar","Oxidase","Gelatinase","Carbapenem","Phlomobacter"]}
