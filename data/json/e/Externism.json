{"cursor":"5159","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Externism' is a fictional philosophical theory proposed by the famous\nfictitious Czech genius JÃ¡ra Cimrman. This character appears in many plays by\nauthors from the JÃ¡ra Cimrman Theatre in Prague. The first act of the theatre\nperformances is usually filled with a lecture on Cimrman's personality,\nfollowed by a theatre play, which is pretended to be written by this fictional\nauthor. The theory of Externism is described in a monologue by a\nCimrmanologist having a lecture on JÃ¡ra Cimrman's significance in the field of\nphilosophy in the first act of the theatre play [[Akt (theatre play)|Akt]]\n([[English language|English]]: The Nude) by ZdenÄk SvÄrÃ¡k, Ladislav Smoljak\nand JiÅÃ­ Å ebÃ¡nek .\n\nThis epistemological theory contradicts the traditional theory of solipsism.\nWhile solipsists believe that only their individual self exists and the external\nworld does not, JÃ¡ra Cimrman came with the idea that it is the external world\nwhich exists and the philosopher's individual self does not.\n\nAt first this idea met a huge disagreement among philosophers. JÃ¡ra Cimrman was\ninvited to defend his theory to the philosophical congress in Basel. The key\ncounterargument that he had to face was: How could a non-existing consciousness\ncreate a theory?\n\nJÃ¡ra Cimrman replied that the fact that he does not exist does not mean he is\nnot perceptible. He compared the world to a space with a small place in the\nmiddle, where JÃ¡ra Cimrman is missing. If we take a piece of paper with a hole\nin the middle, the paper can be compared to the external world and the hole\n(which is clearly visible) to the non-existing philosopher. Stretching and\ncontracting the space results in the opposite change in the form of the hole.\nThis movement can be viewed as a process of philosopher's thinking.\n\nLater Cimrman elaborated the theory into more detail, as cimrmanologists found\nout when reading Albert Einstein's correspondence. He proposed that even other\nobjects in our world do not exist in the way it is usually thought. In fact, an\nobject is located in the place where we think it is not, and it is not in the\nplace where we consider it to be. For example, if you take a piece of chalk, the\nchalk forms a huge mass all around itself, where the chalk may be, with a small\nbubble inside, where the chalk is definitely not.\n\nAlbert Einstein considered the theory to be \"funny\", which Cimrmanologists read\nas an expression of admiration. However, he had some objections as well. \"As a\nphysicist, I have to point out that it makes no difference if you call an object\n'emptiness' and the emptiness 'object',\" he wrote, \"It is just a ping-pong with\nthe words.\"\n\nCimrman's rival in the field of philosophy was F. C. Bohlen (another fictitious\nphilosopher). He owned a pharmacy and was known for using rude words. According\nto this vulgar materialist (which also means \"pharmacist\" in Czech), the truth\nis the basic principle of our knowledge. In the beginning of the learning\nprocess, the truth is inaccurate and we make it more precise. Finally, we know\neverything.\n\nOppositively, Cimrman stated that in the beginning of every learning process,\nour knowledge is formed by a mistake, which is precise, and we must disconfirm\nit. Finally, we know nothing. Despite this, Cimrman cannot be considered to be\nan agnostic or nihilist. On the contrary, he sees the learning process\npositively as a process of disproving the initial mistake. Thus we can finally\nstand face-to-face with the Universe, having our head clear and empty.\n\nThe fact that in the end we know nothing is just a logical consequence of\nCimrman's externism. The example with the chalk showed that in the learning\nprocess, when we try to get nearer to an object, we always reach a place where\nthe object is not. Therefore, in the end of the process, we know nothing but we\nknow it exactly.\n\nThe theory can be easily applied to the whole of existence, except for the\ntheory itself. When doing so, we seemingly disprove it: either it is a\nmistake, or we do not know it. Therefore, Cimrman came with a revolutionary\nsolution: Cimrman's step aside. Thus he, just for a little while, appeared in\nthe world of vulgar materialism, and could confirm his theory as valid. The\nconclusions of both theories he joined together with a colon - \"We know\neverything: We know nothing.\"\n","linknr":119,"url":"Externism","recorded":1375067771,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Writing_about_fiction","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Writing_about_fiction","/wiki/File:Cimrman_autobusta.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Cimrman_autobusta.jpg/150px-Cimrman_autobusta.jpg","/wiki/File:Cimrman_autobusta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Fiction","/wiki/Philosophical_theory","/wiki/Czech_people","/wiki/J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman","/w/index.php?title=J%C3%A1ra_Cimrman_Theatre&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Act_(theater)","/wiki/Philosophy","/w/index.php?title=Akt_(theatre_play)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Zden%C4%9Bk_Sv%C4%9Br%C3%A1k","/wiki/Ladislav_Smoljak","/w/index.php?title=Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_%C5%A0eb%C3%A1nek&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Epistemology","/wiki/Solipsism","/wiki/Basel","/wiki/Counterargument","/wiki/Perception","/wiki/Albert_Einstein","/wiki/Materialist","/wiki/Czech_language","/wiki/Truth","/wiki/Knowledge","/wiki/Cognition","/wiki/Error","/wiki/Agnostic","/wiki/Nihilism","/wiki/Universe","/wiki/Logic","/wiki/Existence","/wiki/Logical_consequence","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit&section=1","http://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/texty/externismus.html","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NxRGBJhibg&NR","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit&section=2","http://www.zizkovskedivadlo-jc.cz/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Externism&oldid=565398084","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Humour","/wiki/Category:Fictional_philosophies","/wiki/Category:Czech_culture","/wiki/Category:Czech_philosophy","/wiki/Category:Epistemological_theories","/wiki/Category:Articles_that_need_to_differentiate_between_fact_and_fiction_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_that_need_to_differentiate_between_fact_and_fiction","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Externism&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Externism","/wiki/Externism","/wiki/Talk:Externism","#","/wiki/Externism","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Externism","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Externism","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Externism&oldid=565398084","/w/index.php?title=Externism&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2333951","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Externism&id=565398084","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Externism","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Externism&oldid=565398084&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Externism&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externismus","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externisme","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2333951#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externism","//wikimediafound
