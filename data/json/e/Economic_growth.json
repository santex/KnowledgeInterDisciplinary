It is\n conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real [[gross\n domestic product]], or real GDP. [http://www.statista.com/statistics/197039/growth-of-the-global-\n gross-domestic-product-gdp/ Statistics on the Growth of the Global Gross\n Domestic Product (GDP) from 2003 to 2013], IMF, October 2012. Growth is\n usually calculated in real terms, i.e. inflation-adjusted terms, in order to\n obviate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of the goods produced.\n In economics, \"economic growth\" or \"economic growth theory\" typically refers to\n growth of potential output, i.e., production at \"full employment\".\n\nAs an area of study, economic growth is generally distinguished from\n[[development economics]]. The former is primarily the study of how countries\ncan advance their economies. The latter is the study of the economic aspects of\nthe development process in low-income countries. See also Economic development.\n\nSince economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure.\n","linknr":798,"url":"Economic_growth","recorded":1362374717,"links":90,"instances":["real_growth_rate","economics","humanity","scientist","economist","historical","economics","conservation","science_historian","economist","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf","http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf","http://www.abundancedebunked.com/downloads/Ayres-TheRoleOfPhysicalWork.pdf","http://www.abundancedebunked.com/downloads/Ayres-TheRoleOfPhysicalWork.pdf","http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf","http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf","http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa364.pdf","http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa364.pdf","http://www.fraw.org.uk/files/economics/ayres_2001.pdf","http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf","http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf","http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers2/Warr.pdf","http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers2/Warr.pdf","http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp2002/2002-52.pdf","http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp2002/2002-52.pdf","http://www.signallake.com/innovation/CreativeDestructionModelMarch1992.pdf","http://www.iser.uaa.alaska.edu/iser/people/colt/econ337_f03/acemoglu_institutions_aer2001.pdf","http://econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Courses/Readings/MankiwRomerWeil.pdf","http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf","http://www.iisg.nl/research/jvz-research.pdf"],"categories":["Economic
