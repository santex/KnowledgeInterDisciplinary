{"cursor":"3217","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Engineering notation' is a version of scientific notation in which the powers\nof ten must be multiples of three (i.e., they are powers of a thousand, but\nwritten as, for example, 10 6 instead of 1000 2).\nAs an alternative to writing powers of 10, SI prefixes can be used, which also\nusually provide steps of a factor of a thousand. Except in the case of\nsquare and cubic units: in this case the SI prefixes provide only steps of a\nfactor of one million or one billion.\n\nCompared to normalized scientific notation, one disadvantage of using SI\nprefixes and engineering notation is that significant figures are not always\nreadily apparent. For example, 500 Âµm and 500 Ã 10 â6 m cannot\nexpress the uncertainty distinctions between 5 Ã 10 â4 , 5.0 Ã\n10 â4 , and 5.00 Ã 10 â4 m. This can be solved by changing\nthe range of the coefficient in front of the power from the common 1â1000 to\n0.001â1.0. In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be impractical.\nIn the previous example, 0.5, 0.50, or 0.500 mm would have been used to\nshow uncertainty and significant figures. It is also common to state the\nprecision explicitly, such as \"47 kΩ Â±5%\"\n\nAnother example: when the speed of light (exactly 299 792 458 m/s by the\ndefinition of the meter and second) is expressed as 3.00 Ã 10 8 m/s or\n3.00 Ã 10 5 km/s then it is clear that it is between 299 500 and 300\n500 km/s, but when using 300 Ã 10 6 m/s, or 300 Ã 10 3\nkm/s, 300 000 km/s, or the unusual but short 300 Mm/s, this is not clear. A\npossibility is using 0.300 Gm/s, convenient to write, but somewhat impractical\nin understanding (writing something large as a fraction of something even\nlarger; in a context of larger numbers expressed in the same unit this could be\nconvenient, but that is not applicable here).\n\n\nEngineering notation, as used in civil and mechanical engineering (United\nStates), uses the following notation where:\n\n3. Ã 10 â9\n\ncan be written as\n\n4.0Eâ9 or 3.0eâ9\n\nThe E or e should not be confused with the exponential ''e'' which holds a\ncompletely different significance. In the latter case, it would be shown that\n3e â8 â 0.001 006.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Engineering_notation","recorded":1362552511,"links":21,"instances":["mathematical_constant"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering|Notation, Engineering","Numeral systems","Notation"],"headings":["See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Numbers.svg/32px-Numbers.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["e","mathematical_constant"]],"members":["e"],"related":["Scientific_notation","SI_prefix","Significant_figures","Uncertainty","Speed_of_light","E_(mathematical_constant)","SI","Significant_figures","Scientific_notation"]}
