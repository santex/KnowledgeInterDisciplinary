In\ndemocratic societies, individuals or groups that advocate the replacement of\ndemocracy with an authoritarian regime are usually considered to be extremists;\nin authoritarian societies, people who espouse democratic or otherwise liberal\nideals are labelled as extremists by the ruling class or government.\n\nExtremism is usually contrasted with moderation, and extremists with moderates\n(for example, in contemporary discussions in Western countries of Islam, or of\nIslamic political movements, it is common for there to be a heavy stress on the\ndistinction between extremist and moderate Muslims, and it is also not uncommon\nto necessarily define distinctions regarding extremist Christians as opposed to\nmoderate Christians, as in countries such as the United States).\n\nPolitical agendas perceived as extremist often include those from the far left\nor far right as well as fundamentalism or fanaticism.\n\nThe term extremism is almost invariably used pejoratively, however the term may\nalso sometimes be associated with person(s) who have different view(s) which is\nnot consistent with the existing norm(s).
