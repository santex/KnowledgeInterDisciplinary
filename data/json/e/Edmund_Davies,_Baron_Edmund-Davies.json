{"cursor":"5744","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Herbert Edmund Edmund-Davies, Baron Edmund-Davies', PC (15 July 1906 â 26\nDecember 1992) was a British judge.\n\nBorn 'Herbert Edmund Davies' at Mountain Ash in Mid Glamorgan, he was the third\nson of Morgan John Davies and Elizabeth Maud Edmunds. Davies was educated at the\nMountain Ash Grammar School, King's College London and Exeter College, Oxford,\nwhere he received the Vinerian Scholarship. Called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in\n1929, he worked as examiner and lecturer at the London School of Economics in\n1930 and 1931. During the Second World War, he served in the Army Officers'\nEmergency Reserve and in the Royal Welch Fusiliers.\n\nHe was Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil from 1942 to 1944, of Swansea from 1944 to\n1953 and of Cardiff from 1953 to 1958. Between 1953 and 1964, Davies was\nchairman of the Denbighshire Quarter Sessions. He was knighted in 1958 (becoming\n'Sir Edmund Davies') when the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir appointed him a High\nCourt Judge of the Queen's Bench Division (as 'Mr Justice Edmund Davies'), a\npost he held until 1966. Davies's name almost immediately attracted public\nattention when it fell to him to try a German named Guenther Podola, who had\nshot and killed a police sergeant; Podola was convicted of capital murder and\nhanged in November 1959. In 1964 he was sent to Aylesbury to try the notorious\nGreat Train Robbery (1963) case. The severity of the sentences he passed became\nand has remained controversial.\n\nInvested to the Privy Council in 1966, he was a Lord Justice of Appeal (as 'Lord\nJustice Edmund Davies') from 1966 to 1974. In 1967 he was appointed by the\nSecretary of State for Wales as chair of the Tribunal that inquired into the\nAberfan Disaster. [http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/response/recovery_guidanc-\ne/case_studies/g1_aberfan.aspx UK Resilience website â National Recovery\nGuidance â Case Studies: The Aberfan Disaster] On 1 October 1974, he was\nappointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (\"Law Lord\") and was raised to the\nPeerage as 'Baron Edmund-Davies', of Aberpennar in the County of Mid Glamorgan.\nTo allow him to take this title, he changed his surname to \"Edmund-Davies\", so\nthat his given name, which had formed part of his judicial title for more than\n15 years, could be incorporated into his peerage.\n\nFollowing very severe problems with the recruitment and retention of police\nofficers in England and Wales because of chronically low pay, which had by then\nfallen far behind the pay for comparable occupations, in August 1977 Edmund-\nDavies was appointed by Labour Home Secretary Merlyn Rees MP to chair a\ncommission of inquiry into the negotiating machinery for police pay and\nconditions. His terms of reference were enlarged in December 1977 to include the\nlevels of pay. His report was published in July 1978 and recommended a\nsubstantial increase in pay for police officers â of the order of 45 per cent.\nHis recommendations were implemented in full in 1979 by the incoming\nConservative Government, and the essential elements of the Edmund-Davies pay\nregime have remained undisturbed ever since. The Edmund-Davies review has become\na cornerstone for police pay and the Police Federation of England and Wales â\nthe representative body for police officers up to and including the rank of\nChief Inspector â has tenaciously held onto the Edmund-Davies regime.\n\nIn 1981, Edmund-Davies retired as a Law Lord. From 1974 to 1985, he was Pro-\nChancellor of the University of Wales. Edmund-Davies was President of the London\nWelsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, from 1982 until\n1988.\n\nIn 1935, he married Sarah Eurwen Williams-James.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies","recorded":1375075976,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Mountain_Ash,_Rhondda_Cynon_Taf","/wiki/Mid_Glamorgan","/wiki/King%27s_College_London","/wiki/Exeter_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Vinerian_Scholarship","/wiki/Called_to_the_Bar","/wiki/Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/London_School_of_Economics","/wiki/Royal_Welch_Fusiliers","/wiki/Recorder_(judge)","/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil","/wiki/Swansea","/wiki/Cardiff","/wiki/High_Court_Judge","/wiki/Queen%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/Guenther_Podola","/wiki/Great_Train_Robbery_(1963)","/wiki/Privy_Council","/wiki/Lord_Justice_of_Appeal","/wiki/Aberfan_Disaster","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Lord_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Mid_Glamorgan","/wiki/Merlyn_Rees","/wiki/Police_Federation_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/University_of_Wales","/wiki/London_Welsh_Centre","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/R_v_Collins","/wiki/Wilson_v_Racher","/w/index.php?title=Whitehouse_v_Lemon_and_Gay_News_Ltd&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.swarb.co.uk/c/hl/1979Whitehouse-GayNews.html","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ukresilience.gov.uk/response/recovery_guidance/case_studies/g1_aberfan.aspx","#cite_ref-2","http://www.londonwelsh.org/archives/1796","/wiki/London_Welsh_Centre","/wiki/London_Welsh_Centre","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit&section=3","http://www.leighrayment.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=1&coll_id=657&expand=","/wiki/Sir_John_Williams,_1st_Baronet,_of_the_City_of_London","/wiki/Aberystwyth_University","/wiki/Thomas_Jones_(T._J.)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&oldid=546644928","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1906_births","/wiki/Category:1992_deaths","/wiki/Category:Royal_Welch_Fusiliers_officers","/wiki/Category:Law_lords","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Welsh_judges","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_King%27s_College_London","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Exeter_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Queen%27s_Bench_Division_judges","/wiki/Category:British_Army_personnel_of_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:Members_of_Gray%27s_Inn","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmund+Davies%2C+Baron+Edmund-Davies&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmund+Davies%2C+Baron+Edmund-Davies","/wiki/Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies","/wiki/Talk:Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies","#","/wiki/Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmund_Davies,_Baron_Edmund-Davies&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//e
