Along with mast cells, they also control\nmechanisms associated with allergy and asthma. They are granulocytes that\ndevelop during hematopoiesis in the bone marrow before migrating into blood.\n\nThese cells are eosinophilic or 'acid-loving' as shown by their affinity to coal\ntar dyes: Normally transparent, it is this affinity that causes them to appear\nbrick-red after staining with eosin, a red dye, using the Romanowsky method. The\nstaining is concentrated in small granules within the cellular cytoplasm, which\ncontain many chemical mediators, such as histamines and proteins such as\neosinophil peroxidase, ribonuclease (RNase), deoxyribonucleases, lipase,\nplasminogen, and major basic protein. These mediators are released by a process\ncalled degranulation following activation of the eosinophil, and are toxic to\nboth parasite and host tissues.\n\nIn normal individuals, eosinophils make up about 1-6% of white blood cells, and\nare about 12-17 micrometers in size. {{Cite book\n  | last = Young first = Barbara last2 = Lowe first2 = joseph o'connell last3 =\n  | Stevens first3 = Alan last4 = Heath first4 = John W. title = Wheater's\n  | Functional Histology publisher = Elsevier Limited year = 2006 edition = 5\n  | isbn = 0-443-06850-X}} They are found in the medulla and the junction\n  | between the cortex and medulla of the thymus, and, in the lower\n  | gastrointestinal tract, ovary, uterus, spleen, and lymph nodes, but not in\n  | the lung, skin, esophagus, or some other internal organs under normal\n  | conditions.
