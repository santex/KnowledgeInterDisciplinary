{"cursor":"10373","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Endophenotype' is a genetic epidemiology term which is used to parse behavioral\nsymptoms into more stable phenotypes with a clear genetic connection. The\nconcept was first coined by Bernard John and Kenneth R. Lewis in a paper\nattempting to explain the geographic distribution of grasshoppers. They claimed that the particular geographic\ndistribution could not be explained by the obvious and external \"exophenotype\"\nof the grasshoppers, but instead must be explained by their microscopic and\ninternal \"endophenotype.\"\n\nThe next major use of the term was in psychiatric genetics, to bridge the gap\nbetween high-level symptom presentation and low-level genetic variability, such\nas single nucleotide polymorphisms. It is\ntherefore more applicable to more heritable disorders, such as bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia. Since then, the concept\nhas expanded to many other fields, such as the study of ADHD \"Competing Core\nProcesses in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Do Working Memory\nDeficiencies Underlie Behavioral Inhibition Deficits\" Alzheimer's\ndisease , obesity , and cystic fibrosis. Some\nother terms which have a similar meaning but do not stress the genetic\nconnection as highly are \"intermediate phenotype\", \"biological marker\",\n\"subclinical trait\", \"vulnerability marker\", and \"cognitive marker\". The\nstrength of an endophenotype is its ability to differentiate between potential\ndiagnoses that present with similar symptoms.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Endophenotype","recorded":1362508951,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological psychiatry","Genetics","Bioindicators"],"headings":["Definition","For schizophrenia","For bipolar disorder","For suicide","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Genetic_epidemiology","Symptom","Phenotypes","Genetics","Population_distribution","Grasshopper","Psychiatric_genetics","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Alzheimer's_disease","Obesity","Cystic_fibrosis","Schizophrenia","Psychosis","Sensory_gating","Working_memory","Prepulse_inhibition","Reelin","FABP7","Prepulse_inhibition","CHRNA7","Bipolar_disorder","Face_perception","FMRI","Prefrontal_cortex","Anterior_cingulate_cortex","Striatum","Amygdala","Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","Cav1.2","Suicide","Impulsive-aggressive_behavior","Serotonin","5-HT1B_receptor","Biomarker"]}
