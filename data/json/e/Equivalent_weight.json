{"cursor":"15754","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Equivalent weight' (also known as 'gram equivalent') is a term which has been\nused in several contexts in chemistry. In its most general usage, it is the mass\nof one equivalent, that is the mass of a given substance which will: *supply or\nreact with one mole of hydrogen cations  in an acidâbase reaction; or\n*supply or react with one mole of electrons  in a redox reaction.\n\nEquivalent weight has the dimensions and units of mass, unlike atomic weight,\nwhich is dimensionless. Equivalent weights were originally determined by\nexperiment, but (insofar as they are still used) are now derived from molar\nmasses. Additionally, the equivalent weight of a compound can be calculated by\ndividing the molecular weight by the number of positive or negative electrical\ncharges that result from the dissolution of the compound.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Equivalent_weight","recorded":1362539280,"links":26,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","molecule","unit","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha06sec3.pdf","http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/etc/medialib/docs/Aldrich/Brochure/al_pp_ionx.pdf","http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/etc/medialib/docs/Aldrich/Brochure/al_pp_ionx.pdf"],"categories":["Stoichiometry","Amount of substance","Polymer chemistry"],"headings":["History","Use in general chemistry","Use in volumetric analysis","Use in gravimetric analysis","Use in polymer chemistry","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Equivalent_Wts_Larousse_1868.jpg/220px-Equivalent_Wts_Larousse_1868.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter.jpeg/220px-Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Titration.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/4/7/1477b2fce0a0cd877c58377e363119d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/b/32b3eaaebd34b9e2f15490e61fc077a3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/8/8/d885197cf517ee468f5543fe59fc6e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Ni%28dmg%292.JPG/220px-Ni%28dmg%292.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ion_exchange_resin_beads.jpg/220px-Ion_exchange_resin_beads.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["equivalent","chemistry"],["mole","unit"],["base","chemistry"],["water","molecule"],["salt","chemistry"],["copper(i_oxide"],["copper(ii_oxide"],["normality","chemistry"],["mass_fraction","chemistry"]],"members":["salt","base","equivalent","water","mole","mass_fraction","normality"],"related":["Chemistry","Mass","Equivalent_(chemistry)","Mole_(unit)","Hydrogen_cation","Acid–base_reaction","Electron","Redox_reaction","Dimensional_analysis","Unit_of_measurement","Atomic_weight","Dimensionless_quantity","Molar_mass","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Carl_Friedrich_Wenzel","Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter","John_Dalton","Chemical_element","Hydrogen","Dalton's_atomic_theory","Oxygen","Water_(molecule)","Gay-Lussac's_law","Charles_Frédéric_Gerhardt","Henri_Victor_Regnault","Stanislao_Cannizzaro","Karlsruhe_Congress","Atomic_theory","Joseph_Proust","Law_of_definite_proportions","Jean-Baptiste_Dumas","Chlorine","Hydrogen_chloride","Oxide","Salt_(chemistry)","Oxidation_state","Copper","Copper(I)_oxide","Copper(II)_oxide","Dulong–Petit_law","Specific_heat_capacity","Dmitri_Mendeleev","Periodic_table","Analytical_chemistry","Electronic_calculator","Molar_mass","Sulfuric_acid","Potassium_permanganate","Zinc","Zinc_oxide","Law_of_conservation_of_mass","Primary_standard","Analytical_chemistry","Volumetric_analysis","Sodium_hydroxide","Burette","Oxalic_acid","Potassium_hydrogen_phthalate","Potassium_hydrogen_iodate","Measurement_uncertainty","Normality_(chemistry)","Measurement_uncertainty","Gaussian_distribution","Measurement_uncertainty","Gravimetric_analysis","Precipitate","Mass_fraction_(chemistry)","Percentage","Nickel","Dimethylglyoxime","Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy","Calibration_curve","Polymer_chemistry","Reactive_polymer","Polyol","Isocyanate","Epoxy","Thermoset","Crosslinking","Ion-exchange_polymer"]}
