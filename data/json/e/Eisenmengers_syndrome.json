Eisenmenger's syndrome\nspecifically refers to the combination of systemic-to-pulmonary communication,\npulmonary vascular disease, and cyanosis.\n\nIt can cause serious complications in pregnancy,\nthough successful delivery has been reported.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Eisenmenger's_syndrome","recorded":1362575978,"links":27,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heart diseases","Health issues in pregnancy"],"headings":["Etymology","Etiology","Pathogenesis","Signs and symptoms","Treatment","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Eyzenmenger_sindromu.jpg/230px-Eyzenmenger_sindromu.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/ClubbingFingers1.jpg/250px-ClubbingFingers1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stasis","medicine"]],"members":["stasis"],"related":["CDC/BPA","Cardiac_shunt","Congenital_heart_defect","Vasculature","Pulmonary_hypertension","Right-to-left_shunt","Tetralogy_of_Fallot","Cyanosis","Pregnancy","Eponym","Atrial_septal_defect","Ventricular_septal_defect","Patent_ductus_arteriosus","Heart_disease","Cardiac_output","Hypertrophy","Cyanosis","Blue_Baby_Syndrome","Oxygen_saturation","Polycythaemia","Reticulocytes","Hyperviscosity_syndrome","Stasis_(medicine)","Heartâ€“lung_transplant","Lung_transplantation"]}
