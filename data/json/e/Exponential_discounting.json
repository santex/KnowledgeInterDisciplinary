{"cursor":"1296","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn economics 'exponential discounting' is a specific form of the discount\nfunction, used in the analysis of choice over time (with or without\nuncertainty). Formally, exponential discounting occurs when total utility\nis given by\n\n: U(\\{c_t\\}_{t=t_1}^{t_2})=\\sum_{t=t_1}^{t_2}\\delta^{t-t_1}(u(c_t)),\n\nwhere c t is consumption at time t, \\delta is the\nexponential discount factor, and u is the instantaneous utility function.\n\nIn continuous time, exponential discounting is given by\n\n: U(\\{c(t)\\}_{t=t_1}^{t_2})=\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} e^{-\\rho (t-\n:t_1)}u(c(t))\\,dt,\n\nExponential discounting implies that the marginal rate of substitution between\nconsumption at any pair of points in time depends only on how far apart those\ntwo points are. Exponential discounting is not dynamically inconsistent.\n\nFor its simplicity, the exponential discounting assumption is the most commonly\nused in economics. However, alternatives like hyperbolic discounting have more\nempirical support.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Exponential_discounting","recorded":1362899583,"links":12,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Intertemporal economics"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/9/cd9d9f69a9dceb57c1389fe8c9181a96.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/1/0/f10f03c9836c36537d2539196058bfa2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/0/f/80f2136bba81b283a5cf8cec6db267f1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["consumption","economics"]],"members":["consumption"],"related":["Economics","Discount_function","Intertemporal_choice","Uncertainty","Utility","Consumption_(economics)","Discount_factor","Instantaneous_utility_function","Continuous_time","Marginal_rate_of_substitution","Dynamically_inconsistent","Hyperbolic_discounting","Temporal_discounting","Hyperbolic_discounting","Intertemporal_choice"]}
