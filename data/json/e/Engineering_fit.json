{"cursor":"3125","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nFit refers to the mating of two mechanical components. Manufactured parts are\nvery frequently required to mate with one another. They may be designed to\nslide freely against one another or they may be designed to bind together to\nform a single unit. The most common fit found in the machine shop is that of a\nshaft in a hole.\n\nThere are three general categories of fits: 1) Clearance fits for when it may be\ndesirable for the shaft to rotate or slide freely within the hole, this is\nusually referred to as a \"sliding fit.\" 2) Interference fits for when it is\ndesirable for the shaft to be securely held within the hole, this is usually\nreferred to as an interference fit and 3) Transition fits for when it is\ndesirable that the shaft to be held securely, yet not so securely that it cannot\nbe disassembled, this is usually referred to as a Location or Transition fit.\n\nWithin each category of fit there are several classes ranging from high\nprecision and narrow tolerance (allowance) to lower precision and wider\ntolerance. The choice of fit is dictated first by the use and secondly by the\nmanufacturability of the parts.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Engineering_fit","recorded":1362672907,"links":19,"instances":["firearm","firearm","tool"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanical engineering","Metalworking terminology"],"headings":["Interference fits","Transition fits","[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Metric fits","Fitting","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lock","firearm"],["file","tool"],["hammer","firearm"]],"members":["hammer","lock","file"],"related":["Interference_fit","Interchangeable_parts","Lock_(firearm)","File_(tool)","Lapping","Craft","Gunsmith","Tool_and_die_maker","Hammer_(firearm)","Milling_machine","Interchangeable_parts","Statistical_interference","Coiled_spring_pins"]}
