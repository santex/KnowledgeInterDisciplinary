{"cursor":"11524","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe 'expansion card' (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in\ncomputing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical\nconnector, or 'expansion slot' on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser\ncard to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.\n\nOne edge of the expansion card holds the contacts (the edge connector or pin\nheader) that fit exactly into the slot. They establish the electrical contact\nbetween the electronics (mostly integrated circuits) on the card and on the\nmotherboard.\n\nConnectors mounted on the bracket allow the connection of external devices to\nthe card. Depending on the form factor of the motherboard and case, around one\nto seven expansion cards can be added to a computer system. 19 or more expansion\ncards can be installed in backplane systems. There are also other factors\ninvolved in expansion card capacity. For example, most graphics cards on the\nmarket as of 2010 are dual slot graphics cards, using the second slot as a place\nto put an active heat sink with a fan.\n\nSome cards are \"low-profile\" cards, meaning that they are shorter than standard\ncards and will fit in a lower height computer chassis. (There is a \"low profile\nPCI card\" standard that specifies a much smaller bracket and board\narea). The group of expansion cards that are used for external connectivity,\nsuch as network, SAN or modem cards, are commonly referred to as input/output\ncards (or I/O cards).\n\nThe primary purpose of an expansion card is to provide or expand on features not\noffered by the motherboard. For example, the original IBM PC did not provide\ngraphics or hard drive capability. In that case, a graphics card and an ST-506\nhard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface\nrespectively.\n\nIn the case of expansion of on-board capability, a motherboard may provide a\nsingle serial RS232 port or Ethernet port. An expansion card can be installed to\noffer multiple RS232 ports or multiple and higher bandwidth Ethernet ports. In\nthis case, the motherboard provides basic functionality but the expansion card\noffers additional or enhanced ports.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Expansion_card","recorded":1362675474,"links":44,"instances":["microarchitecture","computing","brand","technology"],"pdf":["http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventional/conventional_pci/lowp_ecn.pdf","http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventional/conventional_pci/lowp_ecn.pdf"],"categories":["Computer buses","Computer peripherals|","Motherboard expansion slot|"],"headings":["History","Expansion slot standards","Expansion card types","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Chassis-plans-Digital-IO-Card.jpg/220px-Chassis-plans-Digital-IO-Card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/PCI-Bus.jpg/220px-PCI-Bus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bus","computing"],["p5","microarchitecture"],["pentium","brand"],["fault","technology"]],"members":["p5","bus","pentium","fault"],"related":["Computing","Printed_circuit_board","Electrical_connector","Computer","Motherboard","Backplane","Riser_card","Expansion_bus","Edge_connector","Pin_header","Integrated_circuit","Computer_form_factor","Computer_case","Video_card","Heat_sink","Network_card","Storage_area_network","Modem","Input/output","IBM_PC","ST-506","Serial_port","Ethernet","Ethernet","Microcomputer","Micral","De_facto_standard","Altair_8800","Bus_(computing)","Apple_II","Apple_Macintosh","Intel_8080","Zilog_Z80","CP/M","S-100_bus","IBM","Industry_Standard_Architecture","IBM_Personal_Computer_XT","Micro_Channel_Architecture","Compaq","PC_97","VESA_Local_Bus","Central_processing_unit","PC/104","PCI_bus","P5_(microarchitecture)","Pentium_(brand)","Peripheral_Component_Interconnect","Bridging","Cardbus","PCMCIA","ExpressCard","Intel","Accelerated_Graphics_Port","Legacy_system","BIOS","Mini_PCI","Mini-ITX","Universal_Serial_Bus","ExpressCard","FireWire","IEEE_1394","Apple_Inc.","Apple_Inc.","Apple_II","Macintosh","Tandy_Corporation","Commodore_International","Amiga","Atari","Apple_II_peripheral_cards","NuBus","Central_processing_unit","BIOS","Sega_Genesis","Atari_2600","Tandy_1000","Tandy_1000","PCjr","Interrupt","Direct_memory_access","Fault_(technology)","PCI_Express","Accelerated_Graphics_Port","Conventional_PCI","Industry_Standard_Architecture","Micro_Channel_architecture","VESA_Local_Bus","PC_Card","ExpressCard","CompactFlash","SBus","SPARC","Sun_Microsystems","Amiga_Zorro_II","Amiga","NuBus","Macintosh","Video_card","Sound_card","Network_card","TV_tuner_card","Modem","Host_adapter","SCSI","RAID","POST_card","Compatibility_card","Physics_card","I-RAM","Solid-state_drive"]}
