{"cursor":"6043","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Electron transfer' (ET) occurs when an electron moves from an atom or a\nchemical species (e.g. a molecule) to another atom or chemical species. ET is a\nmechanistic description of the thermodynamic concept of redox, wherein the\noxidation states of both reaction partners change.\n\nNumerous biological processes involve ET reactions. These processes include\noxygen binding, photosynthesis, respiration, and detoxification. Additionally,\nthe process of energy transfer can be formalized as a two-electron exchange (two\nconcurrent ET events in opposite directions) in case of small distances between\nthe transferring molecules. ET reactions commonly involve transition metal\ncomplexes, Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the\nElements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-\n4.
