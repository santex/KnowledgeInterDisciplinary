He had previously been a five-star general in the United States Army\nduring World War II and served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in\nEurope; he had responsibility for planning and supervising the invasion of North\nAfrica in Operation Torch in 1942â43 and the successful invasion of France and\nGermany in 1944â45 from the Western Front. In 1951, he became the first supreme\ncommander of NATO.\n\nEisenhower was of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry and was reared in a large family\nin Kansas by parents with a robust work ethic and religious background. As one\nof six sons, he was conditioned by a competitive atmosphere which instilled self-\nreliance. He attended and graduated from West Point and later married and had\ntwo sons. After World War II, Eisenhower served as Chief of Staff under\nPresident Harry S. Truman, then assumed the post of President at Columbia\nUniversity. Ambrose (1983).\n\nEisenhower entered the 1952 presidential race as a Republican to counter the non-\ninterventionism of Senator Robert A. Taft and to crusade against \"Communism,\nKorea and corruption\". He won by a landslide, defeating Democrat Adlai Stevenson\nand ending two decades of the New Deal Coalition. In the first year of his\npresidency, Eisenhower deposed the leader of Iran in the 1953 Iranian coup\nd'Ã©tat and used nuclear threats to conclude the Korean War with China. His New\nLook policy of nuclear deterrence gave priority to inexpensive nuclear weapons\nwhile reducing the funding for conventional military forces; the goal was to\nkeep pressure on the Soviet Union and reduce federal deficits. In 1954,\nEisenhower first articulated the domino theory in his description of the threat\npresented by the spread of communism. The Congress agreed to his request in 1955\nfor the Formosa Resolution, which enabled him to prevent Chinese communist\naggression against Chinese nationalists and established the U.S. policy of\ndefending Taiwan. When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957, he had to play catch-\nup in the space race. Eisenhower forced Israel, the UK, and France to end their\ninvasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis of 1956. In 1958, he sent 15,000 US\ntroops to Lebanon to prevent the pro-Western government from falling to a Nasser-\ninspired revolution. Near the end of his term, his efforts to set up a summit\nmeeting with the Soviets collapsed because of the U-2 incident. Arthur\nSchlesinger, Jr. A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House (1965), pp.\n233, 238\n\nOn the domestic front, he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to\nthe end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of\nexecutive privilege. He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice\nPresident, Richard Nixon. He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal\nagencies and expanded Social Security.\n\nAmong his enduring innovations, he launched the Interstate Highway System; the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which led to the internet,\namong many invaluable outputs; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA), driving peaceful discovery in space; the establishment of strong science\neducation via the National Defense Education Act; and encouraging peaceful use\nof nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science & Technology,\n(2008).Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [http://www.eisenhowermemorial-\n.org/onepage/IKE%20&%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20(v2).pdf Source].\n\nIn social policy, he sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, for the first\ntime since Reconstruction to enforce federal court orders to desegregate public\nschools. He also signed civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 to protect the\nright to vote. He implemented desegregation of the armed forces in two years and\nmade five appointments to the Supreme Court. He was the first term-limited\npresident in accordance with the 22nd Amendment. Eisenhower's two terms were\npeaceful ones for the most part and saw considerable economic prosperity except\nfor a sharp recession in 1958â59. Eisenhower is often ranked highly among the\nU.S. Presidents.\n","linknr":3164,"url":"Eisenhower","recorded":1362267783,"links":275,"instances":["military","disambiguation","united_states","expeditionary_force","united_states","tunisia","united_states","disambiguation","united_states","usa","united_states","author","military","united_states","new_hampshire","united_states","belgium","magazine","policy","army","illinois","military","world_war_ii","united_states","brazil","united_states","belgium","armed_forces","texas"],"pdf":["http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20&%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20(v2).pdf","http://www.whha.org/whha_publications/publications_documents/whitehousehistory_21.pdf","http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf","http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf"],"categories":["1890 births","1969 deaths","American 5 star officers","American anti-communists","American military personnel of World War I","American military personnel of World War II","American people of German descent","American people of Swiss descent","American people of Swiss-German descent","American people of the Korean War","American Presbyterians","Army Black Knights football players","Cardiovascular disease deaths in Washington, D.C.","Cold War leaders","Collars of the Order of the Aztec Eagle","Companions of the Liberation","Dwight D.
