The meaning of a proposition includes\nhaving the quality or property of being either true or false, and as such\npropositions are claimed to be truthbearers.\n\nThe existence of propositions in sense (a) above, as well as the existence of\n\"meanings,\" is disputed by some philosophers. Where the concept of a \"meaning\"\nis admitted, its nature is controversial. In earlier texts writers have not\nalways made it sufficiently clear whether they are using the term proposition in\nsense of the words or the \"meaning\" expressed by the words.<ref>see e.g.\nhttp://plato.stanford.edu/entries/propositions/</ref> To avoid the controversies\nand ontological implications, the term sentence is often now used instead of\nproposition to refer to just those strings of symbols that are truthbearers,\nbeing either true or false under an interpretation. Strawson advocated the use\nof the term \"statement,\" and some mathematicians have adopted this usage.<ref>A.\nG. Hamilton, Logic for Mathematicians, p. 1, \"We shall refer to simple and\ncompound statements, and our assumption will be that all statements are either\ntrue or false.\", Cambridge University Press, 1978, ISBN 952-12-9291-3 ,</ref>\n",
