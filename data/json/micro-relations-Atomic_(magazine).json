Atomic is marketed at technology enthusiasts and\ncovers a number of topics that are not normally found in mainstream PC\npublications. Such topics include, but are not limited to, video card and CPU\noverclocking, Windows registry tweaking and programming. The magazine's\nstrapline is 'Maximum Power Computing', reflecting the broad nature of its\ntechnology content.\n\nIn November 2012 publisher Haymarket Media announced that Atomic would close and\nbe merged into sister monthly title PC & Tech Authority (beginning with the\nFebruary 2013 issue of PCTA), although the Atomic online forums would continue\nto exist in their own right and under the Atomic brand.
