{"cursor":"5998","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'clonogenic assay' is a microbiology technique for studying the effectiveness\nof specific agents on the survival and proliferation of cells. It is frequently\nused in cancer research laboratories to determine the effect of drugs or\nradiation on proliferating tumor cells as well as for titration of\nCell-killing Particles (CKPs) in virus stocks.\n\nAlthough this technique can provide accurate results, the assay is time-\nconsuming to set up and analyse and can only provide data on tumor cells that\ncan grow in culture. The word \"clonogenic\" refers to the fact that these cells\nare clones of one another.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Clonogenic_assay","recorded":1362481335,"links":10,"instances":["proteomics","genetics","unit","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology techniques"],"headings":["Procedure","Variables","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clone","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["gray","unit"],["receptor","proteomics"]],"members":["receptor","clone","gray","cell"],"related":["Microbiology","Oncology","Tumor","Clone_(genetics)","Tissue_culture","Percentage","Ionizing_radiation","Cell-killing_Particle_assays","CKPs","Cell_(biology)","Biopsy","Petri_dish","Gray_(unit)","Microscope","Algorithm","Image_scanner","Medication","Ionizing_radiation","Synergy","Genes","Receptor_(proteomics)","Oncology","Radiology","Microbiology","Cancer"]}
