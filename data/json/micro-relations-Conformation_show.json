{"cursor":"21373","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, 2009]]\n\n'Conformation shows', also referred to as breed shows, are a kind of dog show in\nwhich a judge familiar with a specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred\ndogs for how well the dogs conform to the established breed type for their\nbreed, as described in a breed's individual breed standard.\n\n\n\nA conformation dog show is not a comparison of one dog to another but a\ncomparison of each dog to a judge's mental image of the ideal ''breed type'' as\noutlined in the individual breed's [[breed standard]]. Dog show judges attempt\nto identify dogs who epitomize the published standards for each breed. This can\nbe challenging, because some judgements must necessarily be subjective. As an\nexample, what exactly entails a \"full coat\" or a \"cheerful attitude\",\ndescriptions found in breed standards, can only be learned through experience\nwith the breed that has that particular requirement.\n\nJudges are generally certified to judge one or several breeds, usually in the\nsame Group but a few \"All-Breed\" judges, have the training and experience to\njudge large numbers of breeds.\n\nThe first modern conformation dog show was held in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England\nin June 1859, and the only breeds scheduled were pointers and setters.\n","linknr":423,"url":"Conformation_show","recorded":1362890003,"links":43,"instances":["uk","dog","dog","dog","dog","dog_breed","dog","dog"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dog sports","Dog shows
