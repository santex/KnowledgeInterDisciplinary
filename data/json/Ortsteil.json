{"cursor":"1993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'quarter' is a section of an urban settlement.\n\nIts borders can be administratively chosen (then denoted as borough), and it may\nhave its own administrative structure (subordinate to that of the city, town or\nother urban area). Such a division is particularly common in countries like\nPoland ([[dzielnica]]), Serbia (ÑÐµÑÐ²ÑÑ, Äetvrt), Croatia (Äetvrt), Germany\n(Ortsteil/Stadtteil), Italy (Quartiere), France (Quartier), or Cambodia\n(Sangkat).\n\nQuarter can also refer to a non-administrative but distinct neighbourhood with\nits own character: for example, a slum quarter. It is often used for a district\nconnected with a particular group of people: for instance, some cities are said\nto have Jewish quarters, diplomatic quarters or Bohemian quarters.\n\nMost Roman cities were divided to four parts, called Quarters, by their two main\navenues: the Cardo and the Decumanus Maximus.\n\nThe Old City of Jerusalem currently has four quarters: the Muslim Quarter,\nChristian Quarter, Jewish Quarter and Armenian Quarter (it also used to have a\nMoroccan Quarter). A Christian quarter exists also in Damascus.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Ortsteil","recorded":1363582126,"links":[],"instances":["disambiguation","jerusalem"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Urban studies and planning terminology","Types of country subdivisions","Quarters"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["jewish_quarter","diaspora"],["jewish_quarter","jerusalem"],["french_quarter","disambiguation"]],"members":["french_quarter","jewish_quarter"],"related":["Urban_area","Borough","Neighbourhood","Slum","Jewish_quarter_(diaspora)","Diplomat","Bohemianism","Cardo","Decumanus_Maximus","Old_City_of_Jerusalem","Muslim_Quarter","Christian_Quarter","Jewish_Quarter_(Jerusalem)","Armenian_Quarter","Moroccan_Quarter","Damascus","Borough","Township","Municipality","French_Quarter_(disambiguation)","German_Quarter","Irish_Quarter","Jewellery_Quarter","Latin_Quarter","European_Quarter"]}
