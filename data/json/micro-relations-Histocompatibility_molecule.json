{"cursor":"33900","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Major [[histocompatibility]] complex' ('MHC') is a cell surface molecule\nencoded by a large gene family in all vertebrates. MHC molecules mediate\ninteractions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are\nimmune cells, with other leukocytes or body cells. MHC determines compatibility\nof donors for organ transplant as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune\ndisease via crossreacting immunization. In humans, MHC is also called human\nleukocyte antigen (HLA).\n\nProtein moleculesâeither of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic\nentitiesâare continually synthesized and degraded in a cell. Occurring on the\ncell surface, each MHC molecule displays a molecular fraction, called epitope,\nof a protein, somewhat like a hot dog (epitope) within a bun\n(MHC). [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/HLA.html\nKimball's Biology], Histocompatibility Molecules The presented antigen can\nbe either self or nonself. On the cell membrane, the MHC population in its\nentirety is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.\n\nThe MHC gene family is divided into three subgroupsâclass I, class II, and class\nIII. Diversity of antigen presentation, mediated by MHC classes I and II, is\nattained in multiple ways: (1) the MHC's genetic encoding is polygenic, (2) MHC\ngenes are highly polymorphic and have many variants, (3) several MHC genes are\nexpressed from both inherited alleles.\n","linknr":771,"url":"Histocompatibility_molecule","recorded":1362486706,"links":41,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genes","Immune
