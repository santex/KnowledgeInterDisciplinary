The prototype kilogram, manufactured in 1799 and from which\nthe current kilogram is based has a mass equal to the mass of 1.000025\nliters of water.\n\nThe kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix (\"kilo\", symbol \"k\") as\npart of its name. It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by\nan artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced\nin different laboratories. Four of the seven base units in the SI system are\ndefined relative to the kilogram so its stability is important.\n\nThe International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the General Conference\non Weights and Measures (CGPM) under the authority of the Metre Convention\n(1875), and is in the custody of the International Bureau for Weights and\nMeasures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International\nPrototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time, the International\nCommittee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram\nbe redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting,\nthe General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) agreed in principle that\nthe kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant, but deferred a\nfinal decision until its next meeting, scheduled for 2014.\n\nThe International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) is rarely used or handled. Copies of\nthe IPK kept by national metrology laboratories around the world were compared\nwith the IPK in 1889, 1948, and 1989 to provide traceability of measurements of\nmass anywhere in the world back to the IPK.\n","linknr":1043,"url":"Kilogram","recorded":1362372074,"links":201,"instances":["mass","wave_propagation","crystal","unit","unit","mass","mass","physics","unit","unit","unit","element","acceleration","morphology","canada","unit"],"pdf":["http://aa.stanford.edu/aeroastro/posters2007/Polhode_Motion.pdf","http://www.oiml.org/publications/R/R052-e04.pdf","http://www.oiml.org/publications/R/R052-e04.pdf","http://www.frzee.com/Education/The%20Economist%20Style%20Guide.pdf","http://www.frzee.com/Education/The%20Economist%20Style%20Guide.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/SIFedReg.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/SIFedReg.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf","http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf","http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf","http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/106/1/j61jab.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/106/1/j61jab.pdf","http://portal.acs.org/preview/fileFetch/C/CNBP_024130/pdf/CNBP_024130.pdf","http://portal.acs.org/preview/fileFetch/C/CNBP_024130/pdf/CNBP_024130.pdf","http://charm.physics.ucsb.edu/courses/ph21_05/kilogrampaper.pdf","http://charm.physics.ucsb.edu/courses/ph21_05/kilogrampaper.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf","http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/106/1/j61jab.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app8.pdf","http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP447/app8.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf","http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/fs376-b.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CIPM2005-EN.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CIPM2005-EN.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si_brochure_draft_ch2.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si_brochure_draft_ch2.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/24_CGPM_Resolution_1.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/24_CGPM_Resolution_1.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Press_release_resolution_1_CGPM.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/Press_release_resolution_1_CGPM.pdf","http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101019/pdf/467892a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101019/pdf/467892a.pdf","http://www.marybowers.org.uk/18_The%20Caravan%20September%201-15.pdf"],"categories":["SI
