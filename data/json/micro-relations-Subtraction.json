Subtraction is denoted by a minus sign in infix notation, in\ncontrast to the use of the plus sign for addition.\n\nSince subtraction is not a commutative operator, the two operands are named. The\ntraditional names for the parts of the formula :c − b = a are\nminuend (c) − subtrahend (b) = difference (a).\n\nSubtraction is used to model four related processes: #From a given collection,\ntake away (subtract) a given number of objects. For example, 5 apples minus 2\napples leaves 3 apples. #From a given measurement, take away a quantity measured\nin the same units. If I weigh 200 pounds, and lose 10 pounds, then I weigh\n200 − 10 = 190 pounds. #Compare two like quantities to find the\ndifference between them. For example, the difference between $800 and $600 is\n$800 − $600 = $200. Also known as comparative subtraction. #To\nfind the distance between two locations at a fixed distance from starting point.\nFor example if, on a given highway, you see a mileage marker that says 150 miles\nand later see a mileage marker that says 160 miles, you have traveled\n160 − 150 = 10 miles.\n\nIn mathematics, it is often useful to view or even define subtraction as a\nkind of addition, the addition of the additive inverse. We can view\n7 − 3 = 4 as the sum of two terms: 7 and -3. This\nperspective allows us to apply to subtraction all of the familiar rules and\nnomenclature of addition. Subtraction is not associative or\ncommutative—in fact, it is anticommutative and left-\nassociative—but addition of signed numbers is both.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Subtraction","recorded":1362374537,"links":93,"instances":["number","number","mathematics","mathematics","number","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://math.coe.uga.edu/TME/Issues/v10n2/5ross.pdf"],"categories":["Elementary arithmetic","Binary operations"],"headings":["Basic subtraction: integers","Subtraction as addition","Algorithms for subtraction","The teaching of subtraction in schools","Unit","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Subtraction01.svg/180px-Subtraction01.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Verticle_Subtraction_Example.svg/180px-Verticle_Subtraction_Example.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Line_Segment_jaredwf.svg/142px-Line_Segment_jaredwf.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Subtraction_line_segment.svg/143px-Subtraction_line_segment.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/50px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Symbol_oppose_vote.svg/50px-Symbol_oppose_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Symbol_multiplication_vote.svg/50px-Symbol_multiplication_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Symbol_divide_vote.svg/50px-Symbol_divide_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["term","mathematics"],["1","number"],["2","number"],["3","number"],["operation","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"]],"members":["1","3","ring","operation","2","term"],"related":["Arithmetic","Binary_operation","Addition","Plus_and_minus_signs","Infix_notation","Commutative_property","Formula","Mathematics","Addition","Additive_inverse","Term_(mathematics)","Associative","Commutative","Anticommutativity","Left-associative","Line_segment","Length","Addition","1_(number)","2_(number)","3_(number)","Natural_number","Integer","Operation_(mathematics)","Natural_number","Additive_inverse","Ring_(mathematics)","Elementary_arithmetic","Method_of_complements","Elementary_school","United_States_of_America","Traditional_mathematics","Percentage","Percentage_point","Elementary_arithmetic","Decrement","Negative_number","Method_of_complements","Cut-the-knot"]}
