This area became\nsettled by Europeans after a gold-bearing reef discovered in 1886 and sparked\nthe gold rush that gave rise to the establishment of Johannesburg.\n\nThe West Rand extends from Randfontein in the west to Roodepoort in the east,\nand includes the town of Krugersdorp. The areas of Carletonville and Westonaria\nare sometimes included as being part of the Far West Rand. The areas are\neconomically linked to the city through the gold mining industry. Following the\ncreation of the Johannesburg unicity in 1999, Roodepoort, which is traditionally\nregarded as part of the West Rand, became part of Johannesburg municipality.\nAfter 1999, much of the area (excluding Roodepoort, which became part of the\nCity of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality) became part of the newly formed\nWest Rand District Municipality.\n\nDespite being a separate municipal area, like the East Rand, the West Rand is\nincluded in the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area. To this end, the West\nRand shares the same dialling code as Johannesburg (011 locally). It is not\nuncommon for residents of the West Rand to work in Johannesburg proper and\nvice versa.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"West_Rand","recorded":1372154912,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geography of Gauteng"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Witwatersrand","Johannesburg","Conurbation","European_ethnic_groups","Gold","Gold_rush","Randfontein,_Gauteng","Roodepoort,_Gauteng","Krugersdorp,_Gauteng","Carletonville,_Gauteng","Westonaria,_Gauteng","City_of_Johannesburg_Metropolitan_Municipality","West_Rand_District_Municipality","East_Rand","Greater_Johannesburg_Metropolitan_Area","Dialling_codes_of_South_Africa","Economies_of_agglomeration"]}
