Actual output can be different from nameplate capacity for a\nnumber of reasons depending on equipment and circumstances. Kleiser, Thomas.

Thus there is a distinction between component\ncapacity and facility capacity.\n\nFor non-dispatchable power, particularly renewable energy, nameplate capacity\nrefers to generation under ideal conditions. Output is generally limited by\nweather conditions, hydroelectric dam water levels, tidal variations and other\noutside forces. Equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to\ncapacity factor reduction than the innate variation of the power source.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Nameplate_capacity","recorded":1362665150,"links":16,"instances":["disambiguation","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.agmanager.info/energy/EthanolPlantCapacityTrends_Aug-09.pdf","http://www.development.ohio.gov/Business/documents/CertificateOfNameplateCapacityForCompletedEnergyProject.pdf"],"categories":["Power station technology","Electric power","Electrical generators","Energy conversion"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/COGAS-diagram.png/220px-COGAS-diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power_plant","disambiguation"],["power","physics"]],"members":["power_plant","power"],"related":["Power_plant_(disambiguation)","Chemical_plant","Dispatchable_generation","Power_(physics)","Capacity_factor","Nameplate","Electrical_generator","Electrical_grid","Intermittent_energy_source","Renewable_energy","Capacity_factor","Availability_factor","Declared_net_capacity","Electricity_generation"]}
