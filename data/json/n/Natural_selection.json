It is a key mechanism of evolution.\nThe term \"natural selection\" was popularized by Charles Darwin who intended it\nto be compared with artificial selection, what we now call selective breeding.\n\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because\nrandom mutations cause changes in the genome of an individual organism, and\nthese mutations can be passed to offspring. Throughout the individualsâ lives,\ntheir genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits.\n(The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other\ncells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic\nenvironment.) Individuals with certain variants of the trait may survive and\nreproduce more than individuals with other variants. Therefore the population\nevolves. Factors that affect reproductive success are also important, an issue\nthat Charles Darwin developed in his ideas on sexual selection, for example.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, or the observable characteristics of an\norganism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives a\nreproductive advantage will become more common in a population (see allele\nfrequency). Over time, this process can result in populations that specialize\nfor particular ecological niches and may eventually result in the emergence of\nnew species. In other words, natural selection is an important process (though\nnot the only process) by which evolution takes place within a population of\norganisms. As opposed to artificial selection, in which humans favour specific\ntraits, in natural selection the environment acts as a sieve through which only\ncertain variations can pass.\n\nNatural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The term was\nintroduced by Darwin in his influential 1859 book [[On the Origin of\nSpecies]], Darwin C (1859) [[On the Origin of Species by Means\nof Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for\nLife]] John Murray, London; modern reprint Published online at [http://darwin-\nonline.org.uk/ The complete work of Charles Darwin online]: [http://darwin-\nonline.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=side&pageseq=2 On the origin\nof species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races\nin the struggle for life]. in which natural selection was described as\nanalogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with\ntraits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for\nreproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the\nabsence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing\nwas known of modern genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with\nsubsequent discoveries in classical and molecular genetics is termed the\n[[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Natural selection remains the primary\nexplanation for adaptive evolution.\n","linknr":1030,"url":"Natural_selection","recorded":1362484005,"links":103,"instances":["natural_selection","mathematics","population_genetics","journal","biologist","science","biology","zoology","biology","biology","biology","rhetoric","genetics","biology","biology","journal","evolutionary_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.uwo.ca/philosophy/contact/people/Papers/dhenry/Mechanisms%20of%20Inheritance%20(JHB).pdf","http://www.uwo.ca/philosophy/contact/people/Papers/dhenry/Mechanisms%20of%20Inheritance%20(JHB).pdf","http://web.missouri.edu/~ariewa/Teleology.pdf","http://web.missouri.edu/~ariewa/Teleology.pdf","http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1085052&blobtype=pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1085053&blobtype=pdf"],"categories":["Selection","Evolutionary
