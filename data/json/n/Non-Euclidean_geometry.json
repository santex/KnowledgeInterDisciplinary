{"cursor":"37611","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, 'non-Euclidean geometry' is a small set of geometries based on\naxioms closely related to those specifying Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean\ngeometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-\nEuclidean geometry arises when either the metric requirement is relaxed, or the\nparallel postulate is set aside. In the latter case one obtains hyperbolic\ngeometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional non-Euclidean geometries. When\nthe metric requirement is relaxed, then there are affine planes associated with\nthe planar algebras which give rise to kinematic geometries that have also been\ncalled non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe essential difference between the metric geometries is the nature of parallel\nlines. Euclid's fifth postulate, the parallel postulate, is equivalent to\nPlayfair's postulate, which states that, within a two-dimensional plane, for any\ngiven line â and a point A, which is not on â, there is exactly one line through\nA that does not intersect â. In hyperbolic geometry, by contrast, there are\ninfinitely many lines through A not intersecting â, while in elliptic geometry,\nany line through A intersects â (see the entries on hyperbolic geometry,\nelliptic geometry, and absolute geometry for more information).\n\nAnother way to describe the differences between these geometries is to consider\ntwo straight lines indefinitely extended in a two-dimensional plane that are\nboth perpendicular to a third line: *In Euclidean geometry the lines remain at a\nconstant distance from each other even if extended to infinity, and are known as\nparallels. *In hyperbolic geometry they \"curve away\" from each other, increasing\nin distance as one moves further from the points of intersection with the common\nperpendicular; these lines are often called ultraparallels. *In elliptic\ngeometry the lines \"curve toward\" each other and intersect.\n","linknr":688,"url":"Non-Euclidean_geometry","recorded":1362672669,"links":55,"instances":["mathematician","geometry","geometry","geometry","abstract","geography","video_games"],"pdf":["http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/DepPhilo/walter/papers/nes.pdf"],"categories":["Non-Euclidean
