Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells,\ncalled excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine\ncells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, they play a central role in\ncell-to-cell communication. In other types of cells, their main function is to\nactivate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action\npotential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In\nbeta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as \"nerve\nimpulses\" or \"spikes\", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated\nby a neuron is called its \"spike train\". A neuron that emits an action potential\nis often said to \"fire\".\n\nAction potentials are generated by special types of voltage-gated ion channels\nembedded in a cell's plasma membrane. These\nchannels are shut when the membrane potential is near the resting potential of\nthe cell, but they rapidly begin to open if the membrane potential increases to\na precisely defined threshold value. When the channels open, they allow an\ninward flow of sodium ions, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in\nturn produces a further rise in the membrane potential. This then causes more\nchannels to open, producing a greater electric current, and so on. The process\nproceeds explosively until all of the available ion channels are open, resulting\nin a large upswing in the membrane potential. The rapid influx of sodium ions\ncauses the polarity of the plasma membrane to reverse, and the ion channels then\nrapidly inactivate. As the sodium channels close, sodium ions can no longer\nenter the neuron, and they are actively transported out of the plasma membrane.\nPotassium channels are then activated, and there is an outward current of\npotassium ions, returning the electrochemical gradient to the resting state.\nAfter an action potential has occurred, there is a transient negative shift,\ncalled the afterhyperpolarization or refractory period, due to additional\npotassium currents. This is the mechanism that prevents an action potential from\ntraveling back the way it just came.\n\nIn animal cells, there are two primary types of action potentials, one type\ngenerated by voltage-gated sodium channels, the other by voltage-gated calcium\nchannels. Sodium-based action potentials usually last for under one millisecond,\nwhereas calcium-based action potentials may last for 100 milliseconds or longer.\nIn some types of neurons, slow calcium spikes provide the driving force for a\nlong burst of rapidly emitted sodium spikes. In cardiac muscle cells, on the\nother hand, an initial fast sodium spike provides a \"primer\" to provoke the\nrapid onset of a calcium spike, which then produces muscle contraction.\n","linknr":1560,"url":"Nerve_impulses","recorded":1362481557,"links":73,"instances":["heart","biology","nerve_agent","electricity","biology","biology","heart","physiology"],"pdf":["http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/chapt4.pdf","http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/chapt4.pdf"],"categories":["Neural
