What\nmakes NCB unique is that the bank was created to address the financial needs of\nan underserved market niche â people who join together cooperatively to meet\npersonal, social or business needs, especially in low-income communities.\n\nChartered by the 95th Congress on August 20, 1978, NCB commenced lending\noperations as a federal instrumentality on March 21, 1980. Congress\nappropriated $184 million of âseed moneyâ in the form of U.S. Treasury Notes,\nwhich represented NCBâs initial capitalization and the governmentâs ownership\nof the bank.\n\nIn 1981, NCB was privatized as a member-owned financial institution, and the\nseed money was converted into subordinated debt. At that time, the Class A\npreferred stock of NCB previously held by the United States was converted into\nClass A subordinated notes as of December 31, 1981. Since then NCB has been\nstructured as a cooperative and all capital stock has been owned by borrowers or\nentities eligible to borrow from NCB. The legislation requires NCB to repay the\n$184 million, with interest, in full by 2020. To date, NCB has reduced the loan\nbalance down to $85 million.\n\n'NCBâs Mission'\n\nNCBâs mission is to help cooperatives grow by supporting and being an advocate\nfor Americaâs cooperatives and their members, placing special emphasis on\nserving the needs of communities that are economically challenged.\n\n'NCBâs Customers'\n\nNCBâs customers are cooperatives, such as grocery wholesaler co-ops, purchasing\nco-ops or housing co-ops. Other customers share in the spirit of cooperation,\ndriven by democratic organizing principles. They may be Alaska and Native\nAmerican enterprises, which by their very nature, are member-run and member-\nowned. Others may be community health centers or charter schools, driven\nentirely by community needs. What they all have in common is a single\nfundamental principle â they have joined together cooperatively to meet\npersonal, social, and/or business needs.\n\nIn accordance with our congressional charter, NCB has a significant commitment\nto community revitalization. The employment of the cooperative model in the\ndevelopment of business and affordable housing is critical for low-income\nAmericans, and strengthens communities in both urban and rural areas.\n\n'What is a Co-op?'\n\nA cooperative is a business that is organized, owned and governed by the people\nwho use its products or services. Those people are called member-owners, and\nthey own the co-op. They share the costs, the earnings, and they also have a\nvoice in its operations and policies through a board of directors elected from\namong the members.\n\nCo-ops benefit their members by taking advantage of economies of scale, combined\nbuying power and strength in numbers to save money and return profits. In the\nprocess, co-ops provide millions of jobs, support business and personal needs,\nand enhance quality of life. A cornerstone of Americaâs economy, co-ops have\nbeen empowering people, developing communities and supporting innovation in this\ncountry for more than 100 years.\n","linknr":172,"url":"National_Cooperative_Bank","recorded":1375090179,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#SOAPBOX","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Wikipedia:EL","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Cooperative","/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Elder_Village","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&action=edit&section=2","http://www.ncb.coop/","http://www.ncbcapitalimpact.org/","/wiki/Template:Co-operatives","/wiki/Template_talk:Co-operatives","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Co-operatives&action=edit","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Mutual_organization","/wiki/Cooperative","/wiki/Consumer_cooperative","/wiki/Cooperative_federation","/wiki/List_of_co-operative_federations","/wiki/Co-operative_wholesale_society","/wiki/Worker_cooperative","/wiki/List_of_worker_cooperatives","/wiki/Employee_ownership","/wiki/Workers%27_self-management","/wiki/Workers%27_control","/wiki/Workplace_democracy","/wiki/Business_and_employment_co-operative","/wiki/Purchasing_cooperative","/wiki/Retailers%27_cooperative","/wiki/Social_cooperative","/wiki/Agent-owned_company","/wiki/Cooperative_banking","/wiki/Credit_union","/wiki/Mutual_savings_bank","/wiki/Savings_and_loan_association","/wiki/Building_society","/wiki/Housing_cooperative","/wiki/Building_cooperative","/wiki/Cohousing","/wiki/Student_housing_cooperative","/wiki/Housing_society","/wiki/Egalitarian_community","/wiki/Intentional_community","/wiki/Agricultural_cooperative","/wiki/Collective_farming","/wiki/Hoedads_Reforestation_Cooperative","/wiki/Winemaking_cooperative","/wiki/Wheat_pool","/wiki/Utility_cooperative","/wiki/List_of_utility_cooperatives","/wiki/Community_wind_energy","/wiki/Anarchistic_free_school","/wiki/Homeschool_cooperative","/wiki/Democratic_education","/wiki/Learning_by_teaching","/wiki/Mutual_insurance","/wiki/Health_insurance_cooperative","/wiki/Food_cooperative","/wiki/List_of_food_cooperatives","/wiki/Recycling_cooperative","/wiki/Rochdale_Principles","/wiki/Statement_on_the_Co-operative_Identity","/wiki/Co-operative_economics","/wiki/Co-operative_federalism","/wiki/Distributism","/wiki/Economic_democracy","/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)","/wiki/Neo-Capitalism","/wiki/Owenism","/wiki/Social_enterprise","/wiki/Socialism","/wiki/Socially_responsible_investing","/wiki/Solidarity_economy","/wiki/G._D._H._Cole","/wiki/Charles_Gide","/wiki/David_Griffiths_(co-operative_economist)","/wiki/William_King_(physician)","/wiki/Robert_Owen","/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Raiffeisen","/wiki/David_Schweickart","/wiki/Rochdale_Society_of_Equitable_Pioneers","/wiki/Beatrice_Webb","/wiki/Farmers%27_Storehouse_Company","/wiki/Ukrainian_cooperative_movement","/wiki/British_co-operative_movement","/wiki/History_of_cooperatives_in_the_United_States","/wiki/List_of_cooperatives","/wiki/List_of_worker_cooperatives","/wiki/List_of_co-operative_federations","/wiki/International_Co-operative_Alliance","/wiki/Co-operative_Party","/wiki/History_of_the_cooperative_movement","/wiki/.coop","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Cooperative_Bank&oldid=555878120","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Banks_based_in_Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Category:Cooperatives_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_a_promotional_tone_from_April_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_a_promotional_tone","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_May_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Cooperative+Bank&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Cooperative+Bank","/wiki/National_Cooperative_Bank","/wiki/Talk:National_Cooperative_Bank","#","/wiki/National_Cooperative_Ba
