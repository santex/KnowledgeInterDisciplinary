He\nserved as Prime Minister three times during his career. His first term was\nbetween August 1878 and February 23, 1879. His second term was served from\nJanuary 10, 1884 to June 9, 1888. His final term was between April 16, 1894 and\nNovember 12, 1895.\n\nNubar was born 'Nubar Nubarian' (Armenian: ÕÕ¸ÖÕºÕ¡Ö ÕÕ¸ÖÕºÕ¡ÖÕ¥Õ¡Õ¶) in Ä°zmir in January\n1825, the son of an Armenian merchant named Mgrdich, who had married a relative\nof Boghos Bey Yusufian, an influential minister of Muhammad Ali. Boghos Bey had\npromised to interest himself in the future of his young relative, and at his\nsuggestion he was sent first to Vevey, and then to Toulouse, to be educated by\nthe Jesuits, from whom he acquired an excellent command of the French language.\n\nBefore he was eighteen he went to Egypt, and after some eighteen months training\nas secretary to Boghos Bey, who was then minister of both commerce and foreign\naffairs, he was made second secretary to Muhammad Ali. In 1845 he became first\nsecretary to Ibrahim Pasha, the heir apparent, and accompanied him on a special\nmission to Europe.\n\nAbbas Pasha, who succeeded Ibrahim in 1848, maintained Nubar in the same\ncapacity, and sent him in 1850 to London as his representative to resist the\npretensions of the Ottoman sultan, who was seeking to evade the conditions of\nthe treaty under which Egypt was secured to the family of Muhammad Ali. Here he\nwas so completely successful that he was made a bey; in 1853 he was sent to\nVienna on a similar mission, and remained there until the death of Abbas in\nJuly 1854.\n\nThe new viceroy, Said, at once dismissed him from office, but two years\nafterwards appointed him his chief secretary, and later gave him charge of the\nimportant transport service through Egypt to India. Here Nubar was mainly\ninstrumental in the completion of railway communication between Cairo and Suez,\nand exhibited strong organising ability combined with readiness of resource.\nAfter a second time falling a victim to Said's caprice and being dismissed, he\nwas again sent to Vienna, and returned as principal secretary to Said, a\nposition he held till Said's death in January 1863.\n\nOn the accession of Ismail Pasha, Nubar Bey was in the prime of life. He was\nalready on friendly terms with him; he even claimed to have saved his life â at\nall events, it was a coincidence that the two had together refused to travel by\nthe train an accident to which caused the death (on May 14, 1858) of the prince\nAhmed, who would otherwise have succeeded Said. Ismail, himself a more capable\nman than his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar,\nand charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his\naccession, but to smooth the way for the many ambitious projects he already\nentertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to\nthat of khedive and the change in the order of succession. 's opera house.]] In\nthe first of these he was completely successful; the sultan, believing as little\nas every one else that the canal was anything more than a dream, gave his\nconsent at a price the moderation of which he must afterwards have regretted.\nThe gratified Ismail created Nubar a pasha, and the sultan himself, persuaded to\nvisit Cairo, confirmed the title so rarely accorded to a Christian. Half the\nwork was, however, yet to be done, and Nubar was sent to Paris to complete the\narrangements, and to settle the differences between Egypt and the Canal Company.\nIn what he used to call an expensive moment of enthusiasm, he left these\ndifferences to the arbitration of the emperor Napoleon III and cost Egypt four\nmillion pounds sterling. On his return he was made Egypt's first minister of\npublic works, and was distinguished for the energy which he threw into the\ncreation of a new department; but in 1866 he was made minister of foreign\naffairs, and at once went on a special mission to Constantinople, where he\nsucceeded in the other two projects that had been left in abeyance since his\nlast visit.\n\nIn June 1867 Ismail was declared khedive of Egypt, with succession in favor of\nhis eldest son. Nubar now had a harder task to undertake than ever before. The\nantiquated system of capitulations which had existed in the Ottoman empire since\nthe 15th century had grown in Egypt to be a practical creation of seventeen\nimperia in imperio: seventeen consulates of seventeen different powers\nadministered seventeen different codes in courts before which alone their\nsubjects were amenable. A plaintiff could only sue a Frenchman in the French\ncourt, with appeal to Aix-en-Provence; an Italian in the Italian court, with\nappeal to Ancona; a Russian in the Russian court, with appeal to Moscow. Nubar's\nbold design, for which alone he deserves the credit, was to induce these\nseventeen powers to consent to abandon their jurisdiction in civil actions, to\nsubstitute mixed International Courts and a uniform code binding on all. That in\nspite of the jealousies of all the powers, in spite of the opposition of the\nSublime Porte, he should have succeeded, places him at once in the first rank of\nstatesmen of his period. Nubar made no attempt to get rid of the criminal\njurisdiction exercised by the consular representatives of the foreign powers â\nsuch a proposal would have had, at that time, no chance of success.\n\nThe extravagant administration of Ismail, for which perhaps Nubar can hardly be\nheld wholly responsible, had brought Egypt to the verge of bankruptcy, and\nIsmail's disregard of the judgments of the Court at last compelled Great Britain\nand France to interfere. Under pressure, Ismail, who began to regret the\nestablishment of the International Courts, assented to a mixed ministry under\nNubar, with Charles Rivers Wilson as minister of finance and the Marquis de\nBligniÃ¨res as minister of public works. Nubar, finding himself supported by both\nGreat Britain and France, tried to reduce Ismail to the position of a\nconstitutional monarch, and Ismail, with an astuteness worthy of a better cause,\ntook advantage of a somewhat injudicious disbandment of certain regiments to\nincite a military rising against the ministry. The governments of Great Britain\nand France, instead of supporting the ministry against the khedive, weakly\nconsented to Nubar's dismissal; but when this was shortly followed by that of\nRivers Wilson and de BligniÃ¨res they realized that the situation was a critical\none, and they succeeded in obtaining from the sultan the deposition of Ismail\nand the substitution of his son Tawfiq as khedive (1879). Nubar remained out of\noffice until 1884.\n\nIn the interval Great Britain had intervened in Egypt â the battle of Tel al-\nKebir had been fought, Urabi Pasha had been banished, and Sir Evelyn Baring\n(afterwards Lord Cromer) had succeeded Sir Edward Baldwin Malet. The British\ngovernment, under the advice of Baring, insisted on the evacuation of the Sudan,\nand Muhammad Sharif Pasha having resigned office, the more pliant Nubar was\ninduced to become prime minister, and to carry out a policy of which he openly\ndisapproved, but which he considered Egypt was forced to accept under British\ndictation. At this period he used to say, \"I am not here to govern Egypt, but to\nadminister the British government of Egypt. I am simply the greaser of the\nofficial wheels.\"\n\nIt might have been well if Nubar had confined himself to this modest programme,\nbut it was perhaps hardly to be expected of a man of his ability and restless\nenergy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord\nCromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no surprise that the\npublic learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his\ndismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion\nseek the advice of the British agent.\n\nRiyad Pasha, who succeeded him, was, with one interval of eight months, prime\nminister until April 1894, when Nubar returned to office. By that time Lord\nCromer had more completely grasped the reins of administration as well as of\ngovernment, and Nubar had realized more clearly the role which an Egyptian\nminister was called on to play: Lord Cromer was the real ruler of Egypt, and the\ndeath of Tawfiq in 1890 had necessitated a more open exercise of British\nauthority.\n\nIn November 1895 Nubar completed his fifty years of service, and, accepting a\npension, retired from office. He lived little more than three years longer,\nspending his time between Cairo and Paris, where he died in January 1899.\n\nNubarashen, a suburb of Yerevan, was founded with his help and is named\nafter him.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Nubar_Pasha","recorded":1375082454,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nubar_Pasha&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nubar_Pasha&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Nubar_Pasha#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nubar_Pasha&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Nubar_Pasha.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Nubar_Pasha.jpg/220px-Nubar_Pasha.jpg","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/Abbas_II_of_Egypt","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Mustafa_Fahmi_Pasha","/wiki/Tewfik_Pasha","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha","/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Ottoman_flag.svg/23px-Ottoman_flag.svg.png","/wiki/%C4%B0zmir","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/France","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/%C4%B0zmir","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/%C4%B0zmir","/wiki/Armenians","/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt","/wiki/Vevey","/wiki/Toulouse","/wiki/Jesuit","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Abbas_I_of_Egypt","/wiki/London","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Bey","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Sa%27id_of_Egypt","/wiki/India","/wiki/Cairo","/wiki/Suez","/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Suez_Canal","/wiki/Khedive","/wiki/File:Nubar_Pasha.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Nubar_Pasha.JPG/225px-Nubar_Pasha.JPG","/wiki/File:Nubar_Pasha.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Alexandria","/wiki/Pasha","/wiki/Napoleon_III","/wiki/Egyptian_Public_Works","/wiki/Aix-en-Provence","/wiki/Ancona","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Sublime_Porte","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/France","/wiki/Charles_Rivers_Wilson","/w/index.php?title=Marquis_de_Bligni%C3%A8res&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Constitutional_monarch","/wiki/Tewfik_Pasha","/wiki/Battle_of_Tel_el-Kebir","/wiki/Ahmed_%27Urabi","/wiki/Evelyn_Baring","/wiki/Edward_Baldwin_Malet","/wiki/Sudan","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Nubarashen","/wiki/Yerevan","/w/index.php?title=Nubar_Pasha&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/w/index.php?title=Nubar_Pasha&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nubar_Pasha","/wiki/Armenians_in_Egypt","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/Muhammad_Tawfiq_Pasha","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/Mustafa_Fahmi_Pasha","/wiki/Template:Prime_Ministers_of_Egypt","/wiki/Template_talk:Prime_Ministers_of_Egypt","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Prime_Ministers_of_Egypt&action=edit","/wiki/Egypt","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Flag_of_Egypt.svg/23px-Flag_of_Egypt.svg.png","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Egypt","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Egypt","/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Egypt_(1882-1922).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_Egypt_%281882-1922%29.svg/40px-Flag_of_Egypt_%281882-1922%29.svg.png","/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha","#endnote_interim","/wiki/Tewfik_Pasha","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha","/wiki/Tewfik_Pasha","#endnote_interim","/wiki/Riyad_Pasha","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha","/wiki/Mahmoud_Sami_el-Baroudi","/wiki/Raghib_Pasha","#endnote_orabi","/wiki/Muhammad_Sharif_Pasha
