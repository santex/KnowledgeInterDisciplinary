{"cursor":"15991","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Niche construction' is the process in which an organism alters its own (or\nother species') environment, often but not always in a manner that increases its\nchances of survival. Several biologists have argued that\nniche construction is as important to evolution as natural selection (i.e., not\nonly does an environment cause changes in species through selection, but species\nalso cause changes in their environment through niche construction). This\ncreates a feedback relationship between natural selection and niche-\nconstruction; with organisms affecting their environment. That change then\ncauses a shift in what traits are being naturally selected for. The effect of\nniche construction is especially pronounced in situations where environmental\nalterations persist for several generations, introducing the evolutionary role\nof ecological inheritance. Less drastic niche-constructing behaviors are also\nquite possible for an organism. This theory, in conjunction with natural\nselection, shows that organisms inherit two legacies from their ancestors: genes\nand a modified environment. Together, these two evolutionary mechanisms\ndetermine a population's fitness and what adaptations those organisms develop in\nthe continuation for their survival.\n","linknr":456,"url":"Niche_construction","recorded":1362483233,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/BoogertetalBioscience.pdf","http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/BoogertetalBioscience.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Ecology"],"headings":["Examples","Implications","Consequences","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Beaver_dam_in_Tierra_del_Fuego.jpg/300px-Beaver_dam_in_Tierra_del_Fuego.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Leafcutter_ants_transporting_leaves.jpg/200px-Leafcutter_ants_transporting_leaves.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Niche_construction_in_evolutionary_time.pdf/page1-400px-Niche_construction_in_evolutionary_time.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Sicklecells4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Reed_warbler_cuckoo.jpg/150px-Reed_warbler_cuckoo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organism","Natural_environment","Biologist","Natural_selection","Species","Ecological_inheritance","Myrmelachista_schumanni","Devil's_garden","Atta","Lepiotaceae","Benthic","Estuarine","Colonize","Conservation_biology","Behavior","Sociobiology","Evolutionary_psychology","Human_behavioral_ecology","Phenotype","Gene-culture_coevolution","Abiotic","Leafcutter_ants","Common_cuckoo"]}
