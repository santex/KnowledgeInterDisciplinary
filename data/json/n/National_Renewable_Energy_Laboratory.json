The National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory (NREL) is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility; it is\nfunded through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This arrangement allows a\nprivate entity to operate the lab on behalf of the federal government under a\nprime contract. NREL receives funding from Congress to be applied toward\nresearch and development projects. NREL also performs research on photovoltaics\n(PV) under the National Center for Photovoltaics. NREL has a number of PV\nresearch capabilities including research and development, testing, and\ndeployment. NREL's campus houses several facilities dedicated to PV research.\n","linknr":465,"url":"National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory","recorded":1362267985,"links":30,"instances":["journal","the_simple_model_of_the_atmospheric_radiative_transfer_of_sunshine"],"pdf":["http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/49409.pdf","http://arec.oregonstate.edu/jaeger/energy/realizable%20renewable%20energy%20future.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy02/30845.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54526.pdf","http://www.cfo.doe.gov/budget/12budget/Content/FY2012Lab.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/pdfs/46860.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/pdfs/46860.pdf"],"categories":["Golden, Colorado","United States Department of Energy National Laboratories","Buildings and structures in Golden, Colorado","Research and development organizations","Energy research institutes","Research institutes in the United States","Renewable energy organizations based in the United States","Battelle Memorial Institute"],"headings":["History","Funding in 2009 and 2010","Commercialization and technology transfer","National Center for Photovoltaics","Biomass research","National Wind Technology Center (NWTC)","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/NREL.jpg/235px-NREL.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/US_projected_cost_of_wind_power.png/220px-US_projected_cost_of_wind_power.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/NREL_Windmills.jpg/220px-NREL_Windmills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg/100px-US-DeptOfEnergy-Seal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["smarts","the_simple_model_of_the_atmospheric_radiative_transfer_of_sunshine"],["science","journal"]],"members":["science","smarts"],"related":["Dan_E._Arvizu","Golden,_Colorado","MRIGlobal","Battelle_Memorial_Institute","Golden,_Colorado","United_States","Renewable_energy","Efficient_energy_use","Research_and_development","U.S._Department_of_Energy","Presidency_of_Jimmy_Carter","Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan","The_Denver_Post","United_States_Department_of_Energy_National_Laboratories","MRIGlobal","Kansas_City,_Missouri","Battelle_Memorial_Institute","MRIGlobal","Renewable_electricity","Renewable_fuels","Carbon_emissions","Fossil_fuel","Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","Fortune_500","Photovoltaics","Sandia_National_Laboratories","Brookhaven_National_Laboratory","Georgia_Institute_of_Technology","DARPA","Western_Governors_Association","Kilowatt_hour","Electrical_grid","Cadmium_telluride","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Building-integrated_photovoltaics","Solar_Decathlon","Golden,_Colorado","Wind_Powering_America_Initiative","Renewable_energy_commercialization_in_the_United_States","List_of_renewable_energy_organizations","SMARTS_(The_Simple_Model_of_the_Atmospheric_Radiative_Transfer_of_Sunshine)","NREL","Science_(journal)","EERE"]}
