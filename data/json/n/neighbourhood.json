Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial\nunits in which face-to-face social interactions occur &ndash; the personal\nsettings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise\nyouth, and maintain effective social control.\"<ref>Schuck, Amie and Dennis\nRosenbuam 2006 \"Promoting Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods: What Research Tells Us\nabout Intervention.\" The Aspen Institute.</ref>\n","title":"neighbourhood","headings":["Preindustrial cities","Sociology","Regions","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Community","2: City","2: District","1: Manhattan","1: New_York_City","1: American_and_British_English_spelling_differences","1: Town","1: Suburb","1: Rural_area","1: Neighbourhood_unit","1: Household","1: Jefferson_County,_Colorado","1: Urban_sociology","1: Mainland_China","1: People's_Republic_of_China","1: Administrative_division","1: Residential_unit","1: Residential_quarter","1: Subdistrict","1: Administrative_divisions_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","1: Nicosia","1: Cyprus","1: Turkey","1: Mukhtar","1: Borough","1: Kingston-upon-Thames","1: Canada","1: United_States","1: Neighbourhood_association","1: Neighbourhood_watch","1: Lawn","1: Fence","1: Block_party","1: Parks","1: Security","1: Barrio","1: Bairro","1: Block_Parent_Program","1: Burough","1: Committees_for_the_Defense_of_the_Revolution","1: Frazione","1: Homeowners'_association","1: Comparison_of_Home_Owners'_and_Civic_Associations","1: Kiez","1: Komshi","1: Balkan","1: Ottoman_Empire","1: Mahalle","1: Neighbourhood_Watch","1: New_urbanism","1: Quartiere","1: Residential_community","1: Unincorporated_community"]}
