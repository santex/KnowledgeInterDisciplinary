{"cursor":"9753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn biology, a 'genus' (plural: 'genera') is a low-level taxonomic rank used in\nthe biological classification of living and fossil organisms, which is an\nexample of definition by genus and differentia. Genera and higher taxonomic\nlevels such as families are used in biodiversity studies, particularly in fossil\nstudies since species cannot always be confidently identified and genera and\nfamilies typically have longer stratigraphic ranges than species.\n\nThe term comes from the Latin genus meaning \"descent, family, type, gender\", [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/genus Merriam Webster Dictionary] cognate with â\ngenos, \"race, stock, kin\".

The standards for\ngenus classification are not strictly codified, so different authorities often\nproduce different classifications for genera. In the hierarchy of the binomial\nclassification system, genus comes above species and below family.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Name_of_a_biological_genus","recorded":1362373244,"links":101,"instances":["plant","pea","biology","biology","botany","biology","biology","taxonomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genera|*01","Scientific classification","Botanical nomenclature|Genus","Plant taxonomy|1rank17","Zoological nomenclature"],"headings":["Generic name","Guidelines","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg/150px-Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["family","taxonomy"],["kingdom","biology"],["order","biology"],["synonym","botany"],["aotus","pea"],["proboscidea","plant"],["type","biology"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["proboscidea","aotus","kingdom","morphology","synonym","order","type","family"],"related":["Biology","Taxonomy","Biological_classification","Fossil","Organism","Genus–differentia_definition","Taxonomist","Species","Family_(taxonomy)","Generic_name","Generic_epithet","Binomial_nomenclature","Binomial_Nomenclature","Nomenclature_Codes","Gray_wolf","Dog","Domestic_dog","Canidae","Carnivora","Kingdom_(biology)","International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature","International_Code_of_Botanical_Nomenclature","Order_(biology)","Frog","Synonym_(botany)","Aotus_(pea)","Night_monkey","Wheatear","Water_dropwort","Accentor","Self-heal","Elephant","Proboscidea_(plant)","Platypus","George_Shaw","Ambrosia_beetle","Johann_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Herbst","Binomial_nomenclature","Type_(biology)","Type_species","Type_specimen","Junior_synonym","Taxon","Scientific_classification","Nomenclature_codes","Type_genus","Monophyly","Ecology","Morphology_(biology)","Biogeography","DNA_sequences","Gene_flow","Postzygotic_barrier","Taxonomists","Philadelphia","Nomenclature_codes","List_of_the_largest_genera_of_flowering_plants"]}
