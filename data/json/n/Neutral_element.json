{"cursor":"6059","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, an 'identity element' (or 'neutral element') is a special type\nof element of a set with respect to a binary operation on that set. It leaves\nother elements unchanged when combined with them. This is used for groups and\nrelated concepts.\n\nThe term identity element is often shortened to identity (as will be done in\nthis article) when there is no possibility of confusion.\n\nLet be a set  with a binary operation â on it (known as a magma). Then\nan element  of  is called a '[[left and right (algebra)|left]]\nidentity' if for all  in , and a '[[left and right (algebra)|right]]\nidentity' if for all  in . If is both a left identity and a right\nidentity, then it is called a 'two-sided identity', or simply an 'identity'.\n\nAn identity with respect to addition is called an additive identity (often\ndenoted as 0) and an identity with respect to multiplication is called a\nmultiplicative identity (often denoted as 1). The distinction is used most\noften for sets that support both binary operations, such as rings. The\nmultiplicative identity is often called the 'unit' in the latter context, where,\nthough, a unit is often used in a broader sense, to mean an element with a\nmultiplicative inverse.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Neutral_element","recorded":1362543060,"links":51,"instances":["algebra","structure","mathematics","matrices","mathematics","computer_science","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","ring_theory","number","disambiguation","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abstract algebra","Algebra","Binary operations|*Identity element","One"],"headings":["Examples","Properties","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/c/10c3e97d2a3eda0d182b81d48f231b62.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["magma","algebra"],["magma","algebra"],["ring","mathematics"],["unit","ring_theory"],["0","number"],["1","number"],["1","number"],["matrix","mathematics"],["hadamard_product","matrices"],["function","mathematics"],["distribution","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["string","computer_science"],["set","mathematics"],["boolean_algebra","structure"],["knot","mathematics"],["direction","geometry"],["unital","disambiguation"]],"members":["magma","boolean_algebra","function","hadamard_product","ring","string","matrix","distribution","direction","knot","group","unit","1","unital","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Set_(mathematics)","Binary_operation","Group_(mathematics)","Magma_(algebra)","Magma_(algebra)","Additive_identity","Multiplicative_identity","Ring_(mathematics)","Unit_(ring_theory)","Real_number","Addition","0_(number)","Multiplication","1_(number)","Non-negative_number","Exponentiation","Integer","Projective_line","Rational_number","Positive_integer","Least_common_multiple","Non-negative_integer","Greatest_common_divisor","1_(number)","Matrix_(mathematics)","Zero_matrix","Matrix_multiplication","Identity_matrix","Hadamard_product_(matrices)","Matrix_of_ones","Function_(mathematics)","Function_composition","Identity_function","Distribution_(mathematics)","Group_(mathematics)","Convolution","Dirac_delta","String_(computer_science)","Tuple","Concatenation","Empty_string","Extended_real_number","Minimum","Maximum","Set_(mathematics)","Set_intersection","Set_union","Empty_set","Boolean_algebra_(structure)","Logical_and","Logical_or","Exclusive_or","Knot_(mathematics)","Knot_sum","Unknot","Compact_surfaces","Connected_sum","Sphere","Zero_power_zero","Cross_product","Euclidean_vector","Direction_(geometry)","Orthogonal","Semigroup","Positive_number","Natural_number","Absorbing_element","Inverse_element","Additive_inverse","Monoid","Unital_(disambiguation)","Quasigroup"]}
