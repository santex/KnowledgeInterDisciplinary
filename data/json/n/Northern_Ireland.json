The code is\n028 within the UK and 048 from the Republic of Ireland }}\n\n'Northern Ireland' ( , Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann or Norlin Airlan) is a part\nof the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It is\nvariously described as a country, province or region of the UK, amongst other\nterms. Northern Ireland shares a border with the Republic of\nIreland to the south and west. As of 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about\n30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the\nUnited Kingdom. Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, Northern\nIreland is largely self-governing. According to the agreement, Northern Ireland\nco-operates with the rest of Ireland â from which it was partitioned in 1921 â\non some policy areas, while other areas are reserved for the Government of the\nUnited Kingdom, though the Republic of Ireland \"may put forward views and\nproposals\".\n\nNorthern Ireland was for many years the site of a violent and bitter inter-\ncommunal conflict â the Troubles â which was caused by divisions between\nnationalists, who see themselves as Irish and are predominantly Roman Catholic,\nand unionists, who see themselves as British and are predominantly Protestant.\nAdditionally, people from both sides of the community may describe themselves as\nNorthern Irish. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain as a part\nof the United Kingdom, while nationalists want reunification with the\nrest of Ireland, independent of British rule. Richard Jenkin, 1997,\nRethinking ethnicity: arguments and explorations, SAGE Publications: London: \"In\nNorthern Ireland the objectives of contemporary nationalists are the\nreunification of Ireland and the removal of British government.\" Peter\nDorey, 1995, British politics since 1945, Blackwell Publishers: Oxford: \"Just as\nsome Nationalists have been prepared to use violence in order to secure Irish\nreunification, so some Unionists have been prepared to use violence in order to\noppose it.\" Sinn Fein. Retrieved 2 August 2008.\nSince 1998, most of the paramilitary groups involved in the Troubles have ceased\ntheir armed campaigns.\n\nNorthern Ireland has traditionally been the most industrialised region of the\nisland. After declining as a result of political and social turmoil in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, it has grown significantly since the 1990s.\nThis is in part due to a \"peace dividend\" and in part due to links and increased\ntrade with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nProminent artists and sports persons from Northern Ireland include Van Morrison,\nRory McIlroy and George Best. Others from that part of the island prefer to\ndefine themselves as Irish, e.g. Seamus Heaney and Liam Neeson. Cultural links\nbetween Northern Ireland, the rest of Ireland and the rest of the UK are\ncomplex, with Northern Ireland sharing both the culture of Ireland and the\nculture of the United Kingdom. In most sports the island of Ireland fields a\nsingle team, a notable exception being association football. Northern Ireland\ncompetes separately at the Commonwealth Games and athletes from Northern Ireland\nmay compete for either Great Britain or Ireland at the Olympic Games.\n","linknr":2654,"url":"Northern_Ireland","recorded":1362486242,"links":223,"instances":["ireland","ireland","northern_ireland","northern_ireland","ireland","snooker_player","northern_ireland","uk","european_parliament_constituency","golfer","1966","politician","northern_ireland","scholar","golfer","uk","northern_ireland","northern_ireland","ireland","golf","rugby_union","train","golfer","golfer","language_act","northern_ireland","road","rugby_union","ireland","northern_ireland","cricket_ground"],"pdf":["http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_report_2011.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_report_2011.pdf","http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf","http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf","http://www.policeombudsman.org//Publicationsuploads/BALLAST%20PUBLIC%20STATEMENT%2022-01-07%20FINAL%20VERSION.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060822152404/http://www.institute-of-governance.org/forum/Leverhulme/briefing_pdfs/IoG_Briefing_16.pdf","http://www.institute-of-governance.org/forum/Leverhulme/briefing_pdfs/IoG_Briefing_16.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060822152404/http://www.institute-of-governance.org/forum/Leverhulme/briefing_pdfs/IoG_Briefing_16.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070510015756/http://www.ucd.ie/spire/text+files/todd-achangedirishnationalism.pdf","http://www.ucd.ie/spire/text%20files/todd-achangedirishnationalism.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070510015756/http://www.ucd.ie/spire/text+files/todd-achangedirishnationalism.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04474.pdf","http://replay.web.archive.org/20090327044249/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/9th-UNCSGN-Docs/E-CONF-98-48-Add1.pdf","http://replay.web.archive.org/20090327044249/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/9th-UNCSGN-Docs/E-CONF-98-48-Add1.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_stats_bulletin_2011.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/key_stats_bulletin_2011.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/urban_rural/ur_gaz.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/urban_rural/ur_gaz.pdf","http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf","http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/UKECRML3_en.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061104144328/http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf","http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061104144328/http://www.nio.gov.uk/st_andrews_agreement.pdf"],"categories":["Celtic
