When spoken in everyday English, a\nfraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-\nhalf, eight-fifths, three-quarters. A common, vulgar, or simple fraction\n(examples: <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> and 17/3) consists of an integer\n'numerator', displayed above a line (or before a slash), and a non-zero integer\n'denominator', displayed below (or after) that line. Numerators and denominators\nare also used in fractions that are not common, including compound fractions,\ncomplex fractions, and mixed numerals.\n\nThe numerator represents a number of equal parts, and the denominator, which\ncannot be zero, indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. For\nexample, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator, 3, tells us that the fraction\nrepresents 3 equal parts, and the denominator, 4, tells us that 4 parts make up\na whole. The picture to the right illustrates <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> or 3/4\nof a cake.\n\nFractional numbers can also be written without using explicit numerators or\ndenominators, by using decimals, percent signs, or negative exponents (as in\n0.01, 1%, and 10<sup>&minus;2</sup> respectively, all of which are equivalent to\n1/100). An integer such as the number 7 can be thought of as having an implied\ndenominator of one: 7 equals 7/1.\n\nOther uses for fractions are to represent ratios and to represent\ndivision.<ref>H. Wu, The Mis-Education of Mathematics Teachers, Notices of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society, Volume 58, Issue 03 (March 2011),\n[http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300372p.pdf#page374 page 374] </ref>\nThus the fraction 3/4 is also used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the\npart to the whole) and the division 3 ÷ 4 (three divided by four).\n\nIn mathematics the set of all numbers which can be expressed in the form a/b,\nwhere a and b are integers and b is not zero, is called the set of rational\nnumbers and is represented by the symbol 'Q', which stands for quotient. The\ntest for a number being a rational number is that it can be written in that form\n(i.e., as a common fraction). However, the word fraction is also used to\ndescribe mathematical expressions that are not rational numbers, for example\nalgebraic fractions (quotients of algebraic expressions), and expressions that\ncontain irrational numbers, such as √2/2 (see square root of 2) and π/4 (see\nproof that π is irrational).\n","title":"Fraction%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Vocabulary","Forms of fractions","Arithmetic with fractions","Fractions in abstract mathematics","Algebraic fractions","Radical expressions","Typographical variations","History","Pedagogical tools","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Integer","3: Quotient","3: Polynomial","2: Ratio","2: Rational_numbers","2: Rational_number","2: Multiplicative_inverse","2: Unit_fraction","2: Egyptian_fraction","2: Integral_domain","2: Fractions","2: Numerator","1: Algebraic_fraction","1: Irrational_number","1: Square_root_of_2","1: Proof_that_Ï_is_irrational","1: Cardinal_number","1: Three-Fifths_Compromise","1: Integers","1: Absolute_value","1: Probability","1: Numerical_digit","1: Decimal_separator","1: Decimal_separator#HinduâArabic_numeral_system","1: Fractional_part","1: Scientific_notation","1: Infinite_series","1: Percentage","1: Parts-per_notation","1: Mental_calculation","1: Accurate","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Dyadic_rational","1: Power_of_two","1: Commutative","1: Associative","1: Distributive","1: Division_by_zero","1: Coprime","1: Irreducible_fraction","1: Greatest_common_divisor","1: Euclidean_algorithm","1: Least_common_multiple","1: Divisor","1: Repeating_decimal","1: Leading_zero","1: Trailing_zero","1: Well_defined","1: Addition","1: Subtraction","1: Multiplication","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Field_of_fractions","1: Rational_fraction","1: Rational_function","1: Algebraic_expression","1: Quotient_field","1: Coefficient","1: Radical_expression","1: Partial_fraction","1: Nth_root","1: Nth_root#Simplified_form_of_a_radical_expression","1: Monomial","1: Binomial","1: Typography","1: One_half","1: Number_Forms","1: Unicode","1: Â£sd","1: History_of_Egypt","1: Dyadic_fraction","1: Akhmim_Wooden_Tablet","1: Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Pythagoras","1: Square_root_of_two","1: Jain","1: History_of_India","1: Sthananga_Sutra","1: Aryabhatta","1: Sanskrit_literature","1: Bhaskara_I","1: Al-HassÄr","1: Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam","1: Fes","1: Morocco","1: Islamic_inheritance_jurisprudence","1: Leonardo_Fibonacci","1: Decimal_fractions","1: Dirk_Jan_Struik","1: Flemish_Region","1: Leiden","1: Simon_Stevin","1: Netherlands","1: Chinese_mathematics","1: Al-KÄshÄ«","1: Sexagesimal","1: Samarkand","1: Persian_people","1: JamshÄ«d_al-KÄshÄ«","1: Baghdad","1: Abu'l-Hasan_al-Uqlidisi","1: Primary_school","1: Cuisenaire_rods","1: Fraction_bar","1: Pattern_block","1: Dot_paper","1: Geoboard","1: Continued_fraction"]}
