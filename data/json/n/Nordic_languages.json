The language group is\nsometimes referred to as the 'Nordic languages', a direct translation of the\nmost common term used among Danish, Swedish and Norwegian scholars and\nlaypeople. In Scandinavia the term 'Scandinavian languages' is referring\nspecifically to the mutually intelligible languages of the three Scandinavian\ncountries, and is thus used in a more narrow sense as a subset of the Nordic\nlanguages. The term Scandinavian arose in the 18th century, as a result of the\nearly linguistic and cultural Scandinavist movement, referring to the peoples,\ncultures and languages of the three Scandinavian countries and stressing their\ncommon heritage.\n\nThe term \"North Germanic languages\" is used in genetic linguistics, Gordon,\nRaymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.\n[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90971 Language Family Trees Indo-\nEuropean, Germanic, North].
