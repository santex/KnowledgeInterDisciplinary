The term includes\nthe use of exothermic nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion\nreactions. Presently the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of\nthe periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear power in the service of\nhumankind, with nuclear decay processes, primarily in the form of geothermal\nenergy, and radioisotope thermoelectric generators, in niche uses making up the\nrest. As of 2013, attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion\nreactions, excluding natural fusion power sources such as the Sun, remains an\narea of active physics and engineering research.\n\n Nuclear (fission) power stations, that is excluding the contribution from naval\n nuclear reactors, provided about 5.7% of the world's energy and 13% of the\n world's electricity, in 2012.\n\n{{Cite journal\n | url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/kwes.pdf\n | title=Key World Energy Statistics 2012 accessdate=2012-12-17 publisher=\n | International Energy Agency year=2012 format=PDF}}\n In 2013, the IAEA report that there are 437 operational nuclear\npower reactors (although not all are producing electricity ), in 31 countries.
