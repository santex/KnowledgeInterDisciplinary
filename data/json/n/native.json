In some cases it is a neutral, descriptive term, for\nexample, when stating that one is a native of a particular city or that a\ncertain language is one's native language. However, in the context of\ncolonialism&mdash;in particular, British colonialism&mdash;the term \"natives\",\nas applied to the inhabitants of colonies, assumed a disparaging and patronising\nsense, implying that the people concerned were incapable of taking care of\nthemselves and in need of Europeans to administer their lives; therefore, these\npeople resent the use of the term and consider it insulting, and at present\nEnglish speakers usually avoid using it. This connotation has also led to\ncontroversy over the preference of the terms Native American or American\nIndians, though this controversy has resulted in either term being acceptable to\nmost American Indians.<ref></ref> And in the context of Nativism, in some\nperiods a potent political force, \"natives\" are defined as a (predominantly\nwhite) group deserving of a special privileged position in comparison to\nimmigrants.\n\n\"Native\" may also refer to:\n\n* Native metal\n* Native (comics), a character in the X-Men comics universe\n","title":"native","headings":["Nationality and language","Music","Ecology","Computing","Other","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Indigenous_peoples","2: Native_API","1: Colonialism","1: Native_metal","1: Native_language","1: Native_speaker","1: Foreign_language","1: Native-born_citizen","1: Foreign_born","1: Endemism","1: Native_plant","1: Permaculture","1: Wildcrafting","1: Native_mode","1: Central_processing_unit","1: Wiktionary","1: Operating_system","1: Northeast_Arizona_Technological_Institute_of_Vocational_Education","1: Navajo_Nation","1: Native_Language_Music"]}
