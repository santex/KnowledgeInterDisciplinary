{"cursor":"7514","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Nomenclature codes' or 'codes of nomenclature' are the various rulebooks that\ngovern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of\norganisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some\nawareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that\nthere is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather\ndifferent in the way they work.\n\nThe successful introduction of two-part names for species by Linnaeus was the\nstart for an ever-expanding system of nomenclature. With all naturalists\nworldwide adopting this approach to thinking up names there arose several\nschools of thought about the details. It became ever more apparent that a\ndetailed body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. From the mid-\nnineteenth century onwards there were several initiatives to arrive at worldwide-\naccepted sets of rules. In the course of time these became the present\nnomenclature codes governing the naming of:\n* Algae, Fungi and Plants – [[International Code of Nomenclature for\n  algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), which in July 2011 replaced the\n  [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] (ICBN)\n* Animals – [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN)\n* Bacteria – [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB)\n* Cultivated plants – [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated\n  Plants]] (ICNCP)\n* Plant associations – [[International Code of Phytosociological\n  Nomenclature]]\n* Viruses – International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) ; see also\n  [[virus classification]]\n","linknr":3,"url":"Nomenclature_codes","recorded":1364239072,"links":["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_codes","irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia","http://www.freenode.net","http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological nomenclature","Virology"],"headings":["Differences between codes","Other codes","Common names","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Taxonomy","Nomenclature","Carolus_Linnaeus","Algae","Fungus","Plant","Animal","Bacterium","Plant_association","Virus","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","Botany","Mycology","Zoology","Bacteriology","Tautonym","Biological_type","Cyanobacteria","International_Botanical_Congress","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Linnaean_nomenclature","Phylogenetic_nomenclature","Periwinkle","Bird","Latin","Greek_language","Octopus","Binomial_nomenclature","Chemical_nomenclature"]}
