{"cursor":"21089","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" chain reaction. 1. A uranium-235 atom absorbs a neutron, and fissions into two\n new atoms (fission fragments), releasing three new neutrons and a large amount\n of binding energy. 2. One of those neutrons is absorbed by an atom of uranium-\n 238, and does not continue the reaction. Another neutron leaves the system\n without being absorbed. However, one neutron does collide with an atom of uranium-\n 235, which then fissions and releases two neutrons and more binding energy. 3.\n Both of those neutrons collide with uranium-235 atoms, each of which fissions\n and releases a few neutrons, which can then continue the reaction.]]\n\nA 'nuclear chain reaction' occurs when one nuclear reaction causes an average of\none or more nuclear reactions, thus leading to a self-propagating series of\nthese reactions. The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy\nisotopes (e.g. 235 U) or the fusion of light isotopes (e.g.\n2 H and 3 H). The nuclear chain reaction releases several\nmillion times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Nuclear_chain_reaction","recorded":1362572851,"links":33,"instances":["nuclear","sport","nuclear"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics|Chain reaction, nuclear","Hungarian inventions"],"headings":["History","Fission chain reaction","Timescales of nuclear chain reactions","Nuclear weapons application of neutron multiplication","Nuclear power plants and control of chain reactions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Fission_chain_reaction.svg/300px-Fission_chain_reaction.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/b/92b262709412178001e0efef6c2be9f5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/5/875449e8430050a43c245b3dc35aeec4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/a/76af58b5c3d44bc88fd1a55d90cccaa8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/8/748b1a15d867720f412fe773302fb629.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5/4/b54408b2a0291940aab9e08aeb077e32.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["racquets","sport"],["critical_mass","nuclear"],["reactivity","nuclear"],["critical_mass","nuclear"]],"members":["critical_mass","racquets","reactivity"],"related":["Uranium-235","Neutron","Uranium-238","Nuclear_reaction","Chemical_reaction","Chain_reaction","Max_Bodenstein","Hungary","Leó_Szilárd","Beryllium","Indium","Nuclear_fission","Lise_Meitner","Otto_Hahn","Otto_Robert_Frisch_","Enrico_Fermi","Herbert_L._Anderson","Einstein–Szilárd_letter","Albert_Einstein","Franklin_D._Roosevelt","Nazi_Germany","Chicago_Pile-1","Racquets_(sport)","Stagg_Field","University_of_Chicago","Arthur_H._Compton","Metallurgical_Laboratory","Manhattan_Project","Argonne_National_Laboratory","University_of_Illinois_Press","University_of_Arkansas","Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor","Oklo","Neutrons","Fissile","Nuclear_fission","Nuclear_power_plants","Nuclear_weapons","Critical_mass_(nuclear)","Gamma_rays","Neutrinos","Speed_of_light","Conservation_of_mass","Electron_volt","Six_factor_formula","Subcriticality","Critical_mass","Supercriticality","Reactivity_(nuclear)","InHour","Four_factor_formula","Six_factor_formula","Radioactive_decay","Prompt_neutron","Delayed_criticality","Prompt_criticality","Gun-type_fission_weapon","Neutron_reflector","Spontaneous_fission","Nuclear_weapon_design","Exponential_growth","Fast-neutron_reactor","Nuclear_weapon","Chernobyl_disaster","Nuclear_reactor","Void_coefficient","Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster","Decay_heat","SCRAM","Beta_decay","Chain_reaction","Critical_mass_(nuclear)","Criticality_accident","Four_factor_formula","Nuclear_criticality_safety","Nuclear_physics","Nuclear_reaction","Nuclear_reactor_physics","Nuclear_weapon_design"]}
