{"cursor":"5783","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Niyi Osundare' (born in 1947 in Ikere-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria) is a\nprolific poet, dramatist and literary critic. He gained degrees at the\nUniversity of Ibadan (BA), the University of Leeds (MA) and York University,\nCanada (PhD, 1979). Previously professor (from 1989) and Head of English\n(1993â97) at the University of Ibadan, he became professor of English at the\nUniversity of New Orleans in 1997. Niyi has a wife, Kimi, and three children,\ntwo girls and a son who still lives in Nigeria. His deaf daughter is the real\nreason Niyi settled in the United States. She could not go to school in Nigeria\nso they found a school in the U.S. for her. They moved with her so Niyi and Kimi\ncould be closer to her.\n\nHe has always been a vehement champion of the right to free speech and is a\nstrong believer in the power of words, saying, \"to utter is to alter\". Osundare\nis renowned for his commitment to socially relevant art and artistic activism\nand has written several open letters to the former President of Nigeria\n(Olusegun Obasanjo), whom Osundare has often publicly criticised.\n\nOsundare believes that there is no choice for the African poet but to be\npolitical: \"You cannot keep quiet about the situation in the kind of\ncountries we find ourselves in, in Africa. When you wake up and there is no\nrunning water, when you have a massive power outage for days and nights, no food\non the table, no hospital for the sick, no peace of mind; when the image of the\nruler you see everywhere is that of a dictator with a gun in his hand; and, on\nthe international level, when you live in a world in which your continent is\nconsigned to the margin, a world in which the colour of your skin is a constant\ndisadvantage, everywhere you go â then there is no other way than to write about\nthis, in an attempt to change the situation for the better.\" \n\nUnder the rule of the dictator General Sani Abacha (1993â1998), Osundare\nregularly contributed poems to a Nigerian national newspaper (now part of the\ncollection Songs of the Season) that criticised the regime and commented upon\nthe lives of people in Nigeria. As a result he was frequently visited by\nSecurity Agents and asked to explain his poems and to whom they\nreferred: \"By that time I realized that the Nigerian security\napparatus had become quite 'sophisticated', quite 'literate'\nindeed!\" \"A couple of my students at the University of\nIbadan had become informers; a few even came to my classes wired. And when I was\nreading abroad, someone trailed me from city to city. At home, my letters were\nfrequently intercepted.\" \n\nIn 1997, he accepted a teaching and research post at the University of New\nOrleans. In 2005 Osundare was caught in Hurricane Katrina, and he and his wife\nwere stuck in their attic for 26 hours. Their neighbor, who at the time was\ndriving by in his boat, heard their shouts for help. They were rescued and\nbounced around from rescue shelters till they ended up in Ringe, New Hampshire,\nwhere Osundare could get a teaching job as a professor at Franklin Pierce\nCollage till things settled down.\n\nHe is a holder of numerous awards for his poetry, as well as the Fonlon/Nichols\naward for \"excellence in literary creativity combined with significant\ncontributions to Human Rights in Africa\".\n\nHis 60th Birthday Literary Fete took place at venues in Ikere-Ekiti, Ibadan and\nLagos state of Nigeria in March 2007.\n\nHis poem \"Not My Business\" is compulsory study in the AQA A syllabus for GCSE\nEnglish Language.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Niyi_Osundare","recorded":1375079905,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ikere-Ekiti","/wiki/Ekiti_State","/wiki/Nigeria","/wiki/University_of_Ibadan","/wiki/University_of_Leeds","/wiki/York_University","/wiki/Ibadan","/wiki/University_of_New_Orleans","/wiki/Freedom_of_speech","/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/Sani_Abacha","/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina","/wiki/Ikere-Ekiti","/wiki/Ibadan","/wiki/Lagos","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Not_My_Business","/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Commonwealth_Poetry_Prize","/wiki/Association_of_Nigerian_Authors","/wiki/Noma_Award","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://osundare60fete.blogspot.com/2007/02/announcing.html","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit&section=3","http://www.english.uno.edu/faculty/osundare.cfm","/wiki/University_of_New_Orleans","http://www.africaresource.com/war/vol4.1/ogoanah-osundare.html","http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-10/2005-10-07-voa67.cfm","/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/14799125","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&oldid=551608782","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:University_of_Ibadan_alumni","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Leeds","/wiki/Category:University_of_Ibadan_faculty","/wiki/Category:Nigerian_academics","/wiki/Category:Nigerian_poets","/wiki/Category:University_of_New_Orleans_faculty","/wiki/Category:Yoruba_poets","/wiki/Category:Nigerian_literary_critics","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1947_births","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Niyi+Osundare&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Niyi+Osundare","/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","/wiki/Talk:Niyi_Osundare","#","/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Niyi_Osundare","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Niyi_Osundare","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&oldid=551608782","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3362899","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Niyi_Osundare&id=551608782","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Niyi+Osundare","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Niyi+Osundare&oldid=551608782&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Niyi_Osundare&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","//yo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3362899#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyi_Osundare","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/image
