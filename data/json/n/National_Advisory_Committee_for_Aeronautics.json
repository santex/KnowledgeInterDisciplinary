On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved, and its\nassets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA). NACA was pronounced as individual letters, rather\nthan as an acronym. Murray, Charles, and Catherine Bly Cox. Apollo. South\nMountain Books, 2004, p. xiii.\n\nAmong other advancements, NACA research and development produced the NACA duct,\na type of air intake used in modern automotive applications, the NACA cowling\nand several series of NACA airfoils which are still used in aircraft\nmanufacturing.\n","linknr":502,"url":"National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics","recorded":1362267785,"links":52,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf","http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf"],"categories":["1915
