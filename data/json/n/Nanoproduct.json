{"cursor":"58940","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Nanotechnology' (sometimes shortened to \"'nanotech'\") is the manipulation of\nmatter on an atomic and molecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of\nnanotechnology  referred\nto the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and\nmolecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as\nmolecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was\nsubsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which\ndefines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension\nsized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum\nmechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the\ndefinition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category\ninclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special\nproperties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore\ncommon to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale\ntechnologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose\ncommon trait is size. With a variety of potential applications, nanotechnologies\nare key for the future and governments have invested billions of dollars in\ntheir research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has\ninvested 3.7 billion dollars. The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and\nJapan 750 million dollars. [http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-\ndetails.php?nid=230436 Apply nanotech to up industrial, agri output], ''The\nDaily Star'' (Bangladesh), 17 April 2012.\n\nNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of\nscience as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology,\nsemiconductor physics, microfabrication, etc. The associated research and\napplications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device\nphysics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from\ndeveloping new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of\nmatter on the atomic scale.\n\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology.\nNanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast\nrange of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, biomaterials and energy\nproduction. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as\nany new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental\nimpact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global\neconomics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These\nconcerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether\nspecial regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.\n","linknr":1403,"url":"Nanoproduct","recorded":1362476884,"links":133,"instances":["biochemistry","bangladesh","track_replication","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/312.NanoLett5regan.pdf","http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/312.NanoLett5regan.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf","http://www.nanolawreport.com/Cambridge.pdf","http://orgprints.org/13569/1/13569.pdf","http://orgprints.org/13569/1/13569.pdf","http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf","http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf"],"categories":["Nanotechnology|","Emerging
