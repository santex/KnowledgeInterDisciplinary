{"cursor":"2534","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'network solid' or 'covalent network solid' is a chemical compound in which\nthe atoms are bonded by covalent bonds in a continuous network. In a network\nsolid there are no individual molecules and the entire crystal may be considered\na macromolecule. Formulas for network solids as those for ionic compounds are\nsimple ratios of the component atoms represented by a formula unit.\n\nExamples of network solids include diamond with a continuous network of carbon\natoms and silicon dioxide or quartz with a continuous three dimensional network\nof SiO 2 units. Graphite and the mica group of silicate minerals\nstructurally consist of continuous two-dimensional layers covalently bonded\nwithin the layer with other bond types holding the layers together.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Network_solid","recorded":1362477004,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Properties","Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_compound","Covalent_bond","Molecule","Crystal","Macromolecule","Ionic_compound","Formula_unit","Diamond","Silicon_dioxide","Quartz","Graphite","Mica","Silicate_mineral","Electrical_conductivity","Allotrope","Quartz","Diamond","Silicon_carbide","Graphite"]}
