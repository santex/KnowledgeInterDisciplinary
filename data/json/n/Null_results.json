{"cursor":"2076","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In science, a 'null result' is a result without the expected content: that is,\nthe proposed result is absent. It is an experimental outcome which\ndoes not show an otherwise expected effect. This does not imply a result of zero\nor nothing, simply a result that does not support the hypothesis. The term is a\ntranslation of the scientific Latin nullus resultarum, meaning \"no consequence\".\n\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, a null result occurs when an experimental\nresult is not significantly different from what is to be expected under the null\nhypothesis. While some effect may in fact be observed, its probability (under\nthe null hypothesis) does not exceed the significance level, i.e., the threshold\nset prior to testing for rejection of the null hypothesis. The significance\nlevel varies, but is often set at 0.05 (5%).\n\nAs an example in physics, the results of the MichelsonâMorley experiment were of\nthis type, as it did not detect the expected velocity relative to the postulated\nluminiferous aether. This experiment's famous failed detection, commonly\nreferred to as the null result, contributed to the development of special\nrelativity. Note that the MMX did in fact appear to measure a non-zero \"drift\",\nbut the value was far too small to account for the theoretically expected\nresults; it is generally thought to be inside the noise level of the experiment-\n.
