For\nother meanings, see [[nonlinearity (disambiguation)]].\n\nIn mathematics, a 'nonlinear system' is one that does not satisfy the\nsuperposition principle, or one whose output is not directly proportional to its\ninput; a linear system fulfills these conditions. In other words, a nonlinear\nsystem is any problem where the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a\nlinear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in it\n(them). It does not matter if nonlinear known functions appear in the equations.\nIn particular, a differential equation is linear if it is linear in terms of the\nundefined function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other\nvariables appearing in it.\n\nNonlinear problems are of interest to engineers, physicists and mathematicians\nbecause most physical systems are inherently nonlinear in nature. Nonlinear\nequations are difficult to solve and give rise to interesting phenomena such as\nchaos.<ref>[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Earth--Atmospheric--and-Planetary-\nSciences/12-006JFall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm Nonlinear Dynamics I: Chaos] at\n[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/index.htm MIT's OpenCourseWare]</ref> Some aspects of\nthe weather (although not the climate) are seen to be chaotic, where simple\nchanges in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout.
