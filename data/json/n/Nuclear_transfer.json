{"cursor":"2986","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Nuclear transfer' is a form of cloning. The steps involve removing the DNA from\nan oocyte (unfertilized egg), and injecting the nucleus which contains the DNA\nto be cloned. In rare instances, the newly constructed cell will divide\nnormally, replicating the new DNA while remaining in a pluripotent state. If the\ncloned cells are placed in the uterus of a female mammal, a cloned organism\ndevelops to term in rare instances. This is how Dolly the Sheep and many other\nspecies were cloned. Cows are commonly cloned to select those that have the best\nmilk production.\n\nDespite this, the low efficiency of the technique has prompted some researchers,\nnotably Ian Wilmut, creator of Dolly the cloned sheep, to abandon it.
