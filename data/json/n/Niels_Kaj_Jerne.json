He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine in 1984 with Georges J. F. KÃ¶hler and CÃ©sar Milstein \"[f]or theories\nconcerning the specificity in development and control of the immune system and\nthe discovery of the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies\".\n\nJerne is known for three significant ideas. Firstly, instead of the body\nproducing antibodies in response to an antigen, Jerne postulated that the immune\nsystem already has the specific antibodies it needs to fight antigens. Secondly,\nit was known that the immune system learns to be tolerant to the individual's\nown self. Jerne postulated that this learning takes place in the thymus.\nThirdly, it was known that T cells and B cells communicate with each other.\nJerne's network theory proposed that the active sites of antibodies are\nattracted to both specific antigens (idiotypes) and to other antibodies that\nbind to the same site. The antibodies are in balance, until an antigen disturbs\nthe balance, stimulating an immune reaction.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Niels_Kaj_Jerne","recorded":1362576101,"links":49,"instances":["germany"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["1911 births|Jerne, Niels Kaj","1994 deaths|Jerne, Niels Kaj","Danish physicians|Jerne, Niels Kaj","Immunologists|Jerne, Niels Kaj","Danish Nobel laureates|Jerne, Niels Kaj","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|Jerne, Niels Kaj","Fellows of the Royal Society|Jerne, Niels Kaj","University of Copenhagen alumni","Medical educators","Danish medical researchers","University of Pittsburgh faculty","Members of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters","People from Rotterdam","People from London"],"headings":["Early years","Research positions","Family life","Honorary titles and memberships","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Niels_Kaj_Jerne.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["paul-ehrlich-institut","germany"]],"members":[],"related":["Denmark","Immunology","Monoclonal_antibodies","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","Denmark","Immunologist","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Georges_J._F._Köhler","César_Milstein","Monoclonal_antibodies","Fanø","London","First_World_War","Netherlands","Rotterdam","Leiden_University","University_of_Copenhagen","Statens_Serum_Institut","Antibody","Langebro","Copenhagen","Antibody","World_Health_Organization","Geneva","Immunology","United_States","University_of_Pittsburgh","Microbiology","University_of_Pittsburgh_School_of_Medicine","World_Health_Organization","Immunology","Europe","Johann_Wolfgang_Goethe_University","Frankfurt","Paul-Ehrlich-Institut_(Germany)","Frankfurt","Basel","Switzerland","Basel_Institute_for_Immunology","Immune_network_theory","Paul_Ehrlich","David_Talmage","Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet","James_Watson","Honorary_doctorates","University_of_Chicago","Columbia_University","University_of_Copenhagen","University_of_Basel","Erasmus_University_Rotterdam","Scientific_societies","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Letters","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Royal_Society","Académie_des_Sciences","Lewis_Wolpert"]}
