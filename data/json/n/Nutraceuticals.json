{"cursor":"22275","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nutraceutical', a portmanteau of the words ânutritionâ and âpharmaceuticalâ, is\na food or food product that reportedly provides health and medical benefits,\nincluding the prevention and treatment of disease. Health Canada defines the\nterm as \"a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in\nmedicinal forms not usually associated with food. A nutraceutical is\ndemonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against\nchronic disease.\" Such products may range from isolated nutrients,\ndietary supplements and specific diets to genetically engineered foods, herbal\nproducts, and processed foods such as cereals, soups, and beverages. With recent\ndevelopments in cellular-level nutraceutical agents, researchers, and medical\npractitioners are developing templates for integrating and assessing information\nfrom clinical studies on complementary and alternative therapies into\nresponsible medical practice. The term nutraceutical was originally\ndefined by Dr. Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of\nInnovation Medicine (FIM), Crawford, New Jersey. Since\nthe term was coined by Dr. DeFelice, its meaning has been modified by Health\nCanada which defines nutraceutical as: a product isolated or purified from\nfoods, and generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food\nand demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against\nchronic disease. Examples are beta-carotene and lycopene.\nThe definition of nutraceutical that appears in the latest edition of the Merriam-\nWebster Dictionary is as follows: A food stuff (as a fortified food or a dietary\nsupplement) that provides health benefits. Nutraceutical foods are\nnot subject to the same testing and regulations as pharmaceutical drugs. The American Nutraceutical Association works with the Food & Drug\nAdministration in consumer education, developing industry and scientific\nstandards for products and manufacturers, and other related consumer protection\nroles. The FDA provides a list of dietary supplement companies receiving warning\nletters about their products.
