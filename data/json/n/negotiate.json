Negotiation is\na process where each party involved in negotiating tries to gain an advantage\nfor themselves by the end of the process. Negotiation is intended to aim at\ncompromise.\n\nNegotiation occurs in business, non-profit organizations, government\nbranches, legal proceedings, among nations and in personal situations such as\nmarriage, divorce, parenting, and everyday life. The study of the subject is\ncalled [[negotiation theory]]. Professional negotiators are often\nspecialized, such as union negotiators, leverage buyout negotiators, peace\nnegotiators, hostage negotiators, or may work under other titles, such as\ndiplomats, legislators or brokers.\n","title":"Negotiation","headings":["Negotiation strategies","Negotiation tactics","Emotion in negotiation","Team negotiations","Etymology","Barriers to negotiations","Negotiation tactics","Nonverbal communication in negotiation","See also","Notes","References and further reading"]},"micro-relation":["2: Collective_bargaining","2: Mediation","2: Arbitration","2: Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement","2: Bad_faith","2: John_Foster_Dulles","2: Decision_making","2: Zero-sum","2: Group_Emotion","1: Albert_Apponyi","1: Dialogue","1: Compromise","1: Diplomats","1: Legislators","1: Brokers","1: Mutual_Gains_Approach","1: Program_on_Negotiation","1: Gould_Negotiation_and_Mediation_Teaching_Program","1: Holly_Schroth","1: Timothy_Dayonot","1: Gerard_E._Watzke","1: Sara_Cobb","1: Len_Riskin","1: Howard_Raiffa","1: Robert_McKersie","1: Lawrence_Susskind","1: Adil_Najam","1: Jeswald_Salacuse","1: Salami_tactics","1: Political_science","1: Political_psychology","1: Information_processing","1: Inherent_bad_faith_model","1: Ole_Holsti","1: Hamas","1: Israel","1: Emotion","1: Dispositional_Affect","1: Problem_solving","1: Anger","1: Utility#Utility_functions","1: Utility","1: Disappointment","1: Sadness","1: Compassion","1: Social_interaction","1: Laboratory","1: Alternative_Dispute_Resolution","1: Bargaining","1: Car_negotiation","1: Collaborative_software","1: Collective_action","1: Conciliation","1: Conflict_resolution_research","1: Contract","1: Cross-cultural","1: Cross-cultural_differences_in_decision_making","1: Diplomacy","1: Dispute_resolution","1: Expert_determination","1: Flipism","1: Game_theory","1: Impasse","1: Leadership","1: Nash_equilibrium","1: Negotiation_theory","1: Prisoner's_dilemma","1: Win-win_game","1: Charles_Blattberg","1: Conversation","1: Chester_Karrass"]}
