{"cursor":"20183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Needle removers' are devices that physically remove a needle from a syringe.\nIn developing countries, there is still a need for improvements in needle\nsafety in hospital settings as most of the needle removal processes are done\nmanually and under severe risk of hazard from needles puncturing skin and\nallowing infection. These countries cannot afford needles with individual\nsafety devices attached, so needle-removers must be used to remove the needle\nfrom the syringe. This lowers possible pathogen spread by preventing the reuse\nof the syringes, reducing incidents of accidental needle-sticks, and\nfacilitating syringe disposal.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Needle_remover","recorded":1362889927,"links":32,"instances":["physics","mechanism","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5588966.pdf","http://www.bd.com/immunization/pdfs/products/bd_hub_cutter_brochure.pdf","http://www.bd.com/safety/pdfs/BD_safetyglide_syringe_usage.pdf","http://www.bd.com/immunization/pdfs/products/bd_uniject.pdf","http://www.bmes.org/pdf/2004ApprovedCodeofEthicsShortForm.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4628169.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4255996.pdf","http://www.who.int/injection_safety/toolbox/docs/en/AgendaNeedleRemoval.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3800644.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5312346.pdf","http://www.healthcarewaste.org/documents/PATH_needleRemover_design.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4961541.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3683733.pdf","http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/en/sharps.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3683733.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4986811.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6158314.pdf","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/345/7/538.pdf","http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5046669.pdf","http://www.ijoeh.com/pfds/1004_Wilburn.pdf"],"categories":["Biomedical engineering","Medical hygiene"],"headings":["Background","Existing solutions","Benefits of needle-removers","Social and ethical implications","Possible designs","Commercial models","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Wall-mounted_sharps_container.JPG/220px-Wall-mounted_sharps_container.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crank","mechanism"],["plasma","physics"],["injection","medicine"]],"members":["plasma","crank","injection"],"related":["Hypodermic_needle","Syringe","Developing_countries","Needle_safety","Hospital","Pathogen","Needle-stick","Developing_countries","World_Health_Organization","Needlestick_injury","Hepatitis_B","Hepatitis_C","HIV","Ghana","Blood-borne_disease","Insulin","Tuberculin","Becton_Dickinson","Uniject","Hepatitis_B","Hepatitis_C","Hammer_mill","Electricity","Crank_(mechanism)","Plasma_(physics)","Sharps_container","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Hypodermic_needle","Injection_(medicine)","International_Council_of_Nurses","Biomedical_technology","Biomedical_engineering","Needle-exchange_programme"]}
