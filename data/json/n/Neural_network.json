J. J. HOPFIELD Neural networks and physical\nsystems with emergent collective computational abilities. Proc. NatL Acad. Sci.\nUSA Vol. 79, pp. 2554-2558, April 1982 Biophysics\n[http://www.pnas.org/content/79/8/2554.full.pdf] The modern usage of the\nterm often refers to artificial neural networks, which are composed of\nartificial neurons or nodes. Thus the term has two distinct usages:\n# Biological neural networks are made up of real biological neurons that are\n# connected or functionally related in a nervous system. In the field of\n# neuroscience, they are often identified as groups of neurons that perform a\n# specific physiological function in laboratory analysis. Artificial neural\n# networks are composed of interconnecting artificial neurons (programming\n# constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons) for solving\n# artificial intelligence problems without creating a model of a real system.\n# Neural network algorithms abstract away the biological complexity by focusing\n# on the most important information. The goal of artificial neural networks is\n# good, or human-like, predictive
