{"cursor":"1432","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn genetics, a 'neutral mutation' is a mutation that has no effect on fitness.\nIn other words, it is neutral with respect to natural selection.\n\nFor example, some mutations in a DNA triplet or codon do not change which amino\nacid is introduced: this is known as a synonymous substitution. Unless the\nmutation also has a regulatory effect, synonymous substitutions are usually\nneutral. Some non-synonymous mutations, i.e. mutations that do change the amino\nacid, are also neutral: these neutral changes are often to a chemically similar\namino acid that may not affect the functionality of the overall protein or\ncomplex with which it associated. Such mutations may be widely present in\nindividuals within a population through neutral drift.\n\nNeutral mutations can accumulate over time due to genetic drift or genetic\ndraft. According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, even if most\nmutations are deleterious rather than neutral or adaptive, the majority of\nmutations that go on to become fixed as differences between species are neutral.\n\nMany or even most mutations to noncoding DNA are neutral.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Neutral_mutation","recorded":1362483372,"links":19,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mutation","Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"]],"members":["fitness"],"related":["Genetics","Mutation","Fitness_(biology)","Natural_selection","Codon","Amino_acid","Synonymous_substitution","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Genetic_drift","Genetic_drift","Genetic_hitchhiking","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Noncoding_DNA"]}
