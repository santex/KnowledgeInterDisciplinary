The device features Bluetooth, a 1.3\nmegapixel fixed focus camera, front VGA (0.3 megapixel) video call camera, hot\nswappable Dual Voltage Reduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) memory expansion card\nsupport, stereo audio playback and a 2.1\", 176x208, 18-bit (262,144) color\ndisplay with automatic brightness control based on the environment. Announced in\nFebruary 2005, they reached the market in May 2005.\n\nThe 6680 remains a high-end 3G device. It is a smartphone offering office and\npersonal management facilities, including Microsoft Office compatible software.\nThe phone initially offered an innovative active standby mode, but this was\nremoved by some network operators (for example, Orange) under their own adapted\nfirmware. The phone, however has been marred by a more-than-normal number of\nbugs, which have included crashes and security issues. The phone was also\ncriticised in some reviews for the relatively limited memory available.\n\nIn addition to the standard RS-MMC card, the 6680 can also use Dual Voltage\nReduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) cards which are also marketed as MMCmobile. While\nthese cards have the same form factor as RS-MMC, the DV-RS-MMC have a 2nd row of\nconnectors on the bottom. Make sure any upgraded card supports or claims to\nsupport 1.8V in addition to 3.0V.\n\nThe phone operates on GSM 900/1800/1900, and UMTS 2100 on 3G networks.\n\nDuring its development, the 6680 was nicknamed Milla.\n\nThis handset was similar to its predecessor, the Nokia 6630. Key changes were\nthe new \"active standby\" feature, the facility for face-to-face video calls, a\ncamera flash, better screen and improved styling.\n\nThis handset was the spring-board onto the N-Series, its successor being the\nN70.\n\nThe hardware application platform of this device is OMAP 1710.\n","linknr":460,"url":"Nokia_6681","recorded":1362891017,"links":36,"instances":["form"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Smartphones","Nokia mobile phones|6680"],"headings":["Variants","Related handsets","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Nokia_6680.jpg/150px-Nokia_6680.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Nokia6681.JPG/100px-Nokia6681.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Nokia_wordmark.svg/125px-Nokia_wordmark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bar","form"]],"members":["bar"],"related":["Nokia","Megapixel","Megapixel","Series_60","3G","Bar_(form)","Nokia_6630","Nokia_N70","Nokia_N75","Symbian","Series_60","Bluetooth","Multimedia_Card","3G","Microsoft_Office","Multimedia_Card","GSM","UMTS","Nokia_Nseries","Nokia_N70","OMAP","Nokia","Series_60","Symbian","Omap","Nokia_N70"]}
