It is seen as a clinical and\nexperimental field of psychology that aims to study, assess, understand and\ntreat behaviors directly related to brain functioning. The term neuropsychology\nhas been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been\napplied to efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or\ngroups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human\npatients).<ref name=\"Posner 2000\"></ref> It is scientific in its approach,\nmaking use of neuroscience, and shares an information processing view of the\nmind with cognitive psychology and cognitive science.\n\nIn practice neuropsychologists tend to work in research settings (universities,\nlaboratories or research institutions), clinical settings (involved in assessing\nor treating patients with neuropsychological problems), forensic settings or\nindustry (often as consultants where neuropsychological knowledge is applied to\nproduct design or in the management of pharmaceutical clinical-trials research\nfor drugs that might have a potential impact on CNS functioning).\n",
