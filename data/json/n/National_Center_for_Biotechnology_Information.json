The NCBI is located in Bethesda, Maryland () and was\n founded in 1988 through legislation sponsored by Senator Claude Pepper.\n\nThe NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine.\nMajor databases include GenBank for DNA sequences and PubMed, a bibliographic\ndatabase for the biomedical literature. All these databases are available online\nthrough the Entrez search engine.\n\nNCBI is directed by David Lipman, one of the original authors of the BLAST\nsequence alignment program and a widely respected figure in bioinformatics. He\nalso leads an intramural research program, including groups led by Stephen\nAltschul (another BLAST co-author), David Landsman, Eugene Koonin (a prolific\nauthor on comparative genomics), John Wilbur, Teresa Przytycka, and Zhiyong Lu.\n","linknr":163,"url":"National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","recorded":1362505056,"links":41,"instances":["book"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Discipline-oriented digital libraries","Medical research institutes in the United States"],"headings":["GenBank","NCBI Bookshelf","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/US-NLM-NCBI-Logo.svg/140px-US-NLM-NCBI-Logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coffee_break","book"]],"members":["coffee_break"],"related":["United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine","National_Institutes_of_Health","Bethesda,_Maryland","Claude_Pepper","Biotechnology","GenBank","PubMed","Entrez","David_Lipman","BLAST","Bioinformatics","Stephen_Altschul","BLAST","Eugene_Koonin","Comparative_genomics","[DNA","Biological_databases","European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory","DNA_Data_Bank_of_Japan","Online_Mendelian_Inheritance_in_Man","DbSNP","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Human_genome","Taxonomy","World_Wide_Web","BLAST","Molecular_biology","Biochemistry","Cell_biology","Genetics","Microbiology","Virology","Coffee_Break_(book)","Pubmed","Peer_review","European_Bioinformatics_Institute","DNA_Data_Bank_of_Japan"]}
