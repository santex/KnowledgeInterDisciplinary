It is diagnosed with blood tests. It\nis related to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), another complication of diabetes more\noften (but not exclusively) encountered in people with type 1 diabetes; they are\ndifferentiated with measurement of ketone bodies, organic molecules that are the\nunderlying driver for DKA but are usually not detectable in HHS.\n\nThe treatment of HHS consists of correction of the dehydration with intravenous\nfluids, reduction of the blood sugar levels with insulin, and management of any\nunderlying conditions that might have precipitated the illness, such as an acute\ninfection.\n\nOlder names for HHS are 'hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma' (HONK), 'nonketotic\nhyperosmolar coma', 'hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome' (favoured\nby the American Diabetes Association). )\n","linknr":227,"url":"Nonketotic_hyperosmolar_coma","recorded":1362482080,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical emergencies","Diabetes"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Pathophysiology","Management","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/9px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Diabetes_mellitus","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Hyperglycemia","Dehydration","Osmolarity","Coma","Blood_test","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Ketone_bodies","Intravenous_fluid","Insulin","American_Diabetes_Association","Thrombosis","Glucose","Osmolarity","Polyuria","Osmotic_diuresis","Ketosis","Insulin","Hormone-sensitive_lipase","Lipolysis","Hypokalemia"]}
