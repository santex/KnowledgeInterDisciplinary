Nice is the capital of the Alpes Maritimes\ndépartement and the second biggest city of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region\nafter Marseille.\n\nThe area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site which\ndisplays evidence of a very early use of fire. Around 350 BC, Greeks of\nMarseille founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia, after Nike, the\ngoddess of victory.<ref></ref> Through the ages, the town has changed hands many\ntimes. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime\nstrength. For years it was a dominion of Savoy, then became part of France\nbetween 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to Piedmont-Sardinia until its\nreannexation by France in 1860.\n\nThe natural beauty of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to\nthe attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th\ncentury, when an increasing number of aristocratic families took to spending\ntheir winter there. The city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais\n(‘the Walkway of the English') owes its name to the earliest visitors to the\nresort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref> For decades now, the\npicturesque Nicean surroundings have attracted not only those in search of\nrelaxation, but also those seeking inspiration. The clear air and soft light has\nbeen of particular appeal to some of Western culture's most outstanding\npainters, such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Arman.\nTheir work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including Musée Marc\nChagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts Jules Chéret.<ref></ref> Nice\nhas the second largest hotel capacity in the
