With origins traceable back to 600 AD,\nNottingham was granted its city charter as part of the Diamond Jubilee\ncelebrations of Queen Victoria in 1897 and has since been officially titled the\nCity of Nottingham. Nottingham is home to the BBC East Midlands offices and\nformerly the Government Office for the East Midlands. It is one of eight members\nof the English Core Cities Group.\n\nWhilst Nottingham City has always had a traditionally tightly-drawn city\nboundary, accounting for its relatively small population of 305,700 (making it\nthe second largest city in the East Midlands behind its local neighbour\nLeicester with a population of 330,000); the Nottingham Urban Area in fact has a\npopulation of approximately 729,977; in the 2011 census,<ref name=\"BUA\"></ref>\nit was the ninth largest urban area in the United Kingdom.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\nEurostat's concept of the Larger Urban Zone listed the area's population at\n825,600 as of 2004.\n\nNottingham has a number of famous institutions and venues - including the\nNational Ice Centre, the National Water Sports Centre, a world-famous Test\ncricket ground, two professional English Football League teams, and top-flight\ncricket and ice hockey sides. In addition, over 60,000 students attend the\ncity's two universities, the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent\nUniversity, giving the city a large student population.\n\nCulturally, there are two large-capacity theatres, numerous museums and art\ngalleries including the Nottingham Contemporary, an independent cinema (The\nBroadway, rated one of the 'best in the world' by Total Film magazine in 2009)\n<ref>http://www.investinnottingham.com/news.asp?pageid=107&MediaID=233&MediaCat-\negoryId=5</ref> and several live music venues, including the Capital FM Arena\nand Rock City, both of which regularly host major UK and international artists.\n\nBeing located at the heart of England, Nottingham also has transport links to\nthe rest of the United Kingdom and abroad. The city has a tram system and the\nlargest public bus network in the UK.<ref>http://www.transdevplc.co.uk/our-\ncompanies.jsp?companyID=6</ref> In October 2012, it was named Transport City\nof the Year.<ref>[http://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/pressarchive/index.aspx?ar-\nticleid=19834 Nottingham is best UK city for transport]</ref> The city is\nconnected to the continent by East Midlands Airport, located to the south-west\nof the city.\n","title":"nottingham","headings":["History","Government","Geography","Architecture","Education","Economy","Culture","Sport","Transport","Crime","Religion","Media","Twin cities","Notable
