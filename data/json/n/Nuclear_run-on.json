Cell nuclei are isolated rapidly, and incubated\nwith labelled nucleotides and the results are hybridized to a slot blot, which\nis then exposed to film. It was originally developed by Gariglio et al. (1981)\nand Brown et al. (1984) (see discussion). Adding actinomycin-D to the reaction\nbuffer is sufficient to stop transcription, while other toxins, such as Î±-\namanitin, show different effects, making it a good way to assay the effects of\nthese compounds.\n\nThis method allows changes in transcription rates to be measured, which often\ndiffer from steady-state mRNA levels used in microarrays. Although the method is\ntime-consuming and requires the use of radioactivity and large numbers of cells,\nit remains the most reliable method to measure transcription rates directly.\nSeveral attempts recently have been made to make this method microarray-\ncompatible, but other methods are much more favorable. To have a publication\nquality blot about 10 7 nuclei are needed, but 10 6 nuclei\nare sufficient to give results: these quantities of cells are higher than for\nmost protocols.\n\nIt is often cited that this method has been surpassed by microarrays, even\nthough this method compares transcription rates and not total transcript\nexpression levels, which differ.\n\nIt is incompatible with microarray experiments due to the fact eukaryotic\npolymerases are more intolerant towards fluorescently labeled or aminoallyl\nnucleotides, so UTP with phosphorus-32, or phosphorus-33, on the alpha phosphate\ngroup is normally used. Cheadle et al. (2005) used spotted nylon blots to obtain\na high-throughput analysis of T-cell activation. Garcia-Martinez et al.\n(2004)developed a protocol for the yeast S. cerevisiae (Genomic run-on, GRO)\nthat allows for the calculation of transcription rates (TRs) for all yeast\ngenes. Those authors also used the calculated TRs and the steady-state mRNA\namounts of all genes to determine, at global scale, the mRNA stabilities for all\nyeast mRNAs.\n\nAlternative microarray methods have recently been developed, mainly PolII RIP-\nchip: RNA immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II with phosphorylated C-\nterminal domain directed antibodies and hybridization on a microarray slide or\nchip (the word chip in the name stems from \"ChIP-chip\" where a special\naffymetrix genechip was required). A comparison of methods based on run-on and\nChIP-chip has been made in yeast (Pelechano et al., 2009). A general\ncorrespondence of both methods has been detected but GRO is more sensitive and\nquantitative. It has to be considered that run-on only detects elongating RNA\npolymerases whereas ChIP-chip detects all present RNA polymerases, including\nbacktracked ones.\n\nThe main issue on the validity of run on assay results is the presence of\nartifacts due to the isolation step: some transcripts may stop prematurely\nothers might start out of place.\n\nAnother point to add is about the nuclei: There are various methods that require\nnuclear isolation. The problem is that the nuclear membrane is contiguous with\nthe ER which is rich in protein and cytoplasmic mRNA; some methods require pure\nnuclear lysate while others, like a nuclear run-on, require \"dirty\" nuclei with\nan intact nuclear membrane even if the ER is attached. Some types of cell are\nnotoriously difficult to isolate this way such as lymphocytes, which require a\nsucrose gradient purification. Yeast cells do not require nuclei isolation.\nPermeabilized cells (with sarkosil) can be used. This is a clear technical\nadvantage.\n","linknr":81,"url":"Nuclear_run-on","recorded":1362481320,"links":10,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Gene","Transcription_(genetics)","Cell_nucleus","Nucleotide","Slot_blot","Actinomycin-D","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_immunoprecipitation","Radioactivity_in_biology"]}
