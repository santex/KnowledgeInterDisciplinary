{"cursor":"28670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Natural killer cells' (or 'NK cells') are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte\ncritical to the innate immune system. The role NK cells play is analogous to\nthat of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells\nprovide rapid responses to virally infected cells and respond to tumor\nformation, acting at around 3 days after infection. Typically immune cells\ndetect MHC presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release\ncausing lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the\nability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC,\nallowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named ânatural killersâ\nbecause of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to\nkill cells that are missing âselfâ markers of major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) class 1 . \n\nNK cells are defined as large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and constitute the\nthird kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor\ngenerating B and T lymphocytes. Roitt I, Brostoff J, Male D\n(2001). Immunology (6th ed.), 480p. St. Louis: Mosby, ISBN 0-7234-3189-2.\nNK cells are known to differentiate and mature in the bone marrow, lymph node,\nspleen, tonsils and thymus where they then enter into the circulation. .\n\n NK cells differ from Natural Killer T cells (NKT) phenotypically, by\norigin and by respective effector functions; often NKT cell activity promotes NK\ncell activity by secreting IFNγ. In contrast to NKT cells, NK cells do not\nexpress T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) or Pan T marker CD3 or surface\nimmunoglobulins (Ig) B cell receptors, but they usually express the surface\nmarkers CD16 (FcÎ³RIII) and CD56 in humans, NK1.1 or NK1.2 in C57BL/6 mice. Up to\n80% of human NK cells also express CD8.\n\nIn addition to the knowledge that natural killer cells are effectors of innate\nimmunity, recent research has uncovered information on both activating and\ninhibitory NK cell receptors which play important function roles including self\ntolerance and sustaining NK cell activity. NK cell also play a role in adaptive\nimmune response ,\n\n numerous experiments have worked to demonstrate their ability to readily\nadjust to the immediate environment and formulate antigen-specific immunological\nmemory, fundamental for responding to secondary infections with the same\nantigen. The ability for NK cells to act in both the innate and adaptive immune\nresponse is becoming increasingly important in research utilizing NK cell\nactivity and potential cancer therapies.\n","linknr":575,"url":"Natural_killer_cell","recorded":1362669547,"links":43,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","immunology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lymphocytes","Human cells"],"headings":["NK cell receptors","Function","History","New findings","See also","Literature","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/HLA-Cw4.png/150px-HLA-Cw4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/PDB_1hq8_EBI.jpg/150px-PDB_1hq8_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/PDB_1hkf_EBI.jpg/150px-PDB_1hkf_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Missingself.svg/400px-Missingself.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cd3","immunology"],["stress","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","stress","cd3"],"related":["Cytotoxic","Lymphocyte","Innate_immune_system","Cytotoxic_T_cell","Adaptive_immune_response","Tumor","Infection","Immune_cells","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Cytokine","Lysis","Apoptosis","NK_cells","Antibodies","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Lymphoblast","B_cell","T_cell","Bone_marrow","Lymph_node","Spleen","Tonsil","Thymus","Natural_Killer_T_cell","NKT_cell","IFN&gamma;","T-cell_antigen_receptors","CD3_(immunology)","Immunoglobulin","B_cell_receptor","CD16","CD56","C57BL/6","Mouse","CD8","Innate_immunity","Adaptive_immune_response","Immunological_memory","Cytotoxicity","Apoptosis","Ligands","MHC_I","HLA-E","Signal_peptide_peptidase","Proteasome","Antibody-dependent_cell-mediated_cytotoxicity","IgG","Cytotoxic","Granulocytes","Cytoplasm","Perforin","Protease","Granzyme","Cell_membrane","Apoptosis","Lysis","Immunology","Virion","Alpha_defensin","Neutrophil","CD16","Cytokine","Stress_(biology)","Virus","Viruses","Pathogens","Receptor_(biochemistry)","T_cell","MHC_class_I","Allele","Microbes","TNF&alpha;","IFN&gamma;","Interleukin","Interleukin_10","Macrophages","Dendritic_cells","Neutrophils","NKG2D","NKG2D","Disulphide","Homodimer","MHC_class_I_polypeptide-related_sequence_A","Macrophage","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Fragment_crystallizable_region","Antibody","Humoral_immunity","Lysis","Antibody-dependent_cellular_cytotoxicity","Fas_receptor","FASL","Pregnancy","Immune_tolerance_in_pregnancy","CD56","Leukocyte","Perforin","Trophoblast","HLA-A","HLA-B","Cytotoxic_T_cell","HLA-E","HLA-G","KIR2DL4","Cytokine","TNF-α","Interleukin_10","IFN-γ","TGF-β","Prostate_cancer","Lysis","Tumor_cell","T-lymphocytes","Lysis","Monoclonal_antibodies","Fc_region","Breast_cancer","Monoclonal_antibodies","Myeloid_leukemia","Multiple_myeloma","Dana-Farber_Cancer_Institute","Lymphomas","Epstein-Barr_virus","NKG2D","Fc_region","HIV","AIDS","Human_leukocyte_antigen","T_helper_cell","Active_Hexose_Correlated_Compound","Granzyme","Hematopoiesis","Immune_system","Immunoglobulin","Interleukin","Lymphatic_System"]}
