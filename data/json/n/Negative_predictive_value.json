It is defined as the proportion of subjects with a negative test\nresult who are correctly diagnosed. A high NPV for a given test means that when\nthe test yields a negative result, it is most likely correct in its assessment.\nIn the familiar context of medical testing, a high NPV means that the test only\nrarely misclassifies a sick person as being healthy. Note that this says\nnothing about the tendency of the test to mistakenly classify a healthy person\nas being sick.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Negative_predictive_value","recorded":1362481398,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biostatistics","Statistical ratios","Categorical data","Summary statistics for contingency tables"],"headings":["Definition","Worked example","Relation to negative post-test probability","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/0/8c0d51bb9237597ef6e61b108a79ae30.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/c/a/9ca03d493971be041523909993b736bf.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Statistics","Diagnostic_testing","Summary_statistic","Diagnostic_test","Positive_predictive_value","Sensitivity","Specificity","Cross-sectional_study","Prevalence","Case-control_study","Fecal_occult_blood","Pre-_and_post-test_probability","Pre-test_probability","Positive_predictive_value","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Diagnostic_odds_ratio","Binary_classification"]}
