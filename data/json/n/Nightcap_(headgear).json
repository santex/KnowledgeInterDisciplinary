They are similar to winter\n'beanies' worn in cold climates. They were common in northern Europe before\ncentral heating was available, when homes were cold at night.\n\nWomen's night caps usually consisted of a long piece of cloth wrapped around the\nhead. Men's nightcaps were traditionally pointed, with a long top, usually\naccompanied by a small ball of some sort, which was used similar to a scarf. It\nkept the neck warm while not being so long that it could wrap around and become\na choking hazard.\n\nIn the Tyburn and Newgate days of the British judicial hanging history, the hood\nused to hide the prisonerâs final agonies was actually a nightcap supplied by\nthe prisoner themselves, if they could afford it. When they had finished their\nprayers, the hangman simply pulled it down over their face. In some cases, women\nmight choose a bonnet with a veil instead. From around 1850, a white linen hood\nwas provided by the authorities as part of the execution process.\n\nNightcaps are not often worn in modern times, although they are easily obtained\nfrom, for example, better class gentlemen's outfitters. They are often featured\nin animation and other media as part of a character's pyjamas.\n","linknr":302,"url":"Nightcap_(headgear)","recorded":1362566552,"links":26,"instances":["caricaturist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Headgear","Nightwear"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Marley%27s_Ghost-John_Leech_1843-detail.jpg/220px-Marley%27s_Ghost-John_Leech_1843-detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_leech","caricaturist"]],"members":["john_leech"],"related":["Charles_Dickens","A_Christmas_Carol","John_Leech_(caricaturist)","Cap","Pajamas","Nightgown","Central_heating","Scarf","Tyburn","Newgate","Barretina","Phrygian_cap","Tuque"]}
