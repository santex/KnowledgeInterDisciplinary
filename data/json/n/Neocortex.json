It is the outer layer of the cerebral hemispheres, and made up\nof six layers, labelled I to VI (with VI being the innermost and I being the\noutermost). The neocortex is part of the cerebral cortex (along with the\narchicortex and paleocortex, which are cortical parts of the limbic system). In\nall mammals, it is involved in \"higher functions\" such as sensory perception,\ngeneration of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Neocortex","recorded":1362373175,"links":30,"instances":["neuroanatomy","geology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neuroanatomy","Cerebrum"],"headings":["Anatomy","Evolution","Neocortex ratio","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mantle","geology"],["sulcus","neuroanatomy"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["sulcus","mantle","cell"],"related":["Latin","Bark","Mantle_(geology)","Brain","Mammal","Cerebral_hemisphere","Cerebral_cortex","Archicortex","Paleocortex","Limbic_system","Sense","Motor_cortex","Spatial_visualization_ability","Consciousness","Language","Grey_matter","Myelin","White_matter","Myelin","Axon","Cerebrum","Rodent","Primate","Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)","Gyrus","Pyramidal_neurons","Interneurons","Cell_(biology)","Neuron","Motor_cortex","Axons","Thalamus","Brainstem","Spinal_cord","Synapse","Cortical_column","Sound","Visual_perception","Frontal_lobe","Parietal_lobe","Occipital_lobe","Temporal_lobe","Primary_visual_cortex","Primary_auditory_cortex","Frontal_lobe","Broca's_area","Orbitofrontal_cortex","Cerebral_cortex","Paleocortex","Archicortex","Allocortex","Species","Bird","Reptile","Turtles","Dunbar's_number","List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain","Blue_Brain","Memory-prediction_framework"]}
