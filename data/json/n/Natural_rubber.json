Forms of polyisoprene\nthat are useful as natural rubbers are classified as elastomers. Currently the\nrubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from certain trees. The\nlatex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making incisions into the bark and\ncollecting the fluid in vessels. This process is called \"tapping\". The latex\nthen is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing. Natural rubber is\nused extensively in many applications and products, either alone or in\ncombination with other materials. In most of its useful forms it has a large\nstretch ratio, high resilience, and is extremely waterproof. Heinz-\nHermann Greve \"Rubber, 2.
