The RealWorld-InWorld experience provides\nteams of students working initially with teachers/coaches the opportunity to\nsolve NASA-inspired engineering problems and then to build solutions with\nuniversity students and engineering mentors in a virtual reality setting. Teams\nconsider real-world questions related to both the James Webb Space Telescope and\nthe dextrous humanoid robot known as Robonaut 2, and then work to develop\nlogistical solutions to the actual problems that researchers and scientists are\nsolving today. RealWorld-InWorld is a joint education initiative of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute of Aerospace\n(NIA), USA TODAY Education, and LearniT-TeachiT.\n\nThe RealWorld-InWorld NASA Engineering Design Challenge builds on the successful\nSIGHT/INSIGHT design challenge developed by USA TODAY Education and NASA and the\nVirtual Exploration Sustainability Challenge (VESC) developed by NIA and NASA.\nBoth education initiatives were based upon NASA themes and content for students\nin grade 7-12. They deepen students' understanding of STEM careers, project\nmanagement, and NASA innovation.\n","linknr":161,"url":"NASA_RealWorld-InWorld_Engineering_Design_Challenge","recorded":1362268031,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science competitions"],"headings":["Problem solving","Sponsors and partners","Robonaut 2","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)","Getting started 2011","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["STEM_fields","National_Institute_of_Aerospace","National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration","National_Institute_of_Aerospace","USA_TODAY","NASA's_Johnson_Space_Center","International_Space_Station","General_Motors","Oceaneering_Space_Systems","Apollo_Space_Program","Big_Bang","NASA","European_Space_Agency","Canadian_Space_Agency","Goddard_Space_Center","Northrup_Grumman","Space_Telescope_Science_Institute","Next_Generation_Space_Telescope","Hubble_Space_Telescope","James_Webb_Space_Telescope","Robonaut_2"]}
