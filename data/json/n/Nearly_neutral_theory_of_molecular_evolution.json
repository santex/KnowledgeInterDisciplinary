{"cursor":"3488","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution' is a modification of the\nneutral theory of molecular evolution that accounts for slightly advantageous or\ndeleterious mutations at the molecular level. The nearly neutral theory was\nproposed by Tomoko Ohta in 1973 (including only\ndeleterious mutations) and expanded in the early 1990s to include both\nadvantageous and deleterious nearly neutral mutations. Unlike in Motoo Kimura's\noriginal neutral theory—which dealt only with mutations unaffected by\nnatural selection—the nearly neutral theory predicts a relationship\nbetween population size and the rate of molecular evolution: in larger\npopulations, genetic drift, which can bring even slightly deleterious mutations\nto fixation, is a weaker force, so evolution happens more slowly than in smaller\npopulations.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Nearly_neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","recorded":1362483372,"links":11,"instances":["population_genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular evolution","Population genetics"],"headings":["Origins of the nearly neutral theory","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"]],"members":["fixation"],"related":["Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Mutation","Tomoko_Ohta","Motoo_Kimura","Natural_selection","Population_size","Molecular_evolution","Genetic_drift","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Protein","Molecular_clock","Generation_time","Noncoding_DNA","Amino_acid"]}
