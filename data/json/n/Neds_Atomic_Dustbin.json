The band took their name from an episode\nof [[The Goon Show]]. [http://www.indiewar.co.uk/page/type/bands-\n2/ ] The band were unusual for using two bass players in their lineup:\nAlex Griffin played melody lines high up on one bass, and Mat Cheslin played the\nregular bass lines on the other. This gave the band a tense and highly driven\nsub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic\ndrums.\n\nThe band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first\nalbum while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong\nteenage fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at\ntheir gigs. The band were also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their\nearly image which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for\nsporting shorts and band/skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred\nto them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirt designs, reportedly\nproducing over 86 different designs within three years (1987â1990).\n(In 2009, Jonn Penney stated, \"We're still adding designs - old habits die\nhard\".)\n","linknr":332,"url":"Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin","recorded":1362544069,"links":18,"instances":["county","musician","music","band","song","musician","bay_city_rollers_song","singer","tv_series","musical_instrument","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English rock music groups","English alternative rock groups","Stourbridge","Musical groups established in 1987"],"headings":["History","Reunited","Members – classic lineup 1989–1995, 2008-present","Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Neds.jpg/220px-Neds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grebo","music"],["rat","ned's_atomic_dustbin"],["darren_brown","musician"],["rock","music"],["west_midlands","county"],["seal","singer"],["electronic","band"],["sampler","musical_instrument"],["the_word","tv_series"],["saturday_night","bay_city_rollers_song"],["rat","ned's_atomic_dustbin"],["andy_king","musician"],["happy","ned's_atomic_dustbin_song"],["trust","ned's_atomic_dustbin_song"],["intact","song"],["saturday_night","bay_city_rollers_song"],["stuck","ned's_atomic_dustbin_song"],["hibernation","ned's_atomic_dustbin_song"]],"members":["west_midlands","trust","andy_king","rock","electronic","intact","darren_brown","saturday_night","seal","the_word","stuck","rat","sampler","grebo","hibernation","happy"],"related":["Wolverhampton","Stourbridge","Alternative_rock","Power_pop","Grebo_(music)","Shoegaze","Indie_punk","Sony","Columbia_Records","Jonn_Penney","Alex_Griffin","Dan_Warton","Rat_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin)","Matt_Cheslin","Darren_Brown_(musician)","Rock_(music)","Stourbridge","West_Midlands_(county)","Crowd_surfing","Moshing","The_Wonder_Stuff","Reading_Festival","United_Kingdom","KLF","Seal_(singer)","The_La's","Electronic_(band)","United_States","MTV","120_Minutes","Mega_City_Four","Senseless_Things","Jesus_Jones","The_Glastonbury_Festival","Sampler_(musical_instrument)","The_Word_(TV_series)","BBC_Radio_One","Dudley","PlayStation_2","Xbox","Xbox_360","Bay_City_Rollers","Saturday_Night_(Bay_City_Rollers_song)","Matt_Cheslin","Japan","Australia","Canada","Europe","Jonn_Penney","Rat_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin)","Alex_Griffin","Matt_Cheslin","Dan_Worton","Andy_King_(musician)","Sony_Records","Epic_Records","Columbia_Records","Chaos_Records","Work_Records","Chapter_22","Furtive","Sony_Records","Gig_Records","Castle_Records","Shakedown_Records","Camden_Records","UK_Singles_Chart","Modern_Rock_Tracks","Chapter_22","Kill_Your_Television","Until_You_Find_Out","Happy_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin_song)","Furtive","Sony_Records","Trust_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin_song)","Grey_Cell_Green","Kill_Your_Television","Not_Sleeping_Around","Intact_(song)","Walking_Through_Syrup","Saturday_Night_(Bay_City_Rollers_song)","Columbia_Records","Bay_City_Rollers","All_I_Ask_of_Myself_Is_That_I_Hold_Together","Furtive","All_I_Ask_of_Myself_Is_That_I_Hold_Together","Stuck_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin_song)","Hibernation_(Ned's_Atomic_Dustbin_song)","Spitfirepink"]}
