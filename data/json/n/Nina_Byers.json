A major contribution is a paper ``Theoretical\nconsiderations concerning quantized magnetic flux in superconductors,\" Phys.\nRev. Lett. 7, 46 (1961) with C. N. Yang. written with C. N. Yang that\nshowed that flux quantization in superconductors in units of hc/2e is\nexperimental evidence for the Cooper pairing of electrons described in the BCS\ntheory of superconductivity.\n\nIn addition to scientific papers she has published scholarly papers and a book\non history of 20th century physics.
