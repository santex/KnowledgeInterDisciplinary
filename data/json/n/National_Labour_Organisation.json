{"cursor":"29462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'National Labour Organisation', also known as the 'National Labour\nCommittee', was a British political group formed after the 1931 creation of the\nNational Government to co-ordinate the efforts of the supporters of the\ngovernment who had come from the Labour Party. The most prominent Labour Party\nmember involved in the Government was the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald.\nNational Labour sponsored Parliamentary candidates but did not consider itself a\nfull political party as it had no policy distinctive from that of the Government\nwhich it supported. After MacDonald's death, the group continued in existence\nuntil winding up on the eve of the 1945 general election; its newsletter ceased\npublication two years later.\n","linknr":353,"url":"National_Labour_Organisation","recorded":1375075256,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/National_Labour_Party_(UK,_1957)","/wiki/National_Labour_Party_(disambiguation)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/National_Government_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945","#1931_election","#Finance_and_organisation","#Candidates","#Creation_of_the_organisation","#Relations_with_the_Conservatives","#Policy_and_publicity","#1935_election","#Later_years","#Dissolution","#Candidacies","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1931","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-Organising_1931-2","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Conservative_Central_Office","/wiki/Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Alexander_Grant,_1st_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_2nd_Duke_of_Westminster","/wiki/Maundy_Gregory","#cite_note-Organising_1931-2","#cite_note-Committee_established-3","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","#cite_note-Not_Unionist-4","/wiki/Parliamentary_Private_Secretary","/wiki/Frank_Markham","/wiki/Herbrand_Sackville,_9th_Earl_De_La_Warr","#cite_note-Committee_established-3","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Conservative_Campaign_Headquarters","/wiki/Frank_Markham","/wiki/Kensington_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Birmingham_Erdington_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Liverpool_Everton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Derwent_Hall_Caine","#cite_note-Candidates_1931-5","/wiki/William_Jowitt,_1st_Earl_Jowitt","/wiki/Preston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Baird,_1st_Viscount_Stonehaven","#cite_note-6","/wiki/National_Liberal_Party_(UK,_1931)","#cite_note-Candidates_1931-5","#cite_note-Reorganisation-7","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","#cite_note-Usher_memorandum-8","/wiki/Clifford_Allen,_1st_Baron_Allen_of_Hurtwood","#cite_note-Reorganisation-7","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Godfrey_Elton,_1st_Baron_Elton","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Westhoughton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-Reorganisation-7","/wiki/Philip_Snowden,_1st_Viscount_Snowden","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Nottingham_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=George_Wilfrid_Holford_Knight&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wednesbury_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Wednesbury_by-election,_1932","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Metropolitan_Borough_of_Finsbury","/wiki/Municipal_Reform_Party","/wiki/London_County_Council","/wiki/Kenneth_Lindsay","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Arthur_Marwick","/wiki/Harold_Nicolson","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin","/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Council","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1935","#cite_note-News_Letter_1935-20","/wiki/Malcolm_MacDonald","/wiki/Ross_and_Cromarty_by-election,_1936","/wiki/Randolph_Churchill","#cite_note-Ross_and_Cromarty-21","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","#cite_note-Labour_victorious-22","/w/index.php?title=National_Labour_Organisation&action=edit&section=8","#cite_note-New_HQ-23","#cite_note-Conference_postponed-24","/wiki/Editorial","#cite_note-Conference_1938-25","/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain","/wiki/Munich_Agreement","#cite_note-Munich-26","/wiki/League_of_Nations","#cite_note-27","#cite_note-28","/wiki/Anthony_Eden","/wiki/Winston_Churchill","#cite_note-29","/wiki/Michael_Marcus_(politician)","/wiki/Stephen_King-Hall","#cite_note-King-Hall-30","/wiki/Kenneth_Lindsay","#cite_note-Lindsay-31","#cite_note-De_La_Warr_resigns-32","/wiki/Richard_Denman","/w/index.php?title=Nati
