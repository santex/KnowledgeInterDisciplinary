The Neckar is a major\nright tributary of the River Rhine. Rising in the Black Forest near Villingen-\nSchwenningen in the Schwenninger Moos conservation area at a height of above sea\nlevel, it passes through Rottweil, Rottenburg am Neckar, Kilchberg, TÃ¼bingen,\nWernau, NÃ¼rtingen, Plochingen, Esslingen, Stuttgart, Ludwigsburg, Marbach,\nHeilbronn and Heidelberg, before discharging into the Rhine at Mannheim, at\nabove sea level.\n\nFrom Plochingen to Stuttgart the Neckar valley is densely populated and\nindustrialised, with several well-known companies, e.g. Daimler AG (the maker of\nMercedes Benz cars) and Mahle GmbH being located there. Between Stuttgart and\nLauffen the Neckar cuts a scenic, meandering, and in many places steep-sided,\nvalley into fossiliferous Triassic limestones and Pleistocene travertine. Along\nthe Neckar's valley in the Odenwald hills many castles can be found, including\nBurg Hornberg and Burg Guttenberg in HaÃmersheim; the now-mothballed Obrigheim\nNuclear Power Plant and the active Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant are also\nlocated there. After passing Heidelberg, the Neckar discharges on average of\nwater into the Rhine, making the Neckar its 4th largest tributary, and the 10th\nlargest river in Germany.\n\nThe name Neckar was derived from Nicarus and Neccarus from Celtic Nikros,\nmeaning wild water or wild fellow. From about 1100 Black Forest timber was\nrafted downstream as far as Holland, for use in shipyards.\n\nDuring the 19th century, traditional horse-drawn boats were replaced by steam\nboats that used a long chain in the river to pull themselves upstream. After\n1899 a railway made it possible to transport timber to the port of Heilbronn,\nlimiting timber rafting to the lower part of the Neckar. Due to the construction\nof 11 locks, ships up to 1500t could travel to Heilbronn in 1935.\n\n at Mannheim.]] reflected in the Neckar]] ]] ]] ]]\n\nBy 1968 the last of 27 locks, at Deizisau, was completed, making the Neckar\nnavigable for cargo ships about 200 km upstream from Mannheim to the river\nport of Plochingen, at the confluence with the Fils, and where the Neckar bends,\ntaking a northwesterly instead of a northeasterly course. Other important ports\ninclude Stuttgart and Heilbronn.\n\nThe river's course provides a popular route for cyclists, especially during the\nsummer months. Its steep valley sides are used for vineyards, mainly for the\ncultivation of Trollinger.\n\nThe name \"Neckar\" was also given to the world's first motorboat made during the\nsummer of 1886 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach when their Standuhr\n(Grandfather Clock) petrol engine was tested on the river near Bad Cannstatt.\n","linknr":392,"url":"Neckar","recorded":1362579331,"links":76,"instances":["neckar","baden","neckar","german_river","water_transport","tübingen","river"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhine basin","Rivers of Baden-Württemberg","Rivers of Hesse","Federal waterways in Germany"],"headings":["Towns along the Neckar","Main tributaries","Bridges","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Neckar_near_Heidelberg.jpg/288px-Neckar_near_Heidelberg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Neckar_watershed_closer.gif/300px-Neckar_watershed_closer.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Germany_T%C3%BCbingen_Reflection-in-Neckar.jpg/300px-Germany_T%C3%BCbingen_Reflection-in-Neckar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Neckar-Stuttgart.jpg/300px-Neckar-Stuttgart.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/HeidelbergLock2.jpg/300px-HeidelbergLock2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/BurgHornbergBlickAufNeckar.jpg/220px-BurgHornbergBlickAufNeckar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/48f834e9974895029c7d5978e43fe447.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Rhein-Karte.png/65px-Rhein-Karte.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kilchberg","tübingen"],["lock","water_transport"],["kilchberg","tübingen"],["eberbach","baden"],["ammer","neckar"],["murr","river"],["sulm","german_river"],["elz","neckar"]],"members":["ammer","eberbach","elz","sulm","lock","kilchberg","murr"],"related":["Black_Forest","Rhine","Germany","River","Germany","States_of_Germany","Baden-Württemberg","Hesse","Rhine","Black_Forest","Villingen-Schwenningen","Rottweil","Rottenburg_am_Neckar","Kilchberg_(Tübingen)","Tübingen","Wernau","Nürtingen","Plochingen","Esslingen_am_Neckar","Stuttgart","Ludwigsburg","Marbach_am_Neckar","Heilbronn","Heidelberg","Mannheim","Daimler_AG","Mercedes-Benz","Mahle_GmbH","Fossil","Triassic","Limestones","Pleistocene","Travertine","Odenwald","Burg_Hornberg","Burg_Guttenberg","Haßmersheim","Obrigheim_Nuclear_Power_Plant","Neckarwestheim_Nuclear_Power_Plant","Celtic_languages","Timber_rafting","Shipyard","Horse-drawn_boat","Steamboat","Lumber","Lock_(water_transport)","Deizisau","Cargo_ship","Mannheim","Port","Plochingen","Fils_River","Stuttgart","Heilbronn","Cycling","Vineyard","Trollinger","Motorboat","Gottlieb_Daimler","Wilhelm_Maybach","Grandfather_Clock","Petrol_engine","Bad_Cannstatt","Villingen-Schwenningen","Rottweil","Oberndorf_am_Neckar","Sulz_am_Neckar","Horb_am_Neckar","Rottenburg_am_Neckar","Kilchberg_(Tübingen)","Tübingen","Nürtingen","Wendlingen","Wernau","Plochingen","Esslingen_am_Neckar","Stuttgart","Remseck","Ludwigsburg","Marbach_am_Neckar","Benningen_am_Neckar","Freiberg_am_Neckar","Besigheim","Lauffen_am_Neckar","Heilbronn","Neckarsulm","Bad_Wimpfen","Mosbach","Eberbach_(Baden)","Heidelberg","Mannheim","Eschach","Rottweil","Ammer_(Neckar)","Lustnau","Echaz","Kirchentellinsfurt","Lauter","Wendlingen","Fils_River","Plochingen","Körsch","Nesenbach","Stuttgart","Rems","Remseck","Murr_(river)","Marbach_am_Neckar","Enz","Besigheim","Zaber","Lauffen","Sulm_(German_river)","Neckarsulm","Kocher","Bad_Friedrichshall","Jagst","Bad_Wimpfen","Elz_(Neckar)","Mosbach","Neckar_Valley_Bridge_Weitingen","Horb_am_Neckar"]}
