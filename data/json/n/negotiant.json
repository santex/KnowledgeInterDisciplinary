They are generally\nemployed by wineries or , where their work includes: *Cooperating with\nviticulturists *Monitoring the maturity of grapes to ensure their quality and to\ndetermine the correct time for harvest *Crushing and pressing grapes *Monitoring\nthe settling of juice and the fermentation of grape material *Filtering the wine\nto remove remaining solids *Testing the quality of wine by tasting *Placing\nfiltered wine in casks or tanks for storage and maturation *Preparing plans for\nbottling wine once it has matured *Making sure that quality is maintained when\nthe wine is bottled<ref>Echikson, Tom. Noble Rot. NY: Norton, 2004</ref>\n\nToday, these duties require an increasing amount of scientific knowledge, since\nlaboratory tests are gradually supplementing or replacing traditional methods.\nWinemakers can also be referred to as oenologists as they study oenology - the\nscience of wine.\n",
