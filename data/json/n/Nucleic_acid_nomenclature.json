This is referred to as\ndirectionality.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Nucleic_acid_nomenclature","recorded":1362374248,"links":16,"instances":["molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA replication","Nucleic acids","Nucleotides"],"headings":["Expanded letter code","Triple Helix Base Pairing","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Numbered_cytidine.png/220px-Numbered_cytidine.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"]],"members":["directionality"],"related":["Cytidine","Molecular_biologist","Nucleic_acid","DNA","RNA","Base_pair","Adenine","Nucleotide","Guanine","Cytosine","Thymine","Uracil","Carbon","Ribose","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Triple_helix","DNA_replication","Nucleotide"]}
