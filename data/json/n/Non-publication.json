{"cursor":"10400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Non-publication' of opinions, or 'unpublished opinions', are those decisions of\ncourts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges\nmaking the opinion deem the case as having less precedential value.\n\nIn the system of common law, each judicial decision becomes part of the body of\nlaw used in future decisions. However, some courts reserve certain decisions,\nleaving them \"unpublished\", and thus not available for citation in future cases.\nIt has been argued that non-publication helps stem the problem of too much\nwritten material creating too little new law. Specifically, the\nnumber of federal appeals filed annually grew from 23,200 to 33,360 between 1980\nand 1985, and 55,000 federal appeals were filed in 2000.\n\n'Selective publication' is the legal process which a judge or justices of a\ncourt decide whether a decision is to be or not published in a reporter. On\nGoogle books: [http://books.google.com/books?id=U_QxAAAAIAAJ&q=%22selective+pub-\nlication%22+law&dq=%22selective+publication%22+law], [http://books.google.com/b-\nooks?id=UwQNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA123&dq=%22selective+publication%22+law], and [http://books.google.com/books?id=pDe4UE8678gC&pg=RA2-\nPA406&dq=%22selective+publication%22+law] \"Unpublished\" federal appellate\ndecisions are published in the Federal Appendix. From 2000 to 2008, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had the highest rate of non-publication\n(92%), and more than 85% of the decisions in the 3rd Circuit, 5th Circuit, 9th\nCircuit, and 11th Circuit went unpublished. 'Depublication' is the\npower of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.\nThe California Supreme Court may depublish opinions of the California Courts of\nAppeal.

argued that non-publication encourages expedient, not careful,\nconsideration as the basis for judgment, and constitutes an invitation to error,\nincompetence, corruption and tyranny.
