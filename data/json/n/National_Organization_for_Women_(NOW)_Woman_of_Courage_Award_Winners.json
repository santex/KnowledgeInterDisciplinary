{"cursor":"11466","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Since 1994, the National Organization for Women (NOW) has presented the Woman of\nCourage Award annually (in most years) at the National NOW Conference, and\nperiodically at issue-based summits organized by NOW and/or the NOW Foundation.\nHonorees are chosen for having demonstrated personal bravery in challenging\nentrenched power and in carrying out action that has the potential to benefit\nwomen in general.\n\nRecipients of this award have been plaintiffs in lawsuits that challenged sex-\nbased discrimination and pervasive sexual harassment. They have also been\nleaders who organized other women to promote better working conditions and\nopportunities in non-traditional careers, such as New York firefighter Capt.\nBrenda Berkman. An awardee may be an individual who brought attention to an\nimportant issue through her own experience, such as Christy Brzonkala. After\nbeing raped by two football players at Virginia Tech, Brzonkala sued the\nuniversity, and her case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAnother honoree was a young woman, Julia Gabriel, who took action to improve\nlabor conditions by testifying against those who force illegal servitude. In a\nhighly-publicized case, future awardee Lilly Ledbetter took her case against sex-\nbased pay discrimination by Goodyear Tire and Rubber to the Supreme Court at\ngreat personal cost. NOW also presents the Woman of Courage Award to women who\nhave accomplished special or unique feats undertaken by few others, such as\nBarbara Hillary, who reached the North Pole at the age of 75.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
