The incumbent Liberal government\nwon 13 seats, while the opposition Progressive Conservatives won a landslide\nmajority of 42 seats in the legislature. As leader of the PC party, David Alward\nbecame New Brunswick's 32nd premier.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick â acting on the advice of the Premier â\nwould have originally been able to call an election earlier or as late as 2011;\nhowever a bill in the 56th Legislature has fixed election dates to the fourth\nMonday of September every four years beginning with this election.\nWhile an election could still have been called earlier in the event of a vote of\nno confidence, this did not take place.\n","linknr":991,"url":"New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010","recorded":1375090246,"links":["/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/New_Brunswick","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Flag_of_New_Brunswick.svg/50px-Flag_of_New_Brunswick.svg.png","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_2006","/wiki/56th_New_Brunswick_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/57th_New_Brunswick_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_2014","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/File:Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick_Logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick_Logo.svg/150px-Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick_Logo.svg.png","/wiki/File:Shawn_Graham_2007.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Shawn_Graham_2007.JPG/148px-Shawn_Graham_2007.JPG","/wiki/David_Alward","/wiki/Shawn_Graham","/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick_leadership_election,_2008","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association_leadership_election,_2002","/wiki/Woodstock_(electoral_district)","/wiki/Kent_(provincial_electoral_district)","/wiki/Percentage_point","/wiki/File:JackMacDougall.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/JackMacDougall.jpg/121px-JackMacDougall.jpg","/wiki/Roger_Duguay","/wiki/Jack_MacDougall","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Green_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party_leadership_election,_2007","/wiki/Tracadie-Sheila_(electoral_district)","/wiki/Fredericton-Nashwaaksis","/wiki/File:Nb2010.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Nb2010.PNG/300px-Nb2010.PNG","/wiki/Shawn_Graham","/wiki/David_Alward","/wiki/57th_New_Brunswick_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","/wiki/New_Brunswick","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/David_Alward","/wiki/List_of_premiers_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Lieutenant-Governor_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Premier_of_New_Brunswick","#cite_note-1","#Timeline","#2006","#2007","#2008","#2009","#2010","#Results","#Results_by_region","#Results_by_place","#Target_ridings","#Opinion_polls","#Candidates","#Retiring_incumbents","#Candidates_by_riding","#Northeast","#Southeast","#Southwest","#Central","#Northwest","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada","/wiki/Green_Party_of_New_Brunswick","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Allison_Brewer","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Interim_leader","/wiki/Pat_Hanratty","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party_leadership_election,_2007","/wiki/Opinion_poll","/w/index.php?title=Corporate_Research_Associates&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_Brunswick_Liberal_Association","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bernard_Lord","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Chris_Collins_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Moncton_East","/wiki/Joan_MacAlpine-Stiles","/wiki/Wally_Stiles","/wiki/Cross_the_floor","/wiki/House_Leader","/wiki/Stuart_Jamieson","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010#endnote_Bill75","/wiki/New_Brunswick_New_Democratic_Party_leadership_election,_2007","/wiki/Roger_Duguay","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Green_Party_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Jack_Carr_(New_Brunswick_politician)","/wiki/Keith_Ashfield","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Burt_Paulin","/wiki/Percy_Mockler","/wiki/Shawn_Graham","/wiki/Proposed_sale_of_NB_Power","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=New_Brunswick_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Mike_Murphy_(New_Brunswick_politician)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Stuart_Jamieson","/wiki/Shawn_Graham","/wiki/Proposed
