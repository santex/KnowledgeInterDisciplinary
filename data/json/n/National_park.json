{"cursor":"18550","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n in West Bengal, India.]] in Tenerife, Spain.]]\n\nA 'national park' is a park, in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a\nreserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state\ndeclares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks\ndifferently, there is a common idea: the conservation of wild nature for\nposterity and as a symbol of national pride. Europarc Federation (eds.)\n2009, Living Parks, 100 Years of National Parks in Europe, Oekom Verlag,\nMunchen Furthermore, an international organization, the International\nUnion for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected\nAreas, has defined \"National Park\" as its CategoryÂ II type of protected\nareas. While ideas for this type of national park had been suggested previously,\nthe United States established the first such one, Yellowstone National Park, in\n1872. The largest national park in the world meeting the IUCN definition is the\nNortheast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974. According to\nthe IUCN, there were 6,555 national parks worldwide in 2006 that meet its\ncriteria.\n","linknr":391,"url":"National_park","recorded":1362373107,"links":100,"instances":["united_states","ethic"],"pdf":["http://www.nps.gov/hosp/historyculture/upload/chronology.web.pdf","http://www.nps.gov/hosp/historyculture/upload/chronology.web.pdf","http://constitution.org/uslaw/sal/004_statutes_at_large.pdf","http://constitution.org/uslaw/sal/004_statutes_at_large.pdf","http://constitution.org/uslaw/sal/013_statutes_at_large.pdf","http://constitution.org/uslaw/sal/013_statutes_at_large.pdf"],"categories":["National
