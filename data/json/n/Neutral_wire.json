{"cursor":"15670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAs the neutral point of an electrical supply system is often connected to earth\nground, 'ground and neutral' are closely related. Under certain conditions, a\nconductor used to connect to a system neutral is also used for grounding\n(earthing) of equipment and structures. Current carried on a grounding conductor\ncan result in objectionable or dangerous voltages appearing on equipment\nenclosures, so the installation of grounding conductors and neutral conductors\nis carefully defined in electrical regulations. Where a neutral conductor is\nused also to connect equipment enclosures to earth, care must be taken that the\nneutral conductor never rises to a high voltage with respect to local ground.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Neutral_wire","recorded":1362543067,"links":25,"instances":["electrical","electricity","united_states","electrical_power","us"],"pdf":["http://www.iee.org/Publish/WireRegs/EarthingPlasticPipes.pdf","http://www.apcmedia.com/salestools/SADE-5TNQYQ_R0_EN.pdf"],"categories":["Electrical safety","Electrical wiring","Power cables","Electric power distribution"],"headings":["Definitions","Circuitry","Earthing systems","Combining neutral with earth","Shared neutral","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ground","electrical"],["enclosure","electrical"],["national_electrical_code","us"],["ac_power_plugs_and_sockets#nema_1-15","15_a/125_v_ungrounded"],["harmonics","electrical_power"],["electrical_wiring","uk"],["electrical_wiring","united_states"],["ground","electricity"]],"members":["enclosure","ground","electrical_wiring","harmonics","national_electrical_code"],"related":["Mains_electricity","Ground_(electrical)","Electrical_conduction","Volt","Enclosure_(electrical)","Mains_electricity","Alternating_current","Electrical_wiring","Electrical_impedance","Alternating_current","National_Electrical_Code_(US)","North_American","UK","Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology","Busbar","Split_phase","Polyphase_system","Delta-wye_transformer","TN-C-S","TN-S","TT_earthing_system","TN-C","Stray_voltage","Mastitis","Electricity_distribution","Railway_electrification_system","Tram","Equipotential","Kitchen_stove","Cook_top","Kitchen_stove","Clothes_dryer","Copper_wire_and_cable","World_War_II","National_Electrical_Code","Split_phase","AC_power_plugs_and_sockets","Harmonics_(electrical_power)","Duplex_receptacle","Multiwire_branch_circuit","Appliance_classes","Electrical_bonding","Electrical_wiring","Electrical_wiring_(UK)","Electrical_wiring_(United_States)","Earthing_arrangements","Ground_(electricity)","Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology"]}
