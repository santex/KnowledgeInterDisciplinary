Important processes in the nitrogen cycle\ninclude fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification.

However, atmospheric nitrogen has\nlimited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable\nnitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular\ninterest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key\necosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human\nactivities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen\nfertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the\nglobal nitrogen cycle.\n\nA 2011 study found that nitrogen from rocks may also be a significant source of\nnitrogen, that had not previously been\nincluded.\n","linknr":429,"url":"Nitrogen_cycle","recorded":1362372960,"links":55,"instances":["habitat","geology","biology","environmental","ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.aseanenvironment.info/Abstract/41013039.pdf"],"categories":["Nitrogen|Cycle","Biogeochemical cycle","Soil biology","Nitrogen metabolism","Metabolism","Biogeography","Fishkeeping"],"headings":["Ecological function","The processes of the nitrogen cycle","Marine nitrogen cycle","Human influences on the nitrogen cycle","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/The_Nitrogen_Cycle.png/400px-The_Nitrogen_Cycle.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nitrogen_Cycle.svg/320px-Nitrogen_Cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Marine_Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg/220px-Marine_Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"],["mineralization","soil"],["mineralization","geology"],["heath","habitat"],["dead_zone","ecology"],["hypoxia","environmental"]],"members":["heath","mineralization","mutualism","hypoxia","dead_zone"],"related":["Nitrogen","Nitrogen_fixation","Ammonification","Nitrification","Denitrification","Earth's_atmosphere","Nitrogen","Ecologist","Primary_production","Decomposition","Human_impact_on_the_nitrogen_cycle","Amino_acids","Proteins","Nucleic_acids","DNA","RNA","Plants","Chlorophyll","Photosynthesis","Nitrogen_fixation","Rhizome","Ammonium","Nitrite","Nitrate","Nitrous_oxide","Nitric_oxide","Humus","Microbes","Nitrogen_fixation","Lightning","Symbiosis","Bacterium","Nitrogenase","Enzyme","Hydrogen","Ammonia","Organic_compound","Archaea","Enzyme","Legumes","Mutualism_(biology)","Carbohydrate","Symbiosis","Ammonia","Legume","Diazotroph","Haber-Bosch","Photon","Nitrate","Ion","Ammonium","Animal","Food_chain","Heterotrophic","Amino_acid","Nucleotide","Organic_matter","Ammonium","Mineralization_(soil)","Solubility","Anions","Groundwater","Methemoglobinemia","Eutrophication","Algal","Fertilizer","Nitrite","Ammonium","Nitrogen","Phytoplankton","Cyanobacteria","Mineralization_(geology)","Nitrification","Denitrification","Nitrate_reductase","Prochlorococcus","Synechococcus","Oligotrophic","Chlorophyll","HNLC","Soy","Alfalfa","Clover","Haber-Bosch_process","Earth","Earth's_atmosphere","Industrial_agriculture","Nitrous_oxide","Stratosphere","Catalyst","Ozone","Greenhouse_gas","Global_warming","Carbon_dioxide","Methane","Ammonia","Aerosol","Water","Nitric_acid","Hydrogen","Nitrate","Acid_rain","Combustion","Fossil_fuel","Atmospheric_chemistry","Troposphere","Smog","Acid_rain","Plant","Ecosystem","Fertilization","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Biodiversity","Heath_(habitat)","Onsite_sewage_facilities","Septic_drain_field","Wastewater","Aquifers","Nitrogen","Nitrates","Drinking_water_quality_in_the_United_States","Methemoglobinemia","Blue_baby_syndrome","Wastewater_treatment_systems","Eutrophication","Dead_zone_(ecology)","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Catskills","Aeration"]}
