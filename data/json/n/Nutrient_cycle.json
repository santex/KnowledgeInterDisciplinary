{"cursor":"47809","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" \n\n\nComposting\nwithin agricultural systems capitalizes upon the natural services of nutrient\nrecycling in ecosystems. Bacteria, fungi, insects, earthworms, bugs, and other\ncreatures dig and digest the compost into fertile soil. The minerals and\nnutrients in the soil is recycled back into the production of crops. \n \n\nA 'nutrient cycle' (or 'ecological recycling') is the movement and exchange of\norganic and inorganic matter back into the production of living matter. The\nprocess is regulated by food web pathways that decompose matter into mineral\nnutrients. Nutrient cycles occur within ecosystems. Ecosystems are\ninterconnected systems where matter and energy flows and is exchanged as\norganisms feed, digest, and migrate about. Minerals and nutrients accumulate in\nvaried densities and uneven configurations across the planet. Ecosystems\nrecycle locally, converting mineral nutrients into the production of biomass,\nand on a larger scale they participate in a global system of inputs and outputs\nwhere matter is exchanged and transported through a larger system of\nbiogeochemical cycles.\n\nParticulate matter is recycled by biodiversity inhabiting the detritus in soils,\nwater columns, and along particle surfaces (including 'aeolian dust').\nEcologists may refer to ecological recycling, organic recycling, biocycling,\ncycling, biogeochemical recycling, natural recycling, or just recycling in\nreference to the work of nature. Whereas the global biogeochemical cycles\ndescribe the natural movement and exchange of every kind of particulate matter\nthrough the living and non-living components of the Earth, nutrient cycling\nrefers to the biodiversity within community food web systems that loop organic\nnutrients or water supplies back into production. The difference is a matter of\nscale and compartmentalization with nutrient cycles feeding into global\nbiogeochemical cycles. Solar energy flows through ecosystems along\nunidirectional and noncyclic pathways, whereas the movement of mineral nutrients\nis cyclic. Mineral cycles include carbon cycle, sulfur cycle, nitrogen cycle,\nwater cycle, phosphorus cycle, oxygen cycle, among others that continually\nrecycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological nutrition.\nGlobal biogeochemical cycles are the sum product of localized ecological\nrecycling regulated by the action of food webs moving particulate matter from\none living generation onto the next. Earths ecosystems have recycled mineral\nnutrients sustainably for billions of years.\n","linknr":932,"url":"Nutrient_cycle","recorded":1362505718,"links":71,"instances":["food_chain","ecology","ecology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.fish.washington.edu/people/naiman/contemporary/papers/elser_urabe_1999.pdf","http://www.fish.washington.edu/people/naiman/contemporary/papers/elser_urabe_1999.pdf","http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/dspace/bitstream/10113/10766/1/IND22068646.pdf","http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/dspace/bitstream/10113/10766/1/IND22068646.pdf","http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.281.aspx.pdf","http://www.maweb.org/documents/document.281.aspx.pdf","http://www.biology.duke.edu/upe302/pdf%20files/Emily_BormannLikens1967.pdf","http://www.biology.duke.edu/upe302/pdf%20files/Emily_BormannLikens1967.pdf","http://www.thaiscience.info/Article%20for%20ThaiScience/Article/4/Ts-4%20emergy%20indices%20and%20ratios%20for%20sustainable%20material%20cycles%20and%20recycle%20options.pdf","http://www.thaiscience.info/Article%20for%20ThaiScience/Article/4/Ts-4%20emergy%20indices%20and%20ratios%20for%20sustainable%20material%20cycles%20and%20recycle%20options.pdf","http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/files.php/faculty/ruth/biophysical_limits.pdf","http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/files.php/faculty/ruth/biophysical_limits.pdf","http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~Benoit_R_Roisin/courses/engs171/Limits-to-Sustainability.pdf","http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~Benoit_R_Roisin/courses/engs171/Limits-to-Sustainability.pdf","http://eeb19.biosci.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/Proulx%20Promislow%20Phillips%20networks%20ecol%20evol.pdf","http://eeb19.biosci.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/Proulx%20Promislow%20Phillips%20networks%20ecol%20evol.pdf","http://www.math.uga.edu/~caner/08vigre/cycling_ulanowicz_83.pdf","http://www.math.uga.edu/~caner/08vigre/cycling_ulanowicz_83.pdf","http://www.geography.siu.edu/courses/429/AgroEco/AgroEcoC.pdf","http://www.geography.siu.edu/courses/429/AgroEco/AgroEcoC.pdf","http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf","http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/pdf/laland_Evolution_2006.pdf","http://www.math.wustl.edu/~berson/0206-barrot-2006.pdf","http://www.math.wustl.edu/~berson/0206-barrot-2006.pdf","http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf","http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf","http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf","http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/eltahir/www/Publications_files/1994%20Eltahir%20Bras%20precip%20recy%20Amazon%20basin%20QJRMetSoc.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/eltahir/www/Publications_files/1994%20Eltahir%20Bras%20precip%20recy%20Amazon%20basin%20QJRMetSoc.pdf","http://shell.cas.usf.edu/rohrlab/data/Rohr%20et%20al.%20Tree%202006.pdf","http://shell.cas.usf.edu/rohrlab/data/Rohr%20et%20al.%20Tree%202006.pdf","http://www.com.univ-mrs.fr/~boudouresque/Publications_FLUC_2007_2008/Gray_2002_Mar_Poll_Bull.pdf","http://www.com.univ-mrs.fr/~boudouresque/Publications_FLUC_2007_2008/Gray_2002_Mar_Poll_Bull.pdf","http://www.cbd.int/doc/emerging-issues/2010-TREE-horizon-scan-conservation.pdf","http://www.cbd.int/doc/emerging-issues/2010-TREE-horizon-scan-conservation.pdf"],"categories":["Ecology","Systems
