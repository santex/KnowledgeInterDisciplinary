{"cursor":"33336","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn chemistry, 'pH' is a measure of the activity of the (solvated) hydrogen ion.\n'p[H]', which measures the hydrogen ion concentration, is closely related to,\nand is often written as, pH. Bates, Roger G. Determination of\npH: theory and practice. Wiley, 1973. Pure water has a pH very close to 7\nat 25 Â°C. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are said to be acidic and\nsolutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic or alkaline. The pH scale is\ntraceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by\ninternational agreement. Primary pH standard values are\ndetermined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the\npotential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such\nas the silver chloride electrode. Measurement of pH for aqueous solutions can be\ndone with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or using indicators.\n\npH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture,\nforestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineering,\nchemical engineering, nutrition, water treatment & water purification, and many\nother applications.\n","linknr":514,"url":"Neutral_solution","recorded":1362543061,"links":98,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1985/pdf/5703x0531.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1985/pdf/5703x0531.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf","http://dge.stanford.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/RoyalSociety_OceanAcidification.pdf","http://dge.stanford.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/RoyalSociety_OceanAcidification.pdf","http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/pdf/c1xacid2.pdf"],"categories":["Acid-base
