The most commonly known applications of nuclear\nphysics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology, but the\nresearch has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear\nmedicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materials\nengineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\n\nThe field of particle physics evolved out of nuclear physics and is typically\ntaught in close association with nuclear physics.\n",
