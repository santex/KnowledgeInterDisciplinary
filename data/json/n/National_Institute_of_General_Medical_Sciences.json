The\nInstitute's research training programs help prepare the next generation of\nscientists.\n\nEach year, NIGMS-supported scientists make many advances in understanding\nfundamental life processes. In the course of answering basic research questions,\nthese investigators increase our knowledge about the mechanisms and pathways\ninvolved in certain diseases. Institute grantees also develop important new\ntools and techniques, some of which have medical applications. In recognition of\nthe significance of their work, a number of NIGMS grantees have received the\n[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Publications/factsheet_NIGMSNobelists.htm Nobel Prize]\nand other high scientific honors.\n\nNIGMS is organized into divisions that support\n[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/ research] and\n[http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/ research training] in a range of\nscientific fields.\n\nNIGMS was established in 1962. In fiscal year 2012, the Instituteâs budget was\n$2.429 billion. The vast majority of this money goes into local economies\nthrough grants to scientists at universities, medical schools, hospitals and\nother research institutions throughout the country.
