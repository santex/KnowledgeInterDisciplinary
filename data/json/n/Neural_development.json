{"cursor":"24112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Neural development' refers to the processes that generate, shape, and reshape\nthe nervous system, from the earliest stages of embryogenesis to the final years\nof life. The study of neural development aims to describe the cellular basis of\nbrain development and to address the underlying mechanisms. The field draws on\nboth neuroscience and developmental biology to provide insight into the cellular\nand molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop. Defects in\nneural development can lead to cognitive, motor, and intellectual disability, as\nwell as neurological disorders such as autism, Rett syndrome, and mental\nretardation.\n","linknr":551,"url":"Neural_development","recorded":1362477545,"links":37,"instances":["protein","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Embryology of nervous system","Developmental neuroscience|"],"headings":["Overview of brain development","Aspects of neural development","Neural induction","Regionalization","Patterning of the nervous system","Neurotrophic factors","Synapse formation","Synapse elimination","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Development_of_nervous_system.svg/750px-Development_of_nervous_system.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Corticogenesis_in_a_wild-type_mouse.gif/220px-Corticogenesis_in_a_wild-type_mouse.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Interneuron-radial_glial_interactions_in_the_developing_cerebral_cortex.png/220px-Interneuron-radial_glial_interactions_in_the_developing_cerebral_cortex.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Neuro_logo.png/32px-Neuro_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Gray739.png/130px-Gray739.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["noggin","protein"],["noggin","protein"],["soma","biology"]],"members":["noggin","soma"],"related":["Brain","Neuroscience","Developmental_biology","Nervous_system","Neurological_disorders","Autism","Rett_syndrome","Mental_retardation","Neurons","Glial_cells","Axons","Dendrites","Synapses","Cellular_differentiation","Neuron","Stem_cells","Cellular_migration","Axon","Dendrite","Axon_guidance","Growth_cone","Synapse","Synaptic_plasticity","Cellular_differentiation","Cellular_migration","Axon_guidance","Axon","Neural_groove","Neural_folds","Neural_tube","Basal_plate","Alar_plate","Neural_canal","Noggin_(protein)","Chordin","Pluripotent_stem_cells","Mesencephalon","Mesencephalon","Prosencephalon","Rhombencephalon","Optical_vesicle","Telencephalon","Diencephalon","Chordates","Neural_plate","Notochord","Ectoderm","Bone_morphogenetic_protein","Follistatin","Noggin_(protein)","Chordin","Sonic_Hedgehog","Floor_plate","Patched1","Smoothened","Gli","Transcription_factors","Morphogen","SMAD","Retinoic_acid","Hox_genes","Facial_nerve","Trigeminal_nerve","Cajal-Retzius_cell","Reelin","Cellular_migration","Neocortex","Mitosis","Cajal-Retzius_cells","Subplate","Pia_mater","Soma_(biology)","Nucleokinesis","Microtubules","Centrosome","Astrocyte","Neuron","Radial_glia","Ganglionic_eminence","Rostral_migratory_stream","Subventricular_zone","Olfactory_bulb","Cortical_intermediate_zone","Rita_Levi_Montalcini","Nerve_Growth_Factor","Basal_lamina","Agrin","Rapsyn","Dendritic_Filopodia","Neural_development_in_humans","Axon_guidance","Pioneer_neuron","Neural_Darwinism","Neurodevelopmental_disorder","Pre-_and_perinatal_psychology","Brain_development_timelines","Malleable_intelligence","Human_brain_development_timeline","Mouse_brain_development_timeline","Macaque_brain_development_timeline","Role_of_cell_adhesions_in_neural_development"]}
