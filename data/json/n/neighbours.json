It was first broadcast\non the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg\nWatson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories\nand portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems\ntogether. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's\n[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]], which aired on\nthe network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the\nSydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was\nimmediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the\nshow, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the\noriginals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening\nNeighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and\ncommencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running\ndrama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively\ninto the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's new\ndigital channel, Eleven.\n\nThe show's storylines concern the domestic and professional lives of the people\nwho live and work in Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria.\nThe series primarily centres around the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-\nsac, and its neighbouring areas, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar,\nhotel, cafe, news office and park. Neighbours began with three families created\nby Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that he\nwanted to show three families who are friends living in a small street. The\nRobinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing\nrivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that has\ndoubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured are real and\nthe residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their gardens. The\ninterior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill.\n\nThrough its entire run in Australia, Neighbours has been screened as a twenty-\ntwo minute episode each week night in an early-evening slot. In Australia it is\ncurrently broadcast each weeknight at 6:30&nbsp;pm on Eleven. The show is\nproduced by FremantleMedia and has been sold to over fifty countries around the\nworld, making it one of Australia's most successful media exports. Neighbours\nhas proved to be more popular in the United Kingdom and was once the highest-\nrated daytime programme in the country, outside of news bulletins.\n","title":"neighbours","headings":["History","Setting","Broadcasting","Popularity and viewership","Storylines","Characters","Theme tune","Titles","Awards and nominations","Home media","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Network_Ten","5: Seven_Network","3: Reg_Watson","3: Vermont_South,_Victoria","3: Ramsay_Street","2: High-definition_television","2: Richard_Jasek","2: Tony_Hatch","2: Jackie_Trent","2: FremantleMedia_Australia","2: List_of_Logie_Hall_of_Fame_inductees","2: Erinsborough","2: Ramsay_family","2: Forest_Hill,_Victoria","2: FremantleMedia","2: Nine_Network","2: Stefan_Dennis","2: TV_Tonight","2: Max_Ramsay","2: Kenya","2: Jackie_Woodburne","2: Jason_Donovan","2: Kylie_Minogue","2: Charlene_Robinson","2: Alan_Dale","2: Darius_Perkins","2: Helen_Daniels","2: Anne_Haddy","2: Lou_Carpenter","2: Tom_Oliver","1: PAL","1: 576i","1: 1080i","1: List_of_Neighbours_characters","1: Theme_to_Neighbours","1: Grundy_Television","1: Soap_opera","1: Melbourne","1: Sydney","1: Victoria,_Australia","1: Cul-de-sac","1: United_Kingdom","1: BBC","1: BBC1","1: Royal_Variety_Performance","1: Queen_Elizabeth_II","1: Susan_Bower","1: White_Australia_policy","1: Sunny_Lee","1: Hany_Lee","1: Poppy_Rogers","1: Digital_Spy","1: Donna_Freedman","1: Margot_Robbie","1: Ringo_Brown","1: Sam_Clark","1: Location_manager","1: Location_shooting","1: IPhone","1: Wedding_of_Prince_William_of_Wales_and_Kate_Middleton","1: Erinsborough#Erinsborough_High_School","1: Erinsborough#Lassiter's_Hotel","1: Erinsborough#Charlie's","1: Erinsborough#Harold's_Store","1: Erinsborough#West_Waratah","1: Erinsborough#Eden_Hills","1: Erinsborough#Anson's_Corner","1: Colac,_Victoria","1: Shepparton,_Victoria","1: Oakey,_Queensland","1: Queensland","1: Darling_Harbour,_New_South_Wales","1: Port_Douglas,_Queensland","1: Great_Barrier_Reef","1: Lyme_Park","1: Derek_Nimmo","1: Rick_Alessi","1: Dan_Falzon","1: Debbie_Martin","1: Marnie_Reece-Wilmore","1: Michael_Jackson","1: Susan_Kennedy","1: Karl_Kennedy","1: London_Eye","1: River_Thames","1: Adelaide","1: Brisbane","1: Ten_HD","1: One_HD","1: Censorship_in_Australia#Television","1: Australian_Commercial_Television_Code_of_Practice","1: BBC_One","1: Demand_5","1: Richard_Desmond","1: Television_New_Zealand","1: RTÉ_Television","1: RTÉ_One","1: RTÉ_Two","1: Kenya_Television_Network","1: Caribbean_Broadcasting_Corporation","1: Iceland","1: Stöð_2","1: NRK3","1: NRK1","1: TV4_Plus","1: Vietnam","1: Vietnam_Multimedia_Corporation","1: KCOP-TV","1: WWOR-TV","1: CFMT-TV","1: DR1","1: Denmark","1: Stonefish_Rebecchi","1: Serendipity_Gottlieb","1: Raelee_Hill","1: Kimberley_Davies","1: Annalise_Hartman","1: Caroline_Gillmer","1: Cheryl_Stark","1: Colette_Mann","1: Clive_James","1: Bridget_Parker","1: Eloise_Mignon","1: Teenage_pregnancy","1: Incest","1: Surrogacy","1: Multiple_sclerosis","1: Bipolar_disorder","1: Epilepsy","1: Maria_Ramsay","1: Dasha_Blahova","1: Shane_Ramsay","1: Danny_Ramsay","1: Paul_Keane","1: Daphne_Clarke","1: Lauren_Carpenter","1: Kate_Kendall","1: Kip_Gamblin","1: Kate_Ramsay","1: Ashleigh_Brewer","1: Harry_Ramsay","1: Sophie_Ramsay","1: Kaiya_Jones","1: Anne_Charleston","1: Madge_Bishop","1: Guy_Pearce","1: Reg_Grundy_Organisation","1: Harold_Bishop","1: Natalie_Imbruglia","1: Beth_Brennan","1: Scott_Michaelson","1: Delta_Goodrem","1: Nina_Tucker","1: Glenn_Wheatley","1: Hodgkin's_lymphoma","1: Bollywood","1: Red_Symons","1: Chris_Lowe","1: Molly_Meldrum","1: Warwick_Capper","1: Dave_Batista","1: Lily_Allen","1: Matt_Lucas","1: David_Walliams","1: Tim_Vine","1: André_Rieu","1: Ben_Lee","1: Spice_Girls","1: Emma_Bunton","1: Theme_tune","1: Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","1: House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Her_Majesty's_Government","1: Daniel_Boys","1: Bokeh","1: Logie_Award","1: National_Television_Awards","1: Australian_Film_Institute_Awards","1: Rose_D'Or","1: Ryan_Moloney","1: Australian_Writers'_Guild","1: Zeppelin_Games","1: ZX_Spectrum","1: Commodore_64","1: Atari_ST","1: Amiga","1: Skateboard","1: Todd_Landers","1: Kristian_Schmid","1: Kerry_Bishop","1: Linda_Hartley-Clark","1: Shock_Records","1: Television_in_Australia","1: List_of_longest-running_Australian_television_series","1: What's_on_TV"]}
