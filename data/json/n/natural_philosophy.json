      "text" : ":For the current in the 19th-century German idealism, see [[Naturphilosophie]].\n\n\n\n'Natural philosophy' or the 'philosophy of nature' (from Latin philosophia\nnaturalis) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that\nwas dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be\nthe precursor of natural sciences such as physics.\n\nNatural science historically developed out of philosophy or, more specifically,\nnatural philosophy. At older universities, long-established Chairs of Natural\nPhilosophy are nowadays occupied mainly by physics professors. Modern meanings\nof the terms science and scientists date only to the 19th century. The naturalist-\ntheologian William Whewell was the one who coined the term \"scientist\". The\nOxford English Dictionary dates the origin of the word to 1834. Before then,\nthe word \"science\" meant any kind of well-established knowledge and the label\nof scientist did not exist. Some examples of the application of the term\n\"natural philosophy\" to what we today would call \"natural science\" are Isaac\nNewton's 1687 scientific treatise, which is known as ''The Mathematical\nPrinciples of Natural Philosophy'' and Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait's\n1867 treatise called Treatise on Natural Philosophy which helped define much of\nmodern physics.\n",
