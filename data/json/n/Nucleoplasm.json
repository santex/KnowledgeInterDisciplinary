The nucleoplasm is one of the types of\nprotoplasm, and it is enveloped by the nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope. The\nnucleoplasm is a highly viscous liquid that surrounds the chromosomes and\nnucleoli. Many substances such as nucleotides (necessary for purposes such as\nthe replication of DNA) and enzymes (which direct activities that take place in\nthe nucleus) are dissolved in the nucleoplasm. The soluble, liquid portion of\nthe nucleoplasm is called the nuclear [[hyaloplasm]].\n","linknr":199,"url":"Nucleoplasm","recorded":1362675857,"links":37,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Nuclear substructures"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg/300px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cytoplasm","Cell_(biology)","Cell_nucleus","Protoplasm","Nuclear_membrane","Nuclear_envelope","Chromosome","Nucleoli","Nucleotides","Enzymes"]}
