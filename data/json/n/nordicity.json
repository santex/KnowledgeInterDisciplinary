{"cursor":"3584","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nordicity' is the degree of northernness. The concept was developed by Canadian\ngeographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin in the 1960s based on previous work done in the\nSoviet Union. Hamelin's point was that northern territories â like northern\nCanada â cannot be identified based on a single criterion, but that there was a\ncontinuum based on a number of natural and human factors.\n\nHamelin developed an index he called Valeur polaires (Polar values) or VAPO,\nwhere the North Pole had a VAPO of 1000. The nordicity index had 10 natural and\nhuman components: #latitude #summer heat #annual cold #types of ice #total\nprecipitation #natural vegetation cover #accessibility by means other than air\n#air service #population #degree of economic activity\n\nEach component was graded on the scale of 0-100 where 100 represented extreme\nnordicity, with the VAPO representing the sum of these ten components. Hamelin\nproposed that areas with a VAPO of more than 200 should be considered in \"the\nNorth\". He subdivided Canada into Extreme North, Far North, Middle North, and\nNear North based on their VAPO. Using the VAPO, most of Canada outside the\nSouthern Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland, the Prairies, the Quebec City-\nWindsor Corridor, and most of the Maritimes exhibits some degree of nordicity.\n[http://dl1.yukoncollege.yk.ca/anth220/pictures/viewer$49]. At the other end,\nthe Extreme North included the northern portion of Canada's Arctic Archipelago.\nThe rest of the archipelago and tundra zone as well as parts of the boreal\nforest were included in the Far North.\n\nThe term is used by the Canadian government that has a set system for measuring\nnordicity. This system is used for determining a number of regulations in fields\nsuch as environmental protection, infrastructure, and many others. Northern\nCanada, apropos, is normally divided into three areas. The Middle North covering\nthe northern parts of most provinces, as well as parts of the territories is\nlargely populated by those of European descent and has significant resource\nextraction if a low population. The Far North covers the northern part of the\ncontinent and the southern Arctic Archipelago. The Extreme North covers the\nnorthernmost islands and is largely uninhabitable. Other countries have their\nown systems of measuring nordicity.\n\nThe idea of nordicity and the changing conceptions of what is the north has also\nrecently become a subject for historians.\n","linknr":105,"url":"nordicity","recorded":1371235849,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/North","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Geographer","/wiki/Louis-Edmond_Hamelin","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Northern_Canada","/wiki/Latitude","/wiki/Summer","/wiki/Effect_of_sun_angle_on_climate","/wiki/Ice#Types_of_ice","/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)","/wiki/Vegetation","/wiki/Transport","/wiki/Aviation","/wiki/Population","/wiki/Economic_indicator","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Vancouver_Island","/wiki/Lower_Mainland","/wiki/Canadian_Prairies","/wiki/Quebec_City-Windsor_Corridor","/wiki/Maritimes","http://dl1.yukoncollege.yk.ca/anth220/pictures/viewer$49","/wiki/Canadian_Arctic_Archipelago","/wiki/Tundra","/wiki/Boreal_forest","/wiki/Northern_Canada","/wiki/Europe","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=edit&section=1","http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~agraham/papers/graham6.html","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0887721745","http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/92F0138MIE/92F0138MIE2000003.pdf","/wiki/Statistics_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=edit&section=2","http://lehamelin.sittel.ca","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&oldid=543613268","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Canada","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_the_Arctic","/wiki/Category:Culture_of_the_Arctic","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nordicity&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nordicity","/wiki/Nordicity","/wiki/Talk:Nordicity","#","/wiki/Nordicity","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nordicity","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nordicity","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&oldid=543613268","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nordicity&id=543613268","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nordicity","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nordicity&oldid=543613268&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nordicity&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordizit%C3%A4t","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordicit%C3%A9","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1998356#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordicity","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/92F0138MIE/92F0138MIE2000003.pdf"],"categories":["Geography
