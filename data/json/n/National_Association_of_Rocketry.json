{"cursor":"3488","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'National Association of Rocketry' (NAR) is a non-profit tax-exempt\nscientific organization dedicated to consumer safety, youth education, and the\nadvancement of technology in the hobby of sport rocketry in the United States.\nFounded in 1957, the NAR is the oldest and largest spacemodeling organization in\nthe world with over 5200 members and 125 affiliated clubs across the U.S. It was\nestablished in 1957 by Orville Carlisle and G. Harry Stine and is currently\nheaded by Ted Cochran. It supports all aspects of safe consumer sport rocket\nflying, from small model rockets with youth groups to very large high power\nrockets flown by adult hobbyists.\n\nThe NAR is a recognized national authority for safety certification of consumer\nrocket motors and user certification of high-power rocket fliers in the U.S. It\nis the author of safety codes for the hobby that are recognized and accepted by\nmanufacturers and public safety officials nationwide. The NAR plays a strong\nrole in the establishment of national rocketry safety standards for public\nsafety officials through its participation in the National Fire Protection\nAssociation.\n\nThere are four national NAR events each year:\n\n* NARAM, the NAR's Annual Meet, the national contest culminating the rocket\n  contest year, held at different locations each summer,\n* NARCON, the NAR's national Convention, with speakers and educational programs,\n  held a different locations each winter,\n* NSL, the National Sport Launch, a large fun, or \"sport,\" launch, held a\n  different locations each spring, and\n* Team America Rocketry Challenge, a national rocketry competition for students\n  in 7th through 12th grades that culminates in an National Finals contest for\n  the top 100 teams each May. TARC is co-sponsored by the Aerospace Industries\n  Association.\n\nNAR also provides mentoring, launch services, and technical support for NASA's\n[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/Student_Launch_In-\nitiative.html Student Launch Initiative] and [http://www.nasa.gov/offices/educ-\nation/programs/descriptions/University_Student_Launch_Initiative.html\nUniversity Student Launch Initiative], which culminate in a launch of\nexperimental payloads on high power rockets near Marshall Space Flight Center\nin Huntsville, AL each April.\n\nThere are also hundreds of launches every year hosted by local NAR sections\nspanning the United States. These launches are conducted in accordance with NAR\nsafety codes and FAA regulations.\n\nThe NAR provides its members with low-cost insurance for the sport of model\nrocketry, maintains a high power rocketry certification program, and publishes a\nbi-monthly magazine, called Sport Rocketry. It also tests and certifies rocket\nmotors for safety and reliability.\n\nThe NAR (along with the Tripoli Rocketry Association, the other major governing\nbody in hobby rocketry) was involved in a nine-year lawsuit against the BATFE\nregarding the status of Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant (APCP), the\nmost common propellant used in hobby rocketry, as an explosive. The NAR and TRA\nwon the lawsuit in 2009, deregulating APCP.\n","linknr":93,"url":"National_Association_of_Rocketry","recorded":1364148776,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Orville_Carlisle","/wiki/G._Harry_Stine","/wiki/NARAM","/w/index.php?title=NARCON&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=National_Sport_Launch&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Team_America_Rocketry_Challenge","/wiki/Aerospace_Industries_Association","/wiki/NASA","http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/Student_Launch_Initiative.html","http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/University_Student_Launch_Initiative.html","/wiki/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center","/wiki/FAA","/wiki/Tripoli_Rocketry_Association","/wiki/BATFE","/wiki/Ammonium_Perchlorate_Composite_Propellant","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=edit&section=1","http://www.nar.org/","http://www.tccnar.org/","/wiki/File:Shuttle.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Shuttle.svg/20px-Shuttle.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Rocket-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Rocket-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Rocket-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&oldid=507619823","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Model_rocketry","/wiki/Category:Sports_governing_bodies_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Rocketry_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Association+of+Rocketry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=National+Association+of+Rocketry","/wiki/National_Association_of_Rocketry","/wiki/Talk:National_Association_of_Rocketry","#","/wiki/National_Association_of_Rocketry","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/National_Association_of_Rocketry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/National_Association_of_Rocketry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&oldid=507619823","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=National_Association_of_Rocketry&id=507619823","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=National+Association+of+Rocketry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=National+Association+of+Rocketry&oldid=507619823&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Rocketry&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Rocketry","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&on
