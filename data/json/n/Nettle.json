They are mostly herbaceous perennial\nplants, but some are annual and a few are shrubby. Most of the species have\nstinging hairs on the stems and leaves.\n\nThe most prominent member of the genus is the stinging nettle, Urtica dioica,\nnative to Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The genus also contains a\nnumber of other species with similar properties, listed below. However, a large\nnumber of species included within this genus in the older literature are now\nrecognized as synonyms of Urtica dioica. Some of these taxa are still recognized\nas subspecies.\n\nUrtica nettles are food for the caterpillars of numerous Lepidoptera\n(butterflies and moths), such as the tortrix moth [[Syricoris lacunana]] and\nseveral Nymphalidae, such as [[Vanessa atalanta]], one of the Red Admiral\nbutterflies.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Nettle","recorded":1362482795,"links":78,"instances":["taxonomy","bird"],"pdf":["http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/93/6/305.pdf","http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/93/6/305.pdf"],"categories":["Medicinal plants","Urticaceae","Leaf vegetables"],"headings":["Vegetative characteristics","Toxicity","Species of nettle","Uses and medical properties of nettles","In folklore","Role in the environment","Safety","Similar stinging plants","Similarly named plants","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Illustration_Urtica_dioica0.jpg/220px-Illustration_Urtica_dioica0.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Urt.doi.mal.jpg/220px-Urt.doi.mal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Urtica_dioica_%281%29.jpg/220px-Urtica_dioica_%281%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Handmade_soap.jpg/220px-Handmade_soap.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Urtica_dioica_hairs.jpg/225px-Urtica_dioica_hairs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["synonym","taxonomy"],["tit","bird"]],"members":["synonym","tit"],"related":["Stinging_nettle","Plant","Angiosperms","Eudicots","Rosids","Rosales","Urticaceae","Carolus_Linnaeus","Urticaceae","Cosmopolitan_distribution","Herbaceous","Perennial_plant","Annual_plant","Shrub","Stinging_nettle","Europe","Africa","Asia","North_America","Synonym_(taxonomy)","Taxa","Caterpillar","Lepidoptera","Tortrix_moth","Nymphalidae","Annual_plant","Perennial","Herbaceous","Plant","Rhizome","Alternate_leaf","Bract","Cystolith","Formic_acid","Serotonin","Histamine","Oxalic_acid","Tartaric_acid","China","Japan","Korea","Himalaya","Mediterranean_region","Asia","Siberia","Iran","North_America","Europe","Asia","Canada","New_Zealand","Arizona","New_Mexico","Texas","Mexico","Himalaya","Pakistan","Bhutan","Mongolia","Tibet","Urtica_incisa","Australia","Northeast_China","New_Zealand","India","Myanmar","Azores","Canary_Islands","Russia","Sicily","Carl_Ludwig_Blume","Taiwan","Taiwan","North_America","Nova_Scotia","Florida","United_States","Rocky_Mountains","Histamine","Choline","Formic_acid","Silica","Arthritis","Adrenal_gland","Tisane","Bronze_Age","Milarepa","Ascetic","Meditation","Anansi","Scots_language","Hans_Christian_Andersen","The_Wild_Swans","Tit_(bird)","Urticaria","New_Zealand","Araceae","Fabaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Lamiaceae","Kop≈ôiva","Mopiko","Poison_ivy","Poison_oak","Poison_sumac","Rumex","Royal_Botanic_Garden_Edinburgh"]}
