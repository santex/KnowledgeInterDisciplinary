{"cursor":"4000","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'nucleoid' (meaning [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]-like) is an irregularly-shaped\nregion within the cell of a prokaryote that contains all or most of the genetic\nmaterial. In contrast to the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, it is not\nsurrounded by a nuclear membrane. The genome of prokaryotic organisms generally\nis a circular, double-stranded piece of DNA, of which multiple copies may exist\nat any time. The length of a genome widely varies, but generally is at least a\nfew million base pairs.\n\nA genophore is the DNA of a prokaryote. It is commonly referred to as a\nprokaryotic chromosome. The term \"chromosome\" is misleading for a genophore\nbecause the genophore lacks chromatin. Ris, H. (1961). Ultrastructure and\nmolecular organization of genetic systems. Can. J. Genet. Cytol. 3, 95-\n120. The genophore is compacted through a mechanism known as\nsupercoiling, whereas a chromosome is additionally compacted via\nchromatin. The genophore is circular in most prokaryotes, and linear in very\nfew. The circular nature of the genophore allows replication to occur without\ntelomeres. Genophores are generally of a much smaller size than\nEukaryotic chromosomes. A genophore can be as small as 580,073 base pairs\n([[Mycoplasma genitalium]]). Many eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) carry\ngenophores in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. These organelles\nare very similar to true prokaryotes.\n","linknr":225,"url":"Nucleoid","recorded":1362483837,"links":39,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriology","Cell anatomy"],"headings":["Visualization","Composition","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Celltypes.png/330px-Celltypes.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Prokaryote","Genome","Cell_nucleus","Eukaryote","Nuclear_membrane","Genome","DNA","Chromosome","Chromatin","Supercoiling","Telomeres","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Electron_micrograph","Magnification","Cytosol","Feulgen_stain","DAPI","Ethidium_bromide","Fluorescence_microscopy","RNA","Protein","Messenger_RNA","Transcription_factor","Histone","Cell_nucleus","Plasmid"]}
