It usually\nis printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. By\n2007, there were 6,580 daily newspapers in the world selling 395 million copies\na day. The worldwide recession of 2008, combined with the rapid growth of web-\nbased alternatives, caused a serious decline in advertising and circulation, as\nmany papers closed or sharply retrenched operations.\n\nGeneral-interest newspapers typically publish stories on local and national\npolitical events and personalities, crime, business, entertainment, society and\nsports. Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing\neditorials written by an editor and columns that express the personal opinions\nof writers. The newspaper is typically funded by paid subscriptions and\nadvertising.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers, including editorial\nopinions, criticism, persuasion and
