The native\nstate of a biomolecule may possess all four levels of biomolecular structure,\nwith the secondary through quaternary structure being formed from weak\ninteractions along the covalently-bonded backbone. This is in contrast to the\ndenatured state, in which these weak interactions are disrupted, leading to the\nloss of these forms of structure and retaining only the biomolecule's primary\nstructure.\n\nAn alternate usage in metallurgy refers to metals which are found chemically\nuncombined in nature.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Native_conformation","recorded":1362371341,"links":15,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["Biochemistry","Metallurgy","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","biochemistry"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["denaturation"],"related":["Biochemistry","Protein","Nucleic_acid","Biomolecular_structure","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Metallurgy","Tertiary_structure","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Neurodegenerative_disease","Prion","Amyloid","Mad_cow_disease","Kuru","Creutzfeld-Jakob_disease","Enzyme","Protein","Protein_folding","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Chemical_conformation","Secondary_structure","Circular_dichroism","Protein_NMR","Molten_globule","Primary_structure","Protein_engineering","Base_pair","Coaxial_stacking","DNA","Nucleic_acid_double_helix","Chromatin","RNA","TRNA","DNA_nanotechnology","Metals","Earth","Oxides","Sulfides","Native_copper"]}
