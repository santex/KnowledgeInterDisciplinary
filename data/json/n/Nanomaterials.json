{"cursor":"18984","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nSee [[:Category:Nanomaterials|the Nanomaterials category]] for an exhaustive\nlist of articles related to this subject. What follows is an introduction.\n\n'Nanomaterials' is a field that takes a materials science-based approach to\nnanotechnology. It studies materials with morphological features on the\nnanoscale, and especially those that have special properties stemming from their\nnanoscale dimensions. Nanoscale is usually defined as smaller than a one tenth\nof a micrometer in at least one dimension, though this term is\nsometimes used for even smaller materials.\n\nOn 18 October 2011, the European Commission adopted the following definition of\na nanomaterial: [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/nanotech/\nNanomaterials]. European Commission. Last updated 18 October 2011\n\n\n\nAn important aspect of nanotechnology is the vastly increased ratio of surface\narea to volume present in many nanoscale materials, which makes possible new\nquantum mechanical effects. One example is the âquantum size effectâ where the\nelectronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle\nsize. Nanoparticles, for example, take advantage of their dramatically increased\nsurface area to volume ratio. Their optical properties, e.g. fluorescence,\nbecome a function of the particle diameter. This effect does not come into play\nby going from macro to micro dimensions. However, it becomes pronounced when the\nnanometer size range is reached.\n\nA certain number of physical properties also alter with the change from\nmacroscopic systems. Novel mechanical properties of nanomaterials is a subject\nof nanomechanics research. When brought into a bulk material, nanoparticles can\nstrongly influence the mechanical properties of the material, like stiffness or\nelasticity. For example, traditional polymers can be reinforced by nanoparticles\nresulting in novel materials which can be used as lightweight replacements for\nmetals. Such nanotechnologically enhanced materials may enable a weight\nreduction accompanied by an increase in stability and improved functionality.\nCatalytic activities also reveal new behaviour in the interaction with\nbiomaterials.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Nanomaterials","recorded":1362375356,"links":37,"instances":["physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/37/19/37770473.pdf"],"categories":["Nanomaterials|*","Emerging technologies"],"headings":["Classification","Characterization","Uniformity","Safety","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Buckminsterfullerene_animated.gif/220px-Buckminsterfullerene_animated.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["suspension","chemistry"]],"members":["plasma","suspension"],"related":["Materials_science","Nanotechnology","Nanoscale","European_Commission","Ratio","Quantum_mechanical","Quantum","Fluorescence","Physical_properties","Nanomechanics","Polymer","Biomaterial","Allotropes_of_carbon","Graphene","Carbon_nanotube","Silicon_nanotubes","Nanomedicine","Antibiotic","Bacterium","Cancer","Melanoma","Antimicrobial","Nanotechnology","Superconductivity","Carbon","Plasma_(physics)","Density_functional_theory","Infrared","Raman_spectroscopy","Ultraviolet","Nanocrystal","Quantum_dot","Catalyst","Nanomaterial-based_catalyst","Atom","Molecular","Quantum_confinement","Semiconductor","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Superparamagnetism","Magnetic","Copper","Malleability","Ductility","Suspension_(chemistry)","Solvent","Density","Gold","Diffusion","Sintering","Melting_point","Ultramicroscope","Light","Wavelength","Interface_and_Colloid_Science","Particle_size_distribution","Light_scattering","Ultrasound","Ultrasound_attenuation_spectroscopy","Surface_charge","Zeta_potential","Flocculation","Microelectrophoresis","Electrophoretic_light_scattering","Acoustical_engineering","Colloid_vibration_current","Ceramics","Polymers","Glass-ceramic","Composite_material","Nanoparticles","Agglomeration","Force","Van_der_Waals_forces","Solvent","Porosity","Crack_propagation","Sintering","Crystallographic_defect","Oleyl_alcohol","Monodisperse","Silica","Colloidal_crystal","Polycrystalline","OECD_Chemicals_Committee","Working_Party_on_Manufactured_Nanomaterials","Sweden","Karolinska_Institute","Epithelial_cell","Iron_oxide","DNA","Zinc_oxide","Titanium_dioxide","Copper_oxide","Chemical_&_Engineering_News","Gradient_Multi-Layer_nanofilm","List_of_emerging_technologies","Nanostructures","Nanotechnology","Nanocomposite","Printed_electronics","Platinum_nanoparticles","GreenFacts","Cornell_University"]}
