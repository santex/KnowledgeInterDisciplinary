{"cursor":"9221","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'North Atlantic Tracks' (NAT) are trans-Atlantic routes that stretch from the\nnortheast of North America to western Europe across the Atlantic Ocean. They\nensure aircraft are separated over the ocean, where there is little radar\ncoverage. These heavily-traveled routes are used by aircraft traveling between\nNorth America and Europe, flying between the altitudes of 28,500 and 42,000\nfeet. Entrance and movement along these tracks is controlled by special Oceanic\nCenter air traffic controllers to maintain separation between airplanes. The\nprimary purpose of these routes is to provide a Minimum Time Route (MTR). They\nare aligned in such a way as to minimize any head winds and maximize tail winds\nimpact on the aircraft. This results in much more efficiency by reducing fuel\nburn and flight time. To make such efficiencies possible, the routes are created\ndaily to take account of the shifting of the winds aloft.\n","linknr":144,"url":"North_Atlantic_Tracks","recorded":1362539225,"links":19,"instances":["island"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Air traffic control","Navigation","Air traffic control in Europe","Air traffic control in North America"],"headings":["Route Planning","Provision of North Atlantic Track Air Traffic Control","Flying the Routes","Maximizing Traffic Capacity","Concorde","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/NAT.png/350px-NAT.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["newfoundland","island"]],"members":["newfoundland"],"related":["North_America","Europe","Atlantic_Ocean","Aircraft","North_America","Europe","Air_traffic_controller","Jetstream","Tailwind","Shanwick_Oceanic_Control","Gander_Control","Flight_information_region","Shannon_Airport","County_Clare,_Ireland","Ayrshire,_Scotland","Gander,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Newfoundland_(island)","Flight_dispatcher","Air_Traffic_Control","GPS","LNAV","TCAS","Controller_Pilot_Data_Link_Communications","SELCAL","RVSM","Strategic_Lateral_Offset_Procedure","Waypoint","FAA","Nav_Canada","National_Air_Traffic_Services","Joint_Aviation_Authorities","NOTAM","Concorde","United_States","United_Kingdom","France","Service_ceiling","British_Airways","Heathrow","Barbados","North_Atlantic_Track_Agreement"]}
