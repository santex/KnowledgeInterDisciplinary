      "text" : "\n\n\n'Nationalism' is a belief, creed or political ideology that involves a mode of\nidentification with individual persons and a nation. Two major perspectives on\nthe origins and basis of nationalism, one is the primordialist perspective that\ndescribes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and perceived evolutionary\ntendency of humans to organize into distinct groupings based on an affinity of\nbirth; the other is the modernist perspective that describes nationalism as a\nrecent phenomenon that requires the structural conditions of modern society in\norder to exist. There are various definitions for what constitutes a nation,\nhowever, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can be a\nbelief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic, cultural,\nreligious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single state should\nnecessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by\nminorities. The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development\nhas commonly been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied\nwith traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social\norder and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a\nsituation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve. This anomie results in a\nsociety or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed\nacceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a\nunified community. This development may be the result of internal structural\nissues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other\ncommunities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling\nthem. However the founding definition of any nation is a border, a language, and\na culture, elements which are essential for the common good.\n\nNational flags, national anthems, and other symbols of national identity are\ncommonly considered highly important symbols of the national community.<ref\nname=\"Gellner 2005\"></ref><ref name=\"Canovan 1996\"></ref><ref></ref>\n",
