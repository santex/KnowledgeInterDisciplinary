It\nelects one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years using the\nfirst-past-the-post voting system of voting.\n\nOnce a longtime Conservative seat, the area has been represented by Labour MPs\nsince 1987. The current MP is Katy Clark, who has held the seat since 2005.\nDespite a considerable SNP challenge, Clark was re-elected comfortably with a\nmajority of over 9,000 in 2010. During the election campaign, the seat attained\nnational prominence following the Conservative candidate Philip Lardener's\ndeclaration that homosexuality was \"not normal\", and he was subsequently\nexpelled from the party, running as an Independent instead. However he still\nappeared as the Conservative candidate on the ballot paper, it being too late\nfor the Conservatives to select another candidate.\n\nA diverse seat, it contains the affluent towns of Largs, Fairlie and West\nKilbride to the north, as well as the more working class towns of Ardrossan,\nDalry, the Garnock Valley, Kilwinning, Saltcoats and Stevenston to the south.\nThe Isle of Arran and Great Cumbrae are also within the constituency.\n","linknr":417,"url":"North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1374522664,"links":["/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&params=55.637_N_-4.915_E_region:GB_scale:100000","/wiki/County_constituency","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:NorthAyrshireArranConstituency.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/NorthAyrshireArranConstituency.svg/200px-NorthAyrshireArranConstituency.svg.png","/wiki/Electoral_registration_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Katy_Clark","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Cunninghame_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Bute_and_Northern_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/European_Parliament","/wiki/Scotland_(European_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/North_Ayrshire","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Katy_Clark","/wiki/Scottish_National_Party","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Largs","/wiki/Fairlie,_North_Ayrshire","/wiki/West_Kilbride","/wiki/Ardrossan","/wiki/Dalry,_North_Ayrshire","/wiki/Garnock_Valley","/wiki/Kilwinning","/wiki/Saltcoats","/wiki/Stevenston","/wiki/Isle_of_Arran","/wiki/Great_Cumbrae","#Boundaries","#Constituency_profile","#History","#Members_of_Parliament","#Election_results","#2010","#2010_General_Election_Campaign","#2005","#References","/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/North_Ayrshire","/wiki/Central_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Skelmorlie","/wiki/Stevenston","/wiki/Beith","/wiki/Isle_of_Arran","/wiki/Cumbrae","/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Ardrossan_Scotland.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Ardrossan_Scotland.jpg/220px-Ardrossan_Scotland.jpg","/wiki/File:Ardrossan_Scotland.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Skelmorlie","/wiki/Largs","/wiki/Fairlie,_North_Ayrshire","/wiki/West_Kilbride","/wiki/Ardrossan","/wiki/Saltcoats","/wiki/Stevenston","/wiki/Kilwinning","/wiki/Harbour","/wiki/Dalry,_Ayrshire","/wiki/Beith","/wiki/Kilbirnie","/wiki/Steel","/wiki/Textile","/wiki/Isle_of_Arran","/wiki/Cumbrae","/wiki/Nuclear_power","/wiki/Hunterston_A_nuclear_power_station","/wiki/Hunterston_B_nuclear_power_station","/wiki/Windfarm","/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/North_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Irvine,_North_Ayrshire","/wiki/Kilmarnock","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Liberal_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Aylmer_Hunter-Weston","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Bute_and_Northern_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Sir_Fitzroy_MacLean,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/James_Bond","/wiki/Cunninghame_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1987","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/w/index.php?title=North_Ayrshire_and_Arran_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/File:Katy_Clark_MP.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Katy_Clark_MP.jpeg/150px-Katy_Clark_MP.jpeg","/wiki/File:Katy_Clark_MP.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Katy_Clark","/wiki/Brian_Wilson_(Labour_politician)","/wiki/Brian_Donohoe","/wiki/Central_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-rayment-1","/wiki/William_Finnie_(MP)","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Montgomerie&action=edit&
