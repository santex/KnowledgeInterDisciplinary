It was opposed primarily by the New Party of Charilaos Trikoupis.\n\nThe Nationalist Party was formed after the previous major-power client political\nparties, the Russian Party, English Party and the French Party ceased to be\nfactors after the reign of King Otto in 1865. The first leader of the\nNationalist Party was Alexandros Koumoundouros, who was ten-times Prime Minister\nof Greece. Koumoundouros was able to draw much of the conservative stalwarts of\nthe old Russian Party with some of the other two parties to develop a coherent,\nalbeit it mostly personality-driven, party of the right. Koumoundouros was\nsucceeded as party leader and Prime Minister by Theodoros Deligiannis who\nfamously stated that he \"was against everything Trikoupis was for.\" By stoking\nthe fires of nationalism and territorial expansion, Deligiannis was able to take\nadvantage of military events and economic downturns to propel himself to power.\n\nThroughout the 1880s and 1890s, Greece developed a stable two-party system with\nthe Premiership alternating between Deligiannis and Trikoupis. Deligiannis was\nassassinated in 1905 by a gambler who was outraged at Deligiannis's proposal to\ncurtail gambling. With Deligiannis's death, the Nationalist Party began to\nsplinter. Many of the conservative leaders followed Dimitrios Gounaris' so-\ncalled \"Japanese Group,\" and later formed the People's Party.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","recorded":1375082479,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Alexandros_Koumoundouros","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies","/wiki/Conservatism","/wiki/Greek_nationalism","/wiki/Megali_Idea","/wiki/Expansionism","/wiki/Royalist","/wiki/Political_spectrum","/wiki/Centre-right","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/Politics_of_Greece","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Elections_in_Greece","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/New_Party_(1873)_(Greece)","/wiki/Charilaos_Trikoupis","/wiki/Russian_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/English_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/French_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Otto_of_Greece","/wiki/Alexandros_Koumoundouros","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Greece","/wiki/Theodoros_Deligiannis","/wiki/Dimitrios_Gounaris","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&oldid=544679162","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_established_in_1865","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_disestablished_in_1905","/wiki/Category:Conservative_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Greek-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nationalist+Party+%28Greece%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nationalist+Party+%28Greece%29","/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Talk:Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","#","/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nationalist_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&oldid=544679162","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3366549","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nationalist_Party_%28Greece%29&id=544679162","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nationalist+Party+%28Greece%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nationalist+Party+%28Greece%29&oldid=544679162&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nationalist_Party_(Greece)&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_nationaliste_(Gr%C3%A8ce)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3366549#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Greec
