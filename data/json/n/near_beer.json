      "text" : ".]]\n\n'Low-alcohol beer' (also called 'light beer', 'non-alcoholic beer', 'small\nbeer', 'small ale', or 'near-beer') is beer with low alcohol content or no\nalcohol, which aim to reproduce the taste of beer without the inebriating\neffects of standard alcoholic brews. Most low-alcohol beers are lagers, but\nthere are some low-alcohol ales.\n\nIn the United States, beverages containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume\n(ABV) were legally called non-alcoholic, according to the now-defunct Volstead\nAct. Because of its very low alcohol content, non-alcoholic beer may be legally\nsold to minors in many American states.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the following definitions apply by law (correct as of\nMay 2007):<ref>[http://www.alcoholfree.co.uk/article_info.php?articles_id=5\nWhat Is Meant By Alcohol-Free? : The Alcohol-Free Shop<!-- Bot generated title\n-->]</ref>\n\n*No alcohol or alcohol-free: not more than 0.05% ABV *Dealcoholised: over 0.05%\nbut less than 0.5% ABV *Low-alcohol: not more than 1.2% ABV\n\nIn some parts of the European Union, beer must contain no more than 0.5% ABV if\nit is labelled \"alcohol-free\".\n\nIn Australia, the term \"light beer\" refers to any beer with less than 3%\nalcohol.\n",
