He was actually born\n'Nalan Chengde' (ç´è­æå¾·), but had to change his name when the Kangxi Emperor named\nYinreng, whose birth name also had the character cheng (æ), the crown prince.\nXingde also adopted the courtesy name 'Rongruo' (å®¹è¥).\n\nBorn in Beijing in the January of 1665, Nalan Xingde came from a powerful Manchu\nfamily that not only belonged to the Plain Yellow Banner of the Eight Banners,\nbut was also related to royalty. His father Nalan Mingzhu, who became Grand\nSecretary in 1677, was second cousin to the Shunzhi Emperor, and his mother was\na daughter of Ajige, Prince Ying of the First Rank, and thus first cousin to the\nShunzhi Emperor. Xingde's genealogical origins could have been Mongolian,\nhowever, since his clan was originally a tribe of the Mongolian Yehe who\ndefeated the Manchu Nara tribe and adopted their name.\n\nHe was reportedly a bright child with a talent in writing poetry and essays.\nLike all Manchu boys, however, he was also taught riding and archery, and was\nsaid to be quite proficient in both.\n\nBy nineteen, he was already enjoying a literary reputation. However, success at\nthe national civil service examination eluded him until 1676, when he obtained\nthe Chin-shih Degree. In contrast to the more common practice of naming a chin-\nshih a bureaucrat/official, the Kangxi Emperor gave Xingde a military position\nas a junior grade officer in the Imperial Bodyguard (ä¸ç­ä¾è¡).\n\nXingde became a close associate of the emperor, perhaps due to their similar\nages, and often accompanied the emperor on royal tours of inspection. Later,\nXingde was promoted to a higher position (ä¸ç­ä¾è¡). He was sent on a tour of the\nnorthern border to assess the damage caused by the Russian border raids and\nskirmishes.\n\nHe died at the age of 31, due to an unspecified illness.\n\nWhen he was 19, he married the daughter of Lu Xingzu (ç§èç¥), who was the Viceroy\nof Guangdong. Three years into the marriage, his wife died in childbirth. He\nlater took a concubine whose family name was Yan (é¡) and eventually married a\nwoman whose family name was Guan (å®). At thirty, he took another concubine, Shen\nWan (æ²å®), who was a poet of some standing herself. He had at least three sons\nand several daughters.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Nalan_Xingde","recorded":1375082929,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Yu_Zhiding%27s_portrait_of_Nalan_Xingde_cropped.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Yu_Zhiding%27s_portrait_of_Nalan_Xingde_cropped.jpg/220px-Yu_Zhiding%27s_portrait_of_Nalan_Xingde_cropped.jpg","/wiki/Yu_Zhiding","/wiki/Beijing","/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese","/wiki/Qing_Dynasty","/wiki/Chin-shih","/wiki/Qing_Dynasty","/wiki/Ci_poetry","/w/index.php?title=Shen_Wan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mingzhu","/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters","/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters","/wiki/Wade-Giles","/wiki/China","/wiki/Chinese_poetry","/wiki/Qing_Dynasty","/wiki/Ci_poetry","/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor","/wiki/Yinreng","/wiki/Birth_name","/wiki/Crown_prince","/wiki/Courtesy_name","/wiki/Beijing","/wiki/Manchu","/wiki/Eight_Banners","/wiki/Mingzhu","/wiki/Grand_Secretary","/wiki/Second_cousin","/wiki/Shunzhi_Emperor","/wiki/Ajige","/wiki/Mongolian_people","/wiki/Yehe","/wiki/Nara_(clan)","/wiki/Essays","/wiki/Equestrianism","/wiki/Archery","/wiki/Civil_service_examination","/wiki/Chin-shih","/wiki/Bureaucrat","/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor","/wiki/Imperial_Bodyguard","/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China","/wiki/Russia","/w/index.php?title=Border_raids&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Skirmishes","/wiki/Illness","/w/index.php?title=Lu_Xingzu&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Viceroy_of_Guangdong&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Childbirth","/wiki/Concubine","/w/index.php?title=Shen_Wan&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit&section=3","http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/museums/139496.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Beijing","/wiki/China","/wiki/Beijing","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&oldid=540958730","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Manchu_politicians","/wiki/Category:Qing_Dynasty_poets","/wiki/Category:Qing_Dynasty_politicians_from_Beijing","/wiki/Category:1655_births","/wiki/Category:1685_deaths","/wiki/Category:Writers_from_Beijing","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_simplified_Chinese-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_traditional_Chinese-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nalan+Xingde&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nalan+Xingde","/wiki/Nalan_Xingde","/wiki/Talk:Nalan_Xingde","#","/wiki/Nalan_Xingde","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nalan_Xingde","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nalan_Xingde","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&oldid=540958730","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1131641","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nalan_Xingde&id=540958730","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nalan+Xingde","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nalan+Xingde&oldid=540958730&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nalan_Xingde&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Singde","//ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%82%A9%EB%9E%80%EC%84%B1%EB%8D%95","//sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%A8%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%82%D0%B5","//vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%E1%BA%A1p_Lan_T%C3%ADnh_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c","//zh-classical.wikipedia.org/wik
