{"cursor":"12116","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Term 'Nishi' or 'Nyishi' is an ancient Indigenous word. It has been derived\nfrom two words i.e âNyi' or âNyiaâ and âShiâ or âShingâ. The word ânyiâ means\nâHumanâ,descendants of Aathu/Aatoh Nyia, the son of the Aabhu/Abho Thanyi, while\nâshiâ or âshingâ means âBeingâ. Accordingly, Nyishi stands for âHuman Beingâ.\nThe tradition current amongst the people that the Nyishi name for the northern\nregion people were known as ânyemeâ and the down plain region neighbours were\ncalled ânyepakâ. This also sometime refers to strange people coming from the\nplains i.e the Non-Tribals. Hence, the Nyishi also maintained that they inhabit\nbetween the nyeme and the nyepak. In the past, they were little known by this\nracial nomenclature. They were earlier known as chungi or daflas in Ahom and\nAssam Buranji. Subsequently, the British used these words to dub the Tribe as\nâunruly hills menâ, dwelling in the âunadministered frontiersâ and ultimately\nlegitimized them to be the name for the new subjugated subjects by the imperial\npower of British India. Henceforth, colonial administrators, military officials,\nexplorers and ethnographers started designating in various names like ; Duphlas,\nDafla, Domphilas, Bangni, Ni-sing, Nisu, Western and Eastern Domphilas, Tagin\nDuphlas, Yano Daflas, so on and so forth.\n\nAs such when the history was written based on factually incorrect and distorted\ndocumentary evidence; it was ineluctably bound to give incorrect ethnographical\ninformation and misnomer nomenclature. Instead of the original name Nyishi, the\nalien name had been recorded was no exception to such kind of ethnographic\ninformation which was available in the form of published and unpublished works\nin archives and libraries in the country and abroad. On the basis of these\nethnographic records the misnomer word had appeared at SL. No.4 of Scheduled\nTribes of Arunachal Pradesh as contained in Part XVIII of the Constitution\n(Scheduled Tribe) Orders, 1950. Thus, misnomer ethnographical material\ninformation was to be reconstructed and deconstructed to establish the hard core\nfacts and acceptable objective of ethnography proper and correct the historicity\nof the Nyishi word. Lack of factually convincing and irrefutable documentary\nevidence was seriously lacking with the community especially with the State\nGovernment to fulfil the technical prerequisite as was asked by the Registrar\nGeneral of India, New Delhi. For wanting of credible and irrefutable documentary\nevidence to convince the Government of India took a several decades for the\nTribe to redeem. So, we could not make any headway or cause to establish our own\noriginal tribe identity and in turn we were forced to bear with an imposed alien\nidentity and thereby failing to restore our self-esteem and dignity of the\nNyishiness for many centuries. This has caused the community with centuries of\nderogated and pejorative epithet leading to untold suffering, hardship and\npolitical struggle. This indelible epithet has been got rid of by bringing an\namendment to the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Orders, 1950 to modify the list\nof Scheduled Tribe, an Act called the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order,\n(Amendment) Act, 2008, in Part XVIII relating to the State of Arunachal Pradesh,\nfor entry 4, the word Nyishi was substituted in place of derogatory word. It was\na red letter day in the history of the Nyishi community in which both House of\nParliament passed a voice vote on March 19, 2008 to effect the substitution of\nalien word to âNyishiâ in the Constitution of India. This technical historical\ndocuments of irrefutable and unfallacy was prepared by Prof. Tana Showren, a\nleading historian of the North East India,who teaches in the Department of\nHistory, Rajiv Gandhi University, Rono Hills, Doimukh-79112, District Papum\nPare, Arunachal Pradesh, India is credited for convincing the Registrar General\nof India to give clearance of No Objection for substitution of derogatory word\n\"Dafla\" to \"Nyishi\" word for ever in the Constitution of India. In this way we\nhave achieved our long cherished demand for substitution of correct and original\nname Nyishi in place of misnomer term.\n\nThe Nyishi/Nyshing is one of the major tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, inhabiting\nEast Kameng, Papum Pare, Lower Subansiri, Kurung Kumey, and Upper Subansiri\ndistricts of Arunachal Pradesh and some parts of Lakhimphur and Sonitpur\ndistricts of Assam. The Tribe known for its prowess and sturdy built up,\nindependence loving by nature,temperament simple but industrious and\nstraightforward, and have an enormous sense of commitment towards the community\nduring the days of the Varman [1-650 A.D.], the Salastambha [670-910 A.D.], the\nBrahmapala [990-1206 A.D.] and the Ahom rulers [1228-1826 A.D.]. Since then the\nNyishi has been playing a significant role by way of contributing towards the\nshaping of history and culture of the entire North East India in particular and\ncountry as whole, thereby earning for itself a noteworthy place in the annals of\nTribes of the whole Indian Sub-continent but with a misnomer nomenclature.\n\nTheir population of around 300,000 makes them the most populous tribe of\nArunachal Pradesh is having the common ancestor of the Aabhu Thanyi with the\nApatani,the Adi, the Tagin and the Galo of Arunachal Pradesh. Culturally these\ntribes are called Aabhu Thanyi Tribes of the State. The Nyishi language belongs\nto the Sino-Tibetan family, however, the origin is disputed. In the days of\nyore, the practice of polygyny was prevalent among the Nyishi. It signifies ones\nsocial status and economical stability and also proves handy during hard times\nlike clan wars or social huntings and other social activities. This institution,\nhowever is being challenged. They trace their descent patrilineally and are\ndivided into several clans.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Nyishi","recorded":1375084483,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Nishi_people","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Nyishi&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Patrilineality","#cite_note-1","#Economy","#Dress","#Religion","#The_hornbill_issue","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Tibet","/wiki/Brass","/wiki/Arundo","/wiki/Great_Indian_Hornbill","/wiki/Girdle","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Lunar_phase","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Great_Indian_Hornbill","/w/index.php?title=Arunachal_Wildlife_and_Nature_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wildlife_Trust_of_India","/wiki/Fiberglass","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit&section=6","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nishi_people","http://www.nezccindia.org/ArunachalPradesh/IntroductionArunachal.asp?State=Arunachal","http://www.culturalportraits.com/CPIndia/Religion/Nyubu%20Priests.htm","http://web.mid-day.com/smd/go/2003/june/56615.htm","http://www.teri.res.in/teriin/terragreen/issue12/feature.htm","http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=dap","http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=DAP","/wiki/Template:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Template_talk:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh&action=edit","/wiki/Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Adi_people","/wiki/Mishmi_people","/wiki/Hruso_people","/wiki/Apatani_people","/w/index.php?title=Asing_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bori_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Chikum_Dui_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Deori_people","/w/index.php?title=Digaro_Mishmi_tribe&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Galo_tribe","/wiki/Hill_Miri_people","/wiki/Khamba_people","/wiki/Khamti_people","/wiki/Khamyang_people","/wiki/Khowa_people","/wiki/Lisu_people","/wiki/Padam_tribe","/w/index.php?title=Palibo_peole&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tai_Phake_people","/wiki/Memba_people","/wiki/Monpa_people","/wiki/Miji_people","/wiki/Karbi_people","/wiki/Minyong_tribe","/wiki/Miju_Mishmi_tribe","/wiki/Mising_people","/wiki/Nocte_people","/wiki/Nga_people","/w/index.php?title=Ran_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sherdukpen_people","/wiki/Singpho_people","/wiki/Sulung_people","/wiki/Takpa","/wiki/Tangsa_people","/wiki/Tutsa_people","/wiki/Wancho_people","/wiki/Zekhring_people","/wiki/Chugpa_tribe","/wiki/Lishipa_tribe","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&oldid=563702310","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Category:Tribes_of_Assam","/wiki/Category:Social_groups_of_Assam","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_template_with_no_category_set","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_page_title_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nishi+people&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nishi+people","/wiki/Nishi_people","/wiki/Talk:Nishi_people","#","/wiki/Nishi_people","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nishi_people&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents"
