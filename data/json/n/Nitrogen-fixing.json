{"cursor":"18306","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nitrogen fixation' is a process by which nitrogen (N 2) in the\natmosphere is converted into ammonia (NH 3).\nAtmospheric nitrogen or molecular nitrogen (N 2) is relatively inert:\nit does not easily react with other chemicals to form new compounds. Fixation\nprocesses free up the nitrogen atoms from their diatomic form (N 2) to\nbe used in other ways.\n\nNitrogen fixation, natural and synthetic, is essential for all forms of life\nbecause nitrogen is required to biosynthesize basic building blocks of plants,\nanimals and other life forms, e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA and amino acids\nfor proteins. Therefore nitrogen fixation is essential for agriculture and the\nmanufacture of fertilizer. It is also an important process in the manufacture of\nexplosives (e.g. gunpowder, dynamite, TNT, etc.). Nitrogen fixation occurs\nnaturally in the air by means of lightning. http://www.biology.e-\nd.ac.uk/archive/jdeacon/microbes/nitrogen.htm\n\nNitrogen fixation also refers to other biological conversions of nitrogen, such\nas its conversion to nitrogen dioxide. Microorganisms that can fix nitrogen are\nprokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea, distributed throughout their respective\nkingdoms) called diazotrophs. Some higher plants, and some animals (termites),\nhave formed associations (symbioses) with diazotrophs. Biological nitrogen\nfixation was discovered by the German agronomist Hermann Hellriegel and Dutch\nmicrobiologist Martinus Beijerinck.\n\n","linknr":407,"url":"Nitrogen-fixing","recorded":1362512519,"links":44,"instances":["chemistry","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.mcdb.ucla.edu/Research/Hirsch/imagesb/HistoryDiscoveryN2fixingOrganisms.pdf"],"categories":["Nitrogen metabolism","Metabolism","Plant physiology","Soil biology"],"headings":["Biological nitrogen fixation","Industrial nitrogen fixation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Nitrogen_Cycle.svg/320px-Nitrogen_Cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/An_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG/220px-An_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/A_sectioned_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG/220px-A_sectioned_alder_root_nodule_gall.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/NitrogenReduction.png/500px-NitrogenReduction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["order","biology"],["complex","chemistry"],["molybdenum(v_chloride"],["tris(2-aminoethylamine"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","order","complex"],"related":["Nitrogen","Earth's_atmosphere","Ammonia","Biosynthesis","Nucleotides","DNA_and_RNA","Amino_acid","Protein","Gunpowder","Dynamite","Trinitrotoluene","Nitrogen_dioxide","Diazotroph","Termite","Symbiosis","Hermann_Hellriegel","Martinus_Beijerinck","Biological_nitrogen_fixation","Nitrogenase","Hydrolysis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Glutamate","Glutamine_synthetase","Leghemoglobin","Cyanobacteria","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Gram-positive","Actinorhizal_plant","Cyanobacteria","Nitrogen_cycle","Biosphere","Cyanobacteria","Nitrate","Nitrite","Ammonium","Urea","Amino_acids","Diazotroph","Archaea","Coral_reef","Legume","Fabaceae","Kudzu","Clover","Soybean","Alfalfa","Lupin","Peanut","Rooibos","Symbiosis","Root_nodule","Root","Soil","Green_manure","Inga_alley_farming","Genus","Inga","Nitrogen-fixing","Fabaceae","Actinorhizal_plant","Alder","Bayberry","Rosaceae","Genera","Order_(biology)","Cucurbitales","Fagales","Rosales","Fabales","Eurosid","Plesiomorphic","Genetics","Physiological","Last_common_ancestor","Betulaceae","Cannabaceae","Casuarinaceae","Coriariaceae","Datiscaceae","Elaeagnaceae","Myricaceae","Rhamnaceae","Rosaceae","Cyanobacteria","Mosquito_fern","Cycad","Alkali_metal","Barium_carbonate","Barium_cyanide","Ammonia","Adolph_Frank","Nikodem_Caro","Calcium_carbide","Calcium_cyanamide","Ostwald_process","Nitric_acid","Frank-Caro_process","Earth","Ecosystem","Fertilizer","Explosive","Haber_process","Dinitrogen_complex","Complex_(chemistry)","Ruthenium","Alexander_E._Shilov","Lithium_nitride","Homolysis","Molybdenum","Triple_bond","Digital_object_identifier","Nitriles","Reducing_agent","Richard_R._Schrock","Molybdenum(V)_chloride","Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine","Dimer_(chemistry)","Pyridinium","Tetraborate","Reducing_agent","Decamethylchromocene","Molybdenum","Pincer_ligand","Birkeland–Eyde_process","Denitrification","Diazotroph","George_Washington_Carver","Haber_process","Nif_gene","Nitrification","Nitrogen_cycle","Nitrogen_deficiency","Nitrogenase","Ostwald_process","Push–pull_technology","Root_nodule"]}
