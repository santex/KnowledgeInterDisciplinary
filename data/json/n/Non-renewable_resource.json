{"cursor":"14544","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in Wyoming. Coal, produced over millions of years, is an inherently finite and\n non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]] A 'non-renewable resource' is a\n natural resource which cannot be reproduced, grown, generated, or used on a\n scale which can sustain its consumption rate; once depleted there will be no\n more available for future use. Also considered non-renewable are resources that\n are consumed much faster than nature can create them. Fossil fuels (such as\n coal, petroleum, and natural gas), nuclear power (uranium) and certain aquifers\n are examples. Metal ores are prime examples of non-renewable resources. In\n contrast, resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) and wind (used\n to power energy conversion systems) are considered renewable resources.\n","linknr":330,"url":"Non-renewable_resource","recorded":1362372038,"links":47,"instances":["economics","business"],"pdf":["http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/Nuclear-Subsidies-in-APA-and-ACELA.pdf","http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/Nuclear-Subsidies-in-APA-and-ACELA.pdf","http://www.academicjournals.org/ajmr/PDF/pdf2011/16Sep/Eskander%20et%20al.pdf","http://www.academicjournals.org/ajmr/PDF/pdf2011/16Sep/Eskander%20et%20al.pdf","http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf","http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf","http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf","http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/SEFI_Investment_Report_2007.pdf","http://sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/SEFI_Investment_Report_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Resources","Natural
