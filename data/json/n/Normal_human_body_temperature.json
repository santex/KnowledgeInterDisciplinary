Despite what many\nschoolchildren are taught, there is no single number that represents a normal or\nhealthy temperature for all people under all circumstances using any place of\nmeasurement.\n\nDifferent parts of the body have different temperatures. Rectal and vaginal\nmeasurements, or measurements taken directly inside the body cavity, are\ntypically slightly higher than oral measurements, and oral measurements are\nsomewhat higher than skin temperature. The commonly accepted average core body\ntemperature (taken internally) is (). The typical oral (under the tongue)\nmeasurement is slightly cooler, at 36.8Â° Â± 0.4Â°C (98.2Â° Â± 0.7Â°F), and\ntemperatures taken in other places (such as under the arm or in the ear) produce\ndifferent typical numbers. Although some people think of\nthese numbers as representing the normal temperature, a wide range of\ntemperatures has been found in healthy people.\n\n (see at 4:30 and 19:00).]]\n\nIn healthy adults, body temperature fluctuates about () throughout the day, with\nlower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon\nand evening, as the body's needs and activities change. The\ntime of day and other circumstances also affect the body's temperature. The core\nbody temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second\nhalf of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the , is one of the primary\nmarkers for circadian rhythms. The body temperature also changes when a person\nis hungry, sleepy, or cold.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Normal_human_body_temperature","recorded":1362901024,"links":36,"instances":["element","pharmacy","test"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Humans","Medical terminology","Temperature","Physical examination","Medical signs","Physiology"],"headings":["Variations","Specific temperature concepts","Methods of measurement","Measurement devices","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Biological_clock_human.svg/444px-Biological_clock_human.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Body_Temp_Variation.png/250px-Body_Temp_Variation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG/220px-Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gold_standard","test"],["capsule","pharmacy"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","capsule","gold_standard"],"related":["Human_body","Lies_to_children","Rectal","Vagina","Circadian_rhythm","Thermoregulation","Homeostatic","Operating_temperature","Chemical_reaction","Human","Circadian_rhythm","Menstrual_cycle","Basal_body_temperature","Estrogen","Progesterone","Fertility_awareness","Pregnant","Luteal_phase","Mesor","Hormonal_contraceptive","Season","Low-grade_fever","Geriatrics","Weight-loss_diet","Alcohol","Electric_blanket","Sleep_deprivation","Insomnia","Jet_lag","Shift_work","Infectious_disease","Antipyretic","Hyperthermia","Therapeutic_hypothermia","Menstrual_cycle","Fertility_awareness","Temperature","Organism","Liver","Hyperthermia","Hypothermia","Rectum","Gold_standard_(test)","Infrared","Tympanic_membrane","Brain","Rectum","Vagina","Thermistor","Capsule_(pharmacy)","Digestive_tract","Temperature","Clinical_examination","Vagina","Temporal_artery","Temporal_artery","Alcohol","Mercury_(element)","Thermocouple","Forehead","Eardrum","Infrared","Tympanic_membrane"]}
