{"cursor":"14119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Norman Wardhaugh Walker' (January 4, 1886 â June 6, 1985) was a British\nbusinessman and pioneer in the field of vegetable juicing and nutritional\nhealth. He advocated the drinking of fresh raw vegetable and fruit juices, both\nto regain and to maintain one's health. Based on his design, the Norwalk\nHydraulic Press Juicer was developed. This juicer continues to be produced and\nsold today. Walker wrote several books on nutrition and healthy living.\n\nWalker was notable for at least three reasons: (1) He was the author of at least\nsix books published from 1937 to 1978. (2) He was the inventor of an important\nand innovative commercial juicer that is still manufactured today. (3) He was a\npioneer in the raw foods, juicing, and vegetarian movements, each of which has\ngrown in size and scope over the years.\n\nAs of 2006, most book reviews and promotional web sites wrongly claim that\nWalker reached the phenomenal age of, variously, 109, 113, 116, 118 or even 119\nyears. Several official sources The 1901 English census\nlists a Norman W. Walker as a boarder, giving his age as \"15\", his occupation as\n\"clerk\", his citizenship as English, but his place of birth as\n\"Italy\". In the Ellis Island Records a Norman W.\nWalker can be found as passenger No. 19 aboard the RMS Lusitania arriving in New\nYork Harbor from Liverpool in October 1910. He gives his age as \"25\", his\ncitizenship as \"English\", his place of birth as \"Italy\". [1] A Norman Wardhaugh Walker filed a Petition For\nNaturalization dated August 6, 1918. According to that document, he stated that:\n(1) he is living at 94 Grove Street, New York City, (2) his occupation is\naviator, (3) he was born in Genoa, Italy on 4 January 1886 as a British Subject,\n(4) he is married to Margaret Oleott, who was born on the 26th day of July, 1888\nin the U.S.A., that she \"now resides at Farmingdale, L.I.\" and that he has no\nchildren. [2] On November 22, 1918, Norman Wardhaugh Walker took an Oath of\nAlligence to the USA & was admitted to citizenship by the NY County Court that\nday under Certificate of Naturalization No. 920727. the U.S. Social\nSecurity Death Index United States Social Security Number 528-50-\n4312 belongs to a Norman Walker and states that he was born 4 January 1886 and\ndied in June 1985. The record also states that the SS# was issued in Utah, and\nthat his last residence was Cottonwood, Yavapai, Arizona.
