In English, the phrase\nfirst appeared in the 17th century in John Dryden's heroic play, [[The Conquest\nof Granada]] (1672), wherein it was used by a Christian prince disguised as a\nSpanish Muslim to refer to himself, but it later became identified with the\nidealized picture of \"nature's gentleman\", which was an aspect of 18th-century\nsentimentalism. The noble savage achieved prominence as an oxymoronic rhetorical\ndevice after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by\nEnglish novelist Charles Dickens, whom some believe may have wished to\ndisassociate himself from what he viewed as the \"feminine\" sentimentality of\n18th and early 19th-century romantic primitivism. See Grace Moore,\n\"Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'\", The Dickensian 98:458 (2002): 236-243.\nMoore speculates that Dickens, although himself an abolitionist, was motivated\nby a wish to differentiate himself from what he believed was the feminine\nsentimentality and bad writing of female philanthropists and writer such as\nHarriet Beecher Stowe, with whom he, as a reformist writer, was often\nassociated.\n\nThe idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the 3rd Earl of\nShaftesbury, a Whig supporter of constitutional monarchy. In his Inquiry\nConcerning Virtue (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the moral sense in\nhumans is natural and innate and based on feelings rather than resulting from\nthe indoctrination of a particular religion. Shaftesbury was reacting to Thomas\nHobbes's justification of an absolutist central state in his ''Leviathan'',\nChapter XIII, in which Hobbes famously holds that the state of nature is a \"war\nof all against all\" in which men's lives are \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,\nand short\". Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time or war where every\nman is enemy to every man, the same is consequent to the time wherein men live\nwithout other security than what their own strength and their own invention\nshall furnish them withal. In such condition there is no place for industry,\nbecause the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the\nearth, no navigation nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no\ncommodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as\nrequire much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time,\nno arts, no letters, no society, and, which is worst of all, continual fear and\ndanger of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and\nshort [http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html Leviathan]. Hobbes further\ncalls the American Indians an example of a contemporary people living in such a\nstate. Although writers since antiquity had described people living a pre-\ncivilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term \"State of\nNature\". Ross Harrison writes that \"Hobbes seems to have invented this\nuseful term.\" See Ross Harrison, Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece\n(Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.
