Pearson criticises\napproaches to these problems which, while claiming to be \"progressive,\" in his\nopinion merely keep Indigenous people dependent on welfare and out of the \"real\neconomy.\" He outlined this position in 2000 in his speech, [http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2000/00-08-\n12a.shtml The light on the hill].\n\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, Pearson began outlining an alternative to\ntraditional left-wing politics that he called radical centrism.
