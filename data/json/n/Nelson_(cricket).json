{"cursor":"3262","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nelson' is a piece of cricket slang terminology and superstition.\n\nThe name, applied to team or individual scores of 111 or multiples thereof\n(known as double nelson, triple nelson, etc.) is thought to refer to Lord\nNelson's lost eye, arm and leg (Nelson actually had both of his legs intact, the\nthird missing body part is mythical). Longtime cricket historian and\nscorer, Bill \"Bearders\" Frindall once referred to it online as \"one eye, one arm\nand one etcetera\", implying that Nelson's alleged third lost body part was\n\"something else\", however this is equally mythical. Umpire David Shepherd during\na radio interview to mark his retirement explained it as \"One arm, one eye and\none lump of sugar in his tea.\"\n\nIt is thought by the superstitious that bad things happen on that score,\nalthough an investigation by the magazine [[Wisden Cricketer|The Cricketer]] in\nthe 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed,\nthe score at which most wickets fall is 0 (a duck). It may be considered unlucky\nbecause the number resembles a wicket without bails http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Kolo-Toure-and-the-Top-10-\nsporting-superstitions-article28387.html (Retrieved 2010-09-04) (a batsman\nis out when the bails fall from a wicket).\n\nDavid Shepherd made popular the longstanding practice of raising a leg or legs\nfrom the ground on Nelson in an effort to avoid ill fate. When crowds\nnoticed this, they would cheer his leg-raising.\n\nThe equivalent superstitious number in Australian cricket is 87, or the \"Devil's\nNumber\", thirteen shy of 100. Statistics have shown that more\nAustralian batsmen are in fact dismissed on the surrounding numbers.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, in a match between South Africa and Australia with the time\nat 11:11 with South Africa requiring 111 runs to win, the majority of the crowd\nand umpire Ian Gould did Shepherd's leg raise Nelson for that minute with the\nscoreboard reading 11:11 11/11/11.
