It is an environment that encompasses\nthe interaction of all living species. The concept of the natural\nenvironment can be distinguished by components:\n* Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive\n  human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks,\n  atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries.\n* Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut\n  boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation,\n  electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from human activity.\n\nThe natural environment is contrasted with the built environment, which\ncomprises the areas and components that are strongly influenced by humans. A\ngeographical area is regarded as a natural environment.\n\nIt is difficult to find absolutely natural environments, and it is common that\nthe naturalness varies in a continuum, from ideally 100% natural in one extreme\nto 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different\naspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of\nnaturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, we take an agricultural\nfield, and consider the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil,\nwe will find that whereas the first is quite similar to that of an undisturbed\nforest soil, the structure is quite different.\n\nNatural environment is often used as a synonym for habitat. For instance, when\nwe say that the natural environment of giraffes is the savanna.\n","linknr":1213,"url":"Natural_environment","recorded":1362903824,"links":126,"instances":["geology","hydrology","meteorology","geography","tidal","number","geology","ecology","planet","hydrosphere","stream","geology","physiology","biology","chemistry","optical_phenomenon","biophysical","element","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Environment","Ecology","Habitat
