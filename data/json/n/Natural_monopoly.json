{"cursor":"13807","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA monopoly describes a situation where all (or most) sales in a market are\nundertaken by a single firm. A 'natural [[monopoly]]' by contrast is a condition\non the cost-technology of an industry whereby it is most efficient (involving\nthe lowest long-run average cost) for production to be concentrated in a single\nfirm. In some cases, this gives the largest supplier in an industry, often the\nfirst supplier in a market, an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual and\npotential competitors. This tends to be the case in industries where capital\ncosts predominate, creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the\nsize of the market, and hence high barriers to entry; examples include public\nutilities such as water services and electricity.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Natural_monopoly","recorded":1362506189,"links":35,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_2_3.pdf","http://www.mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_2_3.pdf"],"categories":["Market failure","Monopoly (economics)"],"headings":["Explanation","Etymology","Regulation","Notes and references","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Monopoly","Competitor","Capital_cost","Economies_of_scale","Barriers_to_entry","Public_utility","Water_services","Electricity","Investment","Barrier_to_entry","Fixed_cost","Microeconomics","Average_total_cost","Subadditivity","John_Stuart_Mill","Marginalist_revolution","Regulation","Laissez-faire_capitalism","Austrian_school","Market_forms","Currency","Standardization","Public_goods","Anti-competitive_practices","Coercive_monopoly","Quasi-rent","LoopCo"]}
