{"cursor":"50464","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Nationalism' is a belief system or political ideology that involves a strong\nidentification of a group of individuals with a nation. There are two major\nperspectives on the origins and basis of nationalism, one is the primordialist\nperspective that describes nationalism as a reflection of the ancient and\nperceived evolutionary tendency of humans to organize into distinct grouping\nbased on an affinity of birth; the other is the modernist perspective that\ndescribes nationalism as a recent phenomenon that requires the structural\nconditions of modern society, in order to exist. Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1:\nFundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic\nPress, 2001. Pp. 251. There are various definitions for what constitutes a\nnation, however, which leads to several different strands of nationalism. It can\nbe a belief that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic,\ncultural, religious, or identity group, or that multinationality in a single\nstate should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national\nidentity even by minorities.\n\nThe adoption of national identity in terms of historical development, has\ncommonly been the result of a response by an influential group or groups that is\nunsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their\ndefined social order and the experience of that social order by its members,\nresulting in a situation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve. Motyl. Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Volume 1: Fundamental\nThemes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001.\nPp. 262. This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting\nidentity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements\ndeemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified community. This development may be the result of internal\nstructural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups\ntowards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to\nbe controlling them.\n\nNational flags, national anthems, and other symbols of national identity are\ncommonly considered highly important symbols of the national community. Deep\nemotions are aroused.\n","linknr":897,"url":"Nationalism","recorded":1362480745,"links":136,"instances":["organization","politics","political","polity"],"pdf":["http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/stagingfascism.pdf","http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/resources/griffin/stagingfascism.pdf"],"categories":["Nationalism|","Political
