{"cursor":"3245","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Nonosbawsut' (died March 1819) was a leader of the Beothuk people. Family head\nof and partner of Demasduwit, born Newfoundland, Canada. Sometimes referred to\nas Chief Nonosbawsut, his stature within the last remaining Beothuk would better\nbe described as that of a headman or leader.\n\nNonosbawsut was one of a group of Beothuk who was encountered by David Buchan on\nJanuary 24, 1811 at Red Indian Lake. Buchan had left two marines at the native\ncamp while he, Nonosbawsut and three other Beothuk went to retrieve a cache of\npresents Buchan had left behind. Fearing the worst, Nonosbawsut became\nsuspicious of being captured; he and the two Beothuks fled. While back at the\ncamp they had convinced the rest of the group that the intentions of Buchan and\nhis marines were hostile. The two marines were beheaded and the camp was then\ndispersed.\n\nAnother expedition authorized by Governor Charles Hamilton to recover stolen\nproperty was led by John Peyton Jr. in March 1819. Apparently some items were\nstolen by the Beothuk from nearby fishing stations in the Bay of Exploits. The\nfate of the last remaining Beothuk was very much a concern at that time and the\nexpedition was also requested to establish friendly relations with them. On\nMarch 5 the party of Peyton's armed soldiers had surprised a small party of\nBeothuk at Red Indian Lake who attempted to escape. Peyton captured a woman,\nDemasduwit. Nonosbawsut approached the party of armed men holding the tip of a\npine branch, a symbol of peace, and through words and gestures asked Peyton to\nrelease the woman, his wife. A scuffle broke out when Peyton had refused to\nrelease her, and Nonosbawsut was shot and killed.\n\nLater, Peyton and his men were absolved of Nonosbawsut's murder by a grand jury\nin St. John's, the judge concluded that, \".. (there was) no malice on the part\nof Peyton's party to get possession of any of (the Indians) by such violence as\nwould occasion bloodshed.\"\n\nNonosbawsut's body was placed in a sepulchre, later to be joined by his infant\nson and eventually Demasduwit herself.\n\nIn 1828, the sepulchre was found by William Cormack, who at that time removed\nthe skulls and some of the grave goods. Among the items taken by Cormack was\nNonosbawsut's skull which was sent to the Royal Museum, Edinburgh, Scotland.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Nonosbawsut","recorded":1375068064,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Beothuk","/wiki/Demasduwit","/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)","/wiki/Tribal_chief","/wiki/David_Buchan","/wiki/Red_Indian_Lake","/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_(governor)","/wiki/Bay_of_Exploits","/wiki/Pine","/wiki/Sepulchre","/wiki/William_Cormack","/wiki/Royal_Museum","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_people_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit&section=2","http://www.mun.ca/rels/native/beothuk/beo2gifs/texts/shana2.html","http://www.heritage.nf.ca/aboriginal/beothuk.html","/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Canada.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/30px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Canada-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Canada-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canada-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&oldid=544099481","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1819_deaths","/wiki/Category:Aboriginal_leaders_in_Atlantic_Canada","/wiki/Category:Beothuk_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Newfoundland_(island)","/wiki/Category:Pre-Confederation_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_people","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nonosbawsut&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nonosbawsut","/wiki/Nonosbawsut","/wiki/Talk:Nonosbawsut","#","/wiki/Nonosbawsut","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nonosbawsut","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nonosbawsut","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&oldid=544099481","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2401506","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nonosbawsut&id=544099481","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nonosbawsut","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nonosbawsut&oldid=544099481&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nonosbawsut&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonosbawsut","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2401506#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafo
