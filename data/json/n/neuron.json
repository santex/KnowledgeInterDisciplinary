A chemical signal occurs\nvia a synapse, a specialized connection with other cells. Neurons connect to\neach other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the\nnervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. A\nnumber of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch,\nsound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs\nthat then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive\nsignals from the brain and spinal cord, cause muscle contractions, and affect\nglands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of\nthe brain or spinal cord.\n\nA typical neuron possesses a cell body (often called the soma), dendrites, and\nan axon. Dendrites are thin structures that arise from the cell body, often\nextending for hundreds of micrometres and branching multiple times, giving rise\nto a complex \"dendritic tree\". An axon is a special cellular extension that\narises from the cell body at a site called the axon hillock and travels for a\ndistance, as far as 1 meter in humans or even more in other species. The cell\nbody of a neuron frequently gives rise to multiple dendrites, but never to more\nthan one axon, although the axon may branch hundreds of times before it\nterminates. At the majority of synapses, signals are sent from the axon of one\nneuron to a dendrite of another. There are, however, many exceptions to these\nrules: neurons that lack dendrites, neurons that have no axon, synapses that\nconnect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite, etc.\n\nAll neurons are electrically excitable, maintaining voltage gradients across\ntheir membranes by means of metabolically driven ion pumps, which combine with\nion channels embedded in the membrane to generate intracellular-versus-\nextracellular concentration differences of ions such as sodium, potassium,\nchloride, and calcium. Changes in the cross-membrane voltage can alter the\nfunction of voltage-dependent ion channels. If the voltage changes by a large\nenough amount, an all-or-none electrochemical pulse called an action potential\nis generated, which travels rapidly along the cell's axon, and activates\nsynaptic connections with other cells when it arrives.\n\nNeurons do not undergo cell division. In most cases, neurons are generated by\nspecial types of stem cells. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, have also been\nobserved to turn into neurons by virtue of the stem cell characteristic\npluripotency. In humans, neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood—but in two\nbrain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, there is strong evidence for\ngeneration of substantial numbers of new neurons.<ref></ref><ref name=r1></ref>\n","title":"neuron","headings":["Overview","Anatomy and histology","Classes","Connectivity","Mechanisms for propagating action potentials","Neural coding","All-or-none principle","History","Neurons in the brain","Neurological disorders","Nerve regeneration","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Neurogenesis","2: Santiago_Ramón_y_Cajal","2: Purkinje_cell","2: Interneuron","2: Axon_hillock","2: Axon_terminal","2: Squid_giant_axon","2: GABA","2: Camillo_Golgi","2: Multipolar_neuron","2: Ionotropic_receptor","2: Metabotropic_receptor","2: Multiple_sclerosis","1: Granule_cells","1: Electricity","1: Synapse","1: Neural_network","1: Nervous_system","1: Brain","1: Spinal_cord","1: Ganglia","1: Sensory_neuron","1: Sense","1: Motor_neuron","1: Muscle_contraction","1: Gland","1: Dendrite","1: Axon","1: Voltage","1: Cell_membrane","1: Ion_transporter","1: Ion_channel","1: Ion","1: Sodium","1: Potassium","1: Chloride","1: Calcium","1: Voltage-dependent_ion_channel","1: Action_potential","1: Mitosis","1: Stem_cell","1: Astrocyte","1: Glial_cell","1: Pluripotency","1: Hippocampus","1: Olfactory_bulb","1: Animal","1: Eumetazoa","1: Central_nervous_system","1: Ganglion","1: Retina","1: Cochlea","1: Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential","1: Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential","1: Plasma_membrane","1: Lipid","1: Voltage-gated_ion_channel","1: Chemical_synapse","1: Electrical_synapse","1: Synaptic_transmission","1: Membrane_potential","1: Micrometre","1: Cell_nucleus","1: Protein_biosynthesis","1: Dendritic_spine","1: Nerve_signal","1: Voltage-dependent_sodium_channels","1: Neurotransmitter","1: Motoneuron","1: Dorsal_columns","1: Giraffe","1: G0_phase","1: Stem_cells","1: Subventricular_zone","1: Subgranular_zone","1: Nissl_substance","1: Franz_Nissl","1: Endoplasmic_reticulum","1: Ribosomal_RNA","1: Protein","1: Neurofilament","1: Catecholamine","1: Lipofuscin","1: Ribosomes","1: Green_fluorescent_protein","1: Motor_neurons","1: Myelin_sheath","1: Axon_terminals","1: Synaptic_cleft","1: Bipolar_neuron","1: Pseudounipolar_neuron","1: Unipolar_neuron","1: Pseudounipolar_cells","1: Bipolar_cell","1: Golgi_I","1: Golgi_II","1: Basket_cell","1: Cerebellum","1: Betz_cell","1: Medium_spiny_neuron","1: Corpus_striatum","1: Pyramidal_cell","1: Renshaw_cell","1: Alpha_motor_neuron","1: Granule_cell","1: Motoneurons","1: Spindle_cell","1: Afferent_neuron","1: Sensory_neurons","1: Efferent_neuron","1: Effector_cell","1: Glutamate","1: Acetylcholine","1: Spinal_neuron","1: Glycine","1: Photoreceptor_cell","1: Retinal_bipolar_cells","1: Glutamate_receptors","1: Parvalbumin","1: Visual_cortex","1: Somatostatin","1: Electrophysiology","1: Globus_pallidus","1: Retinal_ganglion_cells","1: Nicotinic_receptors","1: Nicotine","1: Gamma_aminobutyric_acid","1: Dopamine","1: Substantia_nigra","1: Serotonin","1: Serotonin_transporter","1: Supraoptic_nucleus","1: EPSP","1: IPSP","1: Gap_junction","1: Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","1: Calcium_in_biology","1: Synaptic_vesicles","1: Energy_metabolism","1: Human_brain","1: John_Zachary_Young","1: Ions","1: Mechanoreceptor","1: Metabolism","1: Myelin","1: Glia","1: Oligodendrocyte","1: Schwann_cell","1: Saltatory_conduction","1: Node_of_Ranvier","1: Neural_coding","1: Neural_ensemble","1: Digital_data","1: Analog_signal","1: All-or-none_law","1: Human_skin","1: Pacinian_corpuscle","1: Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz","1: Neuron_doctrine","1: Neuroscience","1: Golgi's_method","1: Neuroanatomy","1: Neuroglia","1: Nematode_worm","1: Neuropathy","1: Neurodegenerative_disease","1: Cognitive","1: Neuropsychiatric","1: Amnesia","1: Aphasia","1: Apraxia","1: Agnosia","1: Movement_disorders","1: Tremor","1: Bradykinesia","1: Akinesia","1: Motor_cortex","1: Basal_ganglia","1: Cognitive_dysfunction","1: Muscle_weakness","1: Antibodies","1: Acetylcholine_receptors","1: Immunosuppressants","1: Cholinesterase","1: Thymectomy","1: Demyelination","1: Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy","1: Axolemma","1: Cytoskeleton","1: Mitochondria","1: Ubiquitin","1: Calpain","1: Proteases","1: Vertebrate","1: Neocortex","1: Transdifferentiation","1: List_of_neuroscience_databases","1: Neuroplasticity","1: Neuroscience_Information_Framework","1: NeuroLex"]}
