{"cursor":"10000","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'negentropy', also 'negative entropy' or 'syntropy' or 'extropy' or\n'entaxy', Wiener, Norbert of a living system is the entropy that it\nexports to keep its own entropy low; it lies at the intersection of entropy and\nlife. The concept and phrase \"negative entropy\" were introduced by Erwin\nSchrÃ¶dinger in his 1944 popular-science book [[What is Life? (SchrÃ¶dinger)|What\nis Life?]] SchrÃ¶dinger, Erwin, What is Life - the Physical Aspect of the\nLiving Cell, Cambridge University Press, 1944 Later, LÃ©on Brillouin\nshortened the phrase to negentropy, Brillouin, Leon: (1953) \"Negentropy\nPrinciple of Information\", J. of Applied Physics, v. '24(9)', pp. 1152-1163\nLÃ©on Brillouin, La science et la thÃ©orie de l'information, Masson,\n1959 to express it in a more \"positive\" way: a living system imports\nnegentropy and stores it. Mae-Wan Ho, [http://www.i-sis.org.uk/negentr.php\nWhat is (SchrÃ¶dinger's) Negentropy?], Bioelectrodynamics Laboratory, Open\nuniversity Walton Hall, Milton Keynes In 1974, Albert Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi\nproposed replacing the term negentropy with syntropy. That term may have\noriginated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician Luigi FantappiÃ¨, who\ntried to construct a unified theory of biology and physics. Buckminster Fuller\ntried to popularize this usage, but negentropy remains common.\n\nIn a note to What is Life? SchrÃ¶dinger explained his use of this phrase.\n\n\nIndeed, negentropy has been used by biologists as the basis for purpose or\ndirection in life, namely cooperative or moral instincts.

From http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-\nlife/\n\nIn 2009, Mahulikar & Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-\nsystem as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to\nits surrounding chaos.

'41(4)', pp. 1939-1948 Thus, negentropy\nhas units [J/kg-K] when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and\n[K â1 ] when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This\ndefinition enabled: i) scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic\norder existence, ii) formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic\norder existence and evolution, and iii) mathematical interpretation of\nSchrÃ¶dinger's negentropy debt.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Negentropy","recorded":1362509799,"links":28,"instances":["statistical_mechanics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.ufn.ru/ufn39/ufn39_4/Russian/r394b.pdf","http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/reprint/73/6/2960.pdf","http://www.kent.ac.uk/scarr/events/Grinberg-%20(2).pdf"],"categories":["Thermodynamic entropy","Entropy and information","Statistical deviation and dispersion"],"headings":["Information theory","Correlation between statistical negentropy and Gibbs' free energy","Risk management","Notes","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/2/012e1161f299ea2e49b4c10c287a18e7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/c/3fc9ba05283d7da5ee3c6aeec2f673fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/a/8/ca87f1f1b9c7bc71548aec081beadaa4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/9/3a9ec4046ebde354c095e611be8be6b7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/a/8/ca87f1f1b9c7bc71548aec081beadaa4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/b/fbbe48c71e85251afb0ca7f5431a8100.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Wykres_Gibbsa.svg/275px-Wykres_Gibbsa.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/e/b4efe664ef4085cec999a04cfbd86b9f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/4/ff44570aca8241914870afbc310cdb85.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/1/571286850423e91db6d2802a4857bf03.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/c/21c2e59531c8710156d34a3c30ac81d5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce4b16b22b58894aa86c421e8759df3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["distribution","mathematics"],["partition_function","statistical_mechanics"]],"members":["partition_function","distribution"],"related":["Living_system","Entropy","Entropy_and_life","Erwin_Schrödinger","Léon_Brillouin","Albert_Szent-Györgyi","Luigi_Fantappiè","Biology","Physics","Buckminster_Fuller","What_is_Life?","Information_theory","Statistics","Distribution_(mathematics)","Gaussian","If_and_only_if","Differential_entropy","Mean","Variance","Statistics","Signal_processing","Information_entropy","Independent_Component_Analysis","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Volume","Dissipated_energy","Internal_energy","Entropy","Gibbs_free_energy","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Free_enthalpy","Josiah_Willard_Gibbs","Free_enthalpy","Capacity_for_entropy","François_Jacques_Dominique_Massieu","Isothermal_process","Max_Planck","Isothermal_process","Isobaric_process","Thermodynamic_potential","Statistical_mechanics","Free_entropy","Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics)","Boltzmann_constant","Risk_management","Ectropy","Exergy","Extropy","Free_entropy","Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory"]}
