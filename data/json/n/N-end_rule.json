{"cursor":"2031","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'N-end rule' is a rule related to ubiquitination, discovered by Alexander\nVarshavsky in 1986. The rule states that the ''N''-terminal amino acid of a\nprotein determines its half-life (likelihood of being degraded). The rule\napplies to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, but with different\nstrength. However, only rough estimations of protein half-life can be\ndeduced from this 'rule', as N-terminal amino acid modification can lead to\nvariability and anomalies, whilst amino acid impact can also change from\norganism to organism. Other degradation signals, known as degrons, can also be\nfound in sequence.\n","linknr":94,"url":"N-end_rule","recorded":1362484376,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Relationships","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ubiquitination","N-terminus","Degron","S._cerevisiae","Degron"]}
