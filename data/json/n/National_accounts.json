These include detailed underlying measures that rely on\ndouble-entry accounting. By construction such accounting makes the totals on\nboth sides of an account equal even though they each measure different\ncharacteristics, for example production and the income from it. As a method, the\nsubject is termed 'national accounting' or, more generally, 'social\naccounting'. Nancy D. Ruggles, 1987. \"social accounting,\"\n[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4, pp. 377â€“82.\nStated otherwise, national accounts as systems may be distinguished from the\neconomic data associated with those systems. United Nations,\n[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp The System of National\nAccounts] and [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/data.asp National\nAccounts Data]. While sharing many common principles with business\naccounting, national accounts are based on economic concepts.
