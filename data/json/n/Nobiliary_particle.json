The particle used varies depending\non the country, language and period of time. However, in some languages the\nnobiliary particle is the same as a regular prepositional particle that was used\nin the creation of many surnames. In some countries it became customary to\ndistinguish the nobiliary particle from the regular one by different spelling,\nalthough in other countries these conventions did not arise, occasionally\nresulting in ambiguity.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Nobiliary_particle","recorded":1362566891,"links":15,"instances":["french","noble_family","spanish_nobility","norwegian_family","noble_family","regent","grammar","family","voievodal_title_particle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surnames","Nobility","Noble families","Families","Lists of nobility"],"headings":["Denmark and Norway","France","Spain","Germany and Austria","England and Wales","Scotland","Switzerland","Portugal","Other countries","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gyldenpalm","noble_family"],["munthe_af_morgenstierne","noble_family"],["cappelen","family"],["von_der_lippe","norwegian_family"],["sigurd_jonsson","regent"],["elision","french"],["article","grammar"],["hidalgo","spanish_nobility"],["patrician","post-roman_europe"],["io","voievodal_title_particle"]],"members":["elision","gyldenpalm","hidalgo","von_der_lippe","patrician","munthe_af_morgenstierne","sigurd_jonsson","article","cappelen","io"],"related":["Family_name","Surname","Western_culture","Nobility","Grammatical_particle","Preposition_and_postposition","Denmark","Norway","Gyldenpalm_(noble_family)","Munthe_af_Morgenstierne_(noble_family)","Cappelen_(family)","Von_der_Lippe_(Norwegian_family)","Créquy_family","Sigurd_Jonsson_(regent)","Frederik_Wilhelm_Treschow","France","Maximilien_de_Béthune,_Duke_of_Sully","Pierre_Séguier","Lord_Chancellor_of_France","Elision_(French)","Prince_Ferdinand_Philippe,_Duke_of_Orléans","Landlord","Peasant","Squire","Knight","Sir","Bertrand_du_Guesclin","Pierre_Dupont","Patronymic","Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-Périgord","Kingdom_of_France","Valéry_Giscard_d'Estaing","Charles_Hector,_comte_d'Estaing","Maximilien_Robespierre","Spain","Toponymy","Gonzalo_Fernández_de_Córdoba","Pero_López_de_Ayala","Vasco_Núñez_de_Balboa","Conquistador","Álvaro_de_Bazán,_1st_Marquis_of_Santa_Cruz","Hernando_de_Soto","Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain","Elision","Pedro_Arias_Dávila","Baltasar_del_Alcázar","Article_(grammar)","Blazon","Coat_of_arms","Royal_Audiencia_and_Chancillería_of_Valladolid","Hidalgo_(Spanish_nobility)","Hyphen","Germany","Austria","Alexander_von_Humboldt","Gottfried_Heinrich_Graf_zu_Pappenheim","Hans-Adam_II,_Prince_of_Liechtenstein","Middle_Ages","England","Wales","Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester","Richard_of_Shrewsbury,_1st_Duke_of_York","Territorial_designation","Territorial_designation","Lord_Lyon","Lord_Lyon","Laird","Lord_Lyon","Switzerland","Cantons_of_Switzerland","Manuel_I_of_Portugal","Bourgeoisie","House_of_Braganza","Brazilian_nobility","Brazilian_Empire","Hispanic_America","Mexican_nobility","Javier_Pérez_de_Cuéllar","Giuseppe_Tomasi_di_Lampedusa","Lampedusa","Leonardo_DiCaprio","English_language","Lord","Demesne","Patrician_(post-Roman_Europe)","Carl_Linnaeus","Wallonia","Belgium","De_Geer","Laird","William_Maitland_of_Lethington","Thai_language","Pali","Monarchy_of_Thailand","Tributary_state","Siam","Royal_Institute_of_Thailand","House_of_Na_Champassak","House_of_Sundarakul_na_Jolburi","Ayutthaya_Kingdom","Chakri_Dynasty","Immemorial_nobility","Royal_and_noble_ranks","Spanish_naming_customs","Io_(voievodal_title_particle)","Territorial_designation"]}
