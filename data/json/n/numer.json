In\nmathematics, the definition of number has been extended over the years to\ninclude such numbers as 0, negative numbers, rational numbers, irrational\nnumbers, and complex numbers.\n\nMathematical operations are certain procedures that take one or more numbers as\ninput and produce a number as output. Unary operations take a single input\nnumber and produce a single output number. For example, the successor operation\nadds 1 to an integer, thus the successor of 4 is 5. Binary operations take two\ninput numbers and produce a single output number. Examples of binary operations\ninclude addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The\nstudy of numerical operations is called arithmetic.\n\nA notational symbol that represents a number is called a numeral. In addition to\ntheir use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels\n(telephone numbers), for ordering (serial numbers), and for codes (e.g., ISBNs).\n\nIn common usage, the word number can mean the abstract object, the symbol, or\nthe word for the number.\n","title":"Number","headings":["Classification of numbers","Numerals","History","See also","Notes","References","External
