It is an organic compound that owes\nits property as a base to the lone pair of electrons of a nitrogen atom. In\nbiological sciences, nitrogenous bases are typically classified as the\nderivatives of two parent compounds, pyrimidine and purine. Nelson and Cox\n2008, p. 272. They are non-polar weinersaromaticity, planar. Both\npyrimidines and purines resemble pyridine and are thus weak bases and relatively\nunreactive towards electrophilic aromatic substitution. Carey 2006, p.\n1206. Their flat shape is particularly important when considering their\nroles in nucleic acids as nucleobases (building blocks of DNA and RNA): adenine,\nguanine, thymine, cytosine, and uracil. These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond\nbetween opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the \"twisted ladder\" or double\nhelix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine\nis always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine.\nUracil is only present in RNA: replacing thymine and pairing with adenine.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Nitrogenous_base","recorded":1362508173,"links":30,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biochemistry"],"headings":["Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Cytosine_chemical_structure.png/100px-Cytosine_chemical_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Thymine_chemical_structure.png/100px-Thymine_chemical_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Uracil_chemical_structure.png/100px-Uracil_chemical_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Adenine.svg/100px-Adenine.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Guanine_chemical_structure.png/100px-Guanine_chemical_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Nitrogen","Organic_compound","Base_(chemistry)","Lone_pair","Electron","Atom","Biological_science","Pyrimidine","Purine","Non-polar","Aromaticity","Pyridine","Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution","Nucleic_acids","Nucleobase","DNA","RNA","Adenine","Guanine","Thymine","Cytosine","Uracil","Double_helix"]}
