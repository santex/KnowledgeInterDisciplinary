Though Christians hold different views than do Jews about the Old\nTestamentâthat is, the Hebrew ScripturesâChristians regard both the Old and New\nTestaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament is concerned\nessentially to proclaim Heilsgeschichte Heilsgeschichte: an interpretation\nof history emphasizing God's saving acts and viewing Jesus Christ as central in\nredemption âsalvation history, God's positive saving actions throughout\nhistory. Stagg, Frank. New Testament Theology. Broadman, 1962.\nISBN 0-8054-1613-7 The contents of the New Testament deal explicitly with\nfirst century Christianity. Therefore, the New Testament (in whole or in part)\nhas frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It\nreflects and serves as a source for Christian theology. Both extended readings\nand phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with\nreadings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New\nTestament has influenced not only religious, philosophical, and political\nmovements in Christendom, but also has left an indelible mark on its literature,\nart, and music.\n\nThe New Testament is an anthology, a collection of Christian works written in\nthe common Greek language of the first century, at different times by various\nwriters, who were early Jewish disciples of Jesus of Nazareth. In almost all\nChristian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books. The original\ntexts were written in the first and perhaps the second centuries of the\nChristian Era, generally believed to be in Koine Greek, which was the common\nlanguage of the Eastern Mediterranean from the Conquests of Alexander the Great\n(335â323 BC) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600). All of the works\nwhich would eventually be incorporated into the New Testament would seem to have\nbeen written no later than around AD 150. See the standard New Testament\nintroductions listed below under \"Further reading\": Goodspeed, KÃ¼mmel, Duling\nand Perrin, Koester, Conzelmann and Lindemann, Brown, and Ehrman.\n\nCollections of related texts such as letters of the Apostle Paul (a major\ncollection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd\ncentury) See, e.g., Clabeaux, J. J.: A Lost Edition of the Letters of Paul:\nA Reassessment of the Text of the Pauline Corpus Attested by [[Marcion]].\nCatholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series 21; Washington, D.C.: Catholic\nBiblical Association, 1989 and the Canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark,\nLuke, and John (asserted by Irenaeus of Lyon in the late-2nd century as the\nFour Gospels) gradually were joined to other collections and single works in\ndifferent combinations to form various Christian canons of Scripture. Over\ntime, some disputed books, such as the Book of Revelation and the Minor\nCatholic (General) Epistles were introduced into canons in which they were\noriginally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as 1 Clement,\nthe Shepherd of Hermas, and the Diatessaron, were excluded from the New\nTestament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major\nChristian groups including Roman Catholics, Protestants, the Greek Orthodox\nChurch, the Slavic Orthodox Churches, and the Armenian Orthodox Church.\nHowever, the twenty-seven-book canon of the New Testament, at least since Late\nAntiquity, has been almost universally recognized within Christianity (see\nDevelopment of the New Testament canon).\n\nThe New Testament consists of *four narratives of the life, teaching, and death\nof Jesus, called \"gospels\" (or \"good news\" accounts); *a narrative of the\nApostles' ministries in the early church, called the \"Acts of the Apostles\", and\nprobably written by the same writer as the Gospel of Luke, which it continues;\n*twenty-one letters, often called \"epistles\" in the biblical context, written by\nvarious authors, and consisting of Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and\nconflict resolution; and *an Apocalypse, the Book of Revelation, which is a book\nof prophecy, containing some instruction to seven local congregations, but\nmostly containing prophetical symbology, about the end times.\n","linknr":2007,"url":"New_Testament","recorded":1362484746,"links":155,"instances":["united_monarchy","christian","roman_province","christian","gnostic","63_bc","linguistics","theologian","manuscripts","christian","liturgy","protestant","biblical"],"pdf":["http://www.etsjets.org/jets/journal/42/42-4/42-4-pp645-671_JETS.pdf"],"categories":["New
