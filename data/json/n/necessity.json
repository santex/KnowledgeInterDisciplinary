Defendants seeking to rely on this defense\nargue that they should not be held liable for their actions as a crime because\ntheir conduct was necessary to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct\nis not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as self\ndefense. Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases\n<ref>See Re A (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) [2001] Fam 147</ref> there\nis no corresponding defense in English law.<ref>See R v Dudley and Stephens\n[1884] 14 QBD 273 and R v Howe [1987] 1 AC 417</ref>\n\nFor example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from\na kidnap (cf. [[North by Northwest#Plot|North by Northwest]]). Most common law\nand civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited\ncircumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce\nsome evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the\nprohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c)\nhe ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and\n(d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid. Thus, with the\n\"drunk driver\" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized\nif the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from\nthe kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.\nHowever case law suggests necessity is narrowed to medical cases.\n\nThe political necessity defense saw its demise in the case of United States v.\nSchoon.<ref></ref> In that case, thirty people, including appellants, gained\nadmittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted \"keep America's tax\ndollars out of El Salvador,\" splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls,\nand carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled\nthat the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.<ref></ref>\n","title":"necessity","headings":["General discussion","Specific jurisdictions","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Criminal_law","1: Law","1: Defendant","1: Liable","1: Crime","1: Self_defense","1: English_law","1: Kidnap","1: Common_law","1: Jurisdiction","1: Case_law","1: Internal_Revenue_Service","1: Fire_service","1: Civil_defence","1: Organization","1: Community","1: Fire_break","1: Parent","1: Child","1: Cost–benefit_analysis","1: Necessity_in_English_law","1: Necessity_in_Canadian_law","1: Necessity_in_International_law","1: Retsinformation","1: Competing_harms"]}
