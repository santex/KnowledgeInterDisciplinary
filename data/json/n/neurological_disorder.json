Structural, biochemical or electrical\n abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord or other nerves can result in a range\n of symptoms. Examples of symptoms include paralysis, muscle weakness, poor\n coordination, loss of sensation, seizures, confusion, pain and altered levels\n of consciousness.There are many recognized neurological disorders, some\n relatively common, but many rare. They may be assessed by neurological\n examination, and studied and treated within the specialities of neurology and\n clinical neuropsychology.\n\nInterventions for neurological disorders include preventative measures,\nlifestyle changes, physiotherapy or other therapy, neurorehabilitation, pain\nmanagement, medication, or operations performed by neurosurgeons. The World\nHealth Organization estimated in 2006 that neurological disorders and their\nsequelae (direct consequences) affect as many as one billion people worldwide,\nand identified health inequalities and social stigma/discrimination as major\nfactors contributing to the associated disability and suffering.<ref>[http://ww-\nw.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html WHO Neurological\nDisorders: Public Health Challenges]</ref>\n",
