Founded\non February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base\nBall Players, it is sometimes called the 'Senior Circuit'. The other league of\nMajor League Baseball is the American League, founded in 1901 (sometimes called\nthe \"Junior Circuit,\" or \"Junior Loop\" because it started 25 years after the\nNL). The two league champions of 1903 arranged to meet in the World Series and,\nafter the 1904 champions failed to do likewise, the two leagues have arranged to\nmeet in that annual culmination of the American baseball season, failing to do\nso only in the strike-shortened 1994 season. National League teams have won 46\nof the 108 World Series played between these two leagues from 1903 to 2011. The\nSan Francisco Giants are the reigning League Champions. The New York/San\nFrancisco Giants lead the league with 22 National League titles, with the St.\nLouis Cardinals leading the NL with 11 World Series championships.\n","linknr":596,"url":"National_League","recorded":1362539226,"links":37,"instances":["sport","mlb_team","nl","nl","19th_century","baseball","19th_century","nl","sports","national_league"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Major
