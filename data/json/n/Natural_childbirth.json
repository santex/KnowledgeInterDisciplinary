Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-\nmedical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in\nindustrialized societies, and is a childbirth philosophy that attempts to\nminimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications\nand surgical interventions such as episiotomies, forceps and ventouse deliveries\nand caesarean sections. A woman's definition of 'natural' may range from no\nintervention at all to birth which includes any intervention deemed appropriate.\nThe application of this philosophy may occur during a physician or midwife\nattended hospital birth, a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted\nbirth.The term \"natural childbirth\" was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read\nupon publication of his book Natural Childbirth in the 1930s, which was followed\nby the 1942 Childbirth Without Fear.\n","linknr":262,"url":"Natural_childbirth","recorded":1362373538,"links":16,"instances":["psychology","writer"],"pdf":["http://gatton.uky.edu/courseweb/99/JCR%202005-09%20Thompson.pdf"],"categories":["Childbirth","Midwifery"],"headings":["History","Psychological aspects","Alternatives to intervention","Preparation","Prevalence of medical intervention in the U.S.","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_vernon","writer"],["mindfulness","psychology"]],"members":["mindfulness","david_vernon"],"related":["Childbirth","Episiotomies","Ventouse","Caesarean_section","Hospital_birth","Grantly_Dick-Read","Michel_Odent","Frederick_Leboyer","Ina_May_Gaskin","Birthing_center","Water_birth","Homebirth","David_Vernon_(writer)","Maternal_bond","World_Health_Organization","Neonates","Pain_management","Hydrotherapy","Massage","Relaxation_technique","Hypnosis","Breath","Speech_production","Mental_image","Mindfulness_(psychology)","Water_birth","Birthing_ball","Midwife","Doula","Episiotomy","Perineum","Lamaze","Bradley_method_of_natural_childbirth","Doula","Cardiotocography","Epidural","Rupture_of_membranes","Oxytocin","Episiotomy","Childbirth_positions","Early_postnatal_hospital_discharge","Hypnotherapy_in_childbirth","Squatting_position","Childbirth_Connection"]}
