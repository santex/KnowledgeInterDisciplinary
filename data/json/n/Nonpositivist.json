{"cursor":"10387","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Antipositivism' (also known as 'interpretivism' or 'interpretive sociology') is\nthe view in social science that the social realm may not be subject to the same\nmethods of investigation as the natural world; that academics must reject\nempiricism and the scientific method in the conduct of social research.\nAntipositivists hold that researchers should focus on understanding the\ninterpretations that social actions have for the people being\nstudied.\n\nAntipositivism relates to various historical debates in the philosophy and\nsociology of science. In modern practice, however, interpretivism may be equated\nwith qualitative research methods, while positivist research is more\nquantitative. Positivists typically use research methods such as\nexperiments and statistical surveys, while antipositivists use research methods\nwhich rely more on ethnographic fieldwork, conversation/discourse analysis or\nopen-ended interviews. Positivist and antipositivist methods are sometimes\ncombined.
