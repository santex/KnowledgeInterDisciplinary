He served as First Secretary of the Communist\nParty of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and as Chairman of the Council of\nMinisters, or Premier, from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the\npartial de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the\nearly Soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas\nof domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in\n1964, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin\nas Premier.\n\nKhrushchev was born in the Russian village of Kalinovka in 1894, close to the\npresent-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was employed as a metalworker\nin his youth, and during the Russian Civil War was a political commissar. With\nthe help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He\nsupported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1939,\nStalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During\nwhat was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of\nWorld War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary\nbetween Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense\nof Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the\nwar, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's\nclose advisers.\n\nIn the power struggle triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev, after\nseveral years, emerged victorious. On February 25, 1956, at the 20th Party\nCongress, he delivered the \"Secret Speech,\" denouncing Stalin's purges and\nushering in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies,\naimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective,\nespecially in the area of agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for\nnational defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite\nthe cuts, Khrushchev's rule saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating\nin the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nSome of Khrushchev's policies were seen as erratic, particularly by his emerging\nrivals, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964. He did not\nsuffer the deadly fate of some previous losers of Soviet power struggles, but\nwas pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a [[dacha]] in the\ncountryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part\nin 1970. Khrushchev died in 1971 of heart disease.\n","linknr":2522,"url":"Nikita_Khrushchev","recorded":1362267851,"links":157,"instances":["soviet_union","moscow","politics","politician","b","soviet_union","1941","term"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nikita
