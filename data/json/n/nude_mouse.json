The phenotype, or main outward\nappearance of the mouse is a lack of body hair, which gives it the \"nude\"\nnickname. The nude mouse is valuable to research because it can receive many\ndifferent types of tissue and tumor grafts, as it mounts no rejection response.\nThese xenografts are commonly used in research to test new methods of imaging\nand treating tumors. The genetic basis of the nude mouse mutation is a\ndisruption of the FOXN1 gene.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n",
