Fashion refers to a\n distinctive and often habitual trend in the style with which a person dresses,\n as well as to prevailing styles in behaviour. Fashion also refers to the newest\n creations of textile designers.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.).\n Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news.</ref> The more technical term,\n costume, has become so linked to the term \"fashion\" that the use of the former\n has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while\n \"fashion\" means clothing more generally and the study of it. Although aspects\n of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are\n androgynous.<ref>Undressing Cinema: Clothing and identity in the movies - Page\n 196, Stella Bruzzi - 2012</ref><ref>For a discussion of the use of the terms\n \"fashion\", \"dress\", \"clothing\", and \"costume\" by professionals in various\n disciplines, see Valerie Cumming, Understanding Fashion History,\n \"Introduction\", Costume & Fashion Press, 2004, ISBN 0-89676-253-X</ref>\n","title":"fashion","headings":["Clothing fashions","Fashion industry","Media","Anthropological perspective","Intellectual property","Fashion for a cause","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links",""]},"micro-relation":["2: Fashion_accessory","2: Nuremberg","2: Venice","2: History_of_fashion_design","2: New_York_City","2: Perfume","1: Bodice","1: Clothing","1: Footwear","1: Makeup","1: Body_piercing","1: Costume_party","1: Masquerade_ball","1: Androgynous","1: Persian_Empire","1: Turkey","1: India","1: China","1: Shogun","1: Japanese_clothing","1: Ming_Dynasty","1: Han_Chinese_clothing","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Caliphate","1: Moorish_Spain","1: Ziryab","1: Sophistication","1: Baghdad","1: Córdoba,_Spain","1: Al-Andalus","1: Salim_al-Hassani","1: Turkic_peoples","1: Central_Asia","1: Far_East","1: 1300–1400_in_fashion","1: James_Laver","1: Fernand_Braudel","1: Buttocks","1: Art_history","1: Ancien_Régime","1: France","1: Early_modern_Europe","1: Bourgeoisie","1: Peasant","1: Chopine","1: Germany","1: Italy","1: Albrecht_Dürer","1: Military","1: Cravat","1: Necktie","1: Abraham_Bosse","1: Western_Europe","1: Textile","1: Charles_Frederick_Worth","1: Flapper","1: Fashion_capital","1: Paris","1: Milan","1: London","1: Fashion_week","1: Coco_Chanel","1: Ready_to_wear","1: Brand","1: Western_culture","1: Social_status","1: Society","1: Social_class","1: Generation","1: Profession","1: Geography","1: Language","1: Grammar","1: Roland_Barthes","1: Made_to_measure","1: Sewing_machine","1: Mass_production","1: Fashion_journalism","1: Fashion_blog","1: Illustrator","1: Beauty","1: United_States","1: World_War&nbsp;II","1: Color_printing","1: Haute_couture","1: Ready-to-wear","1: Fashion-television","1: FashionTV","1: User-generated_content","1: Nole_Marin","1: IPhones","1: IPads","1: The_New_Islander","1: Parka","1: FUBU","1: Baby_Phat","1: Phat_Farm","1: Anthropology","1: Nike,_Inc.","1: Indonesia","1: Intellectual_property","1: Film_industry","1: Music_industry","1: Trademark","1: Logo","1: World_Intellectual_Property_Organization","1: Healthy","1: Cancer_cure","1: Charities","1: Juvenile_Protective_Association","1: Children's_hospice","1: Trashion","1: Marina_DeBris","1: Fashion_design","1: Fashion_Net","1: History_of_Western_fashion","1: Index_of_fashion_articles","1: Fashion_design#Fashion_education","1: Red_carpet_fashion","1: Sustainable_fashion"]}
