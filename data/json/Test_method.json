Form\nand Style Manual, ASTM, http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf, 2009\n\nA test can be considered as technical operation that consists of determination\nof one or more characteristics of a given product, process or service according\nto a specified procedure. ASTM E 1301, Standard Guide for Proficiency\nTesting by Interlaboratory Comparisons Often a test is part of an\nexperiment.\n\nThe test result can be qualitative (yes/no), categorical, or quantitative (a\nmeasured value). It can be a personal observation or the output of a precision\nmeasuring instrument.\n\nUsually the test result is the dependent variable, the measured response based\non the particular conditions of the test or the level of the independent\nvariable. Some tests, however, may involve changing the independent variable to\ndetermine the level at which a certain response occurs: in this case, the test\nresult is the independent variable.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Test_method","recorded":1362540190,"links":17,"instances":["technical_standard","statistics","assessment","engineering","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/Blue_Book.pdf"],"categories":["Data collection","Metrology","Measurement","Quality control","Evaluation methods","Tests"],"headings":["Importance of test methods","Content of a test method","Test Method Validation","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["performance_test","assessment"],["sampling","statistics"],["tolerance","engineering"],["replication","statistics"],["sampling","statistics"],["specification","technical_standard"]],"members":["specification","replication","performance_test","tolerance","sampling"],"related":["ASTM","Experiment","Qualitative_data","Categorical","Quantitative_data","Observation","Measuring_instrument","Dependent_variable","Independent_variable","Software_development","Engineering","Science","Manufacturing","Business","Measurement","Physical_property","Experiments","Specification","Contract","Technical_standard","Standards_organization","Performance_test_(assessment)","Correlation","Quality_function_deployment","Verification_and_validation","Quality_management_system","Definition","Safety","Calibration","Metrology","Natural_environment","Sampling_(statistics)","Sample_size","Environmental_chamber","Temperature","Humidity","Tolerance_(engineering)","Test_fixture","Accuracy_and_precision","Repeatability","Reproducibility","ANOVA_Gauge_R&R","Image_resolution","Curve_fitting","Interpolation","Measurement_uncertainty","Round_robin_test","Measurement_systems_analysis","Certified_reference_materials","Data_analysis","Design_of_experiments","Document_management_system","EPA_Methods","Integrated_test_facility","Measurement_Systems_Analysis","Measurement_uncertainty","Metrication","Observational_error","Replication_(statistics)","Sampling_(statistics)","Specification_(technical_standard)","Test_Management_Approach","Verification_and_validation"]}
