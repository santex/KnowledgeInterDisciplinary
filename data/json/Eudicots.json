The botanical terms were introduced in 1991 by\nevolutionary botanist James A. Doyle and paleobotanist Carol L. Hotton to\nemphasize the later evolutionary divergence of tricolpate dicots from earlier,\nless specialized, dicots. The close relationships\namong flowering plants with tricolpate pollen grains was initially seen in\nmorphological studies of shared derived characters. These plants have a\ndistinct trait in their pollen grains of exhibiting three colpi or grooves\nparalleling the polar axis. Later molecular evidence confirmed the genetic\nbasis for the evolutionary relationships among flowering plants with tricolpate\npollen grains and dicotyledonous traits. The term means \"true dicotyledons\" as\nit contains the majority of plants that have been considered dicots and have\ncharacteristics of the dicots. The term \"eudicots\" has subsequently been widely\nadopted in botany to refer to one of the two largest clades of angiosperms\n(constituting over 70% of angiosperm species), monocots being the other. The\nremaining angiosperms are sometimes referred to as basal angiosperms or\npaleodicots but these terms have not been widely or consistently adopted as\nthey do not refer to a monophyletic group.\n\nThe other name for the eudicots is '[[tricolpate]]s', a name which refers to the\ngrooved structure of the pollen. Members of the group have tricolpate pollen, or\nforms derived from it. These pollen have three or more pores set in furrows\ncalled colpi. In contrast, most of the other seed plants (that is the\ngymnosperms, the monocots and the paleodicots) produce monosulcate pollen, with\na single pore set in a differently oriented groove called the sulcus. The name\n\"tricolpates\" is preferred by some botanists in order to avoid confusion with\nthe dicots, a non-monophyletic group (Judd & Olmstead 2004).\n\nNumerous familiar plants are eudicots, including many common food plants, trees,\nand ornamentals. Some common and familiar eudicots include members of the\nsunflower family such as the common dandelion, the forget-me-not, cabbage and\nother members of the its family, apple, buttercup, maple and macadamia. Most\nleafy trees of mid-latitudes also belong to eudicots, with notable exceptions\nbeing magnolias and tulip trees which belong to magnoliids, and [[Ginkgo\nbiloba]] which is not an angiosperm.\n\nThe name \"eudicots\" (plural) is used in the APG system, of 1998, and APG II\nsystem, of 2003, for classification of angiosperms. It is applied to a clade, a\nmonophyletic group, which includes most of the (former) dicots.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Eudicots","recorded":1362666024,"links":51,"instances":["taxonomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant taxonomy","Eudicots|"],"headings":["Subdivisions","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Primula_aka.jpg/220px-Primula_aka.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Arabis_voch1-4.jpg/220px-Arabis_voch1-4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["segregate","taxonomy"]],"members":["segregate"],"related":["Early_Cretaceous","Ranunculales","Sabiales","Proteales","Trochodendrales","Buxales","Gunnerales","Pentapetalae","Dilleniaceae","Superasteridae","Berberidopsidales","Caryophyllales","Santalales","Asterids","Superrosidae","Saxifragales","Vitales","Rosids","Monophyletic","Flowering_plant","James_A._Doyle","Dicotyledon","Synapomorphy","Phenotypic_trait","Angiosperm","Monocots","Basal_angiosperms","Monophyletic","Pollen","Seed_plants","Gymnosperms","Monocots","Asteraceae","Dandelion","Forget-me-not","Cabbage","Brassicaceae","Apple","Buttercup","Maple","Macadamia","Magnoliids","Angiosperm","APG_system","APG_II_system","Angiosperms","Clade","Monophyletic","Paraphyletic","Pentapetalae","Gunnerales","Rosidae","Vitaceae","Saxifragales","Berberidopsidales","Santalales","Caryophyllales","Asteridae","Dilleniaceae","Buxaceae","Didymelaceae","Sabiaceae","Trochodendraceae","Tetracentraceae","Ranunculales","Proteales","Aextoxicaceae","Berberidopsidaceae","Dilleniaceae","Gunnerales","Caryophyllales","Saxifragales","Santalales","Aphloiaceae","Geissolomataceae","Ixerbaceae","Picramniaceae","Strassburgeriaceae","Vitaceae","Crossosomatales","Geraniales","Myrtales","Zygophyllaceae","Krameriaceae","Huaceae","Celastrales","Malpighiales","Oxalidales","Fabales","Rosales","Cucurbitales","Fagales","Tapisciaceae","Brassicales","Malvales","Sapindales","Cornales","Ericales","Boraginaceae","Icacinaceae","Oncothecaceae","Vahliaceae","Garryales","Solanales","Gentianales","Lamiales","Bruniaceae","Columelliaceae","Desfontainiaceae","Eremosynaceae","Escalloniaceae","Paracryphiaceae","Polyosmaceae","Sphenostemonacae","Tribelaceae","Aquifoliales","Apiales","Dipsacales","Asterales","Segregate_(taxonomy)"]}
