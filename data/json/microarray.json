It is a 2D array on a solid\nsubstrate (usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays large\namounts of biological material using high-throughput screening methods.\n\nTypes of microarrays include: *DNA microarrays, such as cDNA microarrays,\noligonucleotide microarrays and SNP microarrays *MMChips, for surveillance of\nmicroRNA populations *Protein microarrays *Peptide microarrays, for detailed\nanalyses or optimization of protein-protein interactions *Tissue microarrays\n*Cellular microarrays (also called transfection microarrays) *Chemical compound\nmicroarrays *Antibody microarrays *Carbohydrate arrays (glycoarrays) *Phenotype\nmicroarrays\n* interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS)\n\nPeople in the field of CMOS biotechnology are developing new kinds of\nmicroarrays. Once fed magnetic nanoparticles, individual cells can be moved\nindependently and simultaneously on a microarray of magnetic coils. A microarray\nof nuclear magnetic resonance microcoils is under development.  Donhee Ham\nand Robert M.
