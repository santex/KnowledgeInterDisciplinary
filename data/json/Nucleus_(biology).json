The central\n and rightmost cell are in interphase, thus their entire nuclei are labeled. On\n the left, a cell is going through mitosis and its DNA has condensed.]]\n\n\nIn cell biology, the 'nucleus' (pl. nuclei; from Latin or , meaning kernel) is a\nmembrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It contains most of the\ncell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in\ncomplex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes.\nThe genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome. The function\nof the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the\nactivities of the cell by regulating gene expression â the nucleus is,\ntherefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the\nnucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire\norganelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the\nnucleoskeleton (which includes nuclear lamina), a mesh work within the nucleus\nthat adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the\ncell as a whole. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through\nthe pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of\nchromosomes. Because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules,\nnuclear pores are required that regulate Nuclear transport of molecules across\nthe envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel\nthrough which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins\nwhile allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. The interior of the\nnucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are\nnot uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique\nproteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known\nof these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of\nribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the\ncytoplasm where they translate mRNA.\n","linknr":1240,"url":"Nucleus_(biology)","recorded":1362481139,"links":105,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","genetics","constellation","biology","botanist","genetics","biology","anatomy","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/sep2008/345.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/sep2008/345.pdf"],"categories":["Organelles","Cell
