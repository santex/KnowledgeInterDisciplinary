However,\nin the Western conception \"Pygmies\" are short forest people, whereas southern\nTwa populations do not live in the forest and may not be shorter than the\nfarming/village population, generally not reaching the anthropological\ndefinition of \"Pygmy\" as males averaging less than 150 cm. Outside of the\nrainforest, the Twa may be taller than the classic Pygmy, and there may be less\ndifference in physical appearanceâin some cases none. Nonetheless, the\n'despised' relationship between the farmer patron and the hunter client is\nsimilar to that of the forest.\n\nNo Pygmy or Twa population is known to live independently of agriculture, and\nall live near or in agricultural villages. Agricultural Bantu peoples have\nsettled a number of ecotones (the margins between ecosystems) next to an area\nthat has game but will not support agriculture, such as the edges of the\nrainforest, open swamp, and desert, and the Twa spend part of the year in the\notherwise uninhabited region hunting game, being provided with agricultural food\nby the farmers while they do so.\n\nRoger Blench has proposed that Twa (Pygmies) originated as a caste like they are\ntoday, much like the ''Numu'' blacksmith castes of West Africa, economically\nspecialized groups which became endogamous and consequently developed into\nseparate ethnic groups, sometimes, as with the Ligbi, with their own languages.\nA mismatch in language between patron and client could later occur from\npopulation displacements. The short stature of the \"forest people\" could have\ndeveloped in the few millennia since the Bantu expansion, as also happened with\nBantu domestic animals in the rainforest, especially if there was additional\nselective pressure from farmers taking the tallest women back to the village as\nwives, as happens today. However, that is incidental to the social identity of\nthe Pygmy/Twa. Blench, Roger. 1999. \"Are the African Pygmies an\nEthnographic Fiction?\". Pp 41â60 in Biesbrouck, Elders, & Rossel (eds.)\nChallenging Elusiveness: Central African Hunter-Gatherers in a Multidisciplinary\nPerspective. Leiden.[http://www.rogerblench.info/Anthropology%20data/Text/Pygmi-\nes%20an%20ethnographic%20fiction.pdf]\n\nIt is often supposed that the Pygmies were the aboriginal inhabitants of the\nforest before the advent of agriculture. However, Vansina argues that the\noriginal meaning of the (Proto-Bantu) word *Twa was [[hunter-gatherer]]\n(\"bushpeople\"), and that this became conflated with another root for Twa/Pygmy,\n*Yaka (as in Ba-Yaka). Vansina, Jan. 1990. Paths in the Rainforests: Toward\na history of political tradition in equatorial Africa. As the Twa caste\ndeveloped into full-time hunter-gatherers, the words were conflated, and the\nritual role of the absorbed aboriginal peoples Scattered small hunter-\ngatherer populations survive in out-of-the-way places, some, such as the Hadza,\nwith their original languages intact. was transferred to the
