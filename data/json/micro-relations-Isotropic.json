{"cursor":"7706","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Isotropy' is uniformity in all orientations; it is derived from the Greek isos\n(Î¯ÏÎ¿Ï, equal) and tropos (ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Ï, way). Precise definitions depend on the\nsubject area. Exceptions, or inequalities, are frequently indicated by the\nprefix an, hence [[anisotropy]]. Anisotropy is also used to describe situations\nwhere properties vary systematically, dependent on direction. Isotropic\nradiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement,\nand an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test\nparticle is oriented.\n","linknr":208,"url":"Isotropic","recorded":1362481757,"links":42,"instances":["astronomy","biology","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orientation"],"headings":["Mathematics","Physics","Biology","Other sciences","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/LvMS-Lvv.jpg/220px-LvMS-Lvv.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["great_wall","astronomy"],["antenna","electronics"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["great_wall","cell","antenna"],"related":["Isotropic_radiation","Measurement","Elementary_particle","Mathematics","Isotropic_manifold","Manifold","Geometry","Homogeneous_space","Isotropic_quadratic_form","Quadratic_form","Isotropic_coordinates","Isotropic_chart","Lorentzian_manifolds","Quantum_mechanics","Particle_physics","Rotational_invariance","Kinetic_theory","Fluid_dynamics","Thermal_expansion","Electromagnetism","Optics","Reflectance","Transmittance","Polycrystalline","Cosmology","Big_Bang","Cosmological_Principle","Great_Wall_(astronomy)","Isotropic","Polarized","Petrographic_microscope","List_of_materials_properties","Geology","Mineralogy","Wood","Slate","Carbon_fiber","Rebar","Reinforced_concrete","Microfabrication","Integrated_circuits","Microelectromechanical_systems","Isotropic_antenna","Radiator","Reference","Antenna_(electronics)","Poynting_vector","Helmholtz_equation","Decibel","Cell_biology","Cell_(biology)","Organelle","Physiology","Muscle_fibers","Isotropic_bands","I_bands","Pharmacology","Isotropic_formulations","Rotational_invariance","Isotropic_bands","Isotropic_coordinates","Transverse_isotropy","Anisotropic","Bi_isotropic"]}
