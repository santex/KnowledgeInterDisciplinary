Over the last 40 years\nbiochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now\nalmost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in\nbiochemical research.<ref>http://www.biochemistry.org/Education/Careers/Schools-\nandcolleges/Whatisbiochemistry.aspx</ref> Today the main focus of pure\nbiochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the\nprocesses that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the\nstudy and understanding of whole organisms.\n\nBiochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular\nmechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the\nprocesses of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used,\nmolecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry\nas a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology.\n\nMuch of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of\nbiological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and\nlipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions\nassociated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of\nsmaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal\nions, or organic, for example the amino acids which are used to synthesise\nproteins. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment\nvia chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are\napplied primarily in medicine , nutrients , and agriculture. in nutrients ,\nbiochemist , investigate the causes and cures of disease.in nutrients , they\nstudy how to maintain health and study the effects of nutritional deficiencies.\nin agriculture , biochemist investigate soil and fertilizers , ant try to\ndiscover ways to improve crop cultivation , crop storage and pest control.\n",
