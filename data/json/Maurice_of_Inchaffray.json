He was Prior of\nInchmahome Priory in Menteith after 1297. Ian B. Cowan, & David E. Easson, ,\nMedieval Religious Houses: Scotland With an Appendix on the Houses in the Isle\nof Man, (London, 1976), 108. He became abbot of Inchaffray Abbey in\nStrathearn between March 1304 and October 1305. Ibid, p. 102. As Abbot\nof Inchaffray, he held a canonry in the diocese of Dunblane, that is, the\nprecentorship of Dunblane Cathedral (also in Strathearn). James Hutchison\nCockburn, The Medieval Bishops of Dunblane and Their Church, (Edinburgh, 1959),\npp. 54, 90. After the death of Nicholas de Balmyle, he was elected to the\nbishopric of Dunblane. He was consecrated to the see before 23 March 1322, after\nlitigation at the Papal court. King Edward II of England had nominated one\nRichard de Pontefract to the see, while Roger de Ballinbreich had also been\nelected by the chapter; both of these men were overlooked by the Pope in\nMaurice's favour. D. E. R. Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae Scotinanae Medii Aevi ad\nannum 1638, 2nd Draft, (St Andrews, 1969), p. 76.\n\nMaurice has achieved some popular fame because of his role as an early\nsupporter of King Robert I of Scotland and as chaplain at the Battle of\nBannockburn. Maurice was probably one of the people who helped Robert after his\ndefeat at the Battle of Methven in 1305. G. W. S., Barrow, Robert Bruce and\nthe Community of the Realm of Scotland, (Edinburgh, 1988), p. 60. Robert\nI's first recorded act as king involved Abbot Maurice, who was given a\n\"credence\" (like empowering a Plenipotentiary or possessor of Power of\nAttorney) to speak with Maol Ãosa III, Earl of Strathearn on his\nbehalf. Chris Brown, Robert the Bruce: A Life Chronicled, (Stroud, 2004),\np. 9. Maurice was in England with a grant of safe-conduct in January\n1313, probably on a mission to attempt to make peace between the two\nkings. Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 200. At the Battle of Bannockburn in\n1314, Maurice was the chaplain of the Scottish army and gave an encouraging\nspeech and blessing to the Scottish soldiers. According to a legendary account\nfound in the writings of Hector Boece, Maurice brought to the battlefield the\nsilver reliquary known to contain the left arm-bone of St Fillan, but for\nsafety left the actual arm of the saint in the monastery. The arm-bone,\nhowever, miraculously made its own way to the battlefield where it helped bring\nthe Scots victory. Cockburn, Medieval Bishops of Dunblane, 93.\n\nHis later career is largely unrecorded. He died in the 1340s, definitely before\n23 October 1347, when William de Cambuslang, his successor as Bishop of\nDunblane, was consecrated.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Maurice_of_Inchaffray","recorded":1374779608,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Maurice_of_Inchaffray&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Maurice_of_Inchaffray&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Maurice_of_Inchaffray.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Maurice_of_Inchaffray.jpg/300px-Maurice_of_Inchaffray.jpg","/wiki/File:Maurice_of_Inchaffray.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","/wiki/Prior_of_Inchmahome","/wiki/Abbot_of_Inchaffray","/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Prior","/wiki/Inchmahome_Priory","/wiki/Menteith","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey","/wiki/Strathearn","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Canonry","/wiki/Dunblane","/wiki/Precentor","/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Nicholas_de_Balmyle","/wiki/Episcopal_see","/wiki/Edward_II_of_England","/wiki/Richard_de_Pontefract","/wiki/Roger_de_Ballinbreich","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland","/wiki/Battle_of_Bannockburn","/wiki/Battle_of_Methven","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Plenipotentiary","/wiki/Power_of_Attorney","/wiki/Maol_%C3%8Dosa_III,_Earl_of_Strathearn","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Hector_Boece","/wiki/Reliquary","/wiki/St_Fillan","#cite_note-8","/wiki/William_de_Cambuslang","/w/index.php?title=Maurice_of_Inchaffray&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","/w/index.php?title=Maurice_of_Inchaffray&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/G._W._S._Barrow","/wiki/James_Hutchison_Cockburn","/wiki/D._E._R._Watt","/wiki/Prior_of_Inchmahome","/wiki/Abbot_of_Inchaffray","/wiki/Nicholas_de_Balmyle","/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane","/wiki/William_de_Cambuslang","/wiki/Template:Bishops_of_Dunblane","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Bishops_of_Dunblane&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bishops_of_Dunblane&action=edit","/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane","/wiki/M._de_Dunblan","/wiki/Laurence_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Simon_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Jonathan_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Abraham_of_Strathearn","/wiki/Radulf_(bishop-elect)","/wiki/Osbert_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Clement_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Robert_de_Prebenda","/wiki/William_(bishop_of_Dunblane)","/wiki/Alp%C3%ADn_of_Strathearn","/wiki/Nicholas_of_Arbroath","/wiki/Nicholas_de_Balmyle","/wiki/Richard_de_Pontefract","/wiki/Roger_de_Balnebrich","/wiki/William_de_Cambuslang","/wiki/Walter_de_Coventre","/wiki/Andrew_Magnus","/wiki/D%C3%BAghall_of_Lorne","/wiki/Fionnlagh_MacCailein","/wiki/William_Stephani","/wiki/Michael_Ochiltree","/wiki/Walter_Stewart_(priest)","/wiki/Robert_Lauder","/wiki/John_Herspolz","/wiki/John_Spalding_(priest)","/wiki/James_Chisholm","/wiki/William_Chisholm_(I)","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/William_Chisholm_(II)","/wiki/Andrew_Graham_(bishop_of_Dunblane)","/wiki/George_Graham_(bishop)","/wiki/Adam_Bellenden","/wiki/James_Wedderburn_(bishop)","/wiki/Robert_Leighton_(bishop)","/wiki/James_Ramsay_(bishop)","/wiki/Robert_Douglas_(bishop)","/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church","/wiki/Robert_Douglas_(bishop)","/wiki/John_Gillan","/wiki/Robert_White_(bishop)","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Rose_(bishop)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Patrick_Torry","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurice_of_Inchaffray&oldid=559031495","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1340s_deaths","/wiki/Category:Bishops_of_Dunblane","/wiki/Category:Medieval_Gaels","/wiki/Category:Scottish_abbots","/wiki/Category:Scottish_priors","/wiki/Category:14th-century_Roman_Catholic_bishops","/wiki/Category:People_of_the_Wars_of_Scottish_Independence","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2012","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_August_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Scottish_Gaelic-language_text","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maurice+of+Inchaffray&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maurice+of+Inchaffray","/wiki/Maurice_of_Inchaffray","/wiki/Talk:Maurice_of_Inchaffray","#","/wiki/Maurice_of_Inchaffray","/w/index.php?title
