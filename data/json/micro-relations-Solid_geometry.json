It was developed following the development of plane geometry.\n'Stereometry' deals with the measurements of volumes of various solid figures\nincluding cylinder, circular cone, truncated cone, sphere, and prisms.\n\nThe Pythagoreans had dealt with the regular solids, but the pyramid, prism, cone\nand cylinder were not studied until the Platonists. Eudoxus established their\nmeasurement, proving the pyramid and cone to have one-third the volume of a\nprism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height, and was probably the\ndiscoverer of a proof that the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of\nits radius. ...paraphrased and taken in part from the [[1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia\nBritannica]]\n","linknr":177,"url":"Solid_geometry","recorded":1362579070,"links":44,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","dialogue","geometry","geometry","mathematics","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometric","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean solid geometry|*"],"headings":["Basic topics of solid geometry","Other topics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"],["cone","geometry"],["prism","geometry"],["pyramid","geometry"],["incidence","geometry"],["plane","mathematics"],["line","mathematics"],["cube","geometry"],["pyramid","geometry"],["prism","geometry"],["cone","geometry"],["cylinder","geometry"],["vector","geometric"],["matrix","mathematics"],["timaeus","dialogue"]],"members":["cube","plane","timaeus","incidence","cone","matrix","cylinder","pyramid","prism","vector","line"],"related":["Mathematics","Geometry","Euclidean_space","Space","Plane_geometry","Measurement","Volume","Shape","Cylinder_(geometry)","Cone_(geometry)","Frustum","Sphere","Prism_(geometry)","Pythagoreanism","Regular_solid","Pyramid_(geometry)","Platonism","Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","Radius","Incidence_(geometry)","Plane_(mathematics)","Line_(mathematics)","Dihedral_angle","Solid_angle","Cube_(geometry)","Cuboid","Parallelepiped","Tetrahedron","Pyramid_(geometry)","Prism_(geometry)","Octahedron","Dodecahedron","Icosahedron","Cone_(geometry)","Cylinder_(geometry)","Sphere","Quadric","Spheroid","Ellipsoid","Paraboloid","Hyperboloid","Projective_geometry","Desargues'_theorem","Polyhedra","Descriptive_geometry","Analytic_geometry","Vector_(geometric)","System_of_linear_equations","Matrix_(mathematics)","Computer_graphics","Algorithm","Archimedes","Johannes_Kepler","Planimetry","Plato","Shape","Timaeus_(dialogue)"]}
