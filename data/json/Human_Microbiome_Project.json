{"cursor":"16535","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Human Microbiome Project' ('HMP') is a United States National Institutes of\nHealth initiative with the goal of identifying and characterizing the\nmicroorganisms which are found in association with both healthy and diseased\nhumans (the Human microbiome). Launched in 2008, it is a five-year\nproject, best characterized as a feasibility study, and has a total budget of\n$115 million. The ultimate goal of this and similar NIH-sponsored microbiome\nprojects is to test how changes in the human microbiome are associated with\nhuman health or disease. This topic is currently not well understood.\n\nImportant components of the Human Microbiome Project will be culture-independent\nmethods of microbial community characterization, such as metagenomics (which\nprovides a broad genetic perspective on a single microbial community), as well\nas extensive whole genome sequencing (which provides a \"deep\" genetic\nperspective on certain aspects of a given microbial community, i.e. of\nindividual bacterial species). The latter will serve as reference genomic\nsequences â 3000 such sequences of individual bacterial isolates are currently\nplanned â for comparison purposes during subsequent metagenomic analysis. The\nmicrobiology of five body sites will be emphasized: oral, skin, vaginal, gut,\nand nasal/lung. The project also is financing deep sequencing of bacterial 16S\nrRNA sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human\nsubjects.\n","linknr":447,"url":"Human_Microbiome_Project","recorded":1362509402,"links":18,"instances":["biology","biology","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf"],"categories":["Microbiomes","Bacteriology","Human genome projects","Environmental microbiology"],"headings":["Introduction","Goals","Achievements","Milestones","References","Related entries","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Human_Microbiome_Project_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg/220px-Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["domain","biology"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["domain","cell","nature"],"related":["National_Institutes_of_Health","Microorganisms","Human_microbiome","NIH","Microbiome","Community_ecology","Metagenomics","Whole_genome_sequencing","Genomics","Microbiology","Oral_microbiology","Skin_flora","Vaginal_flora","Gut_flora","Nasal_cavity","Lung","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Cell_(biology)","Human_body","Microbiological_culture","Bacteria","Domain_(biology)","Archaea","Yeasts","Protozoa","Helminth","Parasitism","Virus","Bacteriophages","Human_Genome_Project","Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research","Integrated_Microbial_Genomes_System","CharProtDB","Genomes_OnLine_Database","T_helper_17_cell","Autoimmune_disease","Verrucomicrobia","Vaginosis","NIH","Francis_Collins","Nature_(journal)","Public_Library_of_Science","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Genera","Environmental_microbiology","Genome_project","Genomics","Gut_flora","Human_microbiome","Medical_microbiology","Metagenomics","Microbial_ecology","Microflora","Multigenomic_organism","Oral_microbiology","Skin_flora","Superorganism","Vaginal_flora"]}
