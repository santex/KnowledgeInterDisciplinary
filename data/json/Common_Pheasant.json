It is native to Asia and has been widely introduced elsewhere as\na game bird. In parts of its range, namely in places where none of its relatives\noccur such as in Europe (where it is naturalized), it is simply known as the\n\"'pheasant'\". 'Ring-necked Pheasant' is both the name used for the species as a\nwhole in North America and also the collective name for a number of subspecies\nand their intergrades which have white neck rings.\n\nThe word pheasant is derived from the ancient town of Phasis, the predecessor of\nthe modern port city of Poti in Western Georgia.\n\nIt is a well-known gamebird, among those of more than regional importance\nperhaps the most widespread and ancient one in the whole world. The Common\nPheasant is one of the world's most hunted birds; Robertson (1997) pp.\n123â136 it has been introduced for that purpose to many regions, and is\nalso common on game farms where it is commercially bred. Ring-necked Pheasants\nin particular are commonly bred and were introduced to many parts of the world;\nthe game farm stock, though no distinct breeds have been developed yet, can be\nconsidered semi-domesticated. The Ring-necked Pheasant is the state bird of\nSouth Dakota, one of only three U.S. state birds that is not a species native to\nthe United States.\n\nThe Green Pheasant (P. versicolor) of Japan is sometimes placed as subspecies\nwithin the Common Pheasant. Though the species produce fertile hybrids wherever\nthey coexist, this is simply a typical feature among fowl (Galloanseres), in\nwhich postzygotic isolating mechanisms are slight compared to most other birds.\nThe species apparently have somewhat different ecological requirements and at\nleast in its typical habitat, the Green Pheasant outcompetes the Common\nPheasant. The introduction of the latter to Japan has therefore largely failed.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Common_Pheasant","recorded":1372152400,"links":[],"instances":["biology","colour","british_coin","feather","country","colour","colour","color","biology","town","colour","feathers","colour","colour","colour","british_coin","biology","anatomy","food","color","biology","colour"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animals described in 1758","Birds of Asia","Birds of China","Birds of Europe","Birds of Azerbaijan","Birds of Iran|Pheasant, Common","Birds of Korea","Birds of Pakistan","Birds of Turkey","Introduced birds","Introduced birds of Hawaii","Non-native fauna of the British Isles","Phasianus","Pheasants","Poultry","Symbols of South Dakota","United States state birds"],"headings":["Description","Taxonomy and systematics","Ecology","As gamebirds","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["phasis","town"],["georgia","country"],["game","food"],["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["crest","feathers"],["wattle","anatomy"],["isabelline","colour"],["fawn","colour"],["type_locality","biology"],["georgia","country"],["covert","feather"],["buff","colour"],["rust","colour"],["chestnut","colour"],["copper","colour"],["khaki","color"],["olive","colour"],["tan","color"],["orange","colour"],["egg","biology"],["guinea","british_coin"],["half_crown","british_coin"]],"members":["type_locality","rust","guinea","covert","georgia","isabelline","fawn","khaki","egg","phasis","buff","crest","olive","orange","copper","half_crown","hybrid","wattle","game","tan","family","chestnut"],"related":["Poland","Gene_pool","Animalia","Chordata","Aves","Neornithes","Neognathae","Galloanserae","Galliformes","Phasianidae","Phasianinae","Carl_Linnaeus","10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Pheasant","Family_(biology)","Phasianidae","Asia","Game_bird","Subspecies","Phasis_(town)","Poti","Georgia_(country)","Game_(food)","Breed","Domesticated","List_of_U.S._state_birds","South_Dakota","United_States","Green_Pheasant","Japan","Subspecies","Hybrid_(biology)","Fowl","Isolating_mechanisms","Ecological","Competition","Hybrid_(biology)","Subspecies","Taxon","Hybrid_(biology)","Nominate_subspecies","Feather","Crest_(feathers)","Wattle_(anatomy)","Sexual_dimorphism","Green_Pheasant","Mutation","Melanism","Isabelline_(colour)","Fawn_(colour)","Phenotype","Carolus_Linnaeus","Binomial_nomenclature","Ulisse_Aldrovandi","Giovanni_Pietro_Olina","John_Ray","Eleazar_Albin","Ornithology","Eastern_Meadowlark","Type_locality_(biology)","Mediterranean","Roman_Empire","Rioni_River","Ancient_Greek","Modern_era","Allele","Transcaucasia","Scientific_name","Latin","Colchis","Georgia_(country)","Galliformes","Genus","Domestic_chicken","Red_Junglefowl","Type_species","USA","Montana","Chinese_language","Pheasant","Genome","Amniote","Base_pair","Black-chinned_Hummingbird","Subspecies","Covert_(feather)","Allele","Natural_selection","Climate","Habitat","Central_Asia","East_Asia","Arid","Mountain","Turkestan","Last_glacial_period","Speciation","Caucasus","Turkestan","Buff_(colour)","Rust_(colour)","Chestnut_(colour)","Bronze","Mongolia","Copper_(colour)","Tarim_Basin","Khaki_(color)","Olive_(colour)","China","Vietnam","Taiwan","Strait_of_Tartary","Tan_(color)","Powder_blue","Orange_(colour)","Korean_Peninsula","Black_Sea","Caspian_Sea","Manchuria","Siberia","Korea","China","Taiwan","Copse","Conspecific","Invertebrate","Vertebrate","Polygyny","Egg_(biology)","Litovelské_Pomoraví_Protected_Landscape_Area","Protected_areas_in_the_Czech_Republic","Stone_Age","Grouse","Partridge","Junglefowl","Peacock","Roman_Empire","Fauna","Southern_Hemisphere","Galliformes","Ecological","Great_Britain","Romano-British","Extirpated","Gamekeeper","Game_&_Wildlife_Conservation_Trust","North_America","Rocky_Mountains","Colorado","Montana","Wyoming","Midwest","Great_Plains","Canada","Mexico","Bosque_del_Apache","Great_Plains","Europe","Hawaiian_Islands","Chile","St.&nbsp;Helena","Tasmania","New_Zealand","Rottnest_Island","Australia","English_Cocker_Spaniel","Game_Act_1831","Gun_dog","Retriever","Spaniels","Pointing_breed","Doggerel","Guinea_(British_coin)","Half_crown_(British_coin)","George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","Poaching","Roald_Dahl","United_Kingdom","Intensive_and_extensive_farming","Hunting","United_States","London","Roasting","Ohio","Hunting","Hunters","Shoot","Eleazar_Albin","Ulisse_Aldrovandi","BBC_Four","H2g2","Carl_Linnaeus","Helm_Identification_Guides","John_Ray","Internet_Archaeology","David_Allen_Sibley"]}
