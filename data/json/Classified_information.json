{"cursor":"42829","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n report on the USS ''Liberty'' incident, partially declassified and\n released to the public in July 2004. The original overall classification of the\n page, \"top secret\", and the Special Intelligence code word \"umbra\", are shown\n at top and bottom. The classification of individual paragraphs and reference\n titles is shown in parenthesesâthere are six different levels on this page\n alone. Notations with leader lines at top and bottom cite statutory authority\n for not declassifying certain sections.]]\n\n'Classified information' is a US categorization applied to information that a\ngovernment claims is sensitive information, whereas a terminology with secret,\nconfidential or protected (or a translation thereof) is used instead in other\ncountries. Access is restricted by law or regulation to particular groups of\npersons. A formal security clearance is often required to handle classified\ndocuments or access classified data. The clearance process requires a\nsatisfactory background investigation. There are typically several levels\n(classes) of sensitivity, with differing clearance requirements. This sort of\nhierarchical system of secrecy is used by virtually every national government.\nThe act of assigning the level of sensitivity to data is called 'data\nclassification'. Although the root sense of the word \"classified\" is simply\nsynonymous with \"categorized\", it has developed a sense synonymous with\n\"censored\" in the context of classified information, in US English.\n\nA distinction could be made between formal security classification and privacy\nmarkings such as \"commercial in confidence\".\n\nSome corporations and non-government organizations also assign sensitive\ninformation to multiple levels of protection, either from a desire to protect\ntrade secrets, or because of laws and regulations governing various matters such\nas personal privacy, sealed legal proceedings and the timing of financial\ninformation releases.\n","linknr":492,"url":"Classified_information","recorded":1362902181,"links":50,"instances":["united_states","france","hong_kong"],"pdf":["http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_liberty/attack_sigint.pdf","http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_liberty/attack_sigint.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/access_documents/docs/guide_citoyen/en.pdf","http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/306652_CM6554.pdf","http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/306652_CM6554.pdf","http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(689F2CCBD6DC263C912FB74B15BE8285)~Australian+Government+information+security+management+guidelines-+Australian+Government+Security+classification+system.pdf/$file/Australian+Government+information+security+management+guidelines-+Australian+Government+Security+classification+system.pdf","http://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/doclib/general.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/10/40761118.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/10/40761118.pdf","http://www.archives.gov/isoo/training/marking-booklet.pdf","http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/docs/Removing%20Knowledge.pdf"],"categories":["Classified
