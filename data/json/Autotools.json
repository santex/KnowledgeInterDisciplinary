{"cursor":"8666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'GNU build system', also known as the 'Autotools', is a suite of programming\ntools designed to assist in making source-code packages portable to many Unix-\nlike systems.\n\nIt can be difficult to make a software program portable: the C compiler differs\nfrom system to system; certain library functions are missing on some systems;\nheader files may have different names. One way to handle this is write\nconditional code, with code blocks selected by means of preprocessor directives\n( #ifdef ); but because of the wide variety of build environments\nthis approach quickly becomes unmanageable. Autotools is designed to address\nthis problem more manageably.\n\nAutotools is part of the GNU toolchain and is widely used in many free-software\nand open-source packages.
