{"cursor":"2520","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Michael Gryffin' or Gryffen (died 1467) was an English-born judge who spent\nmany years attempting to prove his right to hold the office of Chief Baron of\nthe Irish Exchequer against his Irish-born rival, John Cornwalsh. Ball, F.\nElrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. i\np.101\n\nLittle appears to be known of his background, but Griffiths states that he had a\nlong record of good service to the English Crown, Grifffiths, Ralph A. The\nReign of Henry VI- the Exercise of Royal Authority Ernest Benn Ltd. 1981\np.417 and Ball states that he was described as \"a gentleman\". Ball\np.178 In consideration of his long service, he was in 1441 appointed Chief\nBaron of the Irish Exchequer for life. Griffiths p.417 Immediately he\nclashed with John Cornwalsh, whose father James Cornwalsh, recently deceased had\nheld the same office; John claimed the office in reversion. he dispute merged\ninto the wider, long-running dispute between the two main political factions in\nIreland, the Butlers and the Talbots. With the backing of the Talbots, headed by\nJohn Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, Gryffin managed to keep his rival out of\noffice for 5 years; but in 1446 Cornwalsh, backed by his powerful patron James\nButler, 4th Earl of Ormonde obtained a declaration that Gryffin's patent of\noffice had been obtained illegally, Ball p.101 although how a patent\nissued at the command of the King could be \"illegal\" is unclear. In favour of\nCornwalsh it could be argued that he had some legal training, whereas Gryffin,\njudging by a memorandum of 1442, had no legal qualifications.\n\nThe following year Gryffin was accused of \"diverse offences\" Ball\np.101 but he refused to give up the struggle: in 1449 he sat as judge on a\ncommission of oyer and terminer, which his enemies promptly declared illegal. In\n1454, after conditions in Ireland had become more settled, he was exonerated of\nany wrongdoing. He died in or about 1467.
