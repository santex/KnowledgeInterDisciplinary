The air mass information is necessary\nfor the engine control unit (ECU) to balance and deliver the correct fuel mass\nto the engine. Air changes its density as it expands and contracts with\ntemperature and pressure. In automotive applications, air density varies with\nthe ambient temperature, altitude and the use of forced induction, which means\nthat mass flow sensors are more appropriate than volumetric flow sensors for\ndetermining the quantity of intake air in each piston stroke. (See stoichiometry\nand ideal gas law.)\n\nThere are two common types of mass airflow sensors in use on automotive engines.\nThese are the vane meter and the hot wire. Neither design employs technology\nthat measures air mass directly. However, with additional sensors and inputs, an\nengine's electronic control unit can determine the mass flowrate of intake air.\n\nBoth approaches are used almost exclusively on electronic fuel injection (EFI)\nengines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0â5.0 volt or a pulse-width modulation\n(PWM) signal that is proportional to the air mass flow rate, and both sensors\nhave an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor incorporated into their housings.\n\nWhen a MAF is used in conjunction with an oxygen sensor, the engine's air/fuel\nratio can be controlled very accurately. The MAF sensor provides the open-loop\ncontroller predicted air flow information (the measured air flow) to the ECU,\nand the oxygen sensor provides closed-loop feedback in order to make minor\ncorrections to the predicted air mass.
