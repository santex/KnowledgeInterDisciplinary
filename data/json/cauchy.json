He started the project of\nformulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous\nmanner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited\nby earlier authors. He defined continuity in terms of infinitesimals and gave\nseveral important theorems in complex analysis and initiated the study of\npermutation groups in abstract algebra. A profound mathematician, Cauchy\nexercised a great influence over his contemporaries and successors. His writings\ncover the entire range of mathematics and mathematical physics.\n\n\"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other\nmathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named\nfor Cauchy).\" Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred\nresearch articles and five complete textbooks. He was a devout Roman Catholic,\nstrict Bourbon royalist, and a close associate of the Jesuit order.\n","title":"Augustin-Louis%20Cauchy","headings":["Biography","Work","Politics and religious beliefs","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: France","2: Paris","2: Ãcole_Centrale_du_PanthÃ©on","2: Ãcole_Nationale_des_Ponts_et_ChaussÃ©es","2: List_of_topics_named_after_Augustin-Louis_Cauchy","2: Baron","2: Infinitesimal","2: Louis_FranÃ§ois_Cauchy","2: French_Revolution","2: Lazare_Carnot","2: Springer_Science+Business_Media","2: Perspectives_on_Science","2: Niels_Henrik_Abel","2: Cambridge_University_Press","1: Sceaux,_Hauts-de-Seine","1: Mathematics","1: Ãcole_polytechnique","1: Francesco_FaÃ _di_Bruno","1: Viktor_Bunyakovsky","1: Mathematician","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Infinitesimal_calculus","1: Generality_of_algebra","1: Continuous_function","1: Complex_analysis","1: Permutation_group","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Mathematical_physics","1: Roman_Catholic","1: House_of_Bourbon","1: Jesuit_order","1: Reign_of_Terror","1: Robespierre","1: Napoleon","1: Pierre-Simon_Laplace","1: Joseph_Louis_Lagrange","1: Ãcole_Polytechnique","1: Ãcole_des_Ponts_et_ChaussÃ©es","1: Institut_de_France","1: Regular_polyhedron","1: Conic_sections","1: Symmetric_functions","1: Symmetric_group","1: Louis_XVIII","1: AcadÃ©mie_des_Sciences","1: Gaspard_Monge","1: Louis_Poinsot","1: Pierre_de_Fermat","1: Polygonal_number_theorem","1: Charles_X","1: CollÃ¨ge_de_France","1: Louis-Philippe","1: House_of_OrlÃ©ans","1: Fribourg","1: King_of_Sardinia","1: Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","1: Prague","1: Henri_d'Artois","1: Bureau_des_Longitudes","1: Longitude","1: Latitude","1: Celestial_mechanics","1: Signed-digit_representation","1: John_Colson","1: Ãcole_Normale_ÃcclÃ©siastique","1: Institut_Catholique","1: The_Enlightenment","1: Napoleon_III_of_France","1: Napoleon_III","1: Last_Rites","1: List_of_the_72_names_on_the_Eiffel_Tower","1: Problem_of_Apollonius","1: Circle","1: Euler_characteristic","1: Polyhedra","1: Wave","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Q-series","1: Augustin-Jean_Fresnel","1: Optics","1: Mechanics","1: Cauchy_stress_tensor","1: Simeon_Poisson","1: Fermat_polygonal_number_theorem","1: Complex_function_theory","1: Holomorphic_function","1: Complex_plane","1: Neighborhood","1: Cauchy's_integral_formula","1: Residue_theorem","1: Pierre-Alphonse_Laurent","1: Laurent_series","1: Karl_Weierstrass","1: Taylor's_theorem","1: Limit_of_a_function","1: Absolute_convergence","1: Cauchy_condensation_test","1: Uniform_continuity","1: Argument_principle","1: Cauchy_argument_principle","1: Nyquist_stability_criterion","1: Feedback_amplifier","1: Feedback","1: Leonhard_Euler","1: FacultÃ©_des_Sciences","1: Operational_calculus","1: Arcueil","1: Rouen","1: Potato_starch","1: Society_of_Saint_Vincent_de_Paul","1: Society_of_Jesus","1: Charles_Hermite","1: Great_Irish_Famine","1: Guglielmo_Libri_Carucci_dalla_Sommaja","1: Joseph_Liouville","1: Jean-Victor_Poncelet","1: CauchyâBinet_formula","1: Cauchy_boundary_condition","1: Cauchy's_convergence_test","1: Cauchy_determinant","1: Cauchy_distribution","1: Cauchy's_equation","1: CauchyâEuler_equation","1: Cauchy_functional_equation","1: Cauchy_horizon","1: Cauchy_formula_for_repeated_integration","1: CauchyâFrobenius_lemma","1: CauchyâHadamard_theorem","1: CauchyâKovalevskaya_theorem","1: Cauchy_momentum_equation","1: CauchyâPeano_theorem","1: Cauchy_principal_value","1: Cauchy_problem","1: Cauchy_product","1: Cauchy's_radical_test","1: CauchyâRassias_stability","1: CauchyâRiemann_equations","1: CauchyâSchwarz_inequality","1: Cauchy_sequence","1: Cauchy_surface","1: Maclaurin-Cauchy_test","1: Dictionary_of_Scientific_Biography","1: Robin_Hartshorne","1: Dijon"]}
