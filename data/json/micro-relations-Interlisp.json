Interlisp\ndevelopment began in 1967 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts as BBN LISP, which ran on PDP-10 machines running the TENEX\noperating system. When Danny Bobrow, Warren Teitelman and Ronald Kaplan moved\nfrom BBN to Xerox PARC, it was renamed Interlisp. Interlisp became a popular\nLisp development tool for AI researchers at Stanford University and elsewhere in\nthe DARPA community. Interlisp was notable for the integration of interactive\ndevelopment tools into the environment, such as a debugger, an automatic\ncorrection tool for simple errors (DWIM Teitelman, Warren, \"Do What I Mean\":\nthe programmer's assistant,\" Computers and Automation, pp. 8-11, April\n1972. - \"do what I mean\"), and analysis tools.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Interlisp","recorded":1362564889,"links":17,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language_"],"pdf":["http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/interlisp/Interlisp-VAX_A_Report.pdf","http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/interlisp/Interlisp-VAX_A_Report.pdf","http://larry.masinter.net/interlisp-ieee.pdf"],"categories":["Dynamic programming languages","Functional languages","Lisp programming language family","Lisp-based operating systems"],"headings":["Adaptations","References","Publications","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flavors","programming_language_"],["c","programming_language"]],"members":["c","flavors"],"related":["Lisp_programming_language","Bolt,_Beranek_and_Newman","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","BBN_LISP","PDP-10","TOPS-20","Daniel_G_Bobrow","Warren_Teitelman","Ronald_Kaplan","Xerox_PARC","Stanford_University","DARPA","Debugger","DWIM","Xerox_PARC","Virtual_machine","L._Peter_Deutsch","Xerox_Alto","Xerox_Daybreak","Lisp_Machine","ANSI","Common_Lisp","Xerox_Common_Lisp","LOOPS","Symbolics","Flavors_(programming_language)_","Common_Lisp_Object_System","Berkeley_Software_Distribution","VAX","Stanford_University","Information_Sciences_Institute","IEEE_Computer","Fuji_Xerox","Xerox_AI_Systems","Sunnyvale,_California","Sun_Microsystems","SPARC","Envos_Corporation","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","Software_System_Award","Daniel_G._Bobrow","Richard_R._Burton","L._Peter_Deutsch","Ronald_Kaplan","Larry_Masinter","Warren_Teitelman","Warren_Teitelman","J_Strother_Moore","L._Peter_Deutsch","Fortran","Mats_Nordstrom","C_(programming_language)","Microsoft_Windows","Linux","Blake_McBride"]}
