Scientific journals contain articles that have\nbeen peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's\nstandards of quality, and scientific validity. Although scientific journals are\nsuperficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite\ndifferent. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would\nread a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part\nof the scientific method. If they are describing experiments or calculations,\nthey must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the\nexperiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article\nbecomes part of the permanent scientific record.\n\nThe history of scientific journals dates from 1665, when the French [[Journal\ndes sÃ§avans]] and the English [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety]] first began systematically publishing research results. Over a\nthousand, mostly ephemeral, were founded in the 18th century, and the number has\nincreased rapidly after that. D. A. Kronick, \"History of Scientific and\nTechnical Periodicals,\" 2nd ed. Scarecrow, 1976\n\nArticles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education.\nSome classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and\nseminar classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or\ncurrent paper. In a scientific research group or academic department it is usual\nfor the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in journal clubs.\n\nThe standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some\njournals, such as [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[Science (journal)|Science]],\n[[PNAS]], and [[Physical Review Letters]], have a reputation of publishing\narticles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields. In\nmany fields, an informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most\nprestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the\narticles it will select for publication, and will also have the highest impact\nfactor. It is also common for journals to have a regional focus, specializing in\npublishing papers from a particular country or other geographic region, like\n[[African Invertebrates]].\n\nArticles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical\nresearch and experimental results in the field of science covered by the\njournal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the\nfield and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the\nnature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of scientific writing are\nenforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal,\nespecially between journals from different publishers.\n","recorded":1362124348,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"409","instances":["academic_document","books","journal","publishing","physics","journal","computer_scientist","soil_study","summary"],"pdf":["http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf","http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf"],"categories":["Technical communication","Academic publishing|"],"headings":["Types of articles","Electronic publishing","Cost","Copyright","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["open_access","publishing"],["open_access","publishing"],["science","journal"],["nature","journal"],["plasma","physics"],["pedology","soil_study"],["nature","journal"],["nature","journal"],["science","journal"],["abstract","summary"],["open_access","publishing"],["open_access","publishing"],["steve_lawrence","computer_scientist"],["thesis","academic_document"],["chapter","books"],["abstract","summary"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nature_cover,_November_4,_1869.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Nature_cover%2C_November_4%2C_1869.jpg/220px-Nature_cover%2C_November_4%2C_1869.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nature_cover,_November_4,_1869.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1665_phil_trans_vol_i_title.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/1665_phil_trans_vol_i_title.png/220px-1665_phil_trans_vol_i_title.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1665_phil_trans_vol_i_title.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Academic_publishing","Periodical_publication","Science","Research","List_of_scientific_journals","Scientific_paper","Peer_review","Validity","Professional","Magazine","Scientific_method","Ephemeral","Seminar","Academic_department","Journal_club","Impact_factor","Scientific_writing","Scientific_paper","Mathematics","Theoretical_computer_science","Data","Meta-analysis","IMRAD","Web_browsers","PDF","Utopia_Documents","WorldWideWeb","Encyclopedia_of_Computational_Chemistry","Physics_Today","Physics","Preprint","ArXiv.org","Quality_control","Scholarly_societies","Serials_crisis","Public_Library_of_Science","Publishing","Open_access_(publishing)","Copyright","Open_access_(publishing)","Postprints","American_Physical_Society","Public_Library_of_Science","List_of_scientific_journals","Academic_authorship","Academic_conference","Academic_journal","Citation_index","Open_access_journal","Scientific_writing","Stevan_Harnad"],"members":["thesis","chapter","nature","open_access","plasma","science","steve_lawrence","pedology","abstract"],"book":[]}
