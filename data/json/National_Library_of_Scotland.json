It is based in a\ncollection of buildings in Edinburgh city centre. The headquarters is on George\nIV Bridge, between the Old Town and the university quarter. There is also a more\nmodern building (1980s) in a residential area on the south side of the town\ncentre, on Causewayside. This was built to accommodate some of the specialist\ncollections (e.g., map library, science library) and to provide large-scale\nextra storage.\n\nThe National Library of Scotland holds 7 million books, 14 million\nprinted items and over 2 million maps. The collection includes copies of the\nGutenberg Bible, the letter which Charles Darwin submitted with the manuscript\nof [[Origin of Species]], the First Folio of Shakespeare and numerous journals\nand other publications.\n","linknr":281,"url":"National_Library_of_Scotland","recorded":1375055896,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:National_library_Scotland_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/National_library_Scotland_logo.png","/wiki/File:National_Library_of_Scotland,_Edinburgh.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/National_Library_of_Scotland%2C_Edinburgh.JPG/220px-National_Library_of_Scotland%2C_Edinburgh.JPG","/wiki/National_library","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=National_Library_of_Scotland&params=55.948554_N_-3.191899_E_","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=National_Library_of_Scotland&params=55.948554_N_-3.191899_E_","/wiki/Legal_deposit","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","http://www.nls.uk/info/readerstickets/index.html","http://www.auditscotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2008/fa_0708_national_libraries.pdf","http://www.nls.uk","/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language","/wiki/Scots_language","/wiki/Legal_deposit","/wiki/Library","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/National_Collections","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/George_IV_Bridge","/wiki/Edinburgh#Old_Town","/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible","/wiki/Charles_Darwin","/wiki/Origin_of_Species","/wiki/First_Folio_of_Shakespeare","#History","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Advocates_Library","/wiki/Faculty_of_Advocates","/wiki/National_library","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Alexander_Grant","/wiki/George_IV_Bridge","/wiki/Royal_Mile","/wiki/Reginald_Fairlie","/wiki/Hew_Lorimer","/w/index.php?title=Scott_Sutherland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Clan_Sinclair","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Mary_Queen_of_Scots","#cite_note-4","/wiki/10:10","/wiki/Carbon_footprint","/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/John_Murray_Archive","/wiki/Scottish_Publishers_Association","/wiki/Ask_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.rampantscotland.com/visit/bldev_visitnls.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml","#cite_ref-3","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7913935.stm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2009/09/mary-queen-of-scots-last-letter-now-on-display-for-limited-time","/w/index.php?title=National_Library_of_Scotland&action=edit&section=4","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:National_Library_of_Scotland","http://www.nls.uk/","/wiki/Template:Europe_topic","/wiki/Template_talk:Europe_topic","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Europe_topic&action=edit","/wiki/National_library","/wiki/Sovereign_state","/wiki/National_Library_of_Albania","/wiki/National_Library_of_Andorra","/wiki/National_Library_of_Armenia","/wiki/National_Library_of_Austria","/wiki/National_Library_of_Azerbaijan","/wiki/National_Library_of_Belarus","/wiki/National_Library_of_Belgium","/wiki/National_Library_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","/wiki/National_Library_of_Bulgaria","/wiki/National_Library_of_Croatia","/wiki/National_Library_of_Cyprus","/wiki/National_Library_of_the_Czech_Republic","/wiki/National_Library_of_Denmark","/wiki/National_Library_of_Estonia","/wiki/National_Library_of_Finland","/wiki/National_Library_of_France","/wiki/National_Library_of_Georgia_(country)","/wiki/National_Library_of_Germany","/wiki/National_Library_of_Greece","/wiki/National_Library_of_Hungary","/wiki/National_Library_of_Iceland","/wiki/National_Library_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/National_Library_of_Italy","/wiki/National_Library_of_Kazakhstan","/wiki/National_Library_of_Latvia","/wiki/National_Library_of_Liechtenstein","/wiki/National_Library_of_Lithuania","/wiki/National_Library_of_Luxembourg","/wiki/National_Library_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia","/wiki/Nationa
