In\n the laboratory, it is usually applied using an ultrasonic bath or an ultrasonic\n probe, colloquially known as a sonicator. In a paper machine, an ultrasonic\n foil can distribute cellulose fibres more uniformly and strengthen the paper.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Sonication","recorded":1362898640,"links":13,"instances":["papermaking","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ultrasound","Laboratory techniques","Fluid dynamics","Medical ultrasound"],"headings":["Effects","Applications","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Sonicator.jpg/220px-Sonicator.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ultrasonic_foil","papermaking"],["sparging","chemistry"]],"members":["ultrasonic_foil","sparging"],"related":["Ultrasound","Fourdrinier_machine","Ultrasonic_foil_(papermaking)","Sonochemistry","Sonoluminescence","NMR_tube","Degassing","Sparging_(chemistry)","Cell_disruption","Sonoporation","Ultrasonic_cleaning","Spectacles","Jewelry","Micropaleontology","Buzz_pollination","Bees","Pollen","Flower","Sonochemistry","Sonoluminescence","Ultrasonics","Kenneth_S._Suslick","Ultrasonic_cleaning"]}
