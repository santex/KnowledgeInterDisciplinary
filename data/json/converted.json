At the fundamental level conversion is the awakening of religious\nknowledge or understanding within a human being who had previously no belief in\nor concern with religious or spiritual matters.<ref>\"a spiritual change from\nsinfulness, ungodliness, or worldliness to love of God and pursuit of holiness.\"\nOED, Current Edition</ref> This awakening to moral and spiritual realities thus\nprecedes a transformation of lifestyle and thought patterns often taking place\nover a long period of time and requiring a significant level of effort and\ncommitment as described in the spiritual teachings of the world's great\nreligions. This transformation is the first and basic meaning of religious\nconversion. In popular usage, religious conversion refers to the adoption,\nwholesale, of a set of beliefs identified with one particular religious\ndenomination to the exclusion of others. Thus 'religious conversion' would\ndescribe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with\nanother. This might be from one to another denomination within the same\nreligion, for example, Christian Baptist to Methodist or Catholic,<ref>More\nconservative Protestants, especially Fundamentalists, would view a\n\"reaffiliation\" to Catholicism as a conversion to a new religion.</ref> Muslim\nShi'a to Sunni.<ref>Stark, Rodney and Roger Finke. \"Acts of Faith: Explaining\nthe Human Side of Religion.\" University of California Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-520-22202-\n1</ref> Religious conversion \"marks a transformation of religious identity and\nis symbolized by special rituals.\" <ref></ref>\n\nPeople convert to a different religion for various reasons, including: active\nconversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs,<ref>Falkenberg, Steve.\n\"Psychological Explanations of Religious Socialization.\" Religious Conversion.\nEastern Kentucky University. August 31, 2009.</ref> secondary conversion,\ndeathbed conversion, conversion for convenience and marital conversion, and\nforced conversion.\n\nConversion or reaffiliation for convenience is an insincere act, sometimes for\nrelatively trivial reasons such as a parent converting to enable a child to be\nadmitted to a good school associated with a religion, or a person adopting a\nreligion more in keeping with the social class he or she aspires to.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/im-posh-\nlet-me-in-602284.html The Independent newspaper]: \"... finding religion – is\nthere anything middle-class parents won't try to get their children into the\n'right' schools?\"</ref> When people marry one spouse may convert to the religion\nof the other.\n\nForced conversion is adoption under duress of a different religion. The convert\nmay secretly retain the previous beliefs and continue, covertly, with the\npractices of the original religion, while outwardly maintaining the forms of the\nnew religion. Over generations a family forced against their will to convert may\nwholeheartedly adopt the new religion.\n\n[[Proselytism]] is the act of attempting to convert by persuasion another\nindividual from a different religion or belief system. (See proselyte).\n\nApostate is a term used by members of a religion or denomination to refer to\nsomeone who has left that religion or denomination.\n","title":"Religious%20conversion","headings":["Abrahamic religions","Indian religions","Other religions and sects","International law","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Sin","3: Apostasy","3: Protestant","2: Christian","2: Muslim","2: Secondary_conversion","2: Deathbed_conversion","2: Forced_conversion","2: Yemen","2: Christian_denominations","2: Catholicism","2: Resurrection","2: Baptism","2: Infant_baptism","2: Age_of_accountability","2: Jesus","2: Missionary","2: United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights","2: Jehovah's_Witnesses","2: Sharia","1: OED","1: Religious_denomination","1: Baptist","1: Methodist","1: Catholic","1: Shi'a","1: Sunni","1: Marital_conversion","1: Social_class","1: Proselyte","1: Halakha","1: Circumcision","1: Pharisees","1: Sacraments","1: Repentance","1: God","1: Atoning","1: Jesus_Christ","1: Eastern_Christianity","1: High_church","1: Confirmation","1: Chrismation","1: Believer's_baptism","1: Catholics","1: Churches_of_Christ","1: Christadelphians","1: Atonement_in_Christianity","1: Blood_of_Christ","1: Sainthood#Christianity","1: Paul_of_Tarsus","1: Ministry_of_Jesus","1: Credo","1: New_Testament","1: Great_Commission","1: Evangelism","1: Trinitarianism","1: Trinity","1: Church_body","1: Anabaptist","1: Rebaptism","1: Protestants","1: Messiah","1: Means_of_grace","1: Irresistible_grace#Lutheran","1: Irresistible_grace","1: Prevenient_grace","1: Latter_Day_Saint_movement","1: Joseph_Smith,_Jr.","1: Original_sin","1: Mormonism","1: Resurrection_of_Jesus","1: Bapistry","1: Latter_Day_Saint","1: Gift_of_the_Holy_Ghost","1: Laying_on_of_hands","1: Five_Pillars_of_Islam","1: Islam","1: Allah","1: Arabic_language","1: Prophets_of_Islam","1: Muhammad","1: Shahada","1: Apostasy_in_Islam","1: Hadith","1: Quran","1: Shafi`i","1: Hanbali","1: Fard","1: Maliki","1: Hanafi","1: Aqidah","1: Proselytization","1: Hinduism_Today","1: Southeast_Asia","1: Ahom_people","1: Hunas","1: Sanskritization","1: Hindu_revivalist","1: Arya_Samaj","1: Saiva_Siddhanta_Church","1: BAPS","1: International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness","1: Sikhism","1: Jainism","1: Shinto","1: Taoism","1: Confucianism","1: Chinese_traditional_religion","1: Timeline_of_Buddhism","1: Burma","1: Anoratha","1: Theravada","1: Jayavarman_VII","1: Khmer_people","1: Dalit_Buddhist_movement","1: Dalit_Buddhist_movement#Organized_mass_conversions","1: Tenzin_Gyatso,_14th_Dalai_Lama","1: E-meter","1: New_religious_movements","1: Brainwashing","1: Mind_control","1: Unification_Church","1: Young_Oon_Kim","1: California","1: Hartford_Seminary","1: Prentice-Hall","1: Church_of_Scientology","1: Foster_Report","1: Tom_Cruise","1: Waiver","1: United_States","1: Netherlands","1: Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient","1: New_Age","1: Vrije_Universiteit","1: Yazidi","1: Druze","1: Mandaeans","1: Zoroastrianism","1: Chinese_folk_religion","1: Shakers","1: United_Nations","1: Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","1: Human_rights","1: International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights","1: Cleveland_State_University","1: Union_of_American_Hebrew_Congregations","1: Jews_for_Jesus","1: Hebrew_Christians","1: Campus_Crusade_for_Christ","1: Hassidic","1: Reverend_Moon","1: Soviet_Union","1: Russian_Orthodox_Church","1: Roman_Catholic_Church","1: Salvation_Army","1: Greece","1: Pentecostalism","1: Ioannis_Metaxas","1: Minos_Kokkinakis","1: European_Court_of_Human_Rights","1: Saudi_Arabia","1: Afghanistan","1: Pakistan","1: Egypt","1: Iran","1: Maldives","1: Moral_conversion","1: List_of_converts_to_Christianity","1: List_of_converts_to_Hinduism","1: List_of_converts_to_Islam","1: List_of_converts_to_Judaism","1: List_of_converts_to_Buddhism","1: Love_Jihad","1: Inquisition","1: Islamic_Missionary_Activity","1: Rite_of_Christian_Initiation_for_Adults","1: Safavid_conversion_of_Iran_from_Sunnism_to_Shiism","1: Conversion_to_Islam_in_U.S._prisons","1: Eileen_Barker"]}
