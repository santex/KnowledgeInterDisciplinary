See algebra (ring theory) and algebra over a field.\n* With a qualifier, there is the same distinction: ** Without article, it means\n  a part of algebra, like linear algebra, elementary algebra (the symbol-\n  manipulation rules taught in elementary courses of mathematics as part of\n  primary and secondary education), or abstract algebra (the study of the\n  algebraic structures for themselves). ** With an article, it means an instance\n  of some abstract structure, like a Lie algebra or an associative algebra. **\n  Frequently both meanings exist for the same qualifier, like in the sentence:\n  [[Commutative algebra]] is the study of [[commutative ring]]s, that all are\n  [[algebra (ring theory)|commutative algebra]]s over the integers.\n* Sometimes \"algebra\" is also used to denote the operations and methods related\n  to algebra in the study of a structure that does not belong to algebra. For\n  example algebra of [[infinite series]] may denotes the methods for computing\n  with series without using the notions of infinite summation, limits and\n  convergence. <!-- The following paragraph is misplaced here. I have kept in\n  comment, because \"fundamental theorem of algebra\" should be\n* Use of letters and symbols to represent values and their relations, especially\n  for solving equations. This is also called \"elementary algebra\". Historically,\n  this was the meaning in pure mathematics too, like seen in \"fundamental\n  theorem of algebra\", but not now.-->\n\nThe adjective \"'algebraic'\" usually means relation to algebra, as in \"algebraic\nstructure\". For historical reasons, it may also mean relation with the roots of\npolynomial equations, like in algebraic number, algebraic extension or algebraic\nexpression.\n",
