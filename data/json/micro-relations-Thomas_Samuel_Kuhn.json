Competing paradigms are frequently\nincommensurable; that is, they are competing accounts of reality which cannot be\ncoherently reconciled. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely on full\n\"objectivity\"; we must account for subjective perspectives as well.\n","recorded":1362124745,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"450","instances":["philosophy_of_science","philosophy_of_science","sociologist","book","science","international_relations","literature","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Kuhn-Objectivity-Value-Judgment-and-Theory-Choice.pdf","http://www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/TAD%20WEB%20ARCHIVE/TAD33-2/TAD33-2-fnl-pg8-24-pdf.pdf","http://www.filosofia.ufpr.br/var/1335457841TOZZINI,_Daniel_-_Objetividade_e_Racionalidade_na_Filosofia_da_Ci%C3%AAncia_de_Thomas_Kuhn._2011.pdf"],"categories":["Historians of science","Philosophers of science","American historians","American philosophers","American scientists","American Jews","Postmodernism","20th-century philosophers","Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty","Princeton University faculty","University of California, Berkeley faculty","Harvard University faculty","Harvard University alumni","People from Cincinnati, Ohio","American Jews","Jewish historians","Jewish philosophers","Deaths from lung cancer","1922 births","1996 deaths","Members of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts"],"headings":["Life","''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''","Polanyi–Kuhn debate","Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award","Honors","Bibliography","References","External links"],"tags":[["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["steve_fuller","sociologist"],["the_copernican_revolution","book"],["commensurability","philosophy_of_science"],["construct","philosophy_of_science"],["nature","philosophy"],["objectivity","philosophy"],["naturalism","philosophy"],["positivism","international_relations"],["objectivity","science"],["naturalism","literature"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Kuhn.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/Thomas_Kuhn.jpg/260px-Thomas_Kuhn.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Western_Philosophy","20th-century_philosophy","Cincinnati","Ohio","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Analytic_philosophy","Philosophy_of_science","Paradigm_shift","Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science)","Normal_science","Immanuel_Kant","Alexandre_Koyré","Michael_Polanyi","John_Hasbrouck_Van_Vleck","Gaston_Bachelard","Jean_Piaget","Bertrand_Russell","Karl_Popper","Philosophy_of_science","Paul_Feyerabend","Imre_Lakatos","Philosophy","Richard_Rorty","United_States","Physics","History_of_science","Philosophy_of_science","Paradigm_shift","Scientific_knowledge","Paradigm_shift","Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge","Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science)","Cincinnati,_Ohio","Bachelor_of_Science","Physics","Harvard_University","Master_of_Science","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Harvard_Junior_Fellow","James_Bryant_Conant","University_of_California,_Berkeley","History_of_science","Niels_Bohr","Princeton_University","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Laurance_Rockefeller","Lung_cancer","Logical_positivism","Vienna_Circle","Paradigm_shift","Normal_science","Karl_Popper","Falsifiability","Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science)","David_Stove","Irrational","Relativism","Relativism","Freeman_Dyson","Relativism","Paradigm","Linguistics","Georg_Lichtenberg","Normal_science","Paradigm_shift","Renaissance","Post-positivist","Positivist","International_Relations","Robert_K._Merton","Sociology_of_Scientific_Knowledge","Occam's_razor","Michael_Polanyi","Epistemology","American_Chemical_Society","Guggenheim_Fellowship","George_Sarton_Medal","History_of_Science_Society","Alexander_Bird","Steve_Fuller_(sociologist)","Sal_Restivo","Errol_Morris","Cincinnati","Ohio","Cambridge,_Massachusetts"],"members":["commensurability","construct","steve_fuller","the_copernican_revolution","objectivity","positivism","naturalism","nature"],"book":[]}
