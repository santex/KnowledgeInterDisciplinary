It is a cyclic ether. This means that it is composed of two alkyl\ngroups attached to an oxygen atom in a cyclic shape (circular). This colorless\nflammable gas with a faintly sweet odor is the simplest epoxide, a three-\nmembered ring consisting of two carbon and one oxygen atom. Because of its\nspecial molecular structure, ethylene oxide easily participates in the addition\nreaction, opening its cycle, and thus easily polymerizes. Ethylene oxide is\nisomeric with acetaldehyde.\n\nAlthough it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the\nmanufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol that are\noften more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide\nitself is a very hazardous substance: at room temperature it is a flammable,\ncarcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas with a misleadingly\npleasant aroma.\n\nThe chemical reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide's hazards\nhas also made it a key industrial chemical. Although too dangerous for direct\nhousehold use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used\nindustrially for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals\nand intermediates. Ethylene oxide is important or critical to the production of\ndetergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such\nas ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers\nand other compounds. As a poison gas that leaves no residue on items it\ncontacts, pure ethylene oxide is a disinfectant that is widely used in hospitals\nand the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-\nsensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes.\n\nEthylene oxide is industrially produced by direct oxidation of ethylene in the\npresence of silver catalyst. It is extremely flammable and explosive and is used\nas a main component of thermobaric weapons;\ntherefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid.
