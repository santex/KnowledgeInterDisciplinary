(T-symmetry).\n\nIn quantum mechanical systems, it turns out that the weak nuclear force is not\ninvariant under T-symmetry alone. If weak interactions are present, reversible\ndynamics are still possible, but only if the operator Ï also reverses the signs\nof all the charges, and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates (C-symmetry and\nP-symmetry).\n\nStochastic processes A stochastic process is reversible if the statistical\nproperties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-\nreversed data from the same process. More formally, for all sets of time\nincrements { Ï s }, where s = 1..k for any k, the joint probabilities\n\n: p(x_t, x_{t+\\tau_{1}}, x_{t+\\tau_{2}} .. x_{t+\\tau_{k}}) = p(x_{t'}, x_{t'-\n:\\tau_{1}},\nx_{t'-\\tau_{2}} .. x_{t'-\\tau_{k}})\n\nA simple consequence for Markov processes is that they can only be reversible if\ntheir stationary distributions have the property\n: p(x_t=i,x_{t+1}=j) = \\,p(x_t=j,x_{t+1}=i)\nThis is called the property of detailed balance.\n\nSee also\n* Reversible cellular automaton\n* Reversible computing\n* Reversible process\n* Time reversibility\n","linknr":143,"url":"Reversible_dynamics","recorded":1362537840,"links":21,"instances":["physics","physics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical mechanics","Dynamical systems","Stochastic processes","Symmetry"],"headings":["Mathematics","Physics","Stochastic processes","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/9/5993f00c9897ab1c2e67d778dffbddc5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/b/11b7dfb5859ed7b98bfe4fa6abd0466b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/c/f/7cffd0d6be1a9623f2490d521321d7ba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Lebesgue_Icon.svg/30px-Lebesgue_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Bellcurve.svg/30px-Bellcurve.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["involution","mathematics"],["critical_point","mathematics"],["charge","physics"],["parity","physics"]],"members":["parity","charge","involution","critical_point"],"related":["Mathematics","Dynamical_system","Invertible","Involution_(mathematics)","Critical_point_(mathematics)","Attractor","Physics","Laws_of_motion","Classical_mechanics","Conjugate_momentum","T-symmetry","Quantum_mechanics","Weak_nuclear_force","Charge_(physics)","Parity_(physics)","C-symmetry","P-symmetry","Stochastic","Stochastic_process","Markov_process","Detailed_balance","Reversible_cellular_automaton","Reversible_computing","Reversible_process","Time_reversibility"]}
