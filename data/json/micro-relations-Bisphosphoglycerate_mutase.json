It is responsible for the\ncatalytic synthesis of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) from 1,3-\nbisphosphoglycerate. BPGM also has a mutase and a phosphatase function, but\nthese are much less active, in contrast to its glycolitic cousin,\nphosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), which favors these two functions, but can also\ncatalyze the synthesis of 2,3-BPG to a lesser extent.\n","linknr":397,"url":"Bisphosphoglycerate_mutase","recorded":1362569015,"links":22,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes"],"headings":["Tissue distribution","Function","Structure","Mechanism of catalysis","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Whole_Enzyme.png/220px-Whole_Enzyme.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Labeled_Active_Site.png/258px-Labeled_Active_Site.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Coordination_in_Active_site.png/261px-Coordination_in_Active_site.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Mechanism_of_1-3BPG_to_2-3BPG.png/300px-Mechanism_of_1-3BPG_to_2-3BPG.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate"],"related":["Erythrocytes","Placental","2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate","1,3-bisphosphoglycerate","Mutase","Phosphatase","Phosphoglycerate_mutase","Biosynthesis","Erythrocytes","Placental","Glycolysis","Hemoglobin","Glycolysis","Oxygen","Proximity","Protein_dimerization","Histidine","Arginine","Lysine","Cystine","Tryptophan","Asparagine","Glutamate","Active_site","Conformational_change","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Hydrogen_bonding","Nucleophile"]}
