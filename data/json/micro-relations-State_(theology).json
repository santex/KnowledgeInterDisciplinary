States are classified in the Catholic Church as the\nclerical state, the religious state, and the secular state; and among\nreligious states, again, we have those of the contemplative, the active, and\nthe mixed orders.\n\nThe word is also used in the classification of the degrees or stages of\nChristian perfection, or the advancement of souls in the supernatural life of\ngrace during their sojourn in the world. This has reference to the practice of\nall the virtues, both theological virtues and moral virtues, and to all their\nacts both external and internal. It includes two elements, namely a believer's\nown efforts and the grace of God assisting the believer.\n","linknr":132,"url":"State_(theology)","recorded":1362477383,"links":11,"instances":["theology","apostle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Catholic theology and doctrine"],"headings":["Division of states","States of consolation and desolation","Directions","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saint_paul","apostle"],["justification","theology"]],"members":["justification","saint_paul"],"related":["Saint_Paul_(apostle)","Clerical_state","Religious_state","Secular_state","Virtue","Theological_virtue","Moral_virtue","Purgative_way","Illuminative_way","Unitive_way","Miguel_de_Molinos","Quietist","Justification_(theology)","Humility","St._John_of_the_Cross","Luis_de_Lapuente","Blosius","Consolation","Desolation","Alphonsus_Maria_de_Liguori","Francisco_Su√°rez","St._John_of_the_Cross","St._Theresa","St._Ignatius_Loyola"]}
