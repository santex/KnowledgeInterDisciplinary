      "In physics, terahertz radiation, also called submillimeter radiation, terahertz waves, terahertz light, T-rays, T-waves, T-light, T-lux, or THz, consists of electromagnetic waves at frequencies in the terahertz range, from 0.3 to 3&nbsp;THz.  The term applies to electromagnetic radiation with frequencies between the high-frequency edge of the millimeter wave band, 300&nbsp;gigahertz, and the low frequency edge of the far-infrared light band, 3000&nbsp;GHz.",

The decreasing transmission with increasing frequency, indicates\n greater absorption]] In physics, 'terahertz radiation', also called\n 'submillimeter radiation', 'terahertz waves', 'terahertz light', 'T-rays', 'T-\n waves', 'T-light', 'T-lux', or 'THz', consists of electromagnetic waves at\n frequencies from 0.3 to 3&nbsp;terahertz (THz). The term applies to\n electromagnetic radiation with frequencies between the high-frequency edge of\n the millimeter wave band, 300&nbsp;gigahertz (3×10<sup>11</sup> Hz), and the\n low frequency edge of the far-infrared light band, 3000&nbsp;GHz\n (3×10<sup>12</sup> Hz). Corresponding wavelengths of radiation in this band\n range from 1&nbsp;mm to 0.1&nbsp;mm (or 100&nbsp;μm)\n\nBecause terahertz radiation begins at a wavelength of one millimeter and\nproceeds into shorter wavelengths, it is sometimes known as the submillimeter\nband, and its radiation as submillimeter waves, especially in astronomy.\n\nTerahertz radiation occupies a middle ground between microwaves and infrared\nlight waves, and technology for generating and manipulating it is in its\ninfancy, and is a subject of active research. It represents the region in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum that the frequency of electromagnetic radiation becomes\ntoo high to be measured by directly counting cycles using electronic counters,\nand must be measured by the proxy properties of wavelength and energy.<!--There\nis a Feynman quote for this, if it is needed--> Similarly, in this frequency\nrange the generation and modulation of coherent electromagnetic signals ceases\nto be possible by the conventional electronic devices used to generate radio\nwaves and microwaves, and requires new devices and techniques.\n",
