Salts and esters of\nbutyric acid are known as 'butyrates' or 'butanoates'. Butyric acid is found in\nmilk, especially goat, sheep and buffalo's milk, butter, Parmesan cheese, and\nas a product of anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon and as body\nodor). It has an unpleasant smell and acrid taste, with a sweetish aftertaste\n(similar to ether). It can be detected by mammals with good scent detection\nabilities (such as dogs) at 10 ppb, whereas humans can detect it in\nconcentrations above 10 ppm.\n\nButyric acid was first observed (in impure form) in 1814 by the French\nchemist Michel EugÃ¨ne Chevreul. By 1818, he had purified it sufficiently to\ncharacterize it. Unfortunately, Chevreul did not publish his early\nresearch on butyric acid; instead, he deposited his findings in manuscript\nform with the secretary of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, France. This\nled to problems because Henri Braconnot, a French chemist, was also\nresearching the composition of butter and was publishing his findings, and\nthis led to disputes about priority. As early as 1815, Chevreul claimed\nthat he had found the susbstance that's responsible for the smell of\nbutter: Chevreul (1815)\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=tZU5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\"Lettre de M. Chevreul Ã  MM. les rÃ©dacteurs des Annales de chimie\"] (Letter\nfrom Mr. Chevreul to the editors of the Annals of Chemistry), Annales de\nchimie, vol. 94, pages 73-79; in a footnote spanning pages 75-76, he\nmentions that he had found a substance that is responsible for the smell of\nbutter. By 1817, he published some of his findings regarding the properties\nof butyric acid: Chevreul (1817)\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=y1E3AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\"Extrait d'une lettre de M.

However, it was not until 1823 that he presented the\nproperties of butyric acid in detail: E. Chevreul, Recherches chimiques sur\nles corps gras d'origine animale [Chemical researches on fatty substances\nof animal origin] (Paris, France: F.G. Levrault, 1823), [http://books.goog-\nle.com/books?id=r46rnl27h70C&pg=PA115#v=onepage&q&f=false pages 115-\n133]. The name of butyric acid comes from the Latin word for butter,\nbutyrum (or buturum), the substance in which butyric acid was first found.\n","linknr":519,"url":"Butyric_acid","recorded":1362903379,"links":64,"instances":["anatomy","chemistry","plant","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://ps.fass.org/cgi/reprint/84/12/1851.pdf","http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0022-0302/PIIS002203029178510X.pdf","http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0022-0302/PIIS002203029178510X.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/279/35/36680.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/279/35/36680.full.pdf"],"categories":["Flavors","Carboxylic acids","Fatty acids","Butyrates","Foul-smelling chemicals"],"headings":["Chemistry","Production","Uses","Biochemistry","Safety","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Butyric_acid_acsv.svg/120px-Butyric_acid_acsv.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Butyric_acid_flat_structure.png/120px-Butyric_acid_flat_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Butyric-acid-3D-balls.png/200px-Butyric-acid-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Hazard_X.svg/40px-Hazard_X.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Hazard_C.svg/40px-Hazard_C.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["colon","anatomy"],["heracleum","plant"]],"members":["colon","salt","heracleum","fermentation"],"related":["Poise","Butyrate","Carboxylic_acid","Propionic_acid","Acrylic_acid","Succinic_acid","Malic_acid","Tartaric_acid","Crotonic_acid","Fumaric_acid","Pentanoic_acid","1-butanol","Butyraldehyde","Methyl_butyrate","Greek_language","Carboxylic_acid","Carbon","Hydrogen","Carboxyl_group","Salt_(chemistry)","Ester","Milk","Goat","Sheep","American_Bison","Butter","Parmesan_cheese","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Colon_(anatomy)","Body_odor","Odor","Taste","Diethyl_ether","Mammal","Dog","Parts_per_billion","Human","Parts_per_million","Michel_Eugène_Chevreul","Henri_Braconnot","Fatty_acid","Esters","Glyceride","Hydrolysis","Unpleasant_odor","Short-chain_fatty_acid","Water","Ethanol","Ether","Calcium_chloride","Carbon_dioxide","Acetic_acid","Potassium_dichromate","Sulfuric_acid","Potassium_permanganate","Structural_isomer","Isobutyric_acid","Sugar","Starch","Cheese","Calcium_carbonate","Butyrate","Ester","Hexyl_butyrate","Heracleum_(plant)","Octyl_butyrate","Parsnip","Skin_flora","Methyl_butyrate","Common_carp","Tench","Bitterling","Sea_Shepherd_Conservation_Society","Sea_Shepherd","Obligate_anaerobe","Anaerobic_organism","Bacteria","Kombucha","Louis_Pasteur","Species","Glycolysis","Glucose","Molecule","Pyruvate","Oxidation","Acetyl_coenzyme_A","Enzyme","Pyruvate-ferredoxin_oxidoreductase","Carbon_dioxide","Hydrogen","Acetoacetyl_coenzyme_A","Acetyl-CoA-acetyl_transferase","Β-hydroxybutyryl_CoA","Β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA_dehydrogenase","Crotonyl_CoA","Crotonase","Butyryl_CoA","Butyryl_CoA_dehydrogenase","Phosphate","Butyryl_phosphate","Phosphobutyrylase","Adenosine_diphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Butyrate","Butyrate_kinase","Acetone","N-Butanol","PH","Butanal","Resistant_starch","Oat_bran","Pectin","Guar","Gut_flora","Short-chain_fatty_acid","Cellulose","Dietary_fiber","Ruminant","Volatile_fatty_acids","HDAC_inhibitor","Histone_deacetylase","Histone","DNA","Electrostatic","Transcription_factors","Sodium_butyrate","Trichostatin_A","Animal_experimentation","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Indole-3-butyric_acid","Acids_in_wine","Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid"]}
