{"cursor":"3762","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'betaine' (BEET-uh-een, bÄ'tÉ-Än', -Ä­n) in chemistry is any neutral chemical\ncompound with a positively charged cationic functional group such as a\nquaternary ammonium or phosphonium cation (generally: onium ions) which bears no\nhydrogen atom and with a negatively charged functional group such as a\ncarboxylate group which may not be adjacent to the cationic site. A betaine thus\nmay be a specific type of zwitterion. Historically the term was reserved for\ntrimethylglycine only. It is used as a medicine as well.\n\nThe correct pronunciation of the compound reflects its origin and first\nisolation from sugar beets, and does not derive from the Greek letter beta (Î²).\nHowever, it is often mispronounced beta-INE or even BEE-tayn.

ISBN 008034481X , ISBN 978-\n0080344812\n\nIn biological systems, many naturally occurring betaines serve as organic\nosmolytes, substances synthesised or taken up from the environment by cells for\nprotection against osmotic stress, drought, high salinity or high temperature.\nIntracellular accumulation of betaines, non-perturbing to enzyme function,\nprotein structure and membrane integrity, permits water retention in cells, thus\nprotecting from the effects of dehydration. It is also a methyl donor of\nincreasingly recognised significance in biology.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Betaine","recorded":1362512102,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quaternary ammonium compounds","Chemical nomenclature"],"headings":["Glycine betaine, the original betaine","Commercial uses","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Betaine_Formula_V.1.svg/220px-Betaine_Formula_V.1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_compound","Cation","Functional_group","Quaternary_ammonium_cation","Phosphonium","Onium_compounds","Carboxylate","Zwitterion","Osmolyte","Osmosis","Methyl","Sugar_beet","Zwitterion","Wittig_reaction","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Ylide","Cocamidopropyl_betaine","Osmoprotectants"]}
