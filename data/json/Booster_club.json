{"cursor":"2271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'booster club' is an American organization that is formed to support (e.g.\ncoordinate events, contribute money, etc.) an associated club, sports team, or\norganization. Booster clubs are popular in American schools at the high school\nand university level. The clubs are generally run and organized by the parents\nof the students in the supported organization in high schools, and by athletic\nsupporters and fans at colleges. It is not a social club. Its main function is\nto develop support for the student program.\n\nFor example, fundraisers are often held to raise money for supplies or equipment\nthat the students may need or for trips that the students may need to take. The\nmain principle of funding by a U.S. IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit is that the booster\nclub may not discriminate in making grants to youth or college students on the\nbasis of their family's membership in or funding to the club, or the family's\nfund-raising or time put into club activities.\n\nA popular way for booster clubs to raise money is with raffles held at\nsporting events for some item that would be donated by a local business,\nclothing such as t-shirts with the school's name and mascot on it, or the sale\nof popcorn, hot dogs, and other food items to the fans who attend the\ngame/tournament/etc. Membership fees are also a key fundraising element,\nespecially at the college level.\n\nAt the high school level school administrators cannot be involved in the booster\nclub organization except approving activities held at the high school.\n\nAt the collegiate level, the NCAA closely regulates the activities of booster\nclubs and strictly defines what actions would cause a person to be considered an\nofficial booster of an athletic program. Many scandals have resulted from\nprohibited activities by boosters, particularly those providing monetary or in-\nkind incentives for prospective athletes to sign with a particular university.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Booster_club","recorded":1374525222,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Organization","/wiki/Club","/wiki/Sports","/wiki/Team","/wiki/Boosterism","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/University","/wiki/Fundraiser","/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29","/wiki/Raffle","/wiki/T-shirts","/wiki/Mascot","/wiki/Popcorn","/wiki/Hot_dog","/wiki/NCAA","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&oldid=555707476","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:College_sports_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Types_of_organization","/wiki/Category:High_school_sports_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Booster+club&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Booster+club","/wiki/Booster_club","/wiki/Talk:Booster_club","#","/wiki/Booster_club","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Booster_club","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Booster_club","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&oldid=555707476","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1238998","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Booster_club&id=555707476","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Booster+club","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Booster+club&oldid=555707476&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Booster_club&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rderverein","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1238998#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_club","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["College
