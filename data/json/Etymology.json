{"cursor":"18897","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n of the word \"mother\", by Hendrik Willem van Loon.]]\n\n'Etymology' is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their\nform and meaning have changed over time. By an extension, the term \"etymology\n(of a word)\" means the origin of a particular word.\n\nFor languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts in\nthese languages and texts about the languages to gather knowledge about how\nwords were used during earlier periods of their history and when they entered\nthe languages in question. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative\nlinguistics to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any\ndirect information to be available.\n\nBy analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method,\nlinguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its\nvocabulary. In this way, word roots have been found that can be traced all the\nway back to the origin of, for instance, the Indo-European language family.\n\nEven though etymological research originally grew from the philological\ntradition, currently much etymological research is done on language families\nwhere little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and\nAustronesian.\n","linknr":445,"url":"Etymology","recorded":1362480716,"links":103,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","philologist","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","lexicographer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Etymology|"],"headings":["Etymology","Methods","Types of word origins","English language","History","See also","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/The_story_of_a_word.jpg/350px-The_story_of_a_word.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/ParseTree.svg/28px-ParseTree.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meaning","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["compound","linguistics"],["stephen_skinner","lexicographer"],["william_jones","philologist"],["bongo-bongo","linguistics"]],"members":["derivation","william_jones","compound","root","meaning","stephen_skinner"],"related":["Mother","Hendrik_Willem_van_Loon","History","Word","Meaning_(linguistics)","Comparative_linguistics","Comparative_method","Root_(linguistics)","Indo-European_languages","Language_family","Philology","Language_family","Uralic_languages","Austronesian_languages","Philology","Dialectology","Comparative_method","Semantic_change","Loanwords","Word_formation","Derivation_(linguistics)","Compound_(linguistics)","Onomatopoeia","Sound_symbolism","Sound_change","Causative","Semantic_change","Old_English","West_Germanic","English_language","German_language","Pronoun","Historical_linguistics","Noun_case","French_language","Germanic_languages","Normans","Norman_Conquest","Norman_language","Anglo-Norman","Anglo-Norman_language","Langue_d'oïl","Folklore","Latin","Greek_language","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","Italian_language","Scandinavian_languages","Finnish_language","Arabic_language","Hebrew_language","Russian_language","Sanskrit","Japanese_language","Standard_Cantonese","Malay_language","Tagalog_language","Welsh_language","Scottish_Gaelic","Irish_language","Scots_language","Northern_English","Loanword","Classical_antiquity","Pindar","Thomas_Browne","Greeks","Poet","Pindar","Creativity","Plutarch","Sounds","Isidore_of_Seville","Grammatical","Encyclopedia","Constantinople","Byzantine","Excursus","Sanskrit","History_of_India","Historical_linguistics","Yaska","Katyayana","Patanjali","Sakatayana","Vedas","Vyakarana","Indo-Aryans","Socratic_dialogue","Plato","Socrates","Ode","Pindar","Plutarch","Isidore_of_Seville","Jacob_de_Voragine","Age_of_Enlightenment","Marcus_Zuerius_van_Boxhorn","Vossius","Stephen_Skinner_(lexicographer)","Elisha_Coles","William_Wotton","Grammar","Lexicon","János_Sajnovics","Sami_languages","Hungarian_language","Finno-Ugric_languages","Samuel_Gyarmathi","Historical_linguistics","William_Jones_(philologist)","Philology","India","Sanskrit","Ancient_Greek","Latin","Indo-European_linguistics","Germanic_philology","Rasmus_Christian_Rask","Brothers_Grimm","Neogrammarian","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Jacques_Derrida","Metaphysics","Back-formation","Bongo-Bongo_(linguistics)","Cognate","False_cognate","Epeolatry","Etymological_dictionary","Etymological_fallacy","False_etymology","Folk_etymology","Historical_linguistics","Proto-language","Lists_of_etymologies","Malapropism","Medieval_etymology","Neologism","Philology","Phono-semantic_matching","Semantic_change","Suppletion","Toponymy","Wörter_und_Sachen","Walter_William_Skeat","Walter_William_Skeat","Marko_Snoj","Anatoly_Liberman"]}
