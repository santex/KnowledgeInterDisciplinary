{"cursor":"5265","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Expediting' is a concept in purchasing and project management\nfor securing the quality and timely delivery of goods and components. [http://procurementguide.com.my/tag/field-\nexpediting The Procurement Expeditor â Itâs Roles And Responsibilities]\n\nThe procurement department or an external expeditor controls the progress of\nmanufacturing at the supplier concerning quality, packing, conformity with\nstandards and set timelines. Thus the expeditor makes sure that the required\ngoods arrive at the appointed date in the agreed quality at the agreed location.\n\nExpediting is especially needed in large scale projects, for example, when a\npower plant or a refinery is erected, because a delay caused by late delivery\nor inferior quality will get very expensive and could lead to unsatisfied\nclients, thus the loss of a project. To save these unnecessary costs and\nminimize potential risks, the supplier and customer may agree on the use of a\nthird party expediter. These are experts from companies specializing in this\nfield who keep track of the deadlines, supervise progress on site and check\nwhether the components are properly packed. [http://www.tuv.com/en/corpora-\nte/business_customers/materials_testing_and_inspection/supply_chain_services/e-\nxpediting_services/expediting_services.jsp Expediting for industrial projects.\nRetrieved on Sep. 18, 2012.] After inspection they notify the involved\nparties and banks about their findings; if everything is as agreed the bank\nwill initiate the transfer of the price of the goods to the supplier. In this\nway, the supplier secures his liquidity as he is paid immediately when the\ncomponents leave his factory (letter of credit) and the customer/bank knows\nthat the goods will be delivered correctly. Expediting is relevant for many\nindustries, such as the oil and gas industry, the general energy industry and\nthe infrastructure industry.\n\nExpediting exists in several levels:\n\n*production control: The expeditor inspects the factory whether the production\nis up to the standards of the country the goods are destined for. This is\nespecially necessary for food or engineering equipment like power plant\ncomponents. He or she controls as well whether the regular audits for ISO 9001\netc. have been made.\n\n*quality control: The components are tested whether they function as required\nand whether they are made to the measurements and standards of the customer. A\npart of this quality control can be the testing for compliance with standards of\nthe destination country, e.g. ASME.\n\n*packing/transport survey: This is the lowest and most used level of expediting,\nas the goods are only counted and the packing is controlled whether it will\nwithstand the adversities of transport (pre-shipment inspection).\n\n*project management: At a large-scale project, not only goods are controlled.\nThe expeditor also keeps an eye on the deadlines and milestones of the project\nand whether the supplier will be on time. This way he or she monitors the\ncrucial procurement parts of the project.\n\nAs the different levels of expediting require different skills, specialists and\nlaboratories, many third party expeditors specialize in only one or several of\nthese levels, while few offer expediting services on all levels.\n\nLarger companies normally have their own expeditors who can perform all four\nlevels. Third parties then are only used when in-house capacity is overstretched\nor a neutral third party is needed.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Expediting","recorded":1374548837,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Purchasing","/wiki/Project_management","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Project","/wiki/Power_plant","/wiki/Refinery","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Distributor_(business)","/wiki/Liquidity","/wiki/Letter_of_credit","/wiki/Energy","/wiki/Infrastructure","/w/index.php?title=Production_control&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/ISO_9001","/wiki/Quality_control","/wiki/ASME","/wiki/Packing","/wiki/Pre-shipment_inspection","/wiki/Management","#Field_expediting","#Desk_expediting","#References","#External_links","#Categories","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://procurementguide.com.my/tag/field-expediting","#cite_ref-2","http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/materials_testing_and_inspection/supply_chain_services/expediting_services/expediting_services.jsp","#cite_ref-3","http://www.velosi.com/services/21/3.php?selected_box=pro_qual_services","#cite_ref-4","http://www.velosi.com/services/21/2.php?selected_box=pro_qual_services","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit&section=4","http://www.tuev-hessen.de/eindeutig.tuv?dnr=195","http://www.ism.ws/pubs/proceedings/confproceedingsdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=11828","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit&section=5","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Expediting&oldid=558146256","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Procurement","/wiki/Category:Project_management","/wiki/Category:Production_and_manufacturing","/wiki/Category:Supply_chain_management","/wiki/Category:Quality_management","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_July_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Expediting&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Expediting","/wiki/Expediting","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Expediting&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Expediting","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Expediting","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Expediting","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&oldid=558146256","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1384274","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Expediting&id=558146256","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Expediting","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Expediting&oldid=558146256&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Expediting&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expediting","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1384274#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikip
