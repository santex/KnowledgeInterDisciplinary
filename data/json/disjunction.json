The logical connective that\nrepresents this operator is also known as \"or\", and typically written as\n<math>\\lor</math> or <math> +</math>. The \"or\" operator produces a result of\ntrue whenever one or more of its operands are true. For example, in this\ncontext, \"A or B\" is true if A is true, or if B is true, or if both A and B are\ntrue. In grammar, 'or' is a coordinating conjunction. An operand of a\ndisjunction is called a 'disjunct'.\n\nThe \"or\" operator differs from the exclusive or in that the latter returns false\nwhen both of its inputs are true, while \"or\" returns true. In ordinary language,\noutside of contexts such as formal logic, mathematics and programming, \"or\"\nsometimes has the meaning of \"exclusive or\". For example, \"Please ring me or\nsend an email\" likely means \"do one or the other, but not both\". On the other\nhand, \"Her grades are so good that she's either very bright or studies hard\"\nallows for the possibility that the person is both bright and works hard. In\nother words, in ordinary language \"or\" can mean inclusive or exclusive or.\nUsually the intended meaning is clear from the context.\n","title":"Logical disjunction","headings":["Notation","Definition","Properties","Symbol","Applications in computer science","Union","See also","Notes","External links","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Short-circuit_evaluation","2: Logical_value","1: Logic","1: Mathematics","1: Grammar","1: Grammatical_conjunction","1: Exclusive_or","1: Control_structure","1: Logical_operation","1: Proposition","1: Identity_element","1: Vacuous_truth","1: Arity","1: Bit","1: Sierpinski_triangle","1: Truth_table","1: Logical_biconditional","1: Bent_function","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Binary_addition","1: Programming_language","1: Bit_field","1: Sequence_point","1: Python_programming_language","1: JavaScript","1: Curryâ€“Howard_correspondence","1: Tagged_union","1: Set_theory","1: De_Morgan's_laws","1: Logical_conjunction","1: Logical_negation","1: Exclusive_disjunction","1: Affirming_a_disjunct","1: Bitwise_OR","1: Boolean_algebra_topics","1: Boolean_domain","1: Boolean_function","1: Boolean-valued_function","1: Disjunctive_syllogism","1: Disjunction_elimination","1: Disjunction_introduction","1: First-order_logic","1: FrÃ©chet_inequalities","1: Logical_graph","1: OR_gate","1: Propositional_calculus","1: George_Boole","1: William_Stanley_Jevons"]}
