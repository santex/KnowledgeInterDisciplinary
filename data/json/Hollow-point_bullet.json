JSP is a semi-jacketed round as the jacket does not extend to\n the tip.]]\n\nA 'hollow-point bullet' is an expanding bullet that has a pit or hollowed out\nshape in its tip, often intended to cause the bullet to expand upon entering a\ntarget in order to decrease penetration and disrupt more tissue as it travels\nthrough the target. It is also used for controlled penetration, where over-\npenetration could cause collateral damage (such as on an aircraft). In target\nshooting, they are used for greater accuracy and reduction of smoke, fouling,\nand lead vapour exposure, as hollow point bullets have an enclosed base while\ntraditional bullets have an exposed lead base. In essence, the hollow point\nbullet has several purposes: hollow points are designed to increase in diameter\nonce within the target, thus maximizing tissue damage and blood loss or shock,\nand to remain inside the target, thereby transferring all of its kinetic energy\nto that target (some fraction would remain in the bullet if it passed through\ninstead). 'Jacketed hollow points' ('JHPs') or 'plated hollow points' are\ncovered in a coating of harder metal (usually a copper alloy or copper coated\nsteel) to increase bullet strength and to prevent fouling the barrel with lead\nstripped from the bullet. The term 'hollow-cavity bullet' is used to describe a\nhollow point where the hollow is unusually large, sometimes dominating the\nvolume of the bullet, and causes extreme expansion or fragmentation on impact.
