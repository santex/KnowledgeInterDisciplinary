It is given to a feature-\nlength motion picture produced outside the United States of America with a\npredominantly non-English dialogue track. [http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/rules/rule14.html 80th\nAcademy Awards â Special Rules for the Best Foreign Language Film Award].\nAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Retrieved November 2, 2007.\n\nWhen the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929 to honor films\nreleased in 1927/28, there was no separate category for foreign language films.\nBetween 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best\nforeign language films released in the United States. These Awards, however,\nwere not handed out on a regular basis (no Award was given in 1953), and were\nnot competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per\nyear. For the 1956 (29th) Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit,\nknown as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English\nspeaking films, and has been given annually since then.\n\nUnlike other Academy Awards, the Best Foreign Language Film Award is not\npresented to a specific individual. It is accepted by the winning film's\ndirector, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Over\nthe years, the Best Foreign Language Film Award and its predecessors have been\ngiven almost exclusively to European films: out of the 65 Awards handed out by\nthe Academy since 1947 to foreign language films, fifty one have gone to\nEuropean films, Europe's tally includes 14 nominations and 4 wins for the\nU.S.S.R. and its successor states. It also includes 5 Special/Honorary Awards: 2\nwon by Italy, 2 won by France and 1 shared between them for [[The Walls of\nMalapaga]] (1949). The latter Award is counted only once in Europe's tally,\nwhereas it is included twice in the country-based table as it figures in both\nItaly's and France's tallies. five to Asian films, Number includes 3\nHonorary Awards for Japan. three to African films and three to films from\nthe Americas. Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign\nLanguage Film Academy Awardâwinning motion pictures during his lifetime, a\nrecord that remains unmatched as of 2007 (if Special Awards are taken into\naccount, then Fellini's record is tied by his fellow countryman Vittorio De\nSica). The most awarded foreign country is Italy, with 10 awards won, 3 Special\nAwards and 27 nominations, while Israel is the foreign country to have the most\nnominations, 10, without winning an award.\n","linknr":863,"url":"Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","recorded":1364238922,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/World_cinema","/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Michael_Haneke","/wiki/Amour_(2012_film)","/wiki/85th_Academy_Awards","http://www.oscars.org/","/wiki/Academy_Award","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Feature-length","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/1928_in_film","/wiki/20th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/28th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","/wiki/26th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/29th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/20th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/European_cinema","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Asian_cinema","#cite_note-3","/wiki/African_cinema","/wiki/Cinema_of_the_Americas","/wiki/Italians","/wiki/Federico_Fellini","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","/wiki/Vittorio_De_Sica","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","#History","#Eligibility","#Submission_and_nomination_process","#Recipient","#Criticisms_and_controversies","#Awards_by_nation","#See_also","#Notes_and_references","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1st_Academy_Awards","/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award","/wiki/Jean_Hersholt","/wiki/Italian_neorealism","/wiki/Shoeshine_(film)","/wiki/Military_history_of_Italy_during_World_War_II","/wiki/Bicycle_Thieves","/wiki/Monsieur_Vincent","/wiki/Forbidden_Games","/wiki/Rashomon_(film)","/wiki/Gate_of_Hell_(film)","/wiki/Samurai_I:_Musashi_Miyamoto","/wiki/International_co-production","/wiki/The_Walls_of_Malapaga","/wiki/26th_Academy_Awards","#cite_note-Levy-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/La_strada","/wiki/Federico_Fellini","#cite_note-Levy-4","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/Calendar_year","/wiki/80th_Academy_Awards","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Cinema_of_Israel","/wiki/The_Band%27s_Visit","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Le_Bal_(film)","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Cinema_of_the_Netherlands","/wiki/Bluebird_(2004_film)","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Lust,_Caution_(film)","/wiki/Cinema_of_Taiwan","/wiki/80th_Academy_Awards","#cite_note-11","/wiki/A_Place_in_the_World_(film)","/wiki/List_of_Uruguayan_films","/wiki/65th_Academy_Awards","/wiki/79th_Academy_Awards","#cite_note-Rule_Changes-12","/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/Cinema_of_Italy","/wiki/Private_(film)","/wiki/Arabic","/wiki/Hebrew","/wiki/List_of_languages_of_Italy","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Cinema_of_Canada","/wiki/Water_(2005_film)","/wiki/French-language","/wiki/Atanarjuat","/wiki/Inuktitut","/wiki/Languages_of_Canada#Aboriginal_languages","/wiki/Nunavut","/wiki/Northwest_Territories","/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Japanese-language","/wiki/Letters_from_Iwo_Jima","/wiki/Yucatec_Maya_language","/wiki/Apocalypto","/wiki/Letters_from_Iwo_Jima","/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","#cite_note-14","/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts","/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Film","#cite_note-BAFTA-15","/wiki/U.S._overseas_possessions","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Unincorporated_territory","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Jones-Shafroth_Act","/wiki/Lo_que_le_Pas%C3%B3_a_Santiago","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Category:Submissions_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film_Academy_Award","/wiki/Film_industry","/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)","/wiki/Secret_ballot","/wiki/Videocassette","#cite_note-Rules-1","/wiki/79th_Academy_Awards","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-Rule_Changes-12","/w/index.php?title=Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/List_of_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture","/wiki/Cinema_of_Canada","/wiki/The_Barbarian_
