      "text" : "\n\n\n) fertilizing the female gamete (ovum)]]\n\nOrganisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each\nknown as a 'sex'.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sex\nsex]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged\n11th Edition. Retrieved 3 December 2012.</ref> Sexual reproduction involves the\ncombining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes\ncombine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be\nidentical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an\nasymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes\n(heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy). By definition, male gametes are\nsmall, motile, and optimized to transport their genetic information over a\ndistance, while female gametes are large, non-motile and contain the nutrients\nnecessary for the early development of the young organism. Typically, males\ncarry XY chromosomes, whereas females carry XX chromosomes.\n\nThe gametes produced by an organism determine its sex: males produce male\ngametes (spermatozoa, or sperm, in animals; pollen in plants) while females\nproduce female gametes (ova, or egg cells); individual organisms which produce\nboth male and female gametes are termed hermaphroditic. Frequently, physical\ndifferences are associated with the different sexes of an organism; these sexual\ndimorphisms can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes\nexperience.\n",
