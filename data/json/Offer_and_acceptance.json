{"cursor":"19208","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Offer and acceptance' analysis is a traditional approach in contract law used\nto determine whether an agreement exists between two parties. Agreement consists\nof an offer by an indication of one person (the \"offeror\") to another (the\n\"offeree\") of the offeror's willingness to enter into a contract on certain\nterms without further negotiations. A contract is said to come into existence\nwhen acceptance of an offer (agreement to the terms in it) has been communicated\nto the offeror by the offeree and there has been consideration bargained-for\ninduced by promises or a promise and performance.\n\nThe offer and acceptance formula, developed in the 19th century, identifies a\nmoment of formation when the parties are of one mind. This classical approach to\ncontract formation has been weakened by developments in the law of estoppel,\nmisleading conduct, misrepresentation and unjust enrichment.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Offer_and_acceptance","recorded":1362375039,"links":19,"instances":["law","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Contract law","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["Offer","Acceptance","Formation","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["option","law"],["agent","law"],["company","law"]],"members":["agent","option","company"],"related":["Contract_law","Contract","Estoppel","Misrepresentation","Unjust_enrichment","Advertisement","Unilateral_contract","Bilateral_contract","High_Court_of_Australia","Conditional_gift","Consideration","Invitation_to_treat","Auction","Option_(law)","Option_contract","Meeting_of_the_minds","Agent_(law)","Mail","Fax","Option_contract","Company_(law)","Standard_form_contract","Alfred_Denning,_Baron_Denning","Lord_Justice_of_Appeal","Last_shot","Uniform_Commercial_Code","California","Implied_in_fact_contract","Last_shot","Harris_v_Nickerson","Chicago-Kent_College_of_Law"]}
