The town was given its name by the CPR in December 1884\nto honour American businessman Cyrus West Field, who was instrumental in\nestablishing trans-atlantic telegraph service.\n\nField is west of Lake Louise along the Trans-Canada Highway which provides the\nonly road access to the town.\n\nField hosts the Yoho National Park visitor centre; those wishing to visit the\nnearby area surrounding Lake O'Hara must either obtain tickets for a bus service\nmanaged by Yoho National Park or hike the dirt road on foot. Due to the extreme\npopularity of the Lake O'Hara region, bus reservations often sell out 3 months\nin advance.\n\nThere are many hiking opportunities near the town including:\n\n* Burgess Pass - one way, provides views of Emerald Lake and the Wapta\n  Icefields.\n* Emerald Lake - from Field on a paved road. A lakeshore trail circles the\n  entire lake.\n* Sherbrooke Lake - one way\n* Twin Falls - 9th highest waterfall in Canada\n* Wapta Falls - a short round trip trail to the waterfall that produces the\n  largest volume of water in Yoho NP.\n\nScrambling options include: Mount Burgess (), Mount Field (), Mount Stephen ()\nand Paget Peak ().\n\nThere are several points of interests nearby including:\n* Takakkaw Falls â second highest waterfall in Canada\n* Burgess shale â fossil beds (restricted access)\n* Natural Bridge â Kicking Horse River has carved a natural bridge through\n  solid rock.\n* Spiral Tunnels Exhibit â Explains railway tunnels bored through Mount Ogden\n  (lower Spiral Tunnel) and Cathedral Mountain (upper Spiral Tunnel).\n* Emerald Lake (British_Columbia) â largest lake in Yoho National Park\n","linknr":323,"url":"Field,_British_Columbia","recorded":1362535334,"links":20,"instances":["british_columbia","british_columbia","british_columbia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Yoho National Park","Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia","Canadian Pacific Railway stations in British Columbia","Columbia Country","Populated places in the Columbia-Shuswap Regional District"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Field%2C_British_Columbia_Location.png/300px-Field%2C_British_Columbia_Location.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/Field_BC_entrance.jpg/250px-Field_BC_entrance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Field-bc-from-burgess_IMG.JPG/250px-Field-bc-from-burgess_IMG.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Field_Canada_R01.jpg/250px-Field_Canada_R01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg/18px-Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/BC-relief.png/30px-BC-relief.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["emerald_lake","british_columbia"],["sherbrooke_lake","british_columbia"],["mount_field","british_columbia"],["emerald_lake","british_columbia"]],"members":["sherbrooke_lake","mount_field","emerald_lake"],"related":["Kicking_Horse_River","British_Columbia","Canada","Yoho_National_Park","Canadian_Pacific_Railway","Field_Hill","Big_Hill","Cyrus_West_Field","Telegraph","Lake_Louise,_Alberta","Trans-Canada_Highway","Yoho_National_Park","Lake_O'Hara","Hiking","Emerald_Lake_(British_Columbia)","Sherbrooke_Lake_(British_Columbia)","Waterfall","Scrambling","Mount_Burgess","Mount_Field_(British_Columbia)","Mount_Stephen","Paget_Peak","Takakkaw_Falls","Burgess_shale","Natural_arch","Kicking_Horse_River","Spiral_Tunnels","Emerald_Lake_(British_Columbia)","Yoho_National_Park"]}
