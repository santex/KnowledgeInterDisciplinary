While he achieved fame during his lifetime as an author, philosopher,\nalchemist and astronomer, composing a scientific treatise on the astrolabe for\nhis ten year-old son Lewis, Chaucer also maintained an active career in the\ncivil service as a bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. Among his many works,\nwhich include [[The Book of the Duchess]], the [[House of Fame]], the [[Legend\nof Good Women]] and [[Troilus and Criseyde]], he is best known today for [[The\nCanterbury Tales]]. Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of\nthe vernacular, Middle English, at a time when the dominant literary languages\nin England were French and Latin.\n","linknr":706,"url":"Geoffrey_Chaucer","recorded":1362374982,"links":119,"instances":["literature","literary_editor","de_roet","poetry","broadcaster","poet","crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geoffrey
