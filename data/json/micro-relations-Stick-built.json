{"cursor":"1177","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'stick-built home' is a wooden house constructed entirely or largely on-site;\nthat is, built on the site which it is intended to occupy upon its completion\nrather than in a factory or similar facility. This term is used to contrast\nsuch a dwelling with mobile homes and modular homes that are assembled in a\nfactory and transported to the site entirely or mostly complete and hence are\nnot \"stick-built\".\n\nStick built homes are also those homes which are built using a more traditional\nmethod of home building rather than a modular type. The \"sticks\" mentioned\nusually refer specifically to the superstructure of the walls and roof.\n\nMost stick built homes have many of the same things in common. They are usually\nbuilt with lumber, though it is possible to use metal poles for the construction\nas well. This is more expensive, more time-consuming and generally harder for\nthe homeowner to deal with once constructed. These homes also have many of the\ncommon features associated with most homes, such as shingles and drywall.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Stick-built","recorded":1362892443,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["House types"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Big_single-family_home_2.jpg/32px-Big_single-family_home_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Factory","Mobile_home","Modular_home","Drywall"]}
