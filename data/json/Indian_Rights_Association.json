{"cursor":"3120","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Indian Rights Association' ('IRA') was an American social activist group\ndedicated to the well being and acculturation of Native Americans. Founded in\nPhiladelphia in 1882, the Indian Rights Associations (IRA) was highly\ninfluential in American Indian policy through the 1930s and remained involved as\nan organization until 1994.\n\nThe organization's initial stated objective was to \"bring about the complete\ncivilization of the Indians and their admission to citizenship.\" 19th and 20th\nCentury groups such as the Indian Rights Association considered themselves the\n\"friends of the Indian\" but, by modern standards, had little understanding of\nthe cultural patterns and needs of Native Americans. Although the IRA and\nrelated groups were well intentioned and some of their activities were\nbeneficial, many policies they helped enact were destructive to Indian people in\nthe long term.\n\nIn 1884, the organization's founders, Herbert Welsh and Henry Spackman Pancoast,\nopened an additional office in Washington D.C. to act as a legislative lobby and\nliaison with the Board of Indian Commissioners and the Board of Indian Affairs.\nThe IRA also opened an early office in Boston, Massachusetts. The management of\nearly Indian Rights Association's programs fell almost entirely to five men, all\nof whom had lengthy careers with the IRA: Herbert Welsh, Matthew Sniffen, and\nLawrence E. Lindley, active in Philadelphia; and Charles C. Painter and Samuel\nM. Brosius, agents and lobbyists in Washington D.C.\n\nIn addition to efforts on policy development and congressional lobbying, the\nIndian Rights Association monitored the actions of Indian Bureau agents and\nobserved Native American living conditions and health care needs through\ncorrespondence and trips to reservations and settlements. They also sponsored\nspeaking tours for activists and Native American representatives as a means of\ninforming the public about native issues. The Unitarian minister and journalist\nJonathan Baxter Harrison was an especially influential observer, publishing\nseveral books and articles detailing his findings in the late 1880s.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Indian_Rights_Association","recorded":1374765372,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Herbert_Welsh","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Spackman_Pancoast&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Washington_D.C.","/wiki/Board_of_Indian_Commissioners","/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs","/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Herbert_Welsh","/w/index.php?title=Matthew_Sniffen&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_E._Lindley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Charles_C._Painter","/w/index.php?title=Samuel_M._Brosius&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Jonathan_Baxter_Harrison","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=edit&section=2","http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid1523ira.pdf","/wiki/Historical_Society_of_Pennsylvania","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&oldid=525025702","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1882_establishments_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Native_American_rights_organizations","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_1882","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indian+Rights+Association&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indian+Rights+Association","/wiki/Indian_Rights_Association","/wiki/Talk:Indian_Rights_Association","#","/wiki/Indian_Rights_Association","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Indian_Rights_Association","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Indian_Rights_Association","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&oldid=525025702","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6021407","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Indian_Rights_Association&id=525025702","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Indian+Rights+Association","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Indian+Rights+Association&oldid=525025702&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Indian_Rights_Association&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6021407#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rights_Association","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid1523ira.pdf"],"categories":["1882
