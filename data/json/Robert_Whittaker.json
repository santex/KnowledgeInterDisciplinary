He provided\nstrong empirical evidence against some ideas of vegetation development\nadvocated by Frederic Clements. Whittaker was most active in the areas of plant\ncommunity analysis, succession, and productivity. \"During his lifetime\nWhittaker was a major innovator of methodologies of community analysis and a\nleader in marshaling field data to document patterns in the composition,\nproductivity and diversity of land plant\ncommunities.\" [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00726879 Westman, W. E. & R. K.\nPeet (1982) Robert H. Whittaker (1920-1980): The Man and His Work. Vegetatio\n48: 98-122] Thus Whittaker was innovative in both empirical data sampling\ntechniques as well as synthesizing more holistic theories.\n\nHe was the first to propose the five-kingdom taxonomic classification of the\nworld's biota into the Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, and Monerain 1959. He\nalso proposed the Whittaker Biome Classification, which categorized biome-types\nupon two abiotic factors: temperature and precipitation.\n\nWhittaker was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1974, received the\nEcological Society of America's Eminent Ecologist Award in 1980, and was\notherwise widely recognized and honored. He collaborated with many other\necologists including George Woodwell (Dartmouth), W. A. Niering, F. H. Bormann\n(Yale) and G. E. Likens (Cornell), and was particularly active in cultivating\ninternational collaborations.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Robert_Whittaker","recorded":1362372769,"links":31,"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cornell University faculty","American ecologists","1920 births","1980 deaths","Ecological succession","People from Wichita, Kansas","Plant ecologists"],"headings":["Ph.D. Students","Family","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Whittaker-Robert-H-1920-1980.jpg/220px-Whittaker-Robert-H-1920-1980.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["community","ecology"]],"members":["community"],"related":["Wichita,_Kansas","U._S._A.","Ithaca,_New_York","U._S._A.","Ecology","Cornell_University","University_of_Illinois","Ecology","Five-kingdom_system","United_States","Plant","Ecologist","Wichita,_Kansas","Bachelor_of_Arts","Washburn_University","Topeka,_Kansas","Military_service","Ph.D.","University_of_Illinois","Washington_State_College","Radioactive_tracer","Ecosystem","Brooklyn_College","Cornell_University","Gradient_analysis","Community_ecology","Empirical_evidence","Frederic_Clements","Community_(ecology)","Ecological_succession","Primary_productivity","Five-kingdom","Taxonomy","Animalia","Plantae","Fungi","Protista","Monera","Biome","National_Academy_of_Science","Ecological_Society_of_America","Eminent_Ecologist_Award","University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill","Baylor_University","North_Carolina_State_University","Assumption_College","Oregon_State_University","Bennington_College","Anthropology","Grinnell_College","Wichita,_Kansas","U._S._A.","Ithaca,_New_York","U._S._A."]}
