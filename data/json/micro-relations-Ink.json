{"cursor":"19975","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]] 'Ink' is a liquid or paste that contains pigments or dyes and is used to\ncolor a surface to produce an image, text, or design. Ink is used for drawing or\nwriting with a pen, brush, or quill. Thicker inks, in paste form, are used\nextensively in letterpress and lithographic printing.\n\nInk can be a complex medium, composed of solvents, pigments, dyes, resins,\nlubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter, fluorescers, and\nother materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the inkâs carrier,\ncolorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its\nappearance when dry.\n","linknr":382,"url":"Ink","recorded":1362512356,"links":83,"instances":["color","color_theory","library_and_archival_science","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf"],"categories":["Inks|","Printing materials"],"headings":["Types","History","Health and environmental aspects","Writing and preservation","Production","Indelible ink","See also","References","Sources","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/F%C3%BCller-tinte_hg.jpg/220px-F%C3%BCller-tinte_hg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Tintenstrich-detail_2.jpg/220px-Tintenstrich-detail_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Ganesha_ink.jpg/250px-Ganesha_ink.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Inkstick.jpg/220px-Inkstick.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saturation","color_theory"],["lightness","color"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"],["preservation","library_and_archival_science"]],"members":["lightness","saturation","preservation","heavy_metal"],"related":["Liquid","Pigment","Dye","Color","Image","Writing","Design","Pen","Brush","Quill","Letterpress","Lithographic","Printing","Solvent","Resin","Lubricant","Solubilizer","Surfactant","Suspended_solids","Fluorescer","Dry","Gamut","Crystal","Micrometre","Hue","Saturation_(color_theory)","Lightness_(color)","Sizing","Inkjet_printer","Cellulose","Molecule","Optical_brightener","Electron","Delocalization","Check_washing","Fountain_pen","Fountain_pen_inks","South_India","Jain","Graphite","Ink_brush","Inkstick","Warring_States_Period","Soot","Animal_glue","India_ink","History_of_India","Kharosthi","Chinese_Turkestan","South_India","Buddhism","Jain","Ancient_Rome","Atramentum","Gall","Medieval","Europe","Parchment","Vellum","Fountain_pen","Al_Muizz","Caliph","Egypt","Printing_press","Johannes_Gutenberg","Iron_gall_ink","Turpentine","P-Anisidine","Volatile_organic_compound","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Vegetable_oil","Petroleum_oil","Sustainability","Soot","Animal_glue","Gum_arabic","Animal_glue","Iron_gall_ink","Johann_Sebastian_Bach","Relative_humidity","Brittle_Books_Program","India","Mexico","Indonesia","Electoral_stain","Electoral_fraud","Aceh","Mali","Blue_Wool_Scale","De-inked_pulp","Dokumental","Election_ink","Fountain_pen_inks","Gel_pen","Ink_eraser","Invisible_ink","Pharmaceutical_ink","Preservation_of_illuminated_manuscripts","Preservation_(library_and_archival_science)","Soy_ink","Squid_ink","Toner","Stark's_ink","Tattoo_ink","Ecofont","Puffball"]}
