ECyDâs purpose is to help adolescents form strong friendships with\nChrist and others, become authentically Christian youth, and build up Christâs\nkingdom on earth, starting in their homes, schools, and parishes. ECyD members\nmake commitments to say certain prayers, utilize the sacraments, receive\nspiritual mentoring (usually from Legionaries or consecrated members of Regnum\nChristi), do various apostolates, and participate in group activities, such as\nweekly meetings and retreats with other ECyD members to strengthen themselves\nspiritually. ECyD membership is open to youth ages 11 to 16 (to 18 in the USA\nand Canada) and has tens of thousands of members in 30 countries worldwide.\n","linknr":301,"url":"ECyD","recorded":1362569678,"links":19,"instances":["catholic_church"],"pdf":["http://www.challengeclubs.com/sites/default/files/nodes/107/Challenge%20and%20Conquest%20powered%20by%20ECYD%20Team%20Leaders%20and%20Parents.pdf","http://www.challengeclubs.com/sites/default/files/nodes/107/Challenge%20and%20Conquest%20powered%20by%20ECYD%20Team%20Leaders%20and%20Parents.pdf","http://www.conquestclubs.com/files/misc/CQ-CH-QuickStartGuide%2006-18-10.pdf","http://www.conquestclubs.com/files/misc/CQ-CH-QuickStartGuide%2006-18-10.pdf"],"categories":["Religious organizations established in 1971","Catholic youth organizations","Regnum Christi","Legion of Christ"],"headings":["Name","History","Spirituality","Stages","Programs","Government","Criticism","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/ECyD_Logo_2012.png/250px-ECyD_Logo_2012.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Mass_otyokwah.jpg/250px-Mass_otyokwah.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ea/River_Ridge_2007.jpg/250px-River_Ridge_2007.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["priest","catholic_church"]],"members":["priest"],"related":["Rome,_Italy","Catholic_Church","Álvaro_Corcuera","Regnum_Christi","Legionaries_of_Christ","Marcial_Maciel","Álvaro_Corcuera","Legionaries_of_Christ","Regnum_Christi","Priest_(Catholic_Church)","Eucharist","Ohio","Indiana","Legion_of_Christ","Regnum_Christi","Álvaro_Corcuera","Legionaries_of_Christ","Regnum_Christi","Controversies_surrounding_the_Legion_of_Christ"]}
