Sixteen plant families are\ncurrently recognized by botanists to be part of Poales.\n\nThe earliest fossils attributed to the Poales date to the late Cretaceous period\nabout 65.5 million years ago, though some studies (e.g., Bremer, 2002) suggest\nthe origin of the of the group may extend to nearly 115 million years ago,\nlikely in South America. The earliest known fossils include pollen and fruits.\nThe flowers are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in\ninflorescences (except in the genus [[Mayaca]], with solitary terminal flowers).\nThe flowers of many species are wind pollinated; the seeds usually contain\nstarch. The APG III system (2009) accepts the order and places it in a clade\ncalled commelinids, in the monocots. It uses this circumscription:\n* order Poales *: family Anarthriaceae *: family Bromeliaceae *: family\n  Centrolepidaceae *: family Cyperaceae *: family Ecdeiocoleaceae *: family\n  Eriocaulaceae *: family Flagellariaceae *: family Joinvilleaceae *: family\n  Juncaceae *: family Mayacaceae *: family Poaceae *: family Rapateaceae *:\n  family Restionaceae *: family Thurniaceae *: family Typhaceae *: family\n  Xyridaceae\n\nThe earlier APG system (1998) adopted the same placement, although it used the\nspelling \"commelinoids\", and used the following circumscription (i.e., it did\nnot include the plants in families Bromeliaceae and Mayacaceae in the order):\n* order Poales *: family Anarthriaceae *: family Centrolepidaceae *: family\n  Cyperaceae *: family Ecdeiocoleaceae *: family Eriocaulaceae *: family\n  Flagellariaceae *: family Hydatellaceae (now transferred out of the monocots;\n  recently discovered to be an 'early-diverging' lineage of flowering plants.)\n  *: family Joinvilleaceae *: family Juncaceae *: family Poaceae *: family\n  Prioniaceae *: family Restionaceae *: family Sparganiaceae (now included in\n  family Typhaceae) *: family Thurniaceae *: family Typhaceae *: family\n  Xyridaceae\n\nThe morphology-based Cronquist system did not include an order named Poales,\nassigning these families to the orders Bromeliales, Cyperales, Hydatellales,\nJuncales, Restionales and Typhales. '' from family Poaceae]]\n\nIn early systems, an order including the grass family did not go by the name\nPoales but by a descriptive botanical name such as Graminales in the Engler\nsystem (update of 1964) and in the Hutchinson system (first edition, first\nvolume, 1926), Glumiflorae in the Wettstein system (last revised 1935) or\nGlumaceae in the Bentham & Hooker system (third volume, 1883).
