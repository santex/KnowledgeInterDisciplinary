{"cursor":"20864","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n radio set with vintage headphones.]]\n\n\nThe 'regenerative circuit' (or 'self-regenerative circuit') or \"autodyne\" allows\nan electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other\nactive component such as a field effect transistor. It consists of an amplifying\nvacuum tube or transistor with its output connected to its input through a\nfeedback loop, providing positive feedback. This circuit was widely used in\nradio receivers, called 'regenerative receivers', between 1920 and World War II.\nThe regenerative receiver was invented and patented in 1914 by American\nelectrical engineer Edwin Armstrong when he was an undergraduate at Columbia\nUniversity. Regenerative receiver circuits are still used in low-cost electronic\nequipment such as garage door openers.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Regenerative_circuit","recorded":1362670990,"links":25,"instances":["unit","signal_processing","radio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radio electronics","Electronic circuits","History of radio"],"headings":["How it works","Advantages and disadvantages","History","Operating limits","Super-regenerative receiver","Patents","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Regenerartive_Receiver-S7300059.JPG/250px-Regenerartive_Receiver-S7300059.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Regenerartive_Receiver-S7300056.JPG/250px-Regenerartive_Receiver-S7300056.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Regenerative_Receiver.png/246px-Regenerative_Receiver.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/f/3/cf36c4680179bc8854670d5cdabebfd8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/4/46402936535e425ff39f1bbacb80db7b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/e/8/be880c616dc33431a818a9e596954a62.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/a/3/ba3ad97f635fb24ba1fb8dcb7855a8bd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/9/d/29dfb59f8dd8c32fac4c38ceb80e8bbe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["detector","radio"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["watt","unit"]],"members":["watt","bandwidth","detector"],"related":["Autodyne","Vacuum_tube","Electrical_element","Field_effect_transistor","Feedback_loop","Positive_feedback","Radio_receiver","World_War_II","Edwin_Armstrong","Columbia_University","Garage_door_opener","Radio_frequency","Oscillator","Frequency_mixer","Feedback_loop","Tuned_circuit","Resonant_frequency","Loop_gain","Detector_(radio)","Rectifier","Audio_signal","Modulation","Amplitude_modulation","Oscillation","Gain","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Q_factor","Electronic_selectivity","Continuous_wave","Radiotelegraphy","Morse_code","Electronic_oscillator","Beat_frequency_oscillator","Sine_wave","Beat_frequency","Audio_frequency","Carrier_wave","Single-sideband_modulation","Gain","Vacuum_tube","Radio_frequency","Tuned_radio_frequency_receiver","Superheterodyne","Transistor","Bipolar_transistor","Field_effect_transistor","Digital_radio","Garage_door_opener","Keyless_entry","RFID","Cell_phone","Watt_(unit)","RFI","Semiconductor","Preamp","Chaos_theory","Edwin_Howard_Armstrong","Autodyne","FM_broadcasting","Edwin_Armstrong","Superheterodyne","Lee_De_Forest","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Vacuum_tube","Secondary_surveillance_radar","Proximity_fuse","Superheterodyne","Volksempf√§nger","Tuned_radio_frequency_receiver","Short_wave","Low-pass_filter","Nyquist_theorem","Heterodyne","Tuned_electrical_circuit","Josiah_Alexander_Van_Orsdel","Institute_of_Radio_Engineers"]}
