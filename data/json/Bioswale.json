They consist of a drainage course with gently sloped sides\n(less than six percent) and filled with vegetation, compost and/or riprap. Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. Document no.\nERDC/CERL TR-03-12. The water's flow path, along with the wide and shallow\nditch, is designed to maximize the time water spends in the swale, which aids\nthe trapping of pollutants and silt. Depending upon the geometry of land\navailable, a bioswale may have a meandering or almost straight channel\nalignment. Biological factors also contribute to the breakdown of certain\npollutants.

The bioswale, or\nother type of biofilter, wraps around the parking lot and treats the runoff\nbefore releasing it to the watershed or storm sewer.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Bioswale","recorded":1362372144,"links":16,"instances":["hydrology","geographical_feature"],"pdf":["http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf","http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental engineering","Environmental soil science","Hydrology and urban planning","Gardening aids","Landscape","Waste treatment technology","Water pollution","Water conservation"],"headings":["Contaminants addressed","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Bioswale.jpg/300px-Bioswale.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["swale","geographical_feature"],["infiltration","hydrology"]],"members":["infiltration","swale"],"related":["Landscape_architecture","Silt","Pollution","Surface_runoff","Vegetation","Compost","Riprap","Swale_(geographical_feature)","Parking_lot","Automotive","Biofilter","Drainage_basin","Storm_sewer","Water_pollutant","Pathogen","Turbidity","Lead","Chromium","Cadmium","Macronutrient","Phosphate","Nitrate","Eutrophication","Pesticide","Agricultural","Urban_area","Organism","Aquatic_ecosystem","Disease","Portland,_Oregon","Willamette_River","Check_dam","Sonoma_County,_California","California_Department_of_Fish_and_Game","Surface_runoff","Sonoma_Creek","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Rain_gardens","Riparian_zone","Soil_contamination","Stormwater","Urban_runoff"]}
