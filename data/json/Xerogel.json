Gels are defined as a\nsubstantially dilute cross-linked system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-\nstate. Ferry, John D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. New York: Wiley,\n1980. By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due\nto a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the\ncrosslinking within the fluid that give a gel its structure (hardness) and\ncontribute to the adhesive stick (tack). In this way\ngels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid\nis the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Xerogel","recorded":1362509922,"links":58,"instances":["injury","rheology","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://bose-electroforce.com/pdf/appbrief_AgaroseGels.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/X06700.pdf"],"categories":["Physical chemistry","Gels|","Drug delivery devices","Dosage forms"],"headings":["Composition","Types of gels","Properties","Naturally occurring gels in the animal kingdom","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Hairgel.JPG/220px-Hairgel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","chemistry"],["burn","injury"],["elasticity","physics"],["paste","rheology"]],"members":["burn","paste","elasticity","absorption"],"related":["Latin","Gelatin","Material","Cross-link","Adhesive","Aerogel","Cation","Viscosity","Colloid","Water","Absorption_(chemistry)","Water","Polymer","Tissue_engineering","Biosensor","Diapers","Urine","Sanitary_napkin","Contact_lens","Silicone","Polyacrylamide","Cross-link","Polyethylene_oxide","PolyAMPS","Polyvinylpyrrolidone","Water_Gel_Explosives","Breast_implant","Soil","Burn_(injury)","Wound","Transdermal","Iontophoresis","Ion_exchange_resin","Polyvinyl_alcohol","Sodium_polyacrylate","Acrylate","Copolymer","Hydrophilic","Hyaluronan","Crystallinity","Glass","Thermoplastics","Material","Liquid","Organic_compound","Organic_solvent","Mineral_oil","Vegetable_fats_and_oils","Solubility","Elasticity_(physics)","Self-assembly","Pharmaceutics","Petroleum","Porosity","Solvent","Supercritical_fluid","Sintering","Glass","Thixotropy","Aerogel","Thickening_agent","Hair_gel","2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropane_sulfonic_acid","Aerogel","Hydrocolloid","Gel_electrophoresis","Agarose_gel_electrophoresis","2-D_electrophoresis","SDS-PAGE","Gel_filtration_chromatography","Gel_permeation_chromatography","Paste_(rheology)","Food_rheology","Silicone_gel"]}
