It is one of the seven ancient universities\nof Britain and Ireland, as well as Ireland's oldest university.\n\nOriginally established outside the city walls of Dublin in the buildings of the\ndissolved Augustinian Priory of All Hallows, Trinity College was set up in part\nto consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland, and it was seen as the\nuniversity of the Protestant Ascendancy for much of its history.

Women were first admitted to the college as full members in 1904.\n\nTrinity College is now surrounded by Dublin and is located on College Green,\nopposite the former Irish Houses of Parliament. The college proper occupies\n190,000 m 2 (47 acres), with many of its buildings ranged around\nlarge quadrangles (known as 'squares') and two playing fields. Academically, it\nis divided into three faculties comprising 25 schools, offering degree and\ndiploma courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In 2011, it was\nranked by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings as the 110th best\nuniversity in the world, by the QS World University Rankings as the 65th best,\nby the Academic Ranking of World Universities as within the 201-300 range, and\nby all three as the best university in Ireland. The Library of Trinity College is\na legal deposit library for Ireland and the United Kingdom, containing over 4.5\nmillion printed volumes and significant quantities of manuscripts (including the\nBook of Kells), maps and music.\n","linknr":1022,"url":"Trinity_College,_Dublin","recorded":1371241400,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College,_Dublin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College,_Dublin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/University_of_Dublin","/wiki/File:Trinity_College_Dublin_Arms.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Trinity_College_Dublin_Arms.svg/180px-Trinity_College_Dublin_Arms.svg.png","/wiki/Latin_language","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Provost_(education)","/wiki/Patrick_Prendergast","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-staffnumbers-3","#cite_note-staffnumbers-3","#cite_note-studentnumbers-4","/wiki/Undergraduate_education","#cite_note-studentnumbers-4","/wiki/Postgraduate_education","#cite_note-studentnumbers-4","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Trinity_College,_Dublin&params=53.3444_N_-6.2577_E_type:edu","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Trinity_College,_Dublin&params=53.3444_N_-6.2577_E_type:edu","/wiki/List_of_Oxbridge_sister_colleges","/wiki/Oriel_College,_Oxford","/wiki/St._John%27s_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/School_colors","/wiki/University_of_Dublin","http://www.tcd.ie/","/wiki/File:University_of_Dublin,_Trinity_College.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/University_of_Dublin%2C_Trinity_College.png/180px-University_of_Dublin%2C_Trinity_College.png","/wiki/Irish_language","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Residential_college","/wiki/University_of_Dublin","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","#cite_note-letterspatent-6","/wiki/Collegiate_university","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/Ancient_university","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","/wiki/Priory_of_All_Hallows","/wiki/Tudor_dynasty","/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy","/wiki/Catholic_church","/wiki/Dissenters","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/College_Green","/wiki/Irish_Houses_of_Parliament","/wiki/Acre","/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)","/wiki/Faculty_(division)","/wiki/Academic_degree","/wiki/Diploma","/wiki/Undergraduate","/wiki/Postgraduate","/wiki/Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings","/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings","/wiki/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities","#cite_note-thewur2011-9","#cite_note-qswur2011-10","#cite_note-arwu2010-11","/wiki/Trinity_College_Library","/wiki/Legal_deposit","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Book_of_Kells","#History","#Early_history","#18th_and_19th_centuries","#20th_century","#21st_century","#Buildings_and_grounds","#Library","#Organisation","#Governance","#The_Board","#The_Visitors","#Academic_associations","#Parliamentary_representation","#Academic_profile","#Undergraduate","#Graduate","#Academic_year","#Admissions","#Awards","#Entrance_Exhibition_awards","#Scholarship","#Research","#Rankings","#Student_life","#Societies","#Clubs","#Publications","#The_Trinity_Ball","#Students.27_Union","#Traditions_and_culture","#In_popular_culture","#Noted_people","#Notes","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College,_Dublin&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/KellsFol007vMadonnaChild.jpg/220px-KellsFol007vMadonnaChild.jpg","/wiki/File:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Book_of_Kells","/wiki/File:Bram_Stoker1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Bram_Stoker1.jpg/220px-Bram_Stoker1.jpg","/wiki/File:Bram_Stoker1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Bram_Stoker","/w/index.php?title=Trinity_College,_Dublin&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-12","/wiki/English_Reformation","/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral,_Dublin","/wiki/Letters_patent","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","#cite_note-letterspatent-6","/wiki/All_Hallows_monastery","/wiki/Dublin_Corporation","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Archbishop_of_Dublin_(Church_of_Ireland)","/wiki/Adam_Loftus_(Archbishop)","/wiki/University_of_Cambridge","/wiki/James_Hamilton,
