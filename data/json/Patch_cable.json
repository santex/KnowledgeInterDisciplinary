Devices of different types (e.g., a switch connected to a computer,\nor a switch to a router) are connected with patch cords. Patch cords are usually\nproduced in many different colors so as to be easily distinguishable, and are\nrelatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of patch cords\ninclude microphone cables, headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny\nTelephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and Â¼\" TRS phone connector cables (as\nwell as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like cords (snake cable)\nused to carry video or amplified signals. However, patch cords typically refer\nonly to short cords used with patch panels.\n\nPatch cords can be as short as 3 inches (ca. 8 cm), to connect stacked\ncomponents or route signals through a patch bay, or as long as twenty feet (ca.\n6 m) or more in length for snake cables. As length increases, the cables are\nusually thicker and/or made with more shielding, to prevent signal loss\n(attenuation) and the introduction of unwanted radio frequencies and hum\n(electromagnetic interference).\n\nPatch cords are often made of coaxial cables, with the signal carried through a\nshielded core, and the electrical ground or earthed return connection carried\nthrough a wire mesh surrounding the core. Each end of the cable is attached to a\nconnector so that the cord may be plugged in. Connector types may vary widely,\nparticularly with adapting cables.\n\nPatch cords may be:\n\n* single-conductor wires using, for example, banana connectors\n* coaxial cables using, for example, BNC connectors\n* Twisted pair Cat5, Cat5e, or Cat6 cables using 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connectors\n  with T568A or T568B wiring\n* Optical fiber cables\n\nA patch cord is always fitted with connectors at both ends. A 'pigtail' is\nsimilar to a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a\nconnector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. The non-\nconnectorized end (\"the pigtail\") is intended to be permanently attached to a\ncomponent or terminal.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Patch_cable","recorded":1362575588,"links":22,"instances":["audio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Telephony equipment","Networking hardware"],"headings":["Music and sound recording","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cat_5.jpg/250px-Cat_5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phone_connector","audio"],["phone_connector","audio"]],"members":["phone_connector"],"related":["8P8C","Electric","Optical","Microphone","Headphone","XLR_connector","Tiny_Telephone","RCA_connector","Phone_connector_(audio)","Modular_connector","Ethernet","Snake_cable","Video","Patch_panel","Patch_bay","Attenuation","Electromagnetic_interference","Coaxial_cable","Electrical_ground","Electrical_conductor","Banana_connector","Coaxial_cable","BNC_connector","Twisted_pair","Cat5e","Cat6","8P8C","Modular_connector","Optical_fiber","PA_system","Microphone","XLR_connector","Electric_guitar","Electric_bass","Synthesizer","Electric_piano","Drum_machine","Effects_unit","DJ","RCA_connector","Amplifier","Instrument_amplifier","Phone_connector_(audio)","Snake_cable","Patch_bay","Cable_management","Crossover_cable"]}
