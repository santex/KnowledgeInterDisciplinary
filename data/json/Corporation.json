{"cursor":"54333","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":This article is about business corporations. For other uses, see [[Corporation\n(disambiguation)]]. \"Corporate\" redirects here. For the Bollywood film, see\n[[Corporate (film)]].\n\nAn 'incorporated entity' is a separate legal entity that has been incorporated\nthrough a legislative or registration process established through legislation.\nIncorporated entities have legal rights and liabilities that are distinct from\ntheir shareholders, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corporation\nDefinition of a \"corporation\" from Reference.com] and may conduct business\nfor either profit-seeking business or not for profit purposes. Early\nincorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted\nby a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now\nallow the creation of new corporations through registration. In addition to\nlegal personality, registered companies tend to have limited liability, who can\ntransfer their shares to others, and controlled by a board of directors whom the\nshareholders appoint.\n\nIn American English the word 'corporation' is widely used to describe\nincorporated entities, especially those that have a large number of\nshareholders, where shares are transferred without the need for the consent of\nother shareholders.\n[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/corporation corporation].\nCollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th\nEdition. Retrieved December 07, 2012. In British English and in the\ncommonwealth countries, the term 'public company' is more widely used to\ndescribe the same sort of entity while the word 'company' encompasses all\n'incorporated entities'. In American English, the word 'company' can include\nentities such as partnerships that would not be referred to as companies in\nBritish English as they are not a separate legal entity.\n\nDespite not being actual human beings ('Natural People'), corporations, as far\nas the law is concerned, as legal people have many of the same rights and\nresponsibillities as natural people do. Corporations can exercise human rights\nagainst real individuals and the state, e.g. South African\nConstitution Art.8, especially Art.(4) and they can themselves be\nresponsible for human rights violations. Phillip I. Blumberg, The\nMultinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate\nPersonality, (1993) discusses the controversial nature of additional rights\nbeing granted to corporations. Corporations can be \"dissolved\" either by\nstatutory operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of\nshareholders. Insolvency may result in a form of corporate failure, when\ncreditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court\norder, See, for example, the Business Corporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002]\nCHAPTER 57, Part 10 but it most often results in a restructuring of\ncorporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses,\nsuch as fraud and manslaughter. However corporations are not considered living\nentities in the way that humans are. e.g. Corporate Manslaughter and\nCorporate Homicide Act 2007\n","linknr":784,"url":"Corporation","recorded":1362480286,"links":74,"instances":["economics","company","film","business","religious_practice","finance","law","law","law"],"pdf":["http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf","http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf","http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf","http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf"],"categories":["Companies|","Business
