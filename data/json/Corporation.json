Early incorporated\nentities were established by charter (i.e. by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch\nor passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the\ncreation of new corporations through registration. In addition to legal\npersonality, registered corporations tend to have limited liability, be owned by\nshareholders who can transfer their shares to others, and\ncontrolled by a board of directors who are normally elected or appointed by the\nshareholders.\n\nIn American English the word 'corporation' is widely used to describe large\nincorporated businesses. [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/amer-\nican/corporation corporation]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English\nDictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 07,\n2012. In British English and in the commonwealth countries, the term\n'limited company' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while\nthe word 'corporation' encompasses all incorporated entities. In American\nEnglish, the word 'company' can include entities such as partnerships that\nwould not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a\nseparate legal entity.\n\nDespite not being human beings, corporations, as far as the law is concerned,\nare legal persons, and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as\nnatural people do. Corporations can exercise human rights against real\nindividuals and the state, e.g. South African Constitution Art.8,\nespecially Art.(4) and they can themselves be responsible for human rights\nviolations. Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation\nLaw: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) discusses the\ncontroversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.\nCorporations can be \"dissolved\" either by statutory operation, order of court,\nor voluntary action on the part of shareholders. Insolvency may result in a form\nof corporate failure, when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of\nthe corporation under court order, See, for example, the Business\nCorporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002] CHAPTER 57, Part 10 but it most often\nresults in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be\nconvicted of criminal offenses, such as fraud and manslaughter. However\ncorporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans\nare. e.g. Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Corporation","recorded":1372154257,"links":[],"instances":["economics","legal_system","company","film","business","religious_practice","finance","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Companies|","Business law","Corporations law","Corporations|","Legal entities","Types of business entity"],"headings":["History","Ownership and control","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["profit","economics"],["share","finance"],["cult","religious_practice"],["conglomerate","company"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["agent","law"],["company","law"],["conglomerate","company"],["incorporation","business"],["the_corporation","film"]],"members":["profit","civil_law","conglomerate","the_corporation","incorporation","cult","share","agent","company"],"related":["Separate_legal_entity","Legal_rights","Liabilities","Shareholders","Profit_(economics)","Business","Limited_liability","Shareholder","Share_(finance)","Board_of_directors","American_English","British_English","Partnerships","Separate_legal_entity","Legal_person","Human_rights","South_African_Constitution","Insolvency","Fraud","Manslaughter","Corporate_Manslaughter_and_Corporate_Homicide_Act_2007","Latin","Justinian","Roman_Law","Cult_(religious_practice)","Ancient_Rome","Maurya_Empire","University_of_Michigan","Pope","City_of_London_Corporation","Stora_Kopparberg","Falun","Sweden","Charter","Magnus_II_of_Sweden","Dutch_East_India_Company","Hudson's_Bay_Company","Corporate_colonialism","Dutch_East_India_Company","Portugal","Moluccan_Islands","Europe","Spice","Amsterdam","Limited_liability","Stewart_Kyd","Corporate_law","Dutch_East_India_Company","British_East_India_Company","English_monarchy","East_Indies","Africa","Return_on_investment","United_States","Andrew_Carnegie","Limited_partnership","John_D._Rockefeller","Standard_Oil","Trust_law","New_Jersey","Delaware","British_Parliament","Limited_liability","Limited_Liability_Act_1855","James_Watt","George_Stephenson","Industrial_Revolution","Sherman_Act","Holding_companies","Mergers","Privatization","Deregulation","Laissez-faire","Conglomerate_(company)","Keiretsu","Joint-stock_company","Worker_cooperative","Credit_union","Board_of_directors","Common_law","Supervisory_board","Managing_board","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Charter","Registered_agent","Agent_(law)","Articles_of_incorporation","Bylaws","Foreign_corporation","Employment","Crime","Contract","Civil_action","U.S._state","California","Constructive_notice","Legal_liability","Company","Partnership","Sole_proprietorship","Corporate_liability","Corporate_manslaughter","Corporate_law","United_Kingdom_company_law","United_States_corporate_law","German_company_law","European_company_law","Commercial_law","Alaska_Native_Claims_Settlement_Act","Anti-corporate_activism","Blocker_corporation","Community_interest_company","Company_(law)","Conglomerate_(company)","Cooperative","Corporate_crime","Corporate_governance","Corporate_haven","Corporate_scandal","Corporate_welfare","Corporation_sole","Corporatism","Corporatization","Evil_corporation","Finance_capitalism","Good_standing","Guild","Incorporation_(business)","List_of_strikes","Megacorporation","Multinational_corporation","Nonprofit_corporation","Organizational_culture","Preferred_stock","Professional_corporation","Public_limited_company","Registered_Agent","Shelf_Corporation","Stock_certificate","State_Enterprise","The_Corporation_(film)","Unlimited_company","Unlimited_liability_corporation","Oxford_University_Press","Ernst_Freund","Robert_Hessen","Robert_Sobel"]}
