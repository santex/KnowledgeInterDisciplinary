Captive\n breeding programs facilitate biodiversity and may save species from extinction.\n However, such programs may also reduce genetic diversity and species fitness.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Captive_breeding","recorded":1362686381,"links":19,"instances":["biology","medical","bird","biology"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01144.x/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01144.x/pdf"],"categories":["Conservation","Zoology","Zoos","Animal breeding"],"headings":["History","Coordination","Challenges","Success","Recent advances","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Red_wolf_pups_-_captive_breeding.jpg/220px-Red_wolf_pups_-_captive_breeding.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crane","bird"],["immunity","medical"],["morphology","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["polymorphism","immunity","crane","morphology"],"related":["Red_wolf","Zoo","Conservation_biology","Organism","Habitat","Species","Biodiversity","Extinction","Genetic_diversity","Pere_David's_Deer","Peter_Scott","Gerald_Durrell","Wildfowl_and_Wetlands_Trust","Durrell_Wildlife_Park","Pink_Pigeon","Pygmy_Hog","Round_Island_Boa","Poison_arrow_frog","Fauna_and_Flora_Preservation_Society","Arabian_oryx","Arabian_oryx_reintroduction","Przewalski's_horse","Mongolia","Endangered_species","Species_Survival_Plan","Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","Canadian_Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","European_Endangered_Species_Programme","European_Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquaria","Australasian_Regional_Association_of_Zoological_Parks_and_Aquaria","Japanese_Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","South_Asian_Zoo_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation","South_East_Asian_Zoos_Association","Migratory_birds","Crane_(bird)","Hilsa","Cetaceans","Inbreeding","Gene_pool","Immunity_(medical)","Matschie's_tree-kangaroo","Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquariums","Inbreeding","Haplotype_diversity","Allele_frequencies","Genetic_drift","Mutation","Natural_habitat","Hunting","Forage","Starvation","Predator","Golden_Lion_Tamarin","Offspring","Reintroduction","Offspring","Domestication","Physiological","Domesticated_silver_fox","Habitat_loss","Invasive_species","Extinction","Adaptation","Genetic_polymorphism","Technology","De_Wildt_Cheetah_and_Wildlife_Centre","Survival_rate","Endangerment","Morphology_(biology)","Tasmanian_devil","Devil_Facial_Tumor_Disease","Estrous_cycle","Progestogen","Corticosterone","Metabolite","Columbia_Basin_pygmy_rabbit","Major_Histocompatibility_Complex","Genome","Genes","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Immune_cells","Polymorphism_(biology)","Disease_resistant","Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell","Germ_cells","Gene_pool","Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell","Therapeutic","Breeding_in_the_wild","Ex-situ_conservation","Species_Survival_Plan","European_Endangered_Species_Programme","World_Conference_on_Breeding_Endangered_Species_in_Captivity_as_an_Aid_to_their_Survival","Panda_pornography","Zooborns"]}
