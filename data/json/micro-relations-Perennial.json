The\nterm is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and\nbiennials. The term is also widely used to distinguish plants with little or no\nwoody growth from trees and shrubs, which are also technically perennials.\n\nPerennials, especially small flowering plants, that grow and bloom over the\nspring and summer, die back every autumn and winter, and then return in the\nspring from their root-stock, are known as 'herbaceous perennials'. However,\ndepending on the rigors of local climate, a plant that is a perennial in its\nnative habitat, or in a milder garden, may be treated by a gardener as an annual\nand planted out every year, from seed, from cuttings or from divisions.\n\nThere is also a class of evergreen, or non-herbaceous, perennials, including\nplants like [[Bergenia]] which retain a mantle of leaves throughout the year. An\nintermediate class of plants is known as subshrubs, which retain a vestigial\nwoody structure in winter, e.g. [[Penstemon]]. The local climate may dictate\nwhether plants are treated as shrubs or perennials. For instance, in colder\ntemperate climates, many shrubby varieties of [[Fuchsia]] are cut to the ground\nto protect them from winter frosts.\n\nThe symbol for a perennial plant, based on [[Species Plantarum]] by Linnaeus, is\n, which is also the astronomical symbol for the planet Jupiter.
