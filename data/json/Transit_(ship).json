{"cursor":"5169","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Transit' was the name given to three sailing vessels designed and built to the\norder of Captain Richard Hall Gower.\n\nAll three had fine lines at bow and stern, uniform frames mid-ships with concave\nand convex sweeps and a deep keel. Their length to beam ratio was unusually\nhigh, giving them a remarkable turn of speed. The foremast was square rigged\nwhile the other three or four masts were fore-and-aft rigged, barquentine\nfashion but carrying very simplified standing and running rigging. Each sail was\nequipped with a diagonal sprit that enabled it to be brailed up to its mast and\ndeployed rapidly. Each mast carried three sails. The topmasts could be lowered\nand replaced from the deck, in the event the sprits were to fail in strong gales\nand had to be abandoned. The Patent granted to Gower in 1799 details his theory\nabout the relationship between speed and the length to beam ratio, as well as\ndetails of many features of his novel form of rigging, which allowed almost all\nactivities normally conducted aloft to be performed from the deck (including the\nreplacement of damaged masts) ; thus only the foremast was fitted with ratlines.\n\nAt the instance of John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, the First Lord of the\nAdmiralty, the first Transit was sailed against HMS ''Osprey'' in 1801. Osprey\nwas a fast sloop of 383 tons (about twice the tonnage of Transit). Built at\nNorthfleet like a French corvette, with an 80 ft 6 in (24.5 m) keel, she\nhad the reputation of being very fast. Her length to beam ratio (at waterline)\nwas probably less than 3:1. Transit with a length of 130 feet (39.6 m) and\na length to beam ration of 6.5:1 performed so well as to have been acknowledged\nthe winner by the captain of Osprey. Despite this success Gower failed to get\nthe support he needed to build a class of vessels to his patents.\n\nThe reasons given for the rejection of Gower's proposal included the observation\nthat because of her deep keel she would fall over at low tide in many of the\neast coast ports from which she might have to operate and that the deck was so\nnarrow that guns could not be arranged symmetrically on each side for fear of\ntheir recoil causing them to collide. By coincidence, but apparently unbeknownst\nto Gower, the very gun that he would have needed, the carronade, a short\nbarrelled gun mounted on a slide fixed to the deck, was adopted by the Royal\nNavy less than a year before the test of Transit.\n\nGower wrote detailed and vivid accounts of the vessels and his experiences with\nthe authorities. George Bayley, owner of the yard that built two of the Transits\nalso gave an account of the vessels. Macgregor gives a description and\nillustration of the first Transit.\n","linknr":87,"url":"Transit_(ship)","recorded":1374963361,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Richard_Hall_Gower","/wiki/Keel","/wiki/Foremast","/wiki/Square_rigged","/wiki/Barquentine","/wiki/Rigging","/wiki/Sail","/wiki/Sprit","/w/index.php?title=Brail_(sailing)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Topmast","/wiki/Ratlines","/wiki/John_Jervis,_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent","/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty","/w/index.php?title=HMS_Osprey_(1797)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Northfleet","/wiki/Corvette","/wiki/Patents","/wiki/Carronade","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&oldid=534280601","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Sailing_ships","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transit+%28ship%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transit+%28ship%29","/wiki/Transit_(ship)","/wiki/Talk:Transit_(ship)","#","/wiki/Transit_(ship)","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Transit_(ship)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Transit_(ship)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&oldid=534280601","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7834333","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Transit_%28ship%29&id=534280601","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Transit+%28ship%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Transit+%28ship%29&oldid=534280601&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Transit_(ship)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7834333#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_(ship)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["sailing","1797"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sailing ships"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brail","sailing"],["hms_osprey","1797"]],"members":["brail","hms_osprey"],"related":["Richard_Hall_Gower","Keel","Foremast","Square_rigged","Barquentine","Rigging","Sail","Sprit","Brail_(sailing)","Topmast","Ratlines","John_Jervis,_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent","First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty","HMS_Osprey_(1797)","Northfleet","Corvette","Patents","Carronade"]}
