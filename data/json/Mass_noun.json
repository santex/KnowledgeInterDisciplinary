Non-\n  count nouns are distinguished from count nouns.\n\nGiven that different languages have different grammatical features, the actual\ntest for which nouns are mass nouns may vary between languages. In English, mass\nnouns are characterized by the fact that they cannot be directly modified by a\nnumeral without specifying a unit of measurement, and that they cannot combine\nwith an indefinite article (a or an). Thus, the mass noun \"water\" is quantified\nas \"20 litres of water\" while the count noun \"chair\" is quantified as \"20\nchairs\". However, mass nouns (like count nouns) can be quantified in relative\nterms without unit specification (e.g., \"much water,\" \"many chairs\").\n\nSome mass nouns can be used in English in the plural to mean \"more than one\ninstance (or example) of a certain sort of entity\"âfor example, \"Many cleaning\nagents today are technically not soaps, but detergents.\" In such cases they no\nlonger play the role of mass nouns, but (syntactically) they are treated as\ncount nouns.\n\nSome nouns have both a mass sense and a count sense (for example, paper).\n","linknr":350,"url":"Mass_noun","recorded":1362482574,"links":20,"instances":["sociolinguistics","language","linguistics","linguistics","disambiguation","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf","http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/PellSch.pdf","http://d.a.nicolas.free.fr/Nicolas-Mass-nouns-and-plural-logic-Revised-2.pdf"],"categories":["Grammar","Grammatical number"],"headings":["Relating grammatical number to physical discreteness","Cumulativity and mass nouns","Multiple senses for one noun","Quantification","Confounding of collective noun and mass noun","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/0/7/907ee0e370d4f05e218d6419e360cc2d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["advice","disambiguation"],["equipment","disambiguation"],["numeral","linguistics"],["quantization","linguistics"],["quantization","linguistics"],["chinese","language"],["prestige","sociolinguistics"]],"members":["prestige","chinese","quantization","numeral","equipment","advice"],"related":["Advice_(disambiguation)","Air","Art","Blood","Butter","Deodorant","Equipment_(disambiguation)","Evidence","Food","Furniture","Waste","Graffiti","Grass","Homework","Housework","Information","Knowledge","Luggage","Mathematics","Meat","Milk","Money","Music","Notation","Paper","Pollution","Sand","Soap","Software","Sugar","Traffic","Transportation","Travel","Waste","Water","Linguistics","Noun","Count_noun","Numeral_(linguistics)","Word_sense","German_language","Partitive_case","Finnish_language","Accusative_case","Godehard_Link","Manfred_Krifka","Quantization_(linguistics)","Cumulativity","Cumulativity","Quantization_(linguistics)","Collective_noun","Noun","Fire","Generative_Linguistics_in_the_Old_World","Chinese_(language)","Japanese_language","Measure_word","Quantification","Comparative","Superlative","Suppletion","Nonstandard_dialect","Prestige_(sociolinguistics)","Old_English","Tesco","Point_of_sale","Plain_English_Campaign","Count_noun","Mathematics","Physics","Plurale_tantum"]}
