Database author Cary\nJensen describes Advantage as follows: \"Advantage has been around since 1993,\nwhen it was introduced to provide a stable solution for Clipper developers who\nwere tired of slow performance and corrupt indexes inherent to file server-based\ndatabases. Over the years, ADS has grown in both popularity and features.\nAdvantage is now a mature product with an impressive collection of features that\nrival many of the more expensive and complicated database servers\".
