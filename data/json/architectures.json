mason\") is both the process\nand product of planning, designing, and construction, usually of buildings and\nother physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of\nbuildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art.\nHistorical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural\nachievements.\n\n\"Architecture\" can mean: *A general term to describe buildings and other\nphysical structures. *The art and science of designing and erecting buildings\nand other physical structures. *The style and method of design and construction\nof buildings and other physical structures. *The practice of the architect,\nwhere architecture means the offering or rendering of professional services in\nconnection with the design and construction of buildings, or built\nenvironments.<ref></ref> *The design activity of the architect, from the macro-\nlevel (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction\ndetails and furniture). *The term \"architecture\" has been adopted to describe\nthe activity of designing any kind of system, and is commonly used in describing\ninformation technology.\n\nIn relation to buildings, architecture has to do with the planning, designing\nand constructing form, space and ambience that reflect functional, technical,\nsocial, environmental, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative\nmanipulation and coordination of material, technology, light and shadow.\nArchitecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and\nstructures, including scheduling, cost estimating and construction\nadministration. As documentation produced by architects, typically drawings,\nplans and technical specifications, architecture defines the structure and/or\nbehavior of a building or any other kind of system that is to be or has been\nconstructed. , in the building of the dome, not only transformed the cathedral\nand the city of Florence, but also the role and status of the\narchitect.<ref>Museo Galileo, Museum and Institute of History and Science,\n[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/place/TheDomeOfSantaMariaFiore.html\nThe Dome of Santa Maria del Fiore], (accessed 30-01-2013)</ref><ref>Giovanni\nFanelli, Brunelleschi, Becocci, Florence (1980), Chapter: The Dome pp. 10-\n41.</ref>]]\n","title":"architecture","headings":["Theory of architecture","History","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: France","3: Organic_architecture","3: Frank_Lloyd_Wright","2: Design","2: Building","2: Architect","2: Vitruvius","2: Leone_Battista_Alberti","2: Sustainability","2: Vernacular_architecture","2: Classical_antiquity","2: India","2: Asia","2: Palladio","2: Industrial_Revolution","2: Philip_Johnson","2: Postmodernism","1: Florence_Cathedral","1: Latin","1: Planning","1: Construction","1: Work_of_art","1: Urban_design","1: Landscape_architecture","1: Information_technology","1: Structure","1: Behavior","1: System","1: Florence","1: Athens","1: Greece","1: Banister_Fletcher","1: De_Re_Aedificatoria","1: Golden_ratio","1: Vasari","1: Charles_Barry","1: Augustus_Welby_Northmore_Pugin","1: Gothic_architecture","1: John_Ruskin","1: Le_Corbusier","1: Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe","1: Oscar_Niemeyer","1: Louis_Sullivan","1: Form_follows_function","1: Australia","1: Jørn_Utzon","1: Architectural_design_values","1: Rationalism","1: Empiricism","1: Structuralism","1: Poststructuralism","1: Lighting","1: Building_material","1: Craft","1: Rural","1: Urban_area","1: Çatal_Höyük","1: Anatolia","1: Mohenjo_Daro","1: Pakistan","1: Egypt","1: Supernatural","1: Urbanism","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Classical_orders","1: Kyoto","1: China","1: Vaastu_Shastra","1: Manjusri_Vasthu_Vidya_Sastra","1: Sri_Lanka","1: Natural_landscape","1: Common_Era","1: Middle_East","1: Byzantium","1: Europe","1: Medieval","1: Guild","1: Italy","1: Renaissance","1: Renaissance_Humanism","1: Filippo_Brunelleschi","1: Michelangelo","1: Artist","1: Engineer","1: Engineering","1: Aesthetics","1: Gothic_Revival_architecture","1: Scottish_Baronial","1: Ecole_des_Beaux_Arts","1: Walter_Gropius","1: Deutscher_Werkbund","1: Bauhaus","1: Weimar","1: Modern_architecture","1: Avant-garde","1: World_War_I","1: Robie_House","1: Falling_Water","1: California","1: Mies_van_der_Rohe","1: Marcel_Breuer","1: World_Trade_Center","1: Robert_Venturi","1: Lisbon","1: Santiago_Calatrava","1: Modernism","1: Museum_architecture","1: Buckminster_Fuller","1: Ian_McHarg","1: Sim_Van_der_Ryn","1: Brenda_and_Robert_Vale","1: Green_building","1: Sustainable_design","1: Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design","1: Efficient_energy_use","1: Collaborative_for_High_Performance_Schools","1: Dynamic_Tower","1: Wind_turbine","1: Photovoltaics","1: Architectural_design_competition","1: Architectural_drawing","1: Architectural_style","1: Architectural_theory","1: Glossary_of_architecture","1: List_of_human_habitation_forms","1: Sociology_of_architecture","1: Building_materials","1: Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects","1: International_Union_of_Architects"]}
