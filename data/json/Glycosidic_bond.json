{"cursor":"5776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, a 'glycosidic bond' is a type of covalent bond that joins a\ncarbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another\ncarbohydrate.\n\nA glycosidic bond is formed between the hemiacetal group of a saccharide (or a\nmolecule derived from a saccharide) and the hydroxyl group of some organic\ncompound such as an alcohol. If the group attached to the carbohydrate residue\nis not another saccharide it is referred to as an aglycone. If it is another\nsaccharide, the resulting units can be termed as being at the reducing end or\nthe terminal end of the structure. This is a relative nomenclature where the\nreducing end of the di- or polysaccharide is towards the last anomeric carbon of\nthe structure, and the terminal end is in the opposite direction.\n\nIn the literature, the bond between an amino group or other nitrogen-containing\ngroup and the sugar is often referred to as a glycosidic bond (although IUPAC\nseems to suggest that the term is a misnomer). For example, the sugar-base bond\nin a nucleoside may be referred to as a glycosidic bond.\nA substance containing a glycosidic bond is a glycoside.\n\n and ethanol combine to form ethyl glucoside and water. The reaction often\n favors formation of the Î± glycosidic bond as shown due to the anomeric\n effect.]] \n","linknr":304,"url":"Glycosidic_bond","recorded":1362508104,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Glycosides","Carbohydrates","Carbohydrate chemistry"],"headings":["S-, N-, C-, and O-glycosidic bonds","Numbering, and α/β distinction of glycosidic bonds","Glycoside hydrolases","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Ethyl-glucoside.png/550px-Ethyl-glucoside.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Adenosin.svg/200px-Adenosin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Carbonnumbering.jpg/300px-Carbonnumbering.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Covalent_bond","Carbohydrate","Hemiacetal","Saccharide","Hydroxyl_group","Alcohol","Aglycone","Disaccharide","Polysaccharide","Anomeric_carbon","Amino_group","Nucleoside","Glycoside","Ethanol","Ethyl_group","Glucoside","Water","Anomeric_effect","RNA","Ribose","Adenine","Oxygen","Sulfur","Nitrogen","Glycosylamine","IUPAC","Carbon","Hexose","Pyranose","Axial_bond","Equatorial_bond","Glucuronic_acid","Solubility","Glucuronidation","Glycoside","Glycoside_hydrolases","Enzyme","Lipid","Phosphate","Nucleotide","Uridine_diphosphate","Guanosine_diphosphate","Thymidine_diphosphate","Cytidine_monophosphate","Nucleotide_sugar","Dolichol","Glycosyltransferase","Nucleophile","IUPAC","Gold_Book"]}
