{"cursor":"4549","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Savage' is a historic town located in Howard County, Maryland, about south of\nBaltimore and north of Washington, D.C. It is situated close to the city of\nLaurel and to the planned community of Columbia.\n\nThe lands of Savage were first settled around 1650. Colonel Henry Ridgely\nsurveyed the land around Savage Mill and nearby Annapolis Junction in 1685\nnaming the tract \"Ridgely's Forrest\". In 1734, Joseph White opened a\ngristmill on land patented as \"Whites Fortune\" and \"Whites Contrivance\"\n\nA rich vein of American industrial history lies in Savage. When the textile\nindustry was in its heyday, Savage was an important manufacturing center, its\nmills harnessing the water power on the falls of the Little and Middle\nPatuxent Rivers.\n\nThe town was named for John Savage Williams, a Philadelphia merchant with\ninterest in a mill on the falls of the Patuxent. In 1822 he and his associates,\nthe Williams brothers, chartered the Savage Manufacturing Company pruchasing 900\nacres of the White property for $6,666.67. The company produced sails\nfor the clipper ships that sailed out of Baltimore Harbor, in addition to a wide\nvariety of other cotton products.\n\nThe cotton milling industry started in Maryland in the 18th century and\nflourished in the 19th century. Cotton was shipped cheaply from Southern ports\nand hauled overland by mule and oxen teams to the mills before rail\ntransportation served Savage. In 1835 the Washington branch of the B&O Railroad\nwas completed, and Savage Station was established on the line about a mile\nsoutheast of the present mill. A spur of the B&O was laid to the Savage factory\nin 1887, and it was at this time that the famous Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge\nwas moved to its present site from another location. Originally built in 1852,\nit was one of about 100 on the B&O line. Beloved by railroad buffs, the iron\ntruss bridge is the only one of its type in the world, and, along with the\nSavage Mill, is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n\nParts of the Savage Mill are said to date from about 1820, and historians have\nrecorded that the mill once had an iron foundry that made many kinds of\nmachinery, specializing in textile manufacturing. The operation of the mill was\ngreatly expanded in 1880 with the installation of steam power. Army uniforms,\nfield tents, and vehicle covers were made.\n\nA renovation program began in 1984 that established Savage Mill as a major\npermanent marketplace. With its new role as a festive showcase for quality arts,\ncrafts, antiques, and specialty items, Savage Mill is more than a \"shopping\nmill.\" It's a leisurely place to explore, enjoy, and to appreciate the history\nof a quiet mill town on the banks of the Middle Patuxent River.\n\nThe Savage Mill Manor House is found down the street from the Mill and has\nalso been completely renovated. It is now used to host weddings, parties and\nspecial events.\n\n\nCarroll Baldwin Hall once housed the Savage branch of the Howard County Library.\nIt was built in the early 1920s as a memorial to Carroll Baldwin, former\npresident of the manufacturing company. The Baldwins managed the company from\n1859 to 1911.\n\nSinger/songwriter Benny Mardones â who holds an unusual place in United States\nrecording history as a \"one-hit wonder\" who actually hit the Top 20 twice, in\n1980 and 1989, with the same recording of the same song, \"Into the Night\" â was\nraised in Savage but was born in Cleveland, Ohio.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Savage,_Maryland","recorded":1375072180,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Laurel,_Maryland","/wiki/Planned_community","/wiki/Columbia,_Maryland","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Patuxent_River","/w/index.php?title=John_Savage_(merchant)&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/B%26O_Railroad","/wiki/Bollman_Truss_Railroad_Bridge","/wiki/Savage_Mill","/wiki/File:Bollman-bridge-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Bollman-bridge-1.jpg/220px-Bollman-bridge-1.jpg","/wiki/File:Bollman-bridge-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Savage_Mill_Manor_Dec_08.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Savage_Mill_Manor_Dec_08.JPG/220px-Savage_Mill_Manor_Dec_08.JPG","/wiki/File:Savage_Mill_Manor_Dec_08.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Savage_Mill_Community_Bldg_Dec_08.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Savage_Mill_Community_Bldg_Dec_08.JPG/220px-Savage_Mill_Community_Bldg_Dec_08.JPG","/wiki/File:Savage_Mill_Community_Bldg_Dec_08.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Benny_Mardones","/wiki/One-hit_wonder","/wiki/Into_the_Night_(Benny_Mardones_song)","/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio","/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&action=edit&section=2","http://users.erols.com/rmayes/savage.html","http://www.city-data.com/city/Savage-Guilford-Maryland.html","http://www.savagemill.com/","/wiki/Template:Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Template_talk:Howard_County,_Maryland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Howard_County,_Maryland&action=edit","/wiki/Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/County_seat","/wiki/Ellicott_City,_Maryland","/wiki/Census-designated_place","/wiki/Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Elkridge,_Maryland","/wiki/Ellicott_City,_Maryland","/wiki/Fulton,_Maryland","/wiki/Highland,_Maryland","/wiki/Ilchester,_Maryland","/wiki/Jessup,_Maryland","/wiki/North_Laurel,_Maryland","/wiki/Scaggsville,_Maryland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Map_of_Maryland_highlighting_Howard_County.svg/180px-Map_of_Maryland_highlighting_Howard_County.svg.png","/wiki/Unincorporated_area","/wiki/Annapolis_Junction,_Maryland","/wiki/Benson,_Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Clarksville,_Maryland","/wiki/Cooksville,_Maryland","/wiki/Daniels,_Maryland","/wiki/Dayton,_Maryland","/wiki/Dorsey,_Maryland","/wiki/Dorsey%27s_Search,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Glenelg,_Maryland","/wiki/Glenwood,_Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Guilford,_Maryland","/wiki/Hanover,_Maryland","/wiki/Harper%27s_Choice,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Henryton_Heights,_Maryland","/wiki/Hickory_Ridge,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Hopewell,_Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Kings_Contrivance,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Linwood,_Howard_County,_Maryland","/wiki/Lisbon,_Maryland","/wiki/Long_Reach,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Marriottsville,_Maryland","/wiki/Oakland_Mills,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Owen_Brown,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Paternal_Gift_Farm,_Maryland","/wiki/River_Hill,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Simpsonville,_Maryland","/wiki/Town_Center,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/West_Friendship,_Maryland","/wiki/Wilde_Lake,_Columbia,_Maryland","/wiki/Woodbine,_Maryland","/wiki/Woodstock,_Maryland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&oldid=564252763","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Unincorporated_communities_in_Maryland","/wiki/Category:Populated_places_in_Howard_County,_Maryland","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Savage%2C+Maryland&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Savage%2C+Maryland","/wiki/Savage,_Maryland","/wiki/Talk:Savage,_Maryland","#","/wiki/Savage,_Maryland","/w/index.php?title=Savage,_Maryland&action=edit"
