{"cursor":"1238","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, a 'concerted reaction' is a chemical reaction in which all bond\nbreaking and bond making occurs in a single step. Reactive intermediates or\nother unstable high energy intermediates are not involved. Concerted reaction\nrates tend not to depend on solvent polarity ruling out large buildup of charge\nin the transition state. Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions.\n\nIn the S N2 reaction a concerted reaction also takes place. Because\nthe reaction rate is bimolecular there are two molecular species controlling the\nrate of the reaction. Because the rate is dependent on two molecules the\nreaction does not have any intermediate steps, only a transition state. This\nmeans that all the bond making and bond breaking takes place in a single step.\nIn order for the reaction to occur both molecules must be situated correctly.\nTherefore, the reaction is said to be concerted because it occurs in one step.\n","linknr":91,"url":"concerted","recorded":1362581617,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic reactions"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Reactive_intermediate","Reaction_rate","Solvent","Chemical_polarity","Electrical_charge","Transition_state","Pericyclic","SN2","Reaction_rate","Transition_state"]}
