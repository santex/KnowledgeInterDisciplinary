{"cursor":"4778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] 'Thomas Winnington' (31 December 1696 â 23 April 1746), of Stanford Court,\nwas an English politician.\n\nWinnington was the son of Salwey Winnington of Stanford Court, Member of\nParliament for Bewdley, and grandson of Sir Francis Winnington, who had been\nSolicitor General in the 1670s. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ\nChurch, Oxford, and was admitted to Middle Temple in 1714.\n\nHe entered Parliament in 1726 as Whig member for Droitwich, and was re-elected\nthere at every general election for the rest of his life; however in 1741 he was\nalso elected for Worcester (a more prestigious constituency), and he chose to\nrepresent that city in what turned out to be his last Parliament.\n\nA supporter of the Prime Minister Robert Walpole, Winnington was made a Lord\nof the Admiralty in 1730, and served as a Lord of the Treasury from 1736 to\n1742; in 1741 he was made a Privy Counsellor and became Cofferer of the\nHousehold. When Henry Pelham became Prime Minister in 1743, he appointed\nWinnington Paymaster General of the Forces, the post he himself had held in\nthe previous administration (although unlike Pelham, Winnington was not\naccorded a seat in the Cabinet); he held this post for the remaining two-and-a-\nhalf years of his life.\n\nIn 1719, Winnington married Love Reade, daughter of Sir James Reade, Bt. of\nBrocket Hall, Hertfordshire. They had no children. The Stanford Court estate\nsubsequently passed to his cousin who became Sir Edward Winnington, 1st Baronet.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Thomas_Winnington_(1696–1746)","recorded":1375067183,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Winnington_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:C13b.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/C13b.jpeg/220px-C13b.jpeg","/wiki/File:C13b.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Michael_Dahl","/wiki/Salwey_Winnington","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Bewdley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Francis_Winnington_(Solicitor-General)","/wiki/Solicitor_General_for_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Westminster_School","/wiki/Christ_Church,_Oxford","/wiki/Middle_Temple","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Droitwich_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Worcester_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Robert_Walpole","/wiki/Lord_of_the_Admiralty","/wiki/Lord_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/Privy_Counsellor","/wiki/Cofferer_of_the_Household","/wiki/Henry_Pelham","/wiki/Paymaster_of_the_Forces","/wiki/Cabinet_(government)","/w/index.php?title=Sir_James_Reade,_2nd_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Brocket_Hall","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/Sir_Edward_Winnington,_1st_Baronet","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.leighrayment.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","http://www.stirnet.com/HTML/genie/british/zworking/winnington1.htm#con2","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp04890&rNo=0&role=sit","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Richard_Foley_(politician)","/wiki/Edward_Jeffreys","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Droitwich_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Richard_Foley_(politician)","/wiki/Edward_Foley_(1676%E2%80%931747)","/wiki/Thomas_Foley,_1st_Baron_Foley_(1716%E2%80%931777)","/wiki/Thomas_Foley,_1st_Baron_Foley_(1716%E2%80%931777)","/w/index.php?title=Lord_George_Bentinck_(1715-1759)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Samuel_Sandys","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Lockwood_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Worcester_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Samuel_Sandys","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Henry_Harpur,_5th_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Henry_Harpur,_5th_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thomas_Vernon_(Member_of_Parliament)","/wiki/Horatio_Walpole,_1st_Baron_Walpole_of_Wolterton","/wiki/Cofferer_of_the_Household","/wiki/Samuel_Sandys,_1st_Baron_Sandys","/wiki/Henry_Pelham","/wiki/Paymaster_of_the_Forces","/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/2028608","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Floral_Badge_of_Great_Britain.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Floral_Badge_of_Great_Britain.svg/26px-Floral_Badge_of_Great_Britain.svg.png","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:GreatBritain-MP-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:GreatBritain-MP-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:GreatBritain-MP-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Winnington_(1696–1746)&oldid=551291864","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1696_births","/wiki/Category:1746_deaths","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Christ_Church,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Lords_of_the_Admiralty","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Middle_Temple","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Westminster_School,_London","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1722%E2%80%931727","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1727%E2%80%931734","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1734%E2%80%931741","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1741%E2%80%931747","/wiki/Category:People_fr
