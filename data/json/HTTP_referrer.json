{"cursor":"8209","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'HTTP' '{{Not a typo|referer}}' (originally a misspelling of 'referrer') is an\nHTTP header field that identifies the address of the webpage (i.e. the URI or\nIRI) that linked to the resource being requested. By checking the referer, the\nnew webpage can see where the request originated.\n\nIn the most common situation this means that when a user clicks a hyperlink in a\nweb browser, the browser sends a request to the server holding the destination\nwebpage. The request includes the referer field, which says the last page the\nuser was on (the one where they clicked the link).\n\nReferer logging is used to allow websites and web servers to identify where\npeople are visiting them from, for promotional or statistical\npurposes.\n\nReferer is sometimes used to combat cross-site request forgery, but such\nsecurity mechanisms are limited by the ease of disabling or forging a\nreferer. A dereferer is a means to strip the details of the referring\nwebsite from a link request so that the target website cannot identify the page\nwhich was clicked on to originate a request.\n","linknr":206,"url":"HTTP_referrer","recorded":1362892404,"links":25,"instances":["networking","web_browser"],"pdf":[],"categories":["URI schemes","Uniform resource locator","HTTP headers"],"headings":["Origin of the term ''referer''","Details","Referer hiding","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["firewall","networking"],["opera","web_browser"]],"members":["firewall","opera"],"related":["List_of_HTTP_header_fields","Uniform_Resource_Identifier","Internationalized_Resource_Identifier","Hyperlink","Web_browser","Server_log","Website","Web_server","Cross-site_request_forgery","Phillip_Hallam-Baker","HTTP","Request_for_Comments","Roy_Fielding","Unix","Spell_checker","Document_Object_Model","Webpage","HTML","Web_browser","Web_log_analysis_software","Privacy","Proxy_server","Firewall_(networking)","Deep_linking","Bandwidth_theft","Referer_spam","Paysite","Referer_spoofing","Google_Search","Internet_security","Proxy_server","Opera_(web_browser)","World_Wide_Web_Consortium","HTTP_Secure","HTML5"]}
