He was also the leader of the Bougainville\nPeople's Congress.

In June 2005, after the island gained autonomy within\nPapua New Guinea, he was elected as President of Bougainville by a large\nmajority, winning 38,000 out of 69,385 votes.\n\nWhile in office, he granted a Canadian company, Invincible Resources, access\nrights to 70% of Bougainville's mineral resources, and he was widely criticized\nfor this decision. This was announced in 2008 with no prior\ndiscussion in Parliament, and shortly before Kabui's death it was expected that\na motion of no-confidence would be presented against him. In an interview\nshortly before his death, he said that his dream was \"to see Bougainville\n[become] a Kuwait of the Pacific\".

United Nations Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon called Kabui a \"skilled mediator and peacemaker who had a genuine\ninterest in the future of his people\", and according to Australian Foreign\nMinister Stephen Smith, Kabui played a \"key role in restoring Bougainville to\npeace following the bitter conflict on the island\".

His body\nwas returned to Buka on 11 June, and a funeral mass was held for him in Buka on\n12 June. His body was planned to be taken to Arawa, Panguna, and finally the\nvillage of Padorima in Central Bougainville. The Bougainville government\ndeclared a public holiday to mourn Kabui.

In an interview with the Port-\nCourier, a newspaper in Papua New Guinea, that he gave 12 hours before his\ndeath, Kabui said that he had stopped taking his heart medicine four months\nbeforehand and was taking a water tonic instead because the medicine was too\nexpensive. He dismissed suggestions of seeking help, saying that \"I am not a man\nthat would ask for things that concern me\", and he also said that he had missed\na medical check-up because he was too busy with work. His next check-up was\nscheduled for later in June, but he noted that the necessary trip to Australia\nwas expensive as well.\n\nVice-President John Tabinaman became Acting President following Kabui's death.\nThe existing method for filling a vacancy in the presidency is to hold a new\npopular election, and Tabinaman described this as likely, while also noting the\npossibility of a constitutional amendment that would instead allow Parliament to\nelect one of its members as President. Planning for\na new popular election subsequently began.
