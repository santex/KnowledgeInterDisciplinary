{"cursor":"13584","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Azide' is the anion with the formula N 3â . It is the\nconjugate base of hydrazoic acid. N 3â is a linear anion\nthat is isoelectronic with CO 2 and N 2O. Per valence bond\ntheory, azide can be described by several resonance structures, an important one\nbeing N â =N +=N â . Azide is also a functional\ngroup in organic chemistry, RN 3. The dominant\napplication of azides is as a propellant in air bags.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Azide","recorded":1362371453,"links":40,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/units/labsfty/labrsc/factsheets/Azides_FS26.pdf"],"categories":["Functional groups","Azides|"],"headings":["Applications","Preparation","Reactions","Safety","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Azid-Ion.svg/200px-Azid-Ion.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Azide-2D.png/200px-Azide-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Preparation_of_acyl_azides_from_acyl_chlorides.png/300px-Preparation_of_acyl_azides_from_acyl_chlorides.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Dutt-Wormall_Reaction.png/700px-Dutt-Wormall_Reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Iminoenaminoester.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Azidenorbornadieneinsertion.png/400px-Azidenorbornadieneinsertion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sulfonamide","chemistry"]],"members":["sulfonamide"],"related":["Conjugate_base","Hydrazoic_acid","Isoelectronic","Carbon_dioxide","Nitrous_oxide","Valence_bond_theory","Functional_group","Organic_chemistry","Air_bag","Sodium_azide","Air_bag","Lead_azide","DMAZ_","Amine","Click_reaction","Staudinger_ligation","Combinatorial_chemistry","Zidovudine","Bioorthogonal_chemical_reporters","Sodium_azide","Nitrous_oxide","Sodium_amide","Liquid_ammonia","Lead_azide","Detonator","Metathesis_reaction","Lead_nitrate","Pseudohalogen","Trimethylsilyl_azide","Nucleophilic_aromatic_substitution","Mitsunobu_reaction","Hydrazoic_acid","Sodium_nitrite","Phenyl_azide","Acyl_chloride","Sodium_azide","Acyl_azide","Isocyanates","Curtius_rearrangement","Trifluoromethanesulfonyl_azide","Imidazole-1-sulfonyl_azide","Diazonium_salt","Sulfonamide_(chemistry)","Hydrolysis","Sulfinic_acid","Hydrazoic_acid","Nucleophilic_substitution","Conjugate_addition","Organic_reactions","Nitrogen","Staudinger_ligation","Curtius_rearrangement","Sodium_azide","Acetone","Reflux","Chemical_yield","Amine","Titanium_tetrachloride","Diethyl_ether","Nucleophilic_aliphatic_substitution","Ketone","Amine","Imine","Tautomer","Enamine","Rearrangement_reaction","Trans_isomer","Amine","Hydrogenolysis","Triphenylphosphine","Staudinger_reaction","Azide_alkyne_Huisgen_cycloaddition","1,3-dipole","Alkyne","1,2,3-Triazole","Click_chemistry","Tosyl_azide","Norbornadiene","Nitrido","Explosophore","Sodium_azide","Carbon_disulfide","Bromine","Nitric_acid","Dimethyl_sulfate","Copper","Lead","Brønsted_acid","Hydrazoic_acid","Heavy_metals","Lead_azide","Primary_explosives","High_explosive","Detonation","Rotary_evaporator","Freeze_drying","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Dichloromethane","Chloroform","Pentazenium"]}
