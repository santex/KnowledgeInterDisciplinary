Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous\ntissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea,\ncartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. The fibroblast\nis the most common cell which creates collagen.\n\nIn muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen\nconstitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the\nweight of strong, tendinous muscles.<ref></ref> Gelatin, which is used in food\nand industry, is collagen that
