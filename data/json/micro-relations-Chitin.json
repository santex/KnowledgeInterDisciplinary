It is the main component of\nthe cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans\n(e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulas of mollusks, and\nthe beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuse s. In\nterms of structure, chitin may be compared to the polysaccharide cellulose and,\nin terms of function, to the protein keratin. Chitin has also proven useful for\nseveral medical and industrial purposes.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Chitin","recorded":1362375575,"links":70,"instances":["secretion","cephalopod","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf","http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf"],"categories":["Acetamides","Biomolecules","Biopesticides","Polysaccharides"],"headings":["Etymology","Chemistry, physical properties and biological function","Fossil record","Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Chitin.svg/220px-Chitin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Glanzkaefer.jpg/220px-Glanzkaefer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Lyristes_plebejus.jpg/220px-Lyristes_plebejus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gladius","cephalopod"],["lorica","biology"],["tectin","secretion"]],"members":["tectin","gladius","lorica"],"related":["Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Polymer","N-Acetylglucosamine","Glucose","Cell_wall","Fungi","Exoskeleton","Arthropod","Crustacean","Crab","Lobster","Shrimp","Insect","Radula","Mollusk","Cephalopod_beak","Gladius_(cephalopod)","Cephalopods","Squid","Octopus","Cellulose","Keratin","French_language","Greek_language","Mollusk","Greek_language","Tunic","Frock","Semitic","Akkadian_language","Flax","Linen","Sumerian_language","Albert_Hofmann","Polysaccharide","Biosynthesis","N-acetylglucosamine","Glucose","Cellulose","Cellulose","Hydroxyl","Monomer","Acetyl","Amine","Hydrogen_bonding","Polymers","Arthropod","Sclerotin","Protein","Exoskeleton","Composite_material","Calcium_carbonate","Crustacean","Caterpillar","Elytron","Beetle","Sclerotin","Cambrian","Trilobite","Oligocene","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Fertilizer","Chitosan","Pharmaceutical","Dye","Fabric","Adhesive","Reverse_osmosis","Ion-exchange","Resin","Sizing","Paper","Solar_cells","Tensile_strength","Surgical_suture","Biodegradation","Wound_healing","Asthma","Allergic_inflammation","Allergic","Interleukin-4","Chitinase","Biopesticide","Chitobiose","Chitosan","Lorica_(biology)","Sporopollenin","Tectin_(secretion)"]}
