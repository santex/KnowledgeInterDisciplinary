The VA Police have several divisions and operate separately\nbut alongside the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) under the\numbrella of the Office of Security and Law Enforcement. The primary role of VA\nPolice is to serve as a protective uniformed police force in order to deter and\nprevent crime, maintain order, and investigate crimes (ranging from summary to\nfelony offenses) which may have occurred within the jurisdiction of the\nDepartment or its federal assets. The role of investigating felony offenses is\nreferred and investigated in conjunction with agents from the Office of the\nInspector General (VA OIG).\n\nThe Office of Security and Law Enforcement (OS&LE) is the parent agency of the\nVA Police within the Law Enforcement Oversight & Criminal Investigation Division\n(LEO/CID) which provides national oversight to individual VA Police Services at\neach location throughout the United States. They also facilitate support,\nguidance, funds and regulation of the Police Service and their corresponding\nindependent facilities. Upper level management and specialty positions other\nthan Police Officer include (in no particular order); Detective, Special Agent,\nInspector, and Criminal Investigator. Other semi standardized rank structures\nare developed within each VA Police Service at the local level. These serve to\nreflect job title, function, and/or role and range from Sergeant to Chief. The\nVA Police also maintain groups of specialty service elements such as K-9,\nBicycle, and Motorcycle patrols.\n\nThe VA Police are an armed, federal law enforcement and protective service\nentity that operates in and around the various Veterans Affairs Medical Centers,\nNational Cemeteries and other VA facilities located throughout the whole of\nUnited States to include Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Among\nothers, the VA Police are a specialized federal law enforcement agency, whose\nofficers have full police powers derived from statutory authority to enforce all\nfederal laws, VA rules and regulations, and to make arrests on VA controlled\nproperty whether owned or leased.\n\nVA Police encounters and methods of law enforcement are often unique due to the\nfact that the majority of their work is conducted in and around a clinical or\nmedical setting. Enhanced methodology and incident solutions (including advanced\ninterpersonal communication, conflict resolution, and problem solving skills)\nare required by their officers to be successful; as in addition to the full\nrange of incidents and calls for service one might normally associate with\npolice work, the VA Police also often encounter trained military veterans\nsuffering from medical and psychological traumas. Beyond normal law enforcement\ncontact with the general public, VA Police officers also work in an environment\nwhich includes an extremely high percentage of individuals (to include patients\nand even other VA employees) who are military trained veterans (with an\nincreasingly large number of individuals who are returning combat veterans). VA\nPolice officers must strive to enforce the law while working with other VA staff\nto maintain an equitable balance; ensuring that the medical needs of the\nveterans/patients are being met while at the same time continuing to operate as\na full federal law enforcement agency.\n\nAlthough the Office of Security and Law Enforcement exists and policies and\ntraining are standardized, VA Police operate throughout the United States under\nthe direction of individual facility directors (much like a municipal agency\nwould function under a mayor), causing an extensive amount of difference in\noperational format. VA Police personnel serving in the Executive Protection\nDivision provide Protective Services for the United States Secretary of Veterans\nAffairs and the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Veterans Affairs\nPolice (Service) is made up of over 2800 appointed officers and administrative\npersonnel. The agency's motto is \"Protecting Those Who Served\".\n\nhttp://www.osp.va.gov/OSandLE_Overview.asp\n","linknr":217,"url":"United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police","recorded":1372152743,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police.png/120px-USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police.png","/wiki/File:VA_Police_Badge_2012.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/VA_Police_Badge_2012.jpg/107px-VA_Police_Badge_2012.jpg","/wiki/Government_agency","/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency#fedlea","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/List_of_Veterans_Affairs_medical_facilities","/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency#fedlea","/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency#civpol","/wiki/Washington,_DC","/wiki/Frederick_Jackson","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","http://www.osp.va.gov/OSandLE_Overview.asp","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","/wiki/List_of_Veterans_Affairs_medical_facilities","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration","/wiki/National_Cemetery_Administration","/wiki/Veterans_Benefits_Administration","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Federal_law_enforcement_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Arrest","/wiki/Executive_Protection","http://www.osp.va.gov/OSandLE_Overview.asp","#History","#Statutory_Authority","#Line-of-duty_deaths","#Personnel","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police_Badge.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police_Badge.png/100px-USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police_Badge.png","/wiki/File:USA_-_Veterans_Affairs_Police_Badge.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf4/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs","/wiki/Fire_safety","/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management","/wiki/General_Schedule","/wiki/United_States_federal_law","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Automobile_accident","/wiki/Bedford,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Brecksville,_Ohio","/wiki/Life_imprisonment","/wiki/Murder","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Metal_detector","/wiki/Ballistic_vest","/wiki/Heart_attack","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico","/wiki/Patrol_car","/wiki/Kirtland_Air_Force_Base","/wiki/Bowie_knife","/wiki/Gun_barrel","/wiki/Derringer","/wiki/Shotgun","/wiki/Shell_(projectile)","/wiki/San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Holster","/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","/wiki/Murder","/w/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs_Police&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Arrest","/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_law_enforcement_agencies","/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_and_local_law_enforcement_agencies","/wiki/Military_police","/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree","/wiki/Criminal_justice","/wiki/Fingerprinting","/wiki/Physical_examination","/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory","/wiki/Psychological_evaluation","/wiki/Background_investigation","/wiki/Fort_Logan_H._Roots","/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas","/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","/wiki/First_responder","/wiki/Pepper_spray","/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)","/wiki/Beretta_92","/wiki/SIG_Sauer","/wiki/P229","/w/index.php?title=DAK_Version&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/SIG_Sauer","/wiki/SIG_Sauer_P239","/w/index.php?title=DAK_Version&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/9x19mm_Parabellum","/wiki/Pentagon_Force_Protection_Agency","/w/index.php?title=Law_Enforcement_Retirement_System&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/109th_United_States_Congress","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Barack_Obama","http://www.osp.va.gov/Law_Enforcement_Training_Center_LETC.asp","/w/index.p
