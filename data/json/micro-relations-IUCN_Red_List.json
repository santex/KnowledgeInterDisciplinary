The International Union\nfor Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the world's main authority on the\nconservation status of species. A series of Regional Red Lists are produced by\ncountries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species\nwithin a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the extinction risk\nof thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all\nspecies and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of\nconservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the\ninternational community to try to reduce species extinction. According to IUCN\n(1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are (1) to provide\nscientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a\nglobal level, (2) to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of\nthreatened biodiversity, (3) to influence national and international policy and\ndecision-making, and (4) to provide information to guide actions to conserve\nbiological diversity. CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants\nCommittees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7â9 December 2000,\nretrieved Nov 14, 2012\n\nMajor species assessors include BirdLife International, the Institute of Zoology\n(the research division of the Zoological Society of London), the World\nConservation Monitoring Centre, and many Specialist Groups within the IUCN\nSpecies Survival Commission (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these\norganizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five\nyears if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a peer reviewed\nmanner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which\nare Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific\ngeographic area, or in the case of BirdLife International, an entire class\n(Aves).\n","linknr":381,"url":"IUCN_Red_List","recorded":1362373146,"links":86,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/RedList/RedListGuidelines.pdf","http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/RedList/RedListGuidelines.pdf","http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/06/possibly_extinct_paper.pdf","http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/06/possibly_extinct_paper.pdf","http://www.bdnj.org/pdf/IUCNRedListHistory.pdf","http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/commons/PDF%20Background%20Documents/Value%20of%20the%20IUCN%20Red%20List%20for%20Conservation.pdf","http://www.bgci.org/files/Worldwide/Publications/euro_report.pdf"],"categories":["1963 establishments","IUCN Red List|","Biota by conservation status|","1963 in the environment"],"headings":["History","Categories","Versions","Criticism","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/IUCN_Red_List.jpg/200px-IUCN_Red_List.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/IUCN_Red_List_2007.svg/400px-IUCN_Red_List_2007.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bufo_periglenes2.jpg/90px-Bufo_periglenes2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Status_iucn3.1.svg/240px-Status_iucn3.1.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Status_iucn3.1.svg/240px-Status_iucn3.1.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Status_iucn2.3.svg/220px-Status_iucn2.3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subspecies","biology"],["variety","biology"]],"members":["variety","subspecies"],"related":["Governmental_organization","Intergovernmental_organization","International_nongovernmental_organization","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","Species_Survival_Commission","Birdlife_International","Conservation_International","NatureServe","Botanic_Gardens_Conservation_International","Royal_Botanic_Gardens","Texas_A&M_University","Sapienza_University_of_Rome","Zoological_Society_of_London","Wildscreen","Conservation_movement","Species","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","Regional_Red_List","Extinction","BirdLife_International","Institute_of_Zoology","Zoological_Society_of_London","World_Conservation_Monitoring_Centre","IUCN_Species_Survival_Commission","Peer_review","BirdLife_International","Bird","Subspecies_(biology)","Variety_(biology)","Fish_stock","Subpopulation","World_Conservation_Union","Western_Lowland_Gorilla","Cross_River_Gorilla","Endangered","Critically_Endangered","Extinct_in_the_Wild","Ebola_virus","Poaching","Swiss","Sumatran_Orangutan","Bornean_Orangutan","Barcelona","Data_Deficient","United_Nations_Conference_on_Sustainable_Development","IUCN","Extinction","Extinct_in_the_Wild","Critically_endangered_species","Endangered_species","Vulnerable_species","Near_Threatened","Least_Concern","Data_Deficient","Not_Evaluated","Threatened_species","Conservation_Dependent","Near_Threatened","Least_Concern","Birdlife_International","Spix's_Macaw","Secrecy","CITES","Conservation_status","EDGE_of_Existence_Programme","EDGE_Species","Lists_of_organisms_by_population","Red_Data_Book_of_the_Russian_Federation","Red_List_Index","Regional_Red_List","Wildlife_conservation"]}
