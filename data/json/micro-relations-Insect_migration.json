{"cursor":"11057","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" cluster in Santa Cruz, California, where they have migrated to overwinter.]]\n\n'Insect migration' is the seasonal movement of insects, particularly those by\nspecies of dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths. The distance can vary\nwith species and in most cases these movements involve large numbers of\nindividuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not\nreturn and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction.\nThis is a significant difference from bird migration. A popular example of\ninsect migration is that of the Monarch butterfly which migrates from southern\nCanada to wintering sites in central Mexico where they spend the winter. In the\nlate winter/early spring, the adult monarchs leave the Transvolcanic mountain\nrange in Mexico for points North. Mating occurs and the females begin seeking\nout milkweed to lay their eggs, usually first in northern Mexico and southern\nTexas. The caterpillars hatch and develop into adults that move north, where\nmore offspring can go as far as Central Canada until next migratory cycle.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Insect_migration","recorded":1362668802,"links":25,"instances":["biology","geometry"],"pdf":["http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/pdfs/1990s/1991/1991-45(4)296-Lees.pdf","http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/pdfs/1990s/1991/1991-45(4)296-Lees.pdf"],"categories":["Entomology","Ethology","Animal migration"],"headings":["Definition","General patterns","Orientation","Lepidoptera","Orthoptera","Odonata","Coleoptera","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Monarch_butterflies_in_Santa_Cruz-11.jpg/280px-Monarch_butterflies_in_Santa_Cruz-11.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg/140px-Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","biology"],["orientation","geometry"]],"members":["polymorphism","orientation"],"related":["Santa_Cruz,_California","Overwinter","Insect","Dragonfly","Beetle","Butterfly","Moth","Bird_migration","Monarch_butterfly","Locust","Butterfly","Dragonflies","Polymorphism_(biology)","Navigation","Orientation_(geometry)","Magnetic","Bogong_moth","Insect","Australia","Monsoon","Pieridae","Nymphalidae"]}
