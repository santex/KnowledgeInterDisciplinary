The term was initially applied to the polysaccharide matrix excreted\nby epithelial cells forming a coating on the surface of epithelial tissue, but\nits functions have been discovered to go well beyond that. Most animal\nepithelial cells have a fuzzy coat called the glycocalyx on the external surface\nof its plasma membrane. This coating consists of several carbohydrate moieties\nof membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins, which serve as backbone molecules for\nsupport. Further research has shown that the glycocalyx, which is located on the\napical surface of endothelial cells, is composed of a negatively charged network\nof proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.

Pharmacological Reports, 2006, 57: 75-80.\nGenerally, the carbohydrate portion of the glycolipids found on the surface of\nplasma membranes helps these molecules contribute to cell-cell recognition,\ncommunication, and intracellular adhesion.

Included in the glycocalyx are cell-adhesion molecules that enable\ncells to adhere to each other and guide the movement of cells during embryonic\ndevelopment.
