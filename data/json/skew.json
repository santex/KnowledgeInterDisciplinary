that are neither parallel nor intersecting\n* Skew-symmetric matrix, a square matrix whose transpose is also its negative\n* Skew-Hermitian matrix, a complex square matrix whose conjugate transpose is\n  also its negative\n* Infinite skew polyhedron, an extension of the concept of polyhedra\n* Skew-symmetric graph, a directed graph that is isomorphic to its own\n  transpose graph\n* Skew polygon, a polygon whose vertices do not lie on a plane\n* Skew lattice, a non-commutative generalization of a lattice\n* Skew field or division ring, a (non-commutative) ring in which division\n  is possible\n* Skew tableau, a generalization of Young tableau\n* The shear mapping, a particular type of linear transformation\n\nIn 'statistics':\n* Skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution\n* Skew normal distribution, a continuous probability distribution that\n  generalises the normal distribution to allow for non-zero skewness\n\nIn 'chemistry' *Skew (also synclinal or gauche), a torsion angle between 30° to\n90° and –30° to –90°; see Alkane stereochemistry\n\nIn 'optics':\n* A skew ray, an optical path through a rotationally symmetric optical system\n  that is not in a plane of symmetry\n\nIn 'engineering':\n* A skew arch, a method of construction that enables an arch bridge to span an\n  obstacle at some angle other than a right angle\n\nIn 'finance':\n* Volatility skew, a downward-sloping volatility smile\n\nIn 'telecommunications':\n* Skew (fax), the angular deviation of the received frame from rectangularity\n* In parallel communication, the difference in arrival time of simultaneously\n  transmitted bits\n* For data recorded on multichannel magnetic tape, the difference between\n  reading times of bits recorded in a single transverse line. Skew is usually\n  interpreted to mean the difference in reading times between bits recorded on\n  the tracks at the extremities, or edges, of the tape.\n* Skew (antenna) a method to improve the horizontal radiation pattern In\n  'computers':\n* Clock skew, a phenomenon in which the clock signal arrives at different\n  components at different times.\n* In reference to computer disk drives, track-to-track skew is the angle between\n  the start of the data on a given track and the start of the data on the next.\n  This is important, as when reading the data in sequence from one track to the\n  next, time must be allowed for the read/write head to move to the next track,\n  during which the disk continues to rotate. Insufficient skew can force the\n  drive to wait almost an entire revolution for the data to pass under the head\n  again, resulting in extra revolutions per track to read the data. Excessive\n  skew can also lower the sustained data transfer rate.\n* Transitive data skew\n\nIn 'aviate':\n* Skew flip turnover, an aircraft maneuver\n\nIn 'fantasy baseball':\n* SKEW, a strategy that focuses on high impact middle relievers that register a\n  lot of strikeouts\n","title":"skew","headings":["See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: Skew_lines","1: Skew-symmetric_matrix","1: Skew-Hermitian_matrix","1: Infinite_skew_polyhedron","1: Skew-symmetric_graph","1: Skew_polygon","1: Skew_lattice","1: Division_ring","1: Skew_tableau","1: Shear_mapping","1: Skewness","1: Skew_normal_distribution","1: Alkane_stereochemistry","1: Skew_arch","1: Volatility_smile","1: Parallel_communication","1: Magnetic_tape","1: Clock_skew","1: Disk_drive","1: Transitive_data_skew","1: Skew_flip_turnover","1: Stock-keeping_unit"]}
