A 'myco-heterotroph' is the parasitic\nplant partner in this relationship. Myco-heterotrophy is considered a kind of\ncheating relationship and myco-heterotrophs are sometimes informally referred to\nas \"'mycorrhizal cheaters'\". This relationship is sometimes referred to as\n'mycotrophy', though this term is also used for plants that engage in\nmutualistic mycorrhizal relationships.\n","linknr":497,"url":"Myco-heterotroph","recorded":1362372985,"links":40,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04272.x/pdf","http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3pkota/courses/bio436/bidartondo2005.pdf","http://www-mykopat.slu.se/Groningen/Leake.pdf","http://www.esf.edu/EFB/horton/Trudell%20et%20al2003.pdf","http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://plantbio.berkeley.edu/~bruns/ftp/bidartondo2004a.pdf","http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/coev/pdf/selosse/A24.pdf","http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/coev/MA_Selosse/publications/Martos2009.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00872.x/pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060901170748/http://mercury.bio.uaf.edu/~lee_taylor/Design/Assets/pdfs/Taylor_ES157Chap15.pdf","http://mycorrhiza.ag.utk.edu/reviews/imhof_2009.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081216234455/http://plantbio.berkeley.edu/~bruns/ftp/hibbett2002.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326181533/http://www.mssf.org/mnews/0603mn.pdf"],"categories":["Botany","Ecology","Mycology","Parasitic plants|*","Symbiosis"],"headings":["Relationship between myco-heterotrophs and host fungi","Species diversity of myco-heterotrophs and host fungi","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Pink_indian_pipes.jpg/230px-Pink_indian_pipes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Uniflora-root.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cheating","biology"],["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism","cheating"],"related":["Symbiosis","Plants","Fungi","Parasitism","Photosynthesis","Parasitic_plant","Cheating_(biology)","Mutualism_(biology)","Mycorrhizal","Russula_brevipes","Mycelium","Chlorophyll","Photosystem","Orchid","Biological_life_cycle","Cuscuta","Vascular_tissue","Organic_matter","Saprotrophic","Saprophytes","Mycorrhiza","Epiparasites","Vascular_plants","Mycorrhizal_network","Monotropes","Orchids","Marchantiophyta","Gentian_family","Fern","Clubmosses","Gametophyte","Ectomycorrhizal","Arbuscular_mycorrhizal","Orchid_mycorrhizal","Parallel_evolution","Southern_Illinois_University_Carbondale"]}
