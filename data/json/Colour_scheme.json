For example, the use of a white background with black text is an\nexample of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design.\n\nColor schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an\naesthetic feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color\nschemes. A basic color scheme will use two colors that look appealing together.\nMore advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based\naround a single color; for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange\nand light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article.\n\nColor schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example,\na color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light\n(almost white) to very dark.\n\nUse of the phrase 'color scheme' may also and commonly does refer to choice and\nuse of colors used outside typical aesthetic media and context, although may\nstill be used for purely aesthetic effect as well as for purely practical\nreasons. This most typically refers to color patterns and designs as seen on\nvehicles, particularly those used in the military when concerning color patterns\nand designs used for identification of friend or foe, identification of specific\nmilitary units, or as camouflage.\n\nA color scheme in marketing is referred to as a '[[trade dress]]' and can be\nsometimes be copyrighted, as is the pink color of Owens-Corning\nfiberglass.\n","linknr":205,"url":"Colour_scheme","recorded":1362540519,"links":17,"instances":["color","computer_science","miami","color","color","united_states","color","color","color"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Color","Colour schemes|"],"headings":["On the color wheel","Examples of media where color schemes are used","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Miamifireworks.jpg/300px-Miamifireworks.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AnalogousColors.png/220px-AnalogousColors.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["independence_day","united_states"],["bank_of_america_tower","miami"],["white","color"],["black","color"],["default","computer_science"],["red","color"],["yellow","color"],["orange","color"],["blue","color"]],"members":["orange","default","bank_of_america_tower","white","blue","independence_day","black","red","yellow"],"related":["Miami,_Florida","Independence_Day_(United_States)","Bank_of_America_Tower_(Miami)","Color_theory","Color","Design","White_(color)","Black_(color)","Default_(computer_science)","Web_design","Aesthetics","Red_(color)","Yellow_(color)","Orange_(color)","Blue_(color)","Vehicles","Military","Identification_friend_or_foe","Camouflage","Marketing","Copyright","Pink","Owens-Corning","Fiberglass","Color_wheel","Monochromatic_color","Tints_and_shades","Complementary_color","Color_wheel","Graphic_design","Product_packaging","Logo_design","Advertising","Graphical_user_interfaces","GNOME","KDE","Blackbox","Irix","4dwm","World_Wide_Web","Cascading_Style_Sheet","HTML","Publishing","Interior_design","Video_Games","Art","Light-on-dark_color_scheme","Dark-on-light_color_scheme","Color_tool","Monochromatic_color","Complementary_color"]}
