Ares V was also planned\nto carry supplies for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and\nthe smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the Greek god of war, which is the\nequivalent to the Roman god Mars.\n\nInitially, the Ares V would have launched the Earth Departure Stage and Altair\nlunar lander had NASA returned to the Moon, which was planned for 2019, but\nwould also have served as the principal launcher for missions beyond the Earth-\nMoon system, including the program's ultimate goal, a manned mission to Mars\nafter 2030. The unmanned Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-\nrated Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4â6 person Orion spacecraft. Both\nrockets, deemed safer than the current Space Shuttle, would have utilized\ntechnologies developed for the Apollo program, the Shuttle, and the Delta IV\nEELV programs. However, the Constellation\nprogram, including Ares V and Ares I was canceled in October 2010 by the passage\nof the 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011 NASA detailed the Space\nLaunch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's\norbit.
