The\ncountry geographically comprises two main landmasses â that of the North and\nSouth Islands â and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east\nof Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island\nnations of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one\nof the last lands to be settled by humans.\n\nPolynesians settled New Zealand in 1250â1300 CE and developed a distinctive\nMÄori culture, and Europeans first made contact in 1642 CE. The introduction of\npotatoes and muskets triggered upheaval among MÄori early during the 19th\ncentury, which led to the inter-tribal Musket Wars. In 1840 the British and\nMÄori signed a treaty making New Zealand a colony of the British Empire.\nImmigrant numbers increased sharply and conflicts escalated into the New\nZealand Wars, which resulted in much MÄori land being confiscated in the mid\nNorth Island. Economic depressions were followed by periods of political\nreform, with women gaining the vote during the 1890s, and a welfare state being\nestablished from the 1930s. After World War II, New Zealand joined Australia\nand the United States in the ANZUS security treaty, although the United States\nlater, until 2010, suspended the treaty after New Zealand banned nuclear\nweapons. New Zealand is part of the intelligence sharing among the Anglosphere\ncountries, the UKUSA Agreement. New Zealanders enjoyed one of the highest\nstandards of living in the world in the 1950s, but the 1970s saw a deep\nrecession, worsened by oil shocks and the United Kingdom's entry into the\nEuropean Economic Community. The country underwent major economic changes\nduring the 1980s, which transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised\nfree-trade economy. Markets for New Zealand's agricultural exports have\ndiversified greatly since the 1970s, with once-dominant exports of wool being\novertaken by dairy products, meat, and recently wine.\n\nDuring its long isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of\nanimal, fungal and plant life. Most notable are the large number of unique bird\nspecies, many of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and introduced\nmammals. With a mild maritime climate, the land was mostly covered in forest.\nThe country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks owe much to the\ntectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions caused by the Pacific and Indo-\nAustralian Plates clashing beneath the earth's surface.\n\nThe majority of New Zealand's population is of European descent; the indigenous\nMÄori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and non-MÄori Polynesians.\nEnglish, MÄori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with\nEnglish predominant. Much of New Zealand's culture is derived from MÄori and\nearly British settlers. Early European art was dominated by landscapes and to a\nlesser extent portraits of MÄori. A recent resurgence of MÄori culture has seen\ntheir traditional arts of carving, weaving and tattooing become more mainstream.\nMany artists now combine MÄori and Western techniques to create unique art\nforms. The country's culture has also been broadened by globalisation and\nincreased immigration from the Pacific Islands and Asia. New Zealand's diverse\nlandscape provides many opportunities for outdoor pursuits and has provided the\nbackdrop for a number of big budget movies.\n\nNew Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial\nauthorities for local government purposes; these have less autonomy than the\ncountry's long defunct provinces did. Nationally, executive political power is\nexercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. Queen Elizabeth II is the\ncountry's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. The Queen's\nRealm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook\nIslands and Niue (self-governing but in free association); and the Ross\nDependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand\nis a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Commonwealth of Nations,\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum,\nand the United Nations.\n","linknr":3266,"url":"New_Zealand","recorded":1362373230,"links":322,"instances":["economics","dialect","consulting_firm","continent","1987","sports","art","ship","people","building","norm","insead","social_science","māori_mythology","proposed_law","biology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20071125133402/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/F9967810-E15B-4D28-A8E3-DBAD6B80954C/0/UnderstandingWorkingEthnicityData.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071125133402/http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/F9967810-E15B-4D28-A8E3-DBAD6B80954C/0/UnderstandingWorkingEthnicityData.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","https://www.adelaide.edu.au/apsa/docs_papers/Others/Fitzpatrick.pdf","https://www.adelaide.edu.au/apsa/docs_papers/Others/Fitzpatrick.pdf","http://www.victoria.ac.nz/css/docs/Working_Papers/WP21.pdf","http://www.victoria.ac.nz/css/docs/Working_Papers/WP21.pdf","http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/pdf/hoc_fr_bulletins/31_bulletin.pdf","http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/pdf/hoc_fr_bulletins/31_bulletin.pdf","http://www.anzrsai.org/system/files/f8/f9/f39/f40/o186//Dollery%20sustaining%20regions%20article.pdf","http://www.anzrsai.org/system/files/f8/f9/f39/f40/o186//Dollery%20sustaining%20regions%20article.pdf","http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/councilMeetings/cic-council-statutory-minutes-281010.pdf","http://www.cic.govt.nz/pdfs/councilMeetings/cic-council-statutory-minutes-281010.pdf","http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/oceans/offshore-options-jun05/offshore-options-jun05.pdf","http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/oceans/offshore-options-jun05/offshore-options-jun05.pdf","http://nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_115.pdf","http://nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_115.pdf","http://marineornithology.org/PDF/35_2/35_2_97-107.pdf","http://marineornithology.org/PDF/35_2/35_2_97-107.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii/main/fullreport/files/Global%20Innovation%20Index%202012.pdf","http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii/main/fullreport/files/Global%20Innovation%20Index%202012.pdf","http://www.teara.govt.nz/files/3_308_StandardOfLiving_Comparison_0.pdf","http://www.ariplex.com/~economic-myth-busters/hazledine-taking%20nz%20seriously.pdf","http://www.ariplex.com/~economic-myth-busters/hazledine-taking%20nz%20seriously.pdf","http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Documents/Key%20Statistics/KeyTourismStatisticsApr2010.pdf","http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Documents/Key%20Statistics/KeyTourismStatisticsApr2010.pdf","http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Documents/International%20Market%20Profiles/Total%20Profile.pdf","http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Documents/International%20Market%20Profiles/Total%20Profile.pdf","http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf","http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf","http://panz.rsnz.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/nzpr-vol-30-1and-2_callister.pdf","http://panz.rsnz.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/nzpr-vol-30-1and-2_callister.pdf","http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/research/sopemi/2009-2010/imo-2009-2010.pdf","http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/research/sopemi/2009-2010/imo-2009-2010.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110610100533/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/qstats-about-culture-and-identity-2006-census.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110610100533/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/qstats-about-culture-and-identity-2006-census.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110623185936/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fop/2011/FOTP2011GlobalRegionalTables.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110623185936/http://www.freedomhouse.org/images/File/fop/2011/FOTP2011GlobalRegionalTables.pdf","http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ASSHSSH/ASSHSSH11.pdf","http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/ASSHSSH/ASSHSSH11.pdf","http://www.activenzsurvey.org.nz/Documents/Participation-Levels.pdf","http://www.activenzsurvey.org.nz/Documents/Participation-Levels.pdf"],"categories":["Archipelagoes
