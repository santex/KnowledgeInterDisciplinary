About 44% of the sun's electromagnetic\n radiation that reaches the ground is in the visible light range.]]\n\n'Visible light' (commonly referred to simply as 'light') is electromagnetic\nradiation that is visible to the human eye, and is responsible for the sense of\nsight. CIE (1987). [http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html\nInternational Lighting Vocabulary]. Number 17.4. CIE, 4th edition. ISBN 978-3-900734-07-\n7. By the International Lighting Vocabulary, the definition of light is: âAny\nradiation capable of causing a visual sensation directly.â Visible light\nhas a wavelength in the range of about 380 nanometres to about 740 nm â\nbetween the invisible infrared, with longer wavelengths and the invisible\nultraviolet, with shorter wavelengths.\n\nPrimary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation direction,\nfrequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarisation, while its speed in a vacuum,\n299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental constants of nature.\nVisible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is\nexperimentally found to always move at this speed in vacuum.\n\nIn common with all types of EMR, visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny\n\"packets\" called photons, and exhibits properties of both waves and particles.\nThis property is referred to as the waveâparticle duality. The study of light,\nknown as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.\n\nIn physics, the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of\nany wavelength, whether visible or not. This article\nfocuses on visible light. See the electromagnetic radiation article for the\ngeneral term.\n","linknr":780,"url":"Visible_light","recorded":1362575489,"links":157,"instances":["philosophy","classical_element","geometry","optics","tv_series","physics","physics","unit","scientist","optics","physics","moon","lighting","electromagnetic_radiation","california","waves","optics","astronomy","physics","united_states_coin"],"pdf":["http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf"],"categories":["Light|"],"headings":["Speed
