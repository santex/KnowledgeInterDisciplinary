{"cursor":"12967","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n living history museum.]] A 'dye' is a colored substance that has an affinity\n to the to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an\n aqueous solution, and requires a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on\n the fiber.\n\nBoth dyes and pigments appear to be colored because they absorb some wavelengths\nof light more than others. In contrast with a dye, a pigment generally is\ninsoluble, and has no affinity for the substrate. Some dyes can be precipitated\nwith an inert salt to produce a lake pigment, and based on the salt used they\ncould be aluminum lake, calcium lake or barium lake pigments.\n\nDyed flax fibers have been found in the Republic of Georgia dated back in a\nprehistoric cave to 36,000 BP.

PMID 19745144\n[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online\nMaterial] Archaeological evidence shows that, particularly in India and\nPhoenicia, dyeing has been widely carried out for over 5,000 years. The dyes\nwere obtained from animal, vegetable or mineral origin, with none to very little\nprocessing. By far the greatest source of dyes has been from the plant kingdom,\nnotably roots, berries, bark, leaves and wood, but only a few have ever been\nused on a commercial scale.\n","linknr":395,"url":"dye","recorded":1362560869,"links":52,"instances":["color","country","chemistry","biology","dye"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dyes|"],"headings":["Natural dye","Synthetic dye","Dye types","Food dyes","Other important dyes","Chemical classification","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Conner-prairie-yarn-drying.jpg/300px-Conner-prairie-yarn-drying.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Dyeing_British_Library_Royal_MS_15.E.iii%2C_f._269_1482.jpg/300px-Dyeing_British_Library_Royal_MS_15.E.iii%2C_f._269_1482.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Blick_in_Farbstoffsammlung_01.JPG/300px-Blick_in_Farbstoffsammlung_01.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/RITdye.JPG/220px-RITdye.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Teinture_naturelle_Millepertuis_2.jpg/100px-Teinture_naturelle_Millepertuis_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","chemistry"],["georgia","country"],["kermes","dye"],["staining","biology"],["chartreuse","color"]],"members":["chartreuse","georgia","precipitation","staining","kermes"],"related":["Living_history_museum","Color","Chemical_affinity","Aqueous_solution","Mordant","Light","Pigment","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Lake_pigment","Flax","Georgia_(country)","Before_Present","Archaeology","India","Phoenicia","Dyeing","Animal","Vegetable","Mineral","Plant_kingdom","Root","Berry","Bark","Leaf","Wood","Root","Berry","Bark","Leaf","Wood","Fungi","Lichen","Textile","Neolithic","Tyrian_purple","Kermes_(dye)","Isatis_tinctoria","Indigo_dye","Trade_and_use_of_saffron","Rubia","Resist_dyeing","New_World","Cochineal","Haematoxylum_campechianum","Spain","Organic_compound","Mauveine","Serendipity","Sir_William_Henry_Perkin","Water","Soluble","Anionic","Fiber","Silk","Wool","Nylon","Acrylic_fiber","Cationic","Cellulose","Cationic","Acrylic_fiber","Acetic_acid","Paper","Alkaline","Boiling_point","Sodium_chloride","Sodium_sulfate","Sodium_carbonate","Cotton","Leather","Nylon","PH_indicator","Staining_(biology)","Mordant","Light","Perspiration","Potassium_dichromate","Alkaline_liquor","Alkali","Metal","Salt","Oxidation","Chromophore","Substituent","Chemical_reaction","Covalent","Procion_MX","Cibacron_F","Drimarene_K","Cotton","Cellulose","Cellulose_acetate","Polyester","Cellulose_triacetate","Temperature","Azo_compound","Chartreuse_(color)","Food_coloring","Food_additive","Law","Azo_compound","Anthraquinone","Triphenylmethane","Green","Blue","Rhodamine_6G","Coumarin","F._J._Duarte","Leather","Fluorescent_brightener","Solvent_dye","Carbene_dye","Chromophore","Acridine","Anthraquinone","Triphenylmethane","Azo_compound","Diazonium","Nitro_functional_group","Nitroso","Phthalocyanine","Quinone","Safranin","Nile_red","Thiazole","Xanthene","Fluorene","Pyronin","Fluorone","Rhodamine","Biological_pigment","Blue_Wool_Scale","Hair_coloring","J-aggregate","Oxidant","Phototendering","Laser_dye","List_of_dyes","Stain"]}
