The mass of hyphae is sometimes called 'shiro', especially within\n the fairy ring fungi. Fungal colonies composed of mycelia are found in soil and\n on or within many other substrates. A typical single spore germinates into a\n homokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible\n homokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may\n form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms. A mycelium may be minute, forming a\n colony that is too small to see, or it may be extensive: site in eastern Oregon\n had a contiguous growth of mycelium before logging roads cut through\n it.Estimated at 1,665 football fields in size and 2,200 years old, this one\n fungus has killed the forest above it several times over, and in so doing has\n built deeper soil layers that allow the growth of ever-larger stands of trees.\n Mushroom-forming forest fungi are unique in that their mycelial mats can\n achieve such massive proportions.|Paul Stamets, [[Mycelium Running]]}}\n\nIt is through the mycelium that a fungus absorbs nutrients from its environment.\nIt does this in a two-stage process. First, the hyphae secrete enzymes onto or\ninto the food source, which break down biological polymers into smaller units\nsuch as monomers. These monomers are then absorbed into the mycelium by\nfacilitated diffusion and active transport.\n\nMycelia are vital in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for their role in the\ndecomposition of plant material. They contribute to the organic fraction of\nsoil, and their growth releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The\nmycelium of mycorrhizal fungi increases the efficiency of water and nutrient\nabsorption of most plants and confers resistance to some plant pathogens.\nMycelia are an important food source for many soil invertebrates.\n\nSclerotia are compact or hard masses of mycelia.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Mycelium","recorded":1362507225,"links":45,"instances":["fungi"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fungal morphology and anatomy"],"headings":["Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Mushroom%27s_roots_%28myc%C3%A9lium%29.jpg/220px-Mushroom%27s_roots_%28myc%C3%A9lium%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/20100815_1818_Mold.jpg/220px-20100815_1818_Mold.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/20100916_011605_Mycelium.jpg/220px-20100916_011605_Mycelium.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Oyster_mushroom_%28Pleurotus_ostreatus%29_mycelium_in_petri_dish_on_coffee_grounds.JPG/220px-Oyster_mushroom_%28Pleurotus_ostreatus%29_mycelium_in_petri_dish_on_coffee_grounds.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sporocarp","fungi"]],"members":["sporocarp"],"related":["Vegetative_reproduction","Fungus","Hypha","Fairy_rings","Spore","Homokaryotic","Sporocarp_(fungi)","Mushroom","Paul_Stamets","Nutrient","Enzyme","Biopolymers","Monomers","Facilitated_diffusion","Active_transport","Ecosystem","Decomposition","Carbon_dioxide","Mycorrhiza","Sclerotia","Fungi","Decomposition","Petroleum","Pesticide","Pollutant","Mycoremediation","Paul_Stamets","Microorganism","Mycofiltration","Mycorrhiza","Crop_yield","Woody_plants","Greensulate","Ecocradle","Styrofoam","Ecovative_Design","Steelcase","TED_Talks","Quorn","Carbon_cycle","Paul_Stamets"]}
