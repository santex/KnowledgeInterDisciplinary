For example, during a failure of an ingress-egress control system,\ne.g., a user propping a door open somewhere in a building, a fail-secure lock\nwill close, lock, and remain locked even when a user attempts to unlock it with\nthe key that the user usually employs. In such a case, an independent release,\nsuch as a reboot or disarming of the securing mechanism, is required. In\ncontrast, a component may be considered fail-safe even if its failure does not\nsecure the system. For example, if a door locked from the inside is left\nunlocked or is unlocked at the wrong time, it has failed (in some cases, along\nwith the entire system), the door may be (but is not necessarily) fail-safe if\nits being unlocked does not open it or attract additional attention to its\nunlocked state.\n\nSignificantly, despite popular belief to the contrary, \"[http://www.audioenglish.net/dictionary/fail-\nsafe.htm Fail-safe]\".

Accessed 2009.12.31 a system's\nbeing \"fail-safe\" means not that failure is impossible/improbable, but rather\nthat the system's design prevents or mitigates unsafe consequences of the\nsystem's failure; that is, if and when a \"fail-safe\" system \"fails\", it is\n\"safe\" or at least no less safe than when it is operating correctly. e.g.,\nDavid B.
