It\nseparates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. Wingerd, 166 A\nsimilar structure is found in crocodilians, but, in most other tetrapods, the\noral and nasal cavities are not truly separate. The palate is divided into two\nparts, the anterior bony '[[hard palate]]', and the posterior fleshy '[[soft\npalate]]' or 'velum'. Wingerd, 478 Clayman, 1995 Gray's\nAnatomy, 1172 The maxillary nerve branch of the trigeminal nerve (V)\nsupplies sensory innervation to the palate.\n\nThe hard palate forms before birth. If the fusion is incomplete, it is called a\ncleft palate. As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the\nsense of taste, palate can also refer to this sense itself, as in the phrase \"a\ndiscriminating palate\". By further extension, the flavor of a food\n(particularly beer or wine) may be called its palate, as when a wine is said to\nhave an oaky palate.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Palate","recorded":1362373483,"links":63,"instances":["disambiguation","linguistics","wine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Palate"],"headings":["Etymology","Function","See also","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Illu01_head_neck.jpg/250px-Illu01_head_neck.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/06-06-06palataltori.jpg/250px-06-06-06palataltori.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oak","wine"],["derivative","linguistics"],["palette","disambiguation"]],"members":["palette","derivative","oak"],"related":["Torus_palatinus","Mouth","Mammal","Oral_cavity","Nasal_cavity","Crocodilian","Tetrapod","Maxillary_nerve","Trigeminal_nerve","Sensory_innervation","Cleft_palate","Taste","Oak_(wine)","History_of_the_English_language","Synonyms","Palatine_bone","Latin","Old_French","Derivative_(linguistics)","Velar_consonant","Palatal_consonant","Palatalization","Postalveolar_consonant","Alveolo-palatal_consonant","Uvular_consonant","Consonant","Hard_palate","Soft_palate","Cleft_palate","Language","Vocal_tract","Pallet","Palette_(disambiguation)","Pellet","Palatability"]}
