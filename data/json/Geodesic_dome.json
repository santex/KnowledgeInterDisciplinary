{"cursor":"23695","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" at Epcot, Walt Disney World, a geodesic sphere]] A 'geodesic dome' is a\n spherical or partial-spherical shell structure or lattice shell based on a\n network of great circles (geodesics) on the surface of a sphere. The geodesics\n intersect to form triangular elements that have local triangular rigidity and\n also distribute the stress across the structure. When completed to form a\n complete sphere, it is a 'geodesic sphere'. A dome is enclosed, unlike open\n geodesic structures such as playground climbers.\n\nTypically a geodesic dome design begins with an icosahedron inscribed in a\nhypothetical sphere, tiling each triangular face with smaller triangles, then\nprojecting the vertices of each tile to the sphere. The endpoints of the links\nof the completed sphere are the projected endpoints on the sphere's surface. If\nthis is done exactly, sub-triangle edge lengths take on many different values,\nrequiring links of many sizes. To minimize this, simplifications are made. The\nresult is a compromise of triangles with their vertices lying approximately on\nthe sphere. The edges of the triangles form approximate geodesic paths over the\nsurface of the dome.\n\nGeodesic designs can be used to form any curved, enclosed space. Standard\ndesigns tend to be used because unusual configurations may require complex,\nexpensive custom design of each strut, vertex and panel.\n","linknr":357,"url":"Geodesic_dome","recorded":1362375361,"links":39,"instances":["film_series","physics","pin","tensegrity_sphere","geometry","theme_park","graphics","fuller"],"pdf":["http://www.mero-tsk.de/uploads/tx_cwtcartoongallery/Eden_Project_english.pdf"],"categories":["Geodesic
