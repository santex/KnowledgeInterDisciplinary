The radius of the planet's orbit is 7 million kilometres,\nabout 0.047 astronomical units, or one eighth the radius of Mercury's orbit.\nThis small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth days long and an estimated\nsurface temperature of about 1,000 Â°C (about 1,800 Â°F). Its mass is 220 times\nthat of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater\nthan that of Jupiter. The high mass and great volume of HD 209458 b indicate\nthat it is a gas giant.\n\nHD 209458 b represents a number of milestones in extraplanetary research. It was\nthe first of many categories: a transiting extrasolar planet discovered, an\nextrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere, an extrasolar planet observed to\nhave an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere, an extrasolar planet found to have an\natmosphere containing oxygen and carbon, one of the first two extrasolar planets\nto be directly observed spectroscopically and the first extrasolar gas giant to\nhave its superstorm measured, and the first planet to have its orbital speed\nmeasured, determining its mass directly. Based on the\napplication of new, theoretical models, as of April 2007, it is alleged to be\nthe first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere.
