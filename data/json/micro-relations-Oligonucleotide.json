{"cursor":"5896","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Oligonucleotides' are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that have a\nwide range of applications in genetic testing, research, and forensics. Commonly\nmade in the laboratory by solid-phase chemical synthesis, these small bits of\nnucleic acids can be manufactured with any user-specified sequence, and so are\nvital for artificial gene synthesis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA\nsequencing, library construction and as molecular probes. In nature,\noligonucleotides are usually found as small RNA molecules that function in the\nregulation of gene expression (e.g. microRNA), or are degradation intermediates\nderived from the breakdown of larger nucleic acid molecules.\n\nOligonucleotides are characterized by the sequence of nucleotide residues that\ncomprise the entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually\ndenoted by \"-mer\" (from Greek meros, \"part\"). For example, an oligonucleotide of\nsix nucleotides (nt) is an hexamer, while one of 25 nt would usually be called a\n\"25-mer\". Oligonucleotides readily bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to their\nrespective complementary oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA to form duplexes or, less\noften, hybrids of a higher order. This basic property serves as a foundation for\nthe use of oligonucleotides as probes for detecting DNA or RNA. Examples of\nprocedures that use oligonucleotides include DNA microarrays, Southern blots,\nASO analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the synthesis of\nartificial genes. Oligonucleotides are also indispensable elements in antisense\ngene therapy.\n\nOligonucleotides composed of 2'-deoxyribonucleotides (oligodeoxyribonucleotides)\nare fragments of DNA and are often used in the polymerase chain reaction, a\nprocedure that can greatly amplify almost any small amount of DNA. There, the\noligonucleotide is referred to as a primer, allowing DNA polymerase to extend\nthe oligonucleotide and replicate the complementary strand.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Oligonucleotide","recorded":1362508112,"links":30,"instances":["molecular_biology","molecular_biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nucleic acids"],"headings":["Synthesis","Antisense oligonucleotides","DNA microarray","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["primer","molecular_biology"],["translation","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["complementarity","primer","polymorphism","translation"],"related":["DNA","RNA","Genetic_testing","Recombinant_DNA","Forensic_DNA","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Artificial_gene_synthesis","Polymerase_chain_reaction","DNA_sequencing","Molecular_cloning","Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization","MicroRNA","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Monomer","Greek_Language","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Hybridization_probe","DNA_microarray","Southern_blot","Allele_specific_oligonucleotide","Fluorescent_in_situ_hybridization","Nucleotide","DNA","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Primer_(molecular_biology)","DNA_polymerase","Phosphoramidite","Nucleoside","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Antisense_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Messenger_RNA","Non-coding_RNA","RNase_H","Aptamer","Morpholino","Polymorphism_(biology)","Genomic_signature","Polynucleotide","CpG_Oligodeoxynucleotide","K-mer"]}
