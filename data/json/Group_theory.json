{"cursor":"31177","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics and abstract algebra, 'group theory' studies the algebraic\nstructures known as groups. The concept of a group is central to abstract\nalgebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and\nvector spaces can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and\naxioms. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory\nhave strongly influenced many parts of algebra. Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two\nbranches of group theory that have experienced tremendous advances and have\nbecome subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as crystals and the hydrogen atom, can be\nmodelled by symmetry groups. Thus group theory and the closely related\nrepresentation theory have many applications in physics and chemistry.\n\nOne of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century *\nElwes,
