He taught creative writing and English for 27 years in universities\nincluding the University of Western Ontario and the University of New Brunswick.\n\nMcKay is the author of twelve books of poetry, including Long Sault (1975),\nLependu (1978), and Apparatus (1997). He has twice won the Governor General's\nAward, for Night Field (1991) and Another Gravity (2000). In June 2007, he won\nthe Griffin Poetry Prize for Strike/Slip (2006).\n\nAlthough McKay has been publishing since 1973, literary writing on his poetry is\nrecent. Much critical examination of his work is yet to be done.\n\nHe has made a wide impression as a teacher and editor. He is the co-founder and\nmanuscript reader for Brick Books, one of Canada's leading poetry presses, and\nwas editor of the literary journal [[The Fiddlehead]] from 1991-96. He has\nparticipated in the Sage Hill Writing experience in Saskatchewan and he is\nAssociate Director for poetry at the Banff Centre for the Arts Writing Studio.\nHe has edited many books by fellow poets, including Ken Babstock, George Elliot\nClarke, Tim Lilburn, Barbara Colebrook Peace, and Michael Redhill.\n\nMcKay is an avid birdwatcher; and bird themes and flight are dominant topics in\nhis poetry. In Birding, or Desire (1983), the quirky protagonist is never far\nfrom his Birds of Canada hobbyist's field guide. McKay's passion for birds and\nnature percolates throughout all of his work. McKay sees his writing as ânature\npoetry in a time of environmental crisis.â McKay, Don. Vis-Ã -Vis: Field\nNotes on Poetry & Wilderness. Wolfville: Gaspereau Press, 2001, p.9.\nMcKay's poems are ecologically centred, inspired by the conflict between\ninspiration and spiritual, instinct and knowledge. Other members of this\nemerging group of âecopoetsâ include Tim Lilburn, Dennis Lee, Roo Borson, Robert\nBringhurst, and Jan Zwicky.\n\nHis book of poetic philosophy Vis Ã  Vis: Field Notes on Poetry & Wilderness,\ndetails many of McKay's beliefs on metaphor, wildness, and the homing instinct.\nMcKay's essay âBaler Twine,â touches on his main poetic themes as well as those\nof MatÃ©riel and poetic attention.\n\nIn 2008, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Don_McKay","recorded":1374779735,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Haden_Church","/wiki/Don_McKay_(film)","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Poet","/wiki/Essayist","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Poet","/wiki/Editing","/wiki/Educator","/wiki/Owen_Sound,_Ontario","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Cornwall,_Ontario","/wiki/University_of_Western_Ontario","/wiki/University_of_Wales","/wiki/PhD","/wiki/University_of_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Governor_General%27s_Award","/wiki/Griffin_Poetry_Prize","/w/index.php?title=Brick_Books&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Fiddlehead","/wiki/Saskatchewan","/wiki/Banff_Centre_for_the_Arts","/wiki/Ken_Babstock","/wiki/George_Elliot_Clarke","/wiki/Tim_Lilburn","/wiki/Michael_Redhill","/wiki/Birdwatching","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Tim_Lilburn","/wiki/Dennis_Lee_(author)","/wiki/Roo_Borson","/wiki/Robert_Bringhurst","/wiki/Jan_Zwicky","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","#cite_note-2","#Bibliography","#Poetry","#Other","#Secondary_sources","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/1973_in_literature","/wiki/1975_in_literature","/wiki/1978_in_literature","/wiki/1980_in_literature","/wiki/1983_Governor_General%27s_Awards","#cite_note-100can-3","/wiki/1987_in_literature","/wiki/1991_Governor_General%27s_Awards","#cite_note-100can-3","/wiki/1997_Governor_General%27s_Awards","#cite_note-100can-3","/wiki/Griffin_Poetry_Prize","#cite_note-gr07-4","/wiki/Griffin_Poetry_Prize","#cite_note-gr07-4","/wiki/Griffin_Poetry_Prize","/wiki/Dorothy_Livesay_Poetry_Prize","#cite_note-gr07-4","/w/index.php?title=M%C3%A9ira_Cook&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Angelo_Longo&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/2002_Governor_General%27s_Awards","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Quill_and_ink.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg/28px-Quill_and_ink.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Poetry","/wiki/List_of_Canadian_writers","/wiki/List_of_Canadian_poets","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5601","#cite_ref-100can_3-0","#cite_ref-100can_3-1","#cite_ref-100can_3-2","http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/faculties/HUM/ENGL/canada/poet/d_mckay.htm","#cite_ref-gr07_4-0","#cite_ref-gr07_4-1","#cite_ref-gr07_4-2","http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/shortlist_2007.php?t=2","/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&action=edit&section=7","http://www.cbc.ca/wordsatlarge/features/feature.php?storyId=393","http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/shortlists/2007-shortlist/don-mckay/","http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/see-and-hear-poetry/h-n/don-mckay/","http://www.utpjournals.com/product/utq/704/704_dragland.html","http://poetryreviews.ca/2006/05/31/faulty-lines-the-poetry-and-poetics-of-don-mckay/","http://www.gaspereau.com/e3.shtml","http://www.cbc.ca/wordsatlarge/features/feature.php?storyId=403","http://www.whatisstephenharperreading.ca/2010/05/24/book-number-82-the-grey-islands-by-john-steffler-sent-to-you-by-don-mckay/","http://www.library.utoronto.ca/fisher/collections/findaids/mckay518.pdf","http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=3721026&rec_nbr_list=3721026,3940819,3847098,3698781,437221,3851763,3851646,120704,3851772,3851769","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/2535719","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don_McKay&oldid=565695313","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1942_births","/wiki/Category:Canadian_poets","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Wales","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Governor_General%27s_Award_winning_poets","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Ca
