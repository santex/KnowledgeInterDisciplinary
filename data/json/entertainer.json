      "text" : "\n\n\n being entertained by a live cricket match between India and Pakistan (2003)]]\n\n'Entertainment' () is something that holds the attention and interest of an\naudience , or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is\nmore likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over\nthousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's\nattention.<ref>The Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol\n1 pp.&nbsp;213–4) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including inter\n(among) + tenir (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of \"to hold\nmutually\" or \"to hold intertwined\" and \"to engage, keep occupied, the attention\nthoughts or time (of a person)\". It also provides words like \"merry-making\",\n\"pleasure\", \"delight\", as well as \"to receive as a guest and show hospitality\nto\". It cites a 1490 usage by William Caxton.</ref> Although people's attention\nis held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in\nentertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling , music,\ndrama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were\nsupported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time\nbecame available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern\ntimes by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment\nproducts. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging\nfrom an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array\nof pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of\nparty, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands;\nand even for a global audience.\n\nThe experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with\namusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter,\nalthough many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the\nvarious forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for\nexample. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may\nalso be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.\n\nAn important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private\nrecreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a\npassive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show,\nor film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the\nparticipant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be\npublic or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of\ntheatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's\ngames. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving\ndue to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for\nexample, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama,\nand play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be\nentertained over a number of consecutive days.\n\nSome activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public\npunishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or\narchery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even\nprofessions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment\nwith wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills,\nsuch as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as\nglobal competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment\nfor one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.\n\nThe familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different\nmedia and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix.\nThis has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and\nstructures.\n\n{{Listen |filename = Applause.ogg |title = Applause |description = Audience\napplauding a performance of Cavalleria Rusticana by Pietro Mascagni (2011)\n|format = Ogg }}\n\n and girl playing the aulos. Greece (c. 420 BC) <br> Banqueting and music have\n continued to be two important entertainments since ancient times.]]\n",
