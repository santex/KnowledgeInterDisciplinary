{"cursor":"8550","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'hybrid system' is a dynamic system that exhibits both continuous and discrete\ndynamic behavior â a system that can both flow (described by a differential\nequation) and jump (described by a difference equation or control graph). Often,\nthe term \"hybrid dynamic system\" is used, to distinguish over hybrid systems\nsuch as those that combine neural nets and fuzzy logic, or electrical and\nmechanical drivelines. A hybrid system has the benefit of encompassing a larger\nclass of systems within its structure, allowing for more flexibility in\nmodelling dynamic phenomena.\n\nIn general, the state of a hybrid system is defined by the values of the\ncontinuous variables and a discrete control mode. The state changes either\ncontinuously, according to a [[flow conditioning | flow condition]], or\ndiscretely according to a control graph. Continuous flow is permitted as long\nas so-called invariants hold, while discrete transitions can occur as soon as\ngiven jump conditions are satisfied. Discrete transition may be associated\nwith events.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Hybrid_system","recorded":1362476923,"links":16,"instances":["control_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systems theory","Differential equations","Dynamical systems","Control theory"],"headings":["Examples","Other modeling approaches","Tools","See also","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/a/f9a3b8e9e501458e8face47cae8826de.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/4/8f43fce8dbdf3c4f8d0ac91f0de1d43d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/7/5273eec10f923d0b7054653085c98c6b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/0/4a03dd383a15280bfa993eb3b2ede416.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/f/b2f5ff47436671b6e533d8dc3614845d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/1/c/61c3968713011e63c39f169827ed439d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/8/7489ac7b1e59a4e2c5b5cf4d9ef0a16e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/1/1014ee20a4fc8b78e0e34a152618d120.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/4/334de1ea38b615839e4ee6b65ee1b103.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/a/5/8a57bee4e0141c30e314f682cb3460b6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["graph","mathematics"],["controller","control_theory"]],"members":["controller","graph"],"related":["Dynamic_system","Differential_equation","Difference_equation","Graph_(mathematics)","Neural_net","Fuzzy_logic","Physical_system","Controller_(control_theory)","Internet","Inelastic_collision","Zeno_of_Elea","Hybrid_automaton","Petri_net","Differential_algebraic_equation","Hybrid_bond_graph","DEVS","DEVS","PowerDEVS","PowerDEVS","Sliding_mode_control","Variable_structure_system","Variable_structure_control","Joint_spectral_radius","Hybrid_Systems_Visual_Modeler"]}
