{"cursor":"18589","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Consumer protection' consists of laws and organizations designed to ensure the\nrights of consumers as well as fair trade competition and the free flow of\ntruthful information in the marketplace. The laws are designed to prevent\nbusinesses that engage in fraud or specified unfair practices from gaining an\nadvantage over competitors and may provide additional protection for the weak\nand those unable to take care of themselves. Consumer protection laws are a form\nof government regulation, which aim to protect the rights of consumers. For\nexample, a government may require businesses to disclose detailed information\nabout productsâparticularly in areas where safety or public health is an issue,\nsuch as food. Consumer protection is linked to the idea of \"consumer rights\"\n(that consumers have various rights as consumers), and to the formation of\nconsumer organizations, which help consumers make better choices in the\nmarketplace and get help with consumer complaints.\n\nOther organizations that promote consumer protection include government\norganizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer\nprotection agencies and organizations, the Federal Trade Commission, ombudsmen,\nBetter Business Bureaus, etc.\n\nA consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use\nor ownership rather than for resale or use in production and\nmanufacturing. \"West Encyclopedia of American Law.

Retrieved on January 31, 2010\"\n\nConsumer interests can also be protected by promoting competition in the markets\nwhich directly and indirectly serve consumers, consistent with economic\nefficiency, but this topic is treated in competition law.\n\nConsumer protection can also be asserted via non-government organizations and\nindividuals as consumer activism.\n","linknr":463,"url":"Consumer_protection","recorded":1362543331,"links":45,"instances":["market","taiwan","finance","distance_selling_regulations_2000"],"pdf":["http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/rudtpa66.pdf"],"categories":["Consumer protection|","Consumer protection law"],"headings":["Consumer law","Consumer advocacy groups","Laws","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/CDCA_auto_repair_notice.jpg/300px-CDCA_auto_repair_notice.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/70px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["republic_of_china","taiwan"],["consumer_protection","distance_selling_regulations_2000"],["credit","finance"],["transparency","market"]],"members":["transparency","republic_of_china","credit","consumer_protection"],"related":["Regulation","Consumer","Consumer_organization","Consumer_complaint","Federal_Trade_Commission","Ombudsman","Better_Business_Bureau","Competition_law","Consumer_activism","Private_law","Product_liability","Privacy_rights","Unfair_business_practices","Fraud","Misrepresentation","Personal_loans","Bankruptcy","Australia","Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission","Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission","Angela_Merkel","Ilse_Aigner","Basic_Law_is_you_are_a_twat_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","Bundesverwaltungsgericht","India","Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1986","Tribunal","Indian_Judiciary","Mouthshut","Republic_of_China_(Taiwan)","United_Kingdom","European_Union","European_Directive","EU","Law","Contract","Tort","EU_law","Law","Tort","Contract","Restitution","Criminal_law","Office_of_Fair_Trading","Litigation","Trading_Standards","Consumer_Direct","Citizen's_Advice_Bureau","United_States","Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act","Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act","Truth_in_Lending_Act","Fair_Credit_Billing_Act","Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act","Federal_Trade_Commission","U.S._Department_of_Justice","California","California_Department_of_Consumer_Affairs","Private_attorney_general","Consumers_Legal_Remedies_Act","United_States","Consumer_Federation_of_California","Privacy_Rights_Clearinghouse","Unethical","Franchising","Competition_law","Unfair_Contract_Terms_Act_1977","Sale_of_Goods_Act_1979","Consumer_Protection_Act_1987","Unfair_Terms_in_Consumer_Contracts_Regulations_1999","Consumer_Protection_(Distance_Selling)_Regulations_2000","Electronic_Commerce_Regulations_2002","Enterprise_Act_2002","General_Product_Safety_Regulations_2005","Consumer_Protection_from_Unfair_Trading_Regulations_2008","Consumer_Product_Safety_Act","Consumer_Product_Safety_Commission","Federal_Trade_Commission_Act","Federal_Trade_Commission","Privacy_laws_of_the_United_States","United_States_National_Do_Not_Call_Registry","Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Communications_Act_of_1934","Federal_Communications_Commission","Bank_regulation","Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act","Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act","Truth_in_Lending_Act","Real_Estate_Settlement_Procedures_Act","Health_insurance_in_the_United_States","Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act","Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act","DMCRA","Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act","Australian_Consumer_Law","Airline_complaints","Antitrust","Better_Business_Bureau","Class_action","Competition_policy","Competition_regulator","Consumer_complaint","Credit_(finance)","Debt","Extended_warranty","Fairtrade_labelling","Federal_Trade_Commission","Food_safety","Mandatory_labelling","Ombudsman","Online_Complaint_Management_System","Planned_obsolescence","Product_recall","Transparency_(market)","Unfair_competition","Florence_Kelley","Ralph_Nader","Michael_Vernon","Curtis_Arnold","Reiss_Browne","Robert_Ellis_Smith"]}
