Everitt, B.S.\n(2002) The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, CUP. ISBN 0-521-81099-\nX Upton, G., Cook, I. (2006) Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, OUP.\nISBN 978-0-19-954145-4 To avoid making wrong inferences, the\npossibility of regression toward the mean must be considered when designing\nexperiments and interpreting experimental, survey, and other empirical data in\nthe physical, life, behavioral and social sciences.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way\nthe term is mathematically defined. Sir Francis Galton first observed the\nphenomenon in the context of simple linear regression of data points. However, a\nless restrictive approach is possible. Regression towards the mean can be\ndefined for any bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions.\nTwo such definitions exist. Samuels (1991). One\ndefinition accords closely with the common usage of the term âregression towards\nthe meanâ. Not all such bivariate distributions show regression towards the mean\nunder this definition. However, all such bivariate distributions show regression\ntowards the mean under the other definition.\n\nHistorically, what is now called regression toward the mean has also been called\n'reversion to the mean' and 'reversion to mediocrity'.\n\nIn finance, the term mean reversion has a different meaning. Jeremy Siegel uses\nit to describe a financial time series in which \"returns can be very unstable in\nthe short run but very stable in the long run.\" More quantitatively, it is one\nin which the standard deviation of average annual returns declines faster than\nthe inverse of the holding period, implying that the process is not a random\nwalk, but that periods of lower returns are systematically followed by\ncompensating periods of higher returns. , p. 13, pp. 28â9\n","linknr":498,"url":"Regression_toward_the_mean","recorded":1362675119,"links":22,"instances":["economics","finance","statistics","statistics"],"pdf":["http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf","http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf","http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic469678.files/regress_to_mean1.pdf","http://www.spss.com/research/wilkinson/Publications/galton.pdf"],"categories":["Statistical terminology","Regression analysis","Statistical laws"],"headings":["Conceptual background","History","Importance","Other statistical phenomena","Definition for simple linear regression of data points","Definitions for bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/9/599c1e72969ec00e4d012146d8f90fbf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/f/a0f0c4870928bff30a03e1723e7f8b52.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/2/cb2a29b015ebdd70db3b35e100f10e05.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/1/d41e38c43c26973f34d1853b7883b584.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/2/b/42ba2b98ce5c2884620c116638858fdc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/3/5931bfc89d29d1e7a9917294ba0d3d07.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/7/59744f666ff56f695bfe4d128a6784f4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/9/599c1e72969ec00e4d012146d8f90fbf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/8/f68881d48d4e034405b1808da39196f2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/4/f049abe6360e2e16c5594893321489a0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/e/3/8e3ae9c429484dbeb4166915c91b0cf1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg/32px-Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mean_reversion","finance"],["shrinkage","statistics"],["sampling","statistics"],["widget","economics"]],"members":["widget","mean_reversion","sampling","shrinkage"],"related":["Statistics","Sir_Francis_Galton","Simple_linear_regression","Joint_probability_distribution","Marginal_distribution","Mean_reversion_(finance)","Jeremy_Siegel","Time_series","Random_walk","Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables","Random_variable","Mean","Skill","Luck","Sir_Francis_Galton","Regression_analysis","Linear_regression","Recessive","Homozygous","Sampling_bias","Design_of_experiments","Scientific_control","Disadvantaged","Shrinkage_(statistics)","Stein's_example","Causality","Sampling_(statistics)","Mean","Expected_value","Harold_Hotelling","Daniel_Kahneman","Nobel_prize_in_economics","Speed_camera","Accident_blackspot","Road_traffic_accidents","Sophomore_slump","Carmelo_Anthony","National_Basketball_Association","Denver_Nuggets","Sports_Illustrated_Cover_Jinx","Madden_Curse","John_Hollinger","Bill_James","Batting_average","Major_League_Baseball","Nate_Silver","Gambler's_fallacy","Law_of_averages","Law_of_large_numbers","Sir_Francis_Galton","Ordinary_least_squares","Calculus","Standard_deviation","Random_variable","Joint_distribution","Widget_(economics)","Bivariate_normal_distribution","Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient","Standard_deviation","Random_variable","Joint_distribution","Internal_validity","British_Medical_Journal","Wiley-Interscience","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Francis_Galton","McGraw-Hill","Stephen_M._Stigler","Harvard_University_Press"]}
