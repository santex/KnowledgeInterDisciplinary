{"cursor":"48641","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Neoplatonism' (also called 'Neo-Platonism'), is the modern (19th century) term\nfor a school of mystical philosophy that took shape in the 3rd century, based on\nthe teachings of Plato and earlier Platonists, with its earliest contributor\nbelieved to be Plotinus, and his teacher Ammonius Saccas. Neoplatonism focused\non the spiritual and cosmological aspects of Platonic thought, synthesizing\nPlatonism with Egyptian Luckert, Karl. Egyptian light and Hebrew fire:\ntheological and philosophical roots of Christendom in evolutionary perspective,\nSUNY Press, 1991. ISBN 978-0-7914-0967-1, page 330. and Jewish\ntheology. However, Neoplatonists would have considered themselves\nsimply Platonists, and the modern distinction is due to the perception that\ntheir philosophy contained sufficiently unique interpretations of Plato to make\nit substantially different from what Plato wrote and\nbelieved. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/\n\nThe Neoplatonism of Plotinus and Porphyry has been referred to as in fact being\northodox Platonic philosophy by scholars like John D. Turner. This distinction\nprovides a contrast with later movements of Neoplatonism, such as those of\nIamblichus and Proclus, which embraced magical practices or theurgy as part of\nthe soul's development in the process of the soul's return to the Source.\nPossibly Plotinus was motivated to clarify some of the traditions in the\nteachings of Plato that had been misrepresented before Iamblichus (see\nNeoplatonism and Gnosticism).\n\nNeoplatonism took definitive shape with the philosopher Plotinus, who claimed to\nhave received his teachings from Ammonius Saccas, a philosopher in\nAlexandria.

ISBN 978-3-931169-00-\n5 Plotinus was also influenced by Alexander of Aphrodisias and Numenius of\nApamea. Plotinus's student Porphyry assembled his teachings into the six sets of\nnine tractates, or [[Enneads]]. Subsequent Neoplatonic philosophers included\nIamblichus, Hypatia of Alexandria, Hierocles of Alexandria, Proclus (by far the\nmost influential of later Neoplatonists), Damascius (last head of Neoplatonist\nSchool at Athens), Olympiodorus the Younger, and Simplicius of Cilicia.\n\nThinkers from the Neoplatonic school cross-pollinated with the thinkers of other\nintellectual schools. For instance, certain strands of Neoplatonism influenced\nChristian thinkers (such as Augustine, Boethius, John Scotus Eriugena, and\nBonaventure), Robb, Nesca A., 1968, Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance,\nNew York: Octagon Books while Christian thought influenced (and sometimes\nconverted) Neoplatonic philosophers (such as Dionysius the\nAreopagite).

neo-Platonists,\nespecially with Plotinus and Proclus.\"\n[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05013a.htm]\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Neoplatonic arguments were taken seriously in the thought of\nmedieval Islamic and Jewish thinkers such as al-Farabi and Moses\nMaimonides, and experienced a revival in the Renaissance with the\nacquisition and translation of Greek and Arabic Neoplatonic texts.\n","linknr":1257,"url":"Neo-Platonism","recorded":1362485243,"links":72,"instances":["neoplatonist","philosophy","dialogue","philosopher","philosophy","philosophy","physics","greek_philosophy","gnostic","roman_province","platonist","philosopher","philosopher","philosopher","roman_province","religion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neoplatonism|","Ancient
