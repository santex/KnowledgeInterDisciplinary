{"cursor":"6220","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Baldwin of Ibelin', also known as 'Baldwin II of Ramla' (French: Baudouin\nd'Ibelin, early 1130s â€“ c. 1187 or 1186/1188), was an important noble of\nthe crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the 12th century. He was the second son of\nBarisan of Ibelin, and was the younger brother of Hugh of Ibelin and older\nbrother of Balian of Ibelin. He first appears in the historical record as a\nwitness to charters in 1148.\n\nAfter the death of his eldest brother Hugh (third husband of Agnes of Courtenay)\nin 1169, the castle of Ibelin passed to Baldwin, who remained Lord of Mirabel or\nMajdal Yaba and Ramla and passed Ibelin to his younger brother Balian. He\nintroduced the Lusignan family to court in 1174, in the person of Amalric of\nLusignan, who had married his daughter Eschiva. Baldwin and Balian supported\nRaymond III of Tripoli over Miles of Plancy as regent for King Baldwin IV in\n1174, and in 1177 the brothers were present at the Battle of Montgisard.\n\nIt is suspected that, after the death of his second wife Isabella, in 1177, he\nbecame Raymond of Tripoli's favoured candidate to marry the widowed Princess\nSibylla of Jerusalem. His brother Balian had recently married her stepmother,\nDowager Queen Maria Comnena. The Chronicle of [[Ernoul]], or [[Old French]]\nContinuation of [[William of Tyre]], partly written by a former squire of\nBalian, but thirteenth-century in its current form, claims that Baldwin and\nSibylla had been in love and exchanged letters during Baldwin's captivity, but\nthis is highly questionable.\n\nBaldwin was captured in battle at Marj Uyun in 1179, along with Odo de St Amand,\nGrand Master of the Templars, and Raymond of Tripoli's stepson, Hugh of\nTiberias. Baldwin was ransomed by Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and later\nin 1180 he visited Constantinople. Supposedly, the emperor sat him in a chair\nand covered him up to his head in the gold coins that were to be used as his\nransom money. During his stay in Constantinople, the emperor died. Baldwin was\nin Jerusalem at the time of Sibylla's wedding in 1180. Raymond of Tripoli seems\nto have been planning a coup to marry Sibylla to Baldwin, but the king needed to\nmarry her to a non-native, in order gain support for another crusade from the\nwest. She was married to Guy of Lusignan, younger brother of Baldwin of Ibelin's\nson-in-law Amalric. That same year, the king betrothed his younger half-sister\nIsabella of Jerusalem, Balian's stepdaughter, to Humphrey IV of Toron, to\nfurther reduce the Ibelins' influence.\n\nIn 1183 he supported Raymond against Guy, who was by now regent for the ailing\nBaldwin IV. Lord Baldwin was among the barons who advised the king to crown\nSibylla's son Baldwin V in 1183, while Baldwin IV was still alive; this was an\nattempt to prevent Guy from succeeding as king. Baldwin V became sole king while\nstill a child in 1185, and when the young king died in 1186, Sibylla was crowned\nqueen with Guy as her consort. The Ibelins and Raymond favoured the accession of\nIsabella, but Humphrey refused to be crowned and cause a civil war, and instead\nswore allegiance to Sibylla and Guy. All the other barons of the kingdom paid\nhomage to Guy as well, except for Raymond and Baldwin. Baldwin placed his young\nson Thomas under the care of his brother Balian, and exiled himself to the\nPrincipality of Antioch, where he was welcomed with great fanfare.\n\nBaldwin considered Guy \"a madman and a fool\", and refused to pay homage because\nhis father had not paid homage to Guy's father (i.e., regarding Guy as an\nupstart incomer, where Baldwin was a native baron). He refused to return to\nJerusalem to assist Guy against Saladin, and probably died in his self-imposed\nexile in 1187.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Baldwin_of_Ibelin","recorded":1375067751,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Baldwin_of_Ibelin_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Crusade","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Barisan_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Hugh_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Balian_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Agnes_of_Courtenay","/wiki/Ibelin","/wiki/Majdal_Yaba","/wiki/Lord_of_Ramla","/wiki/Lusignan","/wiki/Amalric_II_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Eschive_d%27Ibelin_(1160-1196)","/wiki/Raymond_III_of_Tripoli","/wiki/Miles_of_Plancy","/wiki/Baldwin_IV_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Battle_of_Montgisard","/wiki/Sibylla_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Maria_Comnena,_Queen_consort_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Ernoul","/wiki/Old_French","/wiki/William_of_Tyre","/wiki/Battle_of_Marj_Ayun","/wiki/Odo_de_St_Amand","/wiki/Templars","/wiki/Byzantine_emperor","/wiki/Manuel_I_Comnenus","/wiki/Constantinople","/wiki/Guy_of_Lusignan","/wiki/Isabella_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Humphrey_IV_of_Toron","/wiki/Baldwin_V_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Principality_of_Antioch","/wiki/Saladin","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Lord_of_Ramla","/wiki/Eschive_d%27Ibelin_(1160-1196)","/wiki/Cyprus","/wiki/Amalric_II_of_Jerusalem","/wiki/Hugh_I_of_Cyprus","/wiki/Officers_of_the_County_of_Tripoli#Constable","/wiki/Baldwin_of_Ibelin_(died_1266)","/wiki/John_of_Ibelin,_the_Old_Lord_of_Beirut","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/William_of_Tyre","/wiki/Joshua_Prawer","/wiki/Steven_Runciman","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&oldid=558949455","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1130s_births","/wiki/Category:1180s_deaths","/wiki/Category:Christians_of_the_Crusades","/wiki/Category:House_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baldwin+of+Ibelin&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baldwin+of+Ibelin","/wiki/Baldwin_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Talk:Baldwin_of_Ibelin","#","/wiki/Baldwin_of_Ibelin","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Baldwin_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Baldwin_of_Ibelin","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&oldid=558949455","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q804832","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&id=558949455","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Baldwin+of+Ibelin","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Baldwin+of+Ibelin&oldid=558949455&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Baldwin_of_Ibelin&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balduin_z_Ibelinu","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balduin_von_Ibelin","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balduino_de_Ibel%C3%ADn","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudouin_d%27Ibelin_(mort_en_1187)","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldovino_di_Ibelin","//la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balduinus_de_Ibelino","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boudewijn_van_Ibelin","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%B4%D0%B5_%D0%98%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q804832#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimedi
