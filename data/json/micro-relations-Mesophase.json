Gelatin is a common example of a partially ordered structure in a\nmesophase. Further, biological structures such as the lipid bilayers of cell\nmembranes exemplify the mesophase state.\n\nGeorges Friedel (1922) called attention to the \"mesomorphic states of\nmatter\" \"Les Ãtates MÃ©somorphes de la MatiÃ¨re\" in his scientific\nassessment of observations of the so-called liquid crystals. Everyone knows a\ncrystal is solid and to crystallize is to make solid. The oxymoron of the liquid\ncrystal is resolved through the notion of mesophases. The observations noted an\noptic axis persisting in materials that had been melted and had begun to flow.\nBut the catch-phrase of the liquid crystal caught on, even when displaced in\ntechnical writing.\n\nFor example, in The Physics of Liquid Crystals de Gennes & Prost 1993\nthe mesophases are introduced from the beginning:\n:...certain organic materials do not show a single transition from solid to\n:liquid, but rather a cascade of transitions involving new phases. The\n:mechanical properties and the symmetry properties of these phases are\n:intermediate between those of a liquid and those of a crystal. For this reason\n:they have often been called liquid crystals. A more proper name is âmesomorphic\n:phasesâ (mesomorphic: intermediate form) page one\n\nFurther, \"The classification of mesophases (first clearly set out by G. Friedel\nin 1922) is essentially based on symmetry.\" de Gennes & Prost p\n10 G. Friedel (1922) Annales de Physique (Paris) 18:\n273–474\n\nMolecules that demonstrate mesophases are called mesogens.\n\nIn technology, molecules in which the optic axis is subject to manipulation\nduring a mesophase have become commercial products as they can be used to\nmanufacture display devices. The susceptibility of the optic axis, called a\ndirector, to an electric or magnetic field produces the potential for an optical\nswitch. Methods used include the Freedericksz transition and the twisted nematic\nfield effect. From early liquid crystal displays the buying public has embraced\nthe low-power optical switch facility of mesophases with director.\n\nConsider a solid consisting of a single molecular species and subjected to\nmelting. Ultimately it is rendered to an isotropic state classically referred to\nas liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an intermediate state of order is\nstill maintained as in the nematic, smectic, and columnar phases of liquid\ncrystals. Mesophases thus exhibit anisotropy. For instance, LCD devices work on\nthe optical switch principle that obscures light or lets it pass. This switch is\nturned off and on by an electric field applied to the mesogen with director. The\nresponse of the director to the field is expressed with viscosity parameters, as\nin the Ericksen-Leslie theory in continuum mechanics developed by Jerald\nEricksen and Frank Matthews Leslie.\n\nMesophase phenomena are important in many scientific fields. The publishing arms\nof professional societies have academic journals as needed.
