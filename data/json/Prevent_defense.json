{"cursor":"5557","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Prevent defense' is an American football defensive alignment that uses seven or\nmore defensive backs or players in a defensive back role, the goal of which is\nto prevent the opposing offense from completing a long pass. This defense is\nfrequently used in obvious passing situations, such as a third-and-very-long\nsituation, or to prevent a long score on the last play of a half, or when the\ndefense believes that the offense must pass (for example, if the offense is\ntrailing late in a game). Otherwise the prevent is almost never used. The\ndefense trades size for speed, and tries to ensure that no receiver can get\nbehind the defense. A prevent defense backs up the coverage so far that it will\noften give up long yardage, but it makes scoring a touchdown in a single play\nvery difficult.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Prevent_defense","recorded":1362689609,"links":13,"instances":["american_football"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American football formations","American football terminology"],"headings":["Types of prevent","Implementation","Advantages","Disadvantages","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_madden","american_football"]],"members":["john_madden"],"related":["American_football","Defensive_back","Wide_receiver","Touchdown","Defensive_line","Linebacker","Nickel_defense","Dime_defense","Zone_defense","4-3_defense","3-4_defense","Hail_Mary_pass","Yards","Free_safety","Super_Bowl_XXXII","Mike_Shanahan","Denver_Broncos","Baltimore_Ravens","Rahim_Moore","Jacoby_Jones","Joe_Flacco","John_Madden_(American_football)"]}
