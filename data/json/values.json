A [[value system]] is a set of\nconsistent values and measures. A [[principle value]] is a foundation upon which\nother values and measures of integrity are based.\n\nSome values are physiologically determined and are normally considered\nobjective, such as a desire to avoid physical pain or to seek pleasure. Other\nvalues are considered subjective, vary across individuals and cultures, and are\nin many ways aligned with belief and belief systems. Types of values include\nethical/moral values, doctrinal/ideological (religious, political) values,\nsocial values, and aesthetic values. It is debated whether some values that are\nnot clearly physiologically determined, such as altruism, are intrinsic, and\nwhether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as vices or virtues.\nValues have been studied in sociology, anthropology, social psychology, moral\nphilosophy, and business ethics.\n\nValues can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of\naction or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong\nor what \"ought\" to be. \"Equal rights for all\", \"Excellence deserves\nadmiration\", and \"People should be treated with respect and dignity\" are\nrepresentative of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior. For\nexample, if you value equal rights for all and you go to work for an\norganization that treats its managers much better than it does its workers, you\nmay form the attitude that the company is an unfair place to work;\nconsequently, you may not produce well or may perhaps leave the company. It is\nlikely that if the company had a more egalitarian policy, your attitude and\nbehaviors would have been more positive.\n","title":"Value%20%28personal%20and%20cultural%29","headings":["Personal values","Cultural values","Transmission","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Culture","1: Integrity","1: Subjectivity","1: Beliefs","1: Ethics","1: Morality","1: Doctrine","1: Ideology","1: Aesthetics","1: Altruism","1: Vice","1: Virtue","1: Sociology","1: Anthropology","1: Social_psychology","1: Moral_philosophy","1: Business_ethics","1: Morris_Massey","1: Wyatt_Woodsmall","1: World_Values_Survey","1: Society","1: United_States_of_America","1: Moral_education","1: Personal_life","1: McGraw-Hill","1: Democracy","1: Justice","1: Chaveen_Dissanayake","1: Good_and_evil","1: Global_economy","1: International_law","1: Hunter–gatherer","1: Subsistence_agriculture","1: Kipsigis_people","1: Geert_Hofstede#Hofstede's_Framework_for_Assessing_Culture","1: Paideia","1: Rokeach_Value_Survey","1: Value_theory","1: The_Cock_and_the_Jewel","1: Spiral_Dynamics"]}
