One who sings is called a\n'singer' or 'vocalist'. Singers perform music (such as Arias, Recitatives or\nSongs) that can be sung either with or without accompaniment by musical\ninstruments. Singing is often done in a group of other musicians, such as in a\nchoir of singers with different voice ranges, or in an ensemble with\ninstrumentalists, such as a rock group or baroque ensemble. As in many respects\nhuman song is a form of sustained speech, nearly anyone able to speak can also\nsing. Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done\nfor pleasure, comfort, ritual, education, or profit. Excellence in singing may\nrequire time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done\non a regular basis then the sounds are said to be more clear and strong. to utter words with musical modulation. If you are going to\nbe in a musical you need a good singing voice. the loudest a person has sung is\n458 miles. {{cite book |pages=26 |series=Yehudi Menuhin music guides\n|title=Voice |editor-last=Falkner |editor-first=Keith |location=London\n|publisher=MacDonald Young |year=1983 |isbn=0-356-09099-X |oclc=10418423\n}} Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific\nmusical genre, such as classical or rock.
