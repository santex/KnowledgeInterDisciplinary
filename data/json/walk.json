This applies regardless of the number of\nlimbs - even arthropods with six, eight or more limbs.\n\nThe word walk is descended from the Old English wealcan \"to roll\". In humans and\nother bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one\nfoot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-\nsupport. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each\nstep. This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive\nwalking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be\ntermed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence\nof a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield\nmechanically correct classification.<ref name=\"Bie\"></ref> The most effective\nmethod to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a\nperson's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at midstance.\nDuring walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance while\nduring running, it is at a minimum. Definitions based on the percent of the\nstride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all\nfeet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of\n'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any\nnumber of limbs, although this definition is incomplete.<ref name=\"Bie\"/>\nRunning humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait\ncycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.\n\nAlthough walking speeds can vary greatly depending on factors such as height,\nweight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average\nhuman walking speed is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 3.1 miles\nper hour (mph). Specific studies have found pedestrian walking speeds ranging\nfrom to for older individuals and from to for younger\nindividuals;<ref></ref><ref></ref> a brisk walking speed can be around\n.<ref></ref> Champion racewalkers can average more than over a distance of . An\naverage human child achieves independent walking ability at around 11 months\nold.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Walking","headings":["Health benefits of walking","Paleoanthropology and ambulation","Evolutionary origin of walking","Variants of walking","Biomechanics","As a leisure activity","As transportation","In robotics","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Gait","3: Running","3: Nordic_walking","3: Hiking","2: Centre_of_mass","2: Racewalking","2: Mayo_Clinic","2: Life_expectancy","2: Tetrapods","2: Walking_stick","2: Charitable_organisation","2: Pedestrian-friendly","2: Eltis","1: Animal_locomotion","1: Old_English_language","1: Human","1: Biped","1: Race_walking","1: Quadruped","1: Motion_capture","1: Force_plate","1: Preferred_Walking_Speed","1: Pedestrian","1: Cambridge,_Massachusetts","1: Massachusetts","1: About.com","1: Cancer","1: Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","1: Heart_disease","1: Anxiety","1: Mood_disorder","1: AARP","1: Obesity","1: Hypertension","1: Bone","1: Health","1: Hip_bone","1: Low-density_lipoprotein","1: High-density_lipoprotein","1: HowStuffWorks","1: Google_Book_Search","1: Dementia","1: Alzheimer's","1: Arthropods","1: Insects","1: Myriapods","1: Chelicerates","1: Tardigrades","1: Onychophorans","1: Crustaceans","1: Hand_walking","1: Hand","1: Crutches","1: Trekking_poles","1: Sense_of_balance","1: Equilibrioception","1: Scrambling","1: Scree","1: Double_pendulum","1: Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation","1: Ballistics","1: Kinetic_energy","1: Potential_energy","1: Muscles","1: Tendons","1: Elastic_energy","1: Speed_walking","1: Hobby","1: Exercise","1: Pedometer","1: Bushwalking","1: Hillwalking","1: Volksmarching","1: Long-distance_path","1: Treadmill","1: Ramblers'_Association","1: Nature","1: Urban_area","1: Search_and_rescue","1: United_Kingdom","1: International_Four_Days_Marches_Nijmegen","1: Mackinac_Bridge","1: Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge","1: MS_Challenge_Walk","1: Multiple_sclerosis","1: Ramblers","1: Endurance","1: Weight_control","1: Chronic_stress","1: Coronary_heart_disease","1: Stroke","1: Diabetes","1: High_blood_pressure","1: Bowel_cancer","1: Osteoporosis","1: Memory","1: Learning","1: Concentration","1: Mode_of_transportation","1: Utility_cycling","1: Public_transport","1: Car_sharing","1: Carpool","1: Hitchhiking","1: Urban_planning","1: Commuting","1: Walkability","1: Auto-free_zone","1: Active_living","1: Sustainable","1: Transport","1: Cycling","1: ELTIS","1: Pedestrian_mall","1: Foreshoreway","1: Oceanway","1: Riverwalk","1: Robot","1: ASIMO","1: Knee","1: Tomotaka_Takahashi","1: Ropid","1: Barefoot","1: Carrying_on_the_head","1: Flâneur","1: Footpath","1: Gait_training","1: International_charter_for_walking","1: List_of_U.S._cities_with_most_pedestrian_commuters","1: Military_step","1: Naismith's_rule","1: Outdoor_education","1: Outdoor_literature","1: Power_Walking","1: Preferred_walking_speed","1: Relay_for_Life","1: Sustainable_transport","1: Terrestrial_locomotion_in_animals","1: The_Ministry_of_Silly_Walks","1: Tobler's_hiking_function","1: Trail","1: Walking_distance_measure","1: Walking_fish","1: Walking_tour"]}
