{"cursor":"11246","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wounded healer' is an archetypal dynamic that psychologist Carl Jung used to\ndescribe a phenomenon that may take place, both positively and negatively, in\nthe relationship between analyst and analysand. L. Burns/E. I. Burns,\nLiterature and Therapy (2009) p. 126\n\nOne of the deeper, underlying archetypal patterns which is being constellated in\nthe human psyche that is playing itself out collectively on the world stage is\nthe archetype of the âwounded healer.â To quote Kerenyi, a colleague of Jung who\nelucidated this archetype, the wounded healer refers psychologically to the\ncapacity âto be at home in the darkness of suffering and there to find germs of\nlight and recovery with which, as though by enchantment, to bring forth\nAsclepius, the sunlike healer.â The archetype of the wounded healer reveals to\nus that it is only by being willing to face, consciously experience and go\nthrough our wound do we receive its blessing. To go through our wound is to\nembrace, assent, and say âyesâ to the mysteriously painful new place in\nourselves where the wound is leading us. Going through our wound, we can allow\nourselves to be re-created by the wound. Our wound is not a static entity, but\nrather a continually unfolding dynamic process that manifests, reveals and\nincarnates itself through us, which is to say that our wound is teaching us\nsomething about ourselves. Going through our wound means realizing we will never\nagain be the same when we get to the other side of this initiatory process.\nGoing through our wound is a genuine death experience, as our old self âdiesâ in\nthe process, while a new, more expansive and empowered part of ourselves is\npotentially born.\n\nGoing through and embracing our wound as a part of ourselves is radically\ndifferent than circumnavigating and going around (avoiding), or getting stuck in\nand endlessly, obsessively recreating (being taken over by) our wound. The event\nof our wounding is simultaneously catalyzing a deeper (potential) healing\nprocess which requires our active engagement, thus âweddingâ us to a deeper\nlevel of our being. Jungâs closest colleague, Marie Louise Von Franz, said âthe\nwounded healer IS the archetype of the Self [our wholeness, the God within] and\nis at the bottom of all genuine healing procedures.â\n\n\n\n\nFor Jung, \"a good half of every treatment that probes at all deeply consists in\nthe doctor's examining himself... it is his own hurt that gives a measure of his\npower to heal. This, and nothing else, is the meaning of the Greek myth of the\nwounded physician.\" Jung quoted in Anthony Stevens, Jung (Oxford 1994) p.\n110 Latterly, the term has expanded from Jungâs original concept to cover\nthe study of any professional healer who has been wounded, including counselors,\npsychotherapists, doctors and nurses.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Wounded_healer","recorded":1374544297,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Archetype","/wiki/Carl_Jung","/wiki/Psychoanalyst","/wiki/Analysand","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Greek_myth","#cite_note-2","#Mythological_origins","#Jung.27s_wound","#Practical_example","#Research","#Problematics","#Cultural_analogues","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Chiron","/wiki/Hercules","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Asclepius","/wiki/Epidaurus","/wiki/Apollo","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Healer_(role_variant)","/wiki/Countertransference","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Depth_psychology","/wiki/Unconscious_mind","/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)","/wiki/Psychological_projection","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Gregory_House","/wiki/House_M.D.","#cite_note-16","/wiki/T._S._Eliot","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Empathy","/wiki/Healer_(role_variant)","/wiki/Shaman","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","#cite_ref-13","http://www.thegreenrooms.net/research_and_articles/wounded-healer","#cite_ref-14","#cite_ref-15","#cite_ref-16","#cite_ref-17","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Henri_Nouwen","/wiki/Doubleday_(publisher)","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-385-14803-0","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit&section=10","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2553448/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&oldid=564076896","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Jungian_archetypes","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wounded+healer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wounded+healer","/wiki/Wounded_healer","/wiki/Talk:Wounded_healer","#","/wiki/Wounded_healer","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wounded_healer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wounded_healer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&oldid=564076896","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8037409","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Wounded_healer&id=564076896","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Wounded+healer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Wounded+healer&oldid=564076896&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Wounded_healer&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8037409#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAli
