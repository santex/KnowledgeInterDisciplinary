{"cursor":"13453","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'public utility' (usually just 'utility') is an organization that maintains\nthe infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a service using\nthat infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of public control\nand regulation ranging from local community-based groups to state-wide\ngovernment monopolies. (Common arguments in favor of regulation include the\ndesire to control market power, facilitate competition, promote investment or\nsystem expansion, or stabilize markets. In general, though, regulation occurs\nwhen the government believes that the operator, left to his own devices, would\nbehave in a way that is contrary to the community's best interests.)\n\nThe term 'utilities' can also refer to the set of services provided by these\norganizations consumed by the public: electricity, natural gas, water, and\nsewage. Telephony may occasionally be included within the definition. \n","linknr":415,"url":"Public_utility","recorded":1362890529,"links":41,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Public utilities|","Political economy","Monopoly (economics)","Flow meters","Economics of transport and utility industries"],"headings":["North America","The UK and Ireland","Developing countries","Public utility quality of service for telecommunications","See also","Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg/230px-Grand_Coulee_Dam_spillway.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Water_pipes_-_geograph.org.uk_-_833745.jpg/120px-Water_pipes_-_geograph.org.uk_-_833745.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Banbury_towm_Mk_3_%2812%29.png/120px-Banbury_towm_Mk_3_%2812%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Street_lamp_post.jpg/56px-Street_lamp_post.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Old_Style_Telephone_Pole_-_geograph.org.uk_-_943497.jpg/79px-Old_Style_Telephone_Pole_-_geograph.org.uk_-_943497.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Sedimentation_tank.jpg/120px-Sedimentation_tank.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Infrastructure","Public_services","Electric_utility","Natural_gas_utility","Water_utility","Water_industry","United_States_of_America","Natural_monopoly","Regulation","Public_utilities_commission","Electricity_generation","Electricity_retailing","Telecommunication","Public_transit","Mail","Liberalization","Deregulation","Privatization","Private_company","Government-owned_company","Municipal","Utility_cooperative","Rural","Investor-owned_utility","Investment","Regional_transmission_organization","County_water_district","Flood_control_and_water_conservation_district","Fresh_water_supply_district","Irrigation_district","Investor-owned_utility","Municipal_water_authority","Municipal_water_district","Municipal_utility_district","Public-oberchine_Utility","Public_utility_district","Water_agency","Water_hi_control_and_improvement_district","Water_district","Water_system","Water_supply_corporation","California_Public_Utilities_Commission","CPUC","Public_Utilities_Commission","Natural_gas","California","Sanitary_District","England_and_Wales","Ireland","Electricity_generation","Electricity_retailing","Electric_utility","Natural_gas_utility","Water_utility","Sewage_treatment","Water_industry","Telecommunication","Developing_countries","Developed_countries","Water_and_sanitation_in_Latin_America","Afghanistan","Somalia","Lists_of_public_utilities","Electric_utility","Telephone_company","Water_industry","Airline_deregulation","Common_utility_duct","Electricity_market","Energy","Firm_service","Liberalization","Machine_Tractor_Station","NAICS_22","American_Public_Power_Association","National_Rural_Water_Association","Off-the-grid","Public_services","Rate_Case","Telecommunication","Universal_service","Utility_cooperative","Infrastructure","Dartford_Cable_Tunnel","Public_Utility_Holding_Company_Act_of_1935","Public_Utilities_Commission","Loch_Leathan","Scotland","Banbury","Australia","Norrice_Lea","England","Sedimentation_tank","Merchtem","Belgium","Pollution"]}
