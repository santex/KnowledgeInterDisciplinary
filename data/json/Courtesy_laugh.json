{"cursor":"4255","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Nervous laughter' is laughter evoked from an audience's expression of\nembarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than amusement. Nervous\nlaughter is usually less robust in expression than \"a good belly laugh\", and\nmay be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others\nin the audience. Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a 'courtesy\nlaugh', which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to\nmove a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian is pausing\nfor laughter.\n\nNervous laughter is a physical reaction to stress, tension, confusion, or\nanxiety. Neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran states \"We have nervous\nlaughter because we want to make ourselves think what horrible thing we\nencountered isn't really as horrible as it appears, something we want to\nbelieve.\" Those are the most embarrassing times, too, naturally.\nPsychologist and neuroscientist Robert Provine, from the University of Maryland,\nstudied over 1,200 \"laughter episodes\" and determined that 80% of laughter isn't\na response to an intentional joke.\n\nUnhealthy or \"nervous\" laughter comes from the throat. This nervous laughter is\nnot true laughter, but an expression of tension and anxiety. Instead of relaxing\na person, nervous laughter tightens them up even further. Much of this nervous\nlaughter is produced in times of high emotional stress, especially during times\nwhere an individual is afraid they might harm another person in various ways,\nsuch as a person's feelings or even physically.\n\nPeople laugh when they need to project dignity and control during times of\nstress and anxiety. In these situations we usually laugh in a subconscious\nattempt to reduce stress and calm down, however, it often works otherwise.\nNervous laughter is often considered fake laughter and even heightens the\nawkwardness of the situation.\n\nPeople may laugh nervously when exposed to stress due to witnessing others'\npain. For instance, in Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment, subjects\n(\"teachers\") were told to shock \"learners\" every time the learners answered a\nquestion incorrectly. Although the \"learners\" were not actually shocked, the\nsubjects believed they were. As they were going through the study, many of the\n\"subjects showed signs of extreme tension and conflict\". Milgram observed some subjects laughing nervously when they heard\nthe \"learners'\" false screams of pain. In A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness,\nneuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran suggests that laughter is used as a defense\nmechanism used to guard against overwhelming anxiety. Laughter often diminishes\nthe suffering associated with a traumatic event.\n\nIf the individual is shy or bashful and appears nervous when talking, he or she\nis likely to exhibit nervous laughter. Individuals who are shy and introverted\nwho find themselves the center of conversational attention often become âgiddyâ\nwith nervous laughter; this is a subconscious response caused by the brain over-\nthinking due to social anxiety or inexperience.
