{"cursor":"15666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'bicycle lock' is a security device used to prevent bicycle theft, generally\nby fastening the bicycle to a fixed object, e.g., a bike rack.\n\nAn inherent challenge to bicycle theft prevention is the detatchability of the\nwheels from the frame. Unless both wheels and frame are secured, wheels can be\nremoved separately. An optimal locking method will secure the frame as well as\nboth wheels — either to a fixed object or to each other.\n\nLocking devices vary in size and security; the most secure tending to be the\nlargest, heaviest and least portable. Lesser equipment is used to deter attempts\nby less skilled and determined thieves. Thus like other security equipment,\nbicycle locks must compromise between security, portability and cost. Some are\nmade of particularly expensive materials chosen for their acceptable strength\nand low density.\n\nAn alternate defense is the provision of bicycle lockers in which the whole\nbicycle is locked. This also safeguards equipment such as lamps, tools, spare\ntubes etc., against all but the most industrious thief, or one equipped with\nheavy equipment or power tools. Bicycle lockers, however, generally take up much\nmore space than exposed bicycle racks, limiting potential storage capacity in a\ngiven space. An alternative is a card-access bike cage such as is present at\nAlewife station in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In addition to a bike lock, bike\nregistry can further assist in providing recovery in the event of theft.\n\nTest standards that rate the effective security of bicycle locks are provided by\nThatcham and Sold Secure in the United Kingdom, ART in the Netherlands, SSF in\nSweden, and VDS in Germany. Tests carried out by the Cyclists' Touring Club\nshowed that all of the locks under test could be broken in less than 42 seconds\nusing either bolt croppers for a cable/chain or a bottle jack for D-locks.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Bicycle_lock","recorded":1362476870,"links":34,"instances":["television_program","device","store","mbta_station","lock"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cycling equipment|Lock","Locks","Bicycle parts|Lock","Bicycle parking"],"headings":["U-locks and D-locks","Chain","Cable locks","Wheel lock","Locking skewers","Standards and tests","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Antivolv%C3%A9lo6.jpg/220px-Antivolv%C3%A9lo6.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Generic_u-lock.jpg/220px-Generic_u-lock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/StolenBike-FrontWheel.jpg/220px-StolenBike-FrontWheel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Security_Chain_Wiki.jpg/220px-Security_Chain_Wiki.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Fahrradschloeszer.jpg/160px-Fahrradschloeszer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Bike_cord_%26_lock_26d06.jpg/120px-Bike_cord_%26_lock_26d06.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/CombinationBikeLock.JPG/220px-CombinationBikeLock.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Bike_O_Lock_Japan.jpg/220px-Bike_O_Lock_Japan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Pitlock_skewers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alewife","mbta_station"],["jack","device"],["jack","device"],["key","lock"],["kassa","television_program"],["hema","store"]],"members":["kassa","jack","hema","alewife","key"],"related":["Physical_security","Theft","Bicycle_stand","Bicycle_wheel","Bicycle_frame","Bicycle_locker","Alewife_(MBTA_station)","Cambridge,_MA","Massachusetts","Bike_registry","Thatcham","Cyclists'_Touring_Club","Bolt_cutter","Jack_(device)","Bicycle_stand","Bolt_cutters","Jack_(device)","Angle_grinder","Tubular_pin_tumbler_lock","Bic_pen","Link_chain","Case_hardened","Hexagonal","Trapezoidal","Halfords","Cable","Bolt_cutter","Padlock","Scandinavia","Netherlands","China","India","Japan","Seatpost","Quick_release_skewer","Key_(lock)","Quick_release_skewer","Hex_key","Hose_clamp","Sold_Secure","Stichting_ART","Svenska_Försäkringsföreningen","VdS_Schadenverhütung","Northumbria_Police","Essex_Police","Home_Office","Not-for-profit_corporation","Master_Locksmiths_Association","Insure","Cyclists'_Touring_Club","Cable_cutter","Bolt_cutter","Bottle_jack","Readers_Digest","Motor_Cycle_News","ABUS","Kryptonite_lock","Kassa_(television_program)","ABUS","Hema_(store)","Halfords","Bicycle_locker","Bicycle_parking","Bicycle_stand","Bicycle_tree","Bicycle_transportation_engineering","Bike_registry","Wheel_clamp"]}
