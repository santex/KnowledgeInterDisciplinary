On a macroscopic scale (one where the\ndimensions investigated are much, much larger than the wavelength of the photons\nin question), the photons can be said to follow Snell's Law. 'Translucency'\n(also called 'translucence' or 'translucidity'), is a super-set of transparency,\nallows light to pass through; but, does not necessarily (again, on the\nmacroscopic scale) follow Snell's law; the photons can be scattered at either of\nthe two interfaces where there is a change in index of refraction, or\ninternally. In other words, a translucent medium allows the transport of light\nwhile a transparent medium not only allows the transport of light but allows for\nthe image formation. The opposite property of translucency is opacity.\nTransparent materials appear clear, with the overall appearance of one color, or\nany combination leading up to a brilliant spectrum of every color. When light\nencounters a material, it can interact with it in several different ways. These\ninteractions depend on the wavelength of the light and the nature of the\nmaterial. Photons interact with an object by some combination of reflection,\nabsorption and transmission. Some materials, such as plate glass and clean\nwater, allow much of the light that falls on them to be transmitted, with little\nbeing reflected; such materials are called optically transparent. Many liquids\nand aqueous solutions are highly transparent. Absence of structural defects\n(voids, cracks, etc.) and molecular structure of most liquids are mostly\nresponsible for excellent optical transmission.\n\nMaterials which do not allow the transmission of light are called opaque. Many\nsuch substances have a chemical composition which includes what are referred to\nas absorption centers. Many substances are selective in their absorption of\nwhite light frequencies. They absorb certain portions of the visible spectrum,\nwhile reflecting others. The frequencies of the spectrum which are not absorbed\nare either reflected back or transmitted for our physical observation. This is\nwhat gives rise to color. The attenuation of light of all frequencies and\nwavelengths is due to the combined mechanisms of absorption and\nscattering.\n\n; increasing levels of translucency; and increasing levels of
