{"cursor":"8042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'nerve' is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (the long, slender\nprojections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a\ncommon pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along\neach of the axons to peripheral organs.\n\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts. Neurons are sometimes called nerve\ncells, though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form\nnerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal Schwann cells that coat the axons\nin myelin.\n\nEach nerve is a cordlike structure that contains many axons. These axons are\noften referred to as \"fibres\". Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a\nlayer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. The axons are bundled\ntogether into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer\nof connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is\nwrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium.\n","linknr":981,"url":"Nerve","recorded":1362672367,"links":82,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nerves","Peripheral nervous system","Neuroanatomy","Soft tissue"],"headings":["Anatomy","Physiology","Clinical importance","Growth and stimulation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Nerves_of_the_left_upper_extremity.gif/250px-Nerves_of_the_left_upper_extremity.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Gray636.png/220px-Gray636.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Prostatic_adenocarcinoma_with_perineural_invasion.JPG/220px-Prostatic_adenocarcinoma_with_perineural_invasion.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dermatome","anatomy"]],"members":["dermatome"],"related":["Axon","Neuron","Peripheral_nervous_system","Electrochemical","Nerve_impulse","Central_nervous_system","Neural_tract","Schwann_cells","Myelin","Endoneurium","Perineurium","Epineurium","Sensory_neuron","Central_nervous_system","Mechanoreceptors","Skin","Motor_neuron","Muscle","Gland","Sense","Spinal_column","Spinal_cord","Vertebra","Brain","Brainstem","Roman_numerals","Cranial_nerve_zero","Connective_tissue","Epineurium","Perineurium","Endoneurium","Sensory_receptor","Glycocalyx","Collagen","Blood_vessels","Blood–brain_barrier","Cerebro-spinal_fluid","Central_nervous_system","Edema","Magnetic_resonance_neurography","Nerve_impulse","Action_potential","Myelinated","Synapse","Electrical_synapse","Chemical_synapse","Perineural_spread","Prostate_cancer","H&E_stain","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","Guillain-Barré_syndrome","Neuritis","Diabetes","Pain","Paralysis","Referred_pain","Neurology","Physical_examination","Reflex","Walking","Muscle","Proprioception","Somatosensory_system","Nerve_conduction_study","Electromyography","Notch_signaling","Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system","Dermatome_(anatomy)","Nerve_fiber","Nerve_injury","Neuropathy","Peripheral_nerve_injury","Peripheral_nerve_injury_classification"]}
