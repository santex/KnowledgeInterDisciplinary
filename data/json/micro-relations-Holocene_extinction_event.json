{"cursor":"27603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a flightless bird of Mauritius, became extinct during the mid-late seventeenth\ncentury after humans destroyed the forests where the birds made their homes and\nintroduced mammals that ate their eggs.]] The 'Holocene extinction', sometimes\ncalled the 'Sixth Extinction', is the mass extinction of species during the\npresent Holocene epoch (since around 10,000 BC). The large number of extinctions\nspan numerous families of plants and animals including mammals, birds,\namphibians, reptiles and arthropods. Although 875 extinctions occurring between\n1500 and 2009 have been documented by the International Union for Conservation\nof Nature and Natural Resources, the vast majority are undocumented.\nAccording to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating, up to\n140,000 species per year may be the present rate of extinction. S.L. Pimm,\nG.J. Russell, J.L. Gittleman and T.M. Brooks, The Future of Biodiversity,\nScience 269: 347â350 (1995)\n\nThe Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large mammals known as\nmegafauna, starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago, the end of the last Ice\nAge. Such disappearances are considered to be results of both climate change and\nthe proliferation of modern humans. These extinctions, occurring near the\nPleistoceneâHolocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the Quaternary\nextinction event or Ice Age extinction. The Holocene extinction continues into\nthe 21st century.\n\nThere is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as\na distinct event, merely part of the Quaternary extinction event, or just a\nresult of natural evolution on a non-geologic scale of time. Only during these\nmost recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses.\nOverall, the Holocene extinction can be characterized by humanity's presence.\n","linknr":669,"url":"Holocene_extinction_event","recorded":1362373416,"links":36,"instances":["journal","geology","ecology","medicine"],"pdf":["http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Web_Page_PDFs/Lyons_et_al_2004_EER.pdf","http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Web_Page_PDFs/Lyons_et_al_2004_EER.pdf"],"categories":["Holocene extinctions|","Extinction","Holocene","Humans"],"headings":["Prehistoric extinctions","Ongoing Holocene extinction","Human influence on extinction","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Edward%27s_Dodo.jpg/220px-Edward%27s_Dodo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Bufo_periglenes2.jpg/250px-Bufo_periglenes2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg/26px-ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epoch","geology"],["science","journal"],["endemic","ecology"],["transmission","medicine"],["epoch","geology"],["science","journal"],["science","journal"],["science","journal"]],"members":["science","epoch","endemic","transmission"],"related":["Bird","Mauritius","Humans","Forest","Extinction_event","Species","Holocene","Epoch_(geology)","Plant","Animal","Mammal","Bird","Amphibian","Reptile","Arthropod","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources","Species-area_curve","Science_(journal)","Mammal","Megafauna","Last_Ice_Age","Climate_change","Overpopulation","Modern_human","Pleistocene","Quaternary_extinction_event","Quaternary_extinction_event","Plant","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Megafauna","Glacial_period","Mammoths","Industrial_revolution","Glacial_period","Woolly_mammoth","Clovis_people","Polynesia","Moa","Ratite","Haast's_Eagle","Adzebill","Archeology","Paleontology","Bismarck_Archipelago","Solomon_Islands","Moa-nalo","Hawaii","Nēnē-nui","Megapode","New_Caledonia","Mekosuchine_crocodiles","Fiji","Samoa","Elephant_Bird","Ratite","Subfossil_lemur","Giant_Aye-aye","Sloth_lemur","Koala_lemur","Monkey_lemur","Baboon","Macaque","Ruffed_lemur","Giant_Fossa","Malagasy_Hippopotamus","Giant_tortoise","Seychelles","Mascarene_Islands","List_of_extinct_birds","Dodo","Rodrigues_Solitaire","Réunion_Sacred_Ibis","Background_extinction_rate","Mass_extinction_events","Oxford_University_Press","Stuart_Pimm","Père_David's_Deer","Giant_Panda","Sumatran_Rhinoceros","Black-Footed_Ferret","Arthropod","Aurochs","Equus_ferus_ferus","Thylacine","Quagga","Steller's_Sea_Cow","Bluebuck","Pyrenean_Ibex","Falkland_Islands_Wolf","Atlas_Bear","Caribbean_Monk_Seal","Bali_Tiger","Javan_Tiger","Eastern_Cougar","Western_Black_Rhinoceros","Endemic_(ecology)","List_of_extinct_birds","Dodo","Pigeon","Mauritius","Indian_Ocean","Great_Auk","Passenger_Pigeon","Moa","Carolina_Parakeet","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","El_Niño","Convention_on_Biological_Diversity","Biodiversity_Action_Plan","Endangered_species","USA_Today","LA_Times","Reuters","Scientific_American","Pleistocene","Human_overpopulation","Overfishing","Greenhouse_gas","Deforestation","Hunting","Pollution","Introduced_species","Globalization_and_disease","Transmission_(medicine)","Infectious_disease","Anthropocene","E.O._Wilson","Earth","American_Museum_of_Natural_History","MSNBC","IUCN","Red_List","Nomenclature","Anthropocene","Holocene","Epoch_(geology)","Industrial_revolution","Megafauna","Late_Pleistocene","Smithsonian_Institution_Press","Geological_Society_of_America","Yale_University_Press","Ape_extinction","Biodiversity","Effects_of_global_warming","Extinction_risk_from_global_warming","List_of_extinct_animals","List_of_extinct_plants","Timeline_of_extinctions","Postmedia_News","Science_(journal)","The_Christian_Science_Monitor","Science_(journal)","Science_(journal)"]}
