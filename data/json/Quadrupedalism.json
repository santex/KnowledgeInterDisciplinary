{"cursor":"4711","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is an example of a quadruped.]]\n\n'Quadrupedalism' is a form of terrestrial locomotion in animals using four limbs\nor legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a 'quadrupedal' manner is\nknown as a 'quadruped', meaning \"four feet\" (from the Latin quad for \"four\" and\nped for \"foot\"). The majority of quadrupeds are vertebrate animals, including\nmammals such as cattle, dogs and cats, and reptiles, like lizards.\n\nBirds, humans, insects, crustaceans, and snakes are not quadrupeds. However,\nthere are some exceptions. For example, among the insects, the praying mantis is\na quadruped. A few birds may use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances, for\nexample the shoebill will sometimes use its wings to right itself after lunging\nat prey. http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/12/balaeniceps_rex.ph-\np#more\n","linknr":210,"url":"Quadrupedalism","recorded":1362673941,"links":31,"instances":["anatomy","scientist","human","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000463/01/CPNSS2.pdf"],"categories":["Tetrapods","Terrestrial locomotion"],"headings":["Quadrupeds vs. tetrapods","Quadrupedalism in humans","Quadrupedal robots","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Zebra_sideview.jpg/200px-Zebra_sideview.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["limb","anatomy"],["leg","anatomy"],["john_skoyles","scientist"],["chromosome_17","human"]],"members":["leg","john_skoyles","chromosome_17","limb"],"related":["Terrestrial_locomotion_in_animals","Limb_(anatomy)","Leg_(anatomy)","Animal","Machine","Latin","Mammal","Cattle","Dog","Cat","Reptile","Lizard","Bird","Human","Insect","Crustacean","Snake","Praying_mantis","Bird","Shoebill","Evolution","Tetrapod","Linnaean_taxonomy","Vertebrate","Amphibia","Biped","Fin","Pinniped","Snake","Vestigial_structure","Turkey","Kurd","Chimpanzee","Knuckle-walking","The_Family_That_Walks_On_All_Fours","Human_evolution","Nicholas_Humphrey","John_Skoyles_(scientist)","London_School_of_Economics","Keynes","Cambridge_University","Max_Planck_Institute","Chromosome_17_(human)","Parkour","Freerunning","Georges_HÃ©bert","BigDog","Robot","Boston_Dynamics","Foster-Miller","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","Harvard_University_Concord_Field_Station","Bipedalism","BBC_News"]}
