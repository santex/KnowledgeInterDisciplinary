{"cursor":"8548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Fitness' (often denoted ' w' in population genetics models) is a\ncentral idea in evolutionary theory. It can be defined either with respect to a\ngenotype or to a phenotype in a given environment. In either case, it describes\nthe ability to both survive and reproduce, and is equal to the average\ncontribution to the gene pool of the next generation that is made by an average\nindividual of the specified genotype or phenotype. If differences between\nalleles of a given gene affect fitness, then the frequencies of the alleles will\nchange over generations; the alleles with higher fitness become more common.\nThis process is called natural selection.\n\nAn individual's fitness is manifested through its phenotype. The phenotype is\naffected by the developmental environment as well as by genes, and the fitness\nof a given phenotype can be different in different environments. The fitnesses\nof different individuals with the same genotype are therefore not necessarily\nequal. However, since the fitness of the genotype is an averaged quantity, it\nwill reflect the reproductive outcomes of all individuals with that genotype in\na given environment or set of environments.\n\nInclusive fitness differs from individual fitness by including the ability of an\nallele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other\nindividuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a\ndifferent allele. One mechanism of inclusive fitness is kin selection.\n","linknr":285,"url":"Biological_fitness","recorded":1362501035,"links":46,"instances":["population_genetics"],"pdf":["http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/tff.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Population genetics"],"headings":["Fitness is a propensity","Measures of fitness","History","Fitness landscape","Genetic load","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/1/2/f1290186a5d0b1ceab27f4e77c0c5d68.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/9/c/39c4b397279d9970ef0a68e4c6072c68.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/f/3/cf37de1dc4397116407aabaebf1681d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/f/e6f0a12c4f3bdaa7a742d98a01da1f2d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/e/e9e272f7c16c3879e9919a5e8f4cba92.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Herbert_Spencer.jpg/150px-Herbert_Spencer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png/220px-Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"]],"members":["fixation"],"related":["Population_genetics","Evolution","Genotype","Phenotype","Gene_pool","Alleles","Gene","Natural_selection","Phenotype","Inclusive_fitness","Kin_selection","Phenotypes","Ratio","Generation","Fecundity","Mean","Genotype_frequencies","United_Kingdom","Sociologist","Herbert_Spencer","Survival_of_the_fittest","Charles_Darwin","Natural_selection","J.B.S._Haldane","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Mendelian_genetics","Inclusive_fitness","W.D._Hamilton","Fitness_landscape","Sewall_Wright","Genetic_load","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Inclusive_fitness","Natural_selection","Reproductive_success","Selection_coefficient","Universal_Darwinism","Elliott_Sober"]}
