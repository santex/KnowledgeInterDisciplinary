{"cursor":"1078","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Remarkable' is a UK company that makes stationery products out of recycled\nproducts. Its most famous was the recycled pencil, each made from one recycled\nvending machine cup. The cups are collected from the Save a Cup Recycling\nCompany. The invention became a Millennium product, which was sold as shown at\nthe Millennium Dome. Other products have been made, including plastic rulers\n(also made from vending machine cups), recycled rubber tyres; to make mouse mats\nand pencil cases.\n\nThe company has now been granted Â£20,000 by London Remade, and has bought brand\nnew binding machines to bind the recycled notepads. This has helped Remarkable\nto be able to create a greater range of products, which will help it get\ncontracts from stores like W H Smith.\n","linknr":166,"url":"remarkable","recorded":1362898005,"links":11,"instances":["law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom","Recycling organisations"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["company","law"]],"members":["company"],"related":["United_Kingdom","Company_(law)","Stationery","Recycled","Pencil","Vending_machine","Save_a_Cup_Recycling_Company","Millennium_product","Millennium_Dome","Tire","Mouse_mat","Pencil_case","London_Remade","Notepad","W_H_Smith"]}
