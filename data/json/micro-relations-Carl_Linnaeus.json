He is known as the father of modern taxonomy,\nand is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology. Many of his\nwritings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as '{{lang|la|Carolus\nLinnÃ¦us}}' (after 1761 'Carolus a LinnÃ©').\n\nLinnaeus was born in the countryside of SmÃ¥land, in southern Sweden. Linnaeus\nreceived most of his higher education at Uppsala University, and began giving\nlectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where\nhe studied and also published a first edition of his {{lang|la|[[Systema\nNaturae]]}} in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became\nprofessor of botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys\nthrough Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he\ncontinued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published\nseveral volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed\nscientists in Europe.\n\nThe Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I\nknow no greater man on earth.\" The German\nwriter Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and\nSpinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more\nstrongly.\" Swedish author August Strindberg wrote:\n\"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist\". Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called\n{{lang|la|Princeps botanicorum}} (Prince of Botanists), \"The Pliny of the\nNorth,\" and \"The Second Adam\". Broberg (2006), p. 7.\n\nIn botany, the author abbreviation used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority\nfor species' names is 'L.' In older publications sometimes the abbreviation\n\"Linn.\" is found (for instance in: . In 1959, Carl Linnaeus was designated\nas the lectotype for [[Human|Homo sapiens]], Stearn (1959), p. 4.\nwhich means that following the nomenclatural rules, Homo sapiens was validly\ndefined as the animal species to which Linnaeus belonged.\n","linknr":1497,"url":"Carl_Linnaeus","recorded":1362502000,"links":171,"instances":["ape","land","crater","biology","mythology","school","christianity","biology","botany","sweden","biology","pliny","biology","ecclesiastical","bible"],"pdf":["http://www.evolutionsmuseet.uu.se/samling/UUZM04_Linnaeus.pdf","http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Linnean/Special_Issue_8_-_The_Linneaen_Legacy.pdf","http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Linnean/Special_Issue_8_-_The_Linneaen_Legacy.pdf"],"categories":["1707
