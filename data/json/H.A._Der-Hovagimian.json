Der-Hovagimian' (sometimes spelled Ter-Hovakimyan, (Traditional\nArmenian: ÕÕ¡ÖÕ¸ÖÕ©Õ«ÖÕ¶ ÕÕ¥Ö-ÕÕ¸Õ¾Õ¡Õ¯Õ«Õ´Õ¥Õ¡Õ¶, Eastern Armenian: ÕÕ¡ÖÕ¸ÖÕ©ÕµÕ¸ÖÕ¶ ÕÕ¥Ö-\nÕÕ¸Õ¾Õ¡Õ¯Õ«Õ´ÕµÕ¡Õ¶)) born in Toronto, Ontario, is a Canadian-Armenian music composer,\nsongwriter and producer.\n\nHe signed his first recording contract with the newly found Hi-Bias Records\nimprint at the age of 17. For the following 15 years, he was mainly credited\nunder the adopted pseudonym 'Mark Ryan'.\n\nFor years, his main focus was his Temperance project. Starting out as a solo\nTech house project, his debut commercial release was the 5-track Phantasy EP,\nreleased early 1992 on Hi-Bias Records. Temperance eventually crossed over into\na more Dance-pop/Eurodance sound with the inclusion of Mark's schoolmate\nLorraine Reid on vocals. Over the next couple of years Temperance won numerous\ntop ten hits, awards, and licenses worldwide.\n\nBy 19, Mark's on the side successful remix works also led to [[Billboard\n(magazine)|Billboard]] magazine titling him one of the top remixers from Canada.\nIn 1996, Temperance peaked with its hi-nrg cover version of the 1980s hit\n\"Forever Young\".\n\nIn 1997, after the releases of 'S.P.O.T.' (Side Project of Temperance) and the\nTemperance single \"Universal Dream\", Mark parted ways to launch '22 Green\nProductions', primarily focusing on producing and remixing various local and\ninternational artists, such as soulDecision, 666, Urban Cookie Collective, Mia\nMinx, Emjay, and more.\n\nOver the years, he has been credited with producing and/or remixing over 300\ncommercially released titles in various genres under various aliases. From 1997-\n2006 '22 Green' was the credited title of most his remix works, and from 2006,\nhe began replacing his credited pseudonym Mark Ryan with 'DerHova' (a variation\nof his real name).\n\nHis song \"Qele Qele\" performed by Sirusho was Armenia's entry in the Eurovision\nSong Contest 2008. 'DerHova' composed the song, thought up the title, and\nproduced the original and remix versions of the song. Out of 43 participating\ncountries, it went on to rank 4th (Armenia's highest position), and received the\nmost 12 points in the competition.\n\nOn September 5, 2010, his production of Mama performed by Vladimir Arzumanyan,\nwas selected as Armenia's entry in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010. On\nNovember 20, the song went on to collect the most points (including the most 12\npoints) to win the contest, Armenia's first Eurovision victory.\n","linknr":132,"url":"H.A._Der-Hovagimian","recorded":1375058536,"links":["/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:DerHova.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/DerHova.jpg/220px-DerHova.jpg","/wiki/Toronto","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Pop_music","/wiki/Contemporary_R%26B","/wiki/House_music","/wiki/Techno","/wiki/New_age_music","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Arrangement","/wiki/Temperance_(group)","http://www.derhova.com/","/wiki/Western_Armenian","/wiki/Eastern_Armenian","/wiki/Toronto","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Armenians","/wiki/Temperance_(group)","/wiki/Tech_house","/wiki/Temperance_(group)","/wiki/Dance-pop","/wiki/Eurodance","/wiki/Temperance_(group)","/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)","/wiki/Forever_Young_(Alphaville_song)","/wiki/Temperance_(group)","/wiki/SoulDecision","/wiki/666_(band)","/wiki/Urban_Cookie_Collective","/wiki/Release_(music)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Qele_Qele","/wiki/Sirusho","/wiki/Armenia","/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2008","/wiki/Mama_(Vladimir_Arzumanyan_song)","/wiki/Vladimir_Arzumanyan","/wiki/Armenia","/wiki/Junior_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=edit&section=1","http://www.myspace.com/derhova","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=edit&section=2","http://www.derhova.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&oldid=564882827","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Armenian_musicians","/wiki/Category:Armenian_composers","/wiki/Category:Armenian_DJs","/wiki/Category:Armenian_music","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_of_Armenian_descent","/wiki/Category:Canadian_pop_musicians","/wiki/Category:Canadian_record_producers","/wiki/Category:Musicians_from_Toronto","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2010","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=H.A.+Der-Hovagimian&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=H.A.+Der-Hovagimian","/wiki/H.A._Der-Hovagimian","/wiki/Talk:H.A._Der-Hovagimian","#","/wiki/H.A._Der-Hovagimian","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/H.A._Der-Hovagimian","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/H.A._Der-Hovagimian","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&oldid=564882827","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5620570","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&id=564882827","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=H.A.+Der-Hovagimian","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=H.A.+Der-Hovagimian&oldid=564882827&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=H.A._Der-Hovagimian&printable=yes","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.A._Der-Hovagimjan","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5620570#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.or
