The methodology has applications across science. Examples are\n* in computer science in the analysis of algorithms, considering the performance\n  of algorithms when applied to very large input datasets.\n* the behavior of physical systems when they are very large.\n* in accident analysis when identifying the causation of crash through count\n  modeling with large number of crash counts in a given time and space. The\n  simplest example is, when considering a function f(n), there is a need to\n  describe its properties when n becomes very large. Thus, if f(n) =\n  n<sup>2</sup>+3n, the term 3n becomes insignificant compared to n<sup>2</sup>\n  when n is very large. The function \"f(n) is said to be asymptotically\n  equivalent to n<sup>2</sup> as n → ∞\", and this is written symbolically as\n  f(n) ~ n<sup>2</sup>.\n","title":"asymptotic%20analysis","headings":["Definition","Asymptotic expansion","Use in applied mathematics","Method of dominant balance","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Asymptotic_expansion","2: Ordinary_differential_equation","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Computer_science","1: Analysis_of_algorithms","1: Physical_system","1: Accident_analysis","1: Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation","1: Partial_sum","1: Stirling's_approximation","1: Asymptotic_scale","1: Laplace's_method","1: Saddle-point_method","1: Method_of_steepest_descent","1: Edgeworth_series","1: Feynman_graphs","1: Quantum_field_theory","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Mathematical_model","1: Boundary_layer#Boundary_layer_equations","1: Navier-Stokes_equations","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Product_rule","1: Chain_rule","1: Ansatz","1: Asymptotic_computational_complexity","1: Asymptotic_theory"]}
