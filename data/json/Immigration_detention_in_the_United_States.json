{"cursor":"31671","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Immigration detention in the United States' began in 1981, when the\nadministration of President Ronald Reagan reacted to the mass migration of\nasylum seekers who arrived in boats from Haiti by establishing a program to\ninterdict (i.e., stop and search certain vessels suspected of transporting\nundocumented\nHaitians). http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P960.pdf As the\nnumber of illegal immigrants who were fleeing economic and political conditions\nincreased, President Bush Sr's administration attempted to find a regional\nlocation to handle the influx of refugees and migrants. The United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) arranged for several countries in the\nregionâBelize, Honduras, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuelaâto temporarily\nprovide a safe haven for Haitians however the Coast Guard was becoming\nincreasingly overcrowded from holding hundreds of refugees and by November 18,\n1991, the United States forcibly returned 538 Haitians to\nHaiti. http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P4230.pdf Since the\noptions for safe havens in third countries in the region proved inadequate for\nthe sheer numbers of Haitians fleeing their country, the Coast Guard took them\nto the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, where they were pre-screened for\nasylum in the United States.\n\nMandatory detention was then officially authorized by the federal government in\n1996 with the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n(AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\n(IIRAIRA). From 1996 to 1998, the number of immigrants in detention increased\nfrom 8,500 to 16,000 and by 2008 this number increased to more than\n30,000. According to the Global Detention\nProject, the United States possesses the largest immigration detention system in\nthe world. In 2003, the U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) was created under the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. ICE enforces the United Statesâ immigration and\ncustoms laws, uses investigative techniques to apprehend and detain those\nsuspected of violating them, and then deports many of these individuals. The\nOffice of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), housed within ICE, oversees\nthe detention and deportation of immigrants taken into custody by ICE.\nCurrently, ICE detains immigrants in fifteen detention centers (including\nprivatized facilities), in state and local jails, in juvenile detention centers,\nand in shelters.\n\nSeveral human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and a series of reports made by the New\nYork Times have cited concerns with ICEâs management of these detention centers.\nReports refer to instances of human rights abuse and inadequate or\nunprofessional medical care in these detention facilities. Such reports have\nalso publicized the death of several immigrants in detention and have accused\nICE of covering up this information. ICE, in response, has released a list of\nall the individuals who died in its detention facilities and has publicly stated\nthat the agency provides âstate-of-the-art medical careâ and âdo[es] everything\npossible to maintain the best quality of life for the detainees\ninâ¦custody.\" In May 2008 the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008\n(H.R. 5950) was introduced to the United States Congress by Representative Zoe\nLofgren (D-CA), though no further steps have been taken to enact the bill.\n","linknr":483,"url":"Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States","recorded":1375090201,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Haiti","#cite_note-1","/wiki/George_H._W._Bush","/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees","/wiki/Belize","/wiki/Honduras","/wiki/Trinidad","/wiki/Tobago","/wiki/Venezuela","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Coast_Guard","/wiki/Guantanamo","/wiki/Cuba","/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act","/wiki/Illegal_Immigration_Reform_and_Immigrant_Responsibility_Act","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-Kalhan2010-5","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Immigration_detention","#cite_note-Global_Detention_Project-6","/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement","/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security","#cite_note-Global_Detention_Project-6","/wiki/Amnesty_International","/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union","/wiki/New_York_Times","#cite_note-7","/wiki/United_States_Congress","#Process_of_detention_and_removal","#Office_of_Enforcement_and_Removal_Operations","#Secure_Communities","#Section_287.28g.29","#Detention_at_the_border","#Mandatory_and_Indefinite_Detention","#Deportation","#Detention_centers","#Privatization","#Conditions","#Criticisms","#Alternatives","#Pro-detention_argument","#Immigration_detention_under_Obama","#See_also","#Notes","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alien_Registration_Number&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Aguadilla,_Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Batavia,_New_York","/wiki/El_Centro,_California","/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas","/wiki/Florence,_Arizona","/wiki/Miami,_Florida","/wiki/Los_Fresnos,_Texas","/wiki/San_Pedro,_California","/wiki/Aurora,_Colorado","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Laredo,_Texas","/wiki/Seattle,_Washington","/wiki/Elizabeth,_New_Jersey","/wiki/Queens,_New_York","/wiki/San_Diego,_California","/wiki/Juvenile_detention","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Secure_Communities","/wiki/Biometric_identification","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-ice.gov-10","/wiki/Fingerprint","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Detainer","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Obama_administration","#cite_note-ice.gov-10","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/IIRAIRA","/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965","/wiki/Section_287(g)","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Refugees","/wiki/Right_of_asylum","/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Bail_bond","/wiki/AEDPA","/wiki/IIRAIRA","/wiki/Moral_turpitude","#cite_note-17","/wiki/ACLU","/wiki/Due_process","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Indefinite_detention","/wiki/Repatriation","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Executive_Office_for_Immigration_Review","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9","#cite_note-19","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/ACLU","#cite_note-Anna_Gorman-20","/wiki/Los_Angeles","#cite_note-Anna_Gorman-20","/wiki/California","#cite_note-articles.latimes.com-21","/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California","#cite_note-articles.latimes.com-21","/w/index.php?title=Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=10","#cite_note-Kalhan2010-5","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Pro-bono","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Amnesty_International","/wiki/ACLU","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times","/wiki/New_York_Times","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times","#cite_note-22","/wiki/New_York_Times","#cite_note-Nina_Bernstein-23","/wiki/Mentally_disabled","/wiki/New_
