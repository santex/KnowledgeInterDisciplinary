{"cursor":"2887","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'National Council for the Defense of Democracy–Forces for the Defense\nof Democracy' (French: Conseil National Pour la DÃ©fense de la\nDÃ©mocratie–Forces pour la DÃ©fense de la DÃ©mocratie, NCDD–FDD) is the\ncurrent ruling party in Burundi. During Burundi's civil war CNDD-FDD was the\nmost significant rebel group active and became a major political party in\nBurundi. In March 2012, Pascal Nyabenda was elected as President of CNDD-FDD.\nPascal Nyabenda was formerly Governor of Bubanza and currently attends Hope\nAfrica University.\n\nDuring the civil war, CNDD was the political wing of the organization, while\nthe FDD was the military wing. It was founded in 1994, a year after the\nassassination of the first democratically elected President Melchior Ndadaye.\nThe political wing was dominated by Hutu intellectuals from the southern\nregion of Bururi led by Leonard Nyangoma, while the fighting wing was\ncomposed of troops drawn from throughout the country, which led to a split in\nthe group in 2001.\n\nThe rebel group was often referred to simply as 'Forces for the Defense of\nDemocracy' ('FDD'). In 2001, the CNDD–FDD consisted of about 25,000 rebels\nled by Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. However a schism in October 2001 led to the\noverthrow of Ndayikengurukiye by Pierre Nkurunziza. The Nkurunziza-led faction,\nconsisting of 20,000 to 22,000 troops signed a ceasefire with the government in\nDecember 2002, but continued fighting. The faction led by Ndayikengurukiye\nbecame the lesser of the two with about 5,000 fighters. It also signed a\nceasefire with the government in October 2002 to which it has roughly held.\n\nAt an official ceremony in January 2005, the group registered as a legal\npolitical party. In largely peaceful parliamentary elections on 4 July 2005, the\nCNDD won an estimated 60 to 80 percent of the vote, making it likely that a CNDD\nrepresentative would be chosen president in August. Pierre Nkurunziza indeed was\nelected President of Burundi unopposed on August 19. At the legislative\nelections, the party won 57.8% and 64 out of 118 seats. CNDD-FDD's youth wing is\nled by Ezechiel Nibigira.\n","linknr":177,"url":"National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy–Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy","recorded":1375082003,"links":["/w/index.php?title=National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy%E2%80%93Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy%E2%80%93Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:History_of_Burundi","/wiki/History_of_Burundi","/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Burundi.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Coat_of_arms_of_Burundi.svg/80px-Coat_of_arms_of_Burundi.svg.png","/wiki/Origins_of_Tutsi_and_Hutu","/wiki/Urewe","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Burundi","/wiki/German_East_Africa","/wiki/Ruanda-Urundi","/wiki/Burundi","/wiki/Burundian_Genocide","/wiki/Burundian_Civil_War","/wiki/Second_Congo_War","/wiki/Titanic_Express_massacre","/wiki/National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy_%E2%80%93_Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy","/wiki/Timeline_of_Burundian_history","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Flag_of_Burundi.svg/32px-Flag_of_Burundi.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Burundi","/wiki/Template:History_of_Burundi","/wiki/Template_talk:History_of_Burundi","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:History_of_Burundi&action=edit","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Burundi","/wiki/Pascal_Nyabenda","/wiki/Pascal_Nyabenda","/wiki/Hope_Africa_University","/wiki/Melchior_Ndadaye","/wiki/Bururi","/w/index.php?title=Leonard_Nyangoma&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jean-Bosco_Ndayikengurukiye&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pierre_Nkurunziza","/wiki/Burundi_elections,_2005","/wiki/Pierre_Nkurunziza","/wiki/President_of_Burundi","/wiki/Legislative","/wiki/Burundi_elections,_2005","/wiki/Ezechiel_Nibigira","/w/index.php?title=National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy%E2%80%93Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hussein_Radjabu","/w/index.php?title=National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy%E2%80%93Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy&action=edit&section=2","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4650997.stm","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Template:Armed_groups_in_the_Congo_wars","/wiki/Template_talk:Armed_groups_in_the_Congo_wars","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Armed_groups_in_the_Congo_wars&action=edit","/wiki/First_Congo_War","/wiki/Second_Congo_War","/wiki/Military_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","/wiki/Mobuto_Sese_Seko","/wiki/Angolan_Armed_Forces","/wiki/Military_of_Chad","/wiki/Armed_forces_of_the_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya","/wiki/Namibia_Defence_Force","/wiki/Sudan_People%27s_Armed_Forces","/wiki/Zimbabwe_National_Army","/wiki/Angolan_Armed_Forces","/wiki/Military_of_Burundi","/wiki/Rwandan_Defense_Forces","/wiki/Uganda_People%27s_Defence_Force","/wiki/Alliance_of_Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Congo","/wiki/Rally_for_Congolese_Democracy","/wiki/Rally_for_Congolese_Democracy%E2%80%93Goma","/wiki/Banyamulenge","/wiki/Tutsis","/w/index.php?title=RCD-Congo&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Movement_for_the_Liberation_of_Congo","/wiki/Forces_for_Renewal","/w/index.php?title=RCD-National&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Union_of_Congolese_Patriots","/w/index.php?title=Front_de_Lib%C3%A9ration_du_Congo&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sudan_People%27s_Liberation_Army/Movement","/wiki/UNITA","/wiki/Interahamwe","/wiki/Rassemblement_D%C3%A9mocratique_pour_le_Rwanda","/wiki/Interahamwe","/wiki/Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda","/wiki/Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda","/wiki/Allied_Democratic_Forces","/wiki/Lord%27s_Resistance_Army","/wiki/Nationalist_and_Integrationist_Front","/wiki/National_Council_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy-Forces_for_the_Defense_of_Democracy","/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Burundi)","/wiki/Mai-Mai","/wiki/UNITA","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Congo","/wiki/Template:Burundian_political_parties","/wiki/Template_talk:Burundian_political_parties","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Burundian_political_parties&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Burundi","/wiki/Burundi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Flag_of_Burundi.
