Wilbert Awdry, and the spin-\noff TV series [[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]. James is a mixed-traffic\nengine, which means he is just as capable of pulling coaches as trucks. He has a\n2-6-0 (\"Mogul\") wheel arrangement and is engine number 5 on the North Western\nRailway, the Fat Controller's railway on the Island of Sodor.\n\nJames first appeared in the Railway Series in 1946, in the book ''Thomas the\nTank Engine''. Two books in the series, no. 3 ''James the Red Engine'' and no.\n28 ''James and the Diesel Engines'' are dedicated to James.\n\nIn the stories, James crashed into a field on his first day. The accident was\nblamed on his wooden brake blocks, which were thereafter replaced with metal\nones. James has a reputation for being naughty. Some of his incidents include\nbreaking a coach brake pipe and needing a passenger's bootlace to fix it,\ncrashing into tar wagons, and spinning on the turntable although that was due to\nthe wind rather than him. Despite his behaviour, James is an engine proud of his\nred paint, hard-working and reliable and is generally considered to be a really\nuseful engine.\n\nHe is very proud of his red paint and shining brass dome, and so likes to stay\nclean. He hates pulling trucks, and believes that he should only be used to pull\ncoaches. He thinks himself superior to the other engines, and can be shallow,\nboastful and arrogant â particularly to Edward, and those engines who appear old-\nfashioned, weak, slow or dirty. However, on a number of occasions he has found\nhimself forced to accept help from those he has insulted, and is ultimately\napologetic.\n\nJames is one of the few characters to have their own song (James The Really\nSplendid Engine) in the TV series, the chorus of which is based on his theme\nmusic used in the early seasons.\n\nIn the Railway Series books, James was for a long time one of the last engines\nto retain a prejudice against diesels. However, he was forced to admit in the\nbook ''James and the Diesel Engines'' that there was nothing wrong with diesels\nas a whole, and this appears to be one of the few lessons that has stuck.\n","linknr":308,"url":"James_the_Red_Engine","recorded":1363485534,"links":["/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_%26_Friends","/wiki/File:Thomas_and_Friends_James.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Thomas_and_Friends_James.jpg","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_books#Thomas_the_Tank_Engine","/wiki/The_Railway_Series","/wiki/Thomas_and_Friends","/wiki/Kerry_Shale","/wiki/Keith_Wickham","/wiki/Susan_Roman","/wiki/Michael_Angelis","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Fiction","/wiki/Anthropomorphic","/wiki/Tender_locomotive","/wiki/The_Railway_Series","/wiki/Wilbert_Awdry","/wiki/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_%26_Friends","/wiki/2-6-0","/wiki/North_Western_Railway_(fictional)","/wiki/Fat_Controller","/wiki/Sodor_(fictional_island)","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#Thomas_the_Tank_Engine","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#James_the_Red_Engine","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#James_and_the_Diesel_Engines","/wiki/Bootlace","/wiki/Brass","/wiki/Prejudice","/wiki/Diesel_locomotive","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#James_and_the_Diesel_Engines","#Character_profile","#Behind_the_scenes","#James.27s_prototype","#James_as_a_model","#James_the_Red_Engine_in_The_Railway_Series","#James_the_Red_Engine_in_the_TV_series","#James_in_Thomas_and_the_Magic_Railroad","#James_in_the_Guinness_Book_of_Records","#.22Real_life.22_James","#References","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bootlace","/wiki/Edward_the_Blue_Engine","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/The_Railway_Series","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#Thomas_the_Tank_Engine","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway","/wiki/L%26YR_Class_28","/wiki/0-6-0","/wiki/George_Hughes_(engineer)","/wiki/L%26YR_Class_27","/wiki/John_Aspinall_(engineer)","#cite_note-IoSPHR-1","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#The_Island_of_Sodor:_Its_People.2C_History_and_Railways","/wiki/Pony_truck","/wiki/2-6-0","#cite_note-IoSPHR-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-RLTtTE-3","#cite_note-IoSPHR-1","/wiki/Retcon","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/OO_gauge","/wiki/Glasgow_and_South_Western_Railway","/wiki/Austrian_Goods","/wiki/Peter_Drummond_(engineer)","#cite_note-RLTtTE-3","/wiki/Tri-ang_Railways","/wiki/Midland_Railway_Johnson_0-6-0","/wiki/Hornby_Railways","#cite_note-RLTtTE-3","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Kerry_Shale","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Keith_Wickham","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Susan_Roman","/wiki/Thomas_and_the_Magic_Railroad","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Michael_Angelis","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Diesel_10","/wiki/Teleportation","/wiki/Michael_E._Rodgers","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Harold_the_Helicopter","/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_Records","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Mid-Hants_Railway","/wiki/Southern_Railway_(UK)","/wiki/Southern_Railway_N_Class","/wiki/The_Railway_Series","/wiki/National_Railway_Museum","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/East_Lancashire_Railway","/wiki/LMS_Ivatt_Class_2_Mogul","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=James_the_Red_Engine&action=edit&section=10","#cite_ref-IoSPHR_1-0","#cite_ref-IoSPHR_1-1","#cite_ref-IoSPHR_1-2","/wiki/Wilbert_Awdry","/wiki/List_of_Railway_Series_Books#The_Island_of_Sodor:_Its_People.2C_History_and_Railways","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-434-92762-7","#cite_ref-2","http://www.railuk.info/steam/getsteamclass.php?item=LYR28","#cite_ref-RLTtTE_3-0","#cite_ref-RLTtTE_3-1","#cite_ref-RLTtTE_3-2","http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/james.htm","http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/james.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205461/fullcredits","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSource
