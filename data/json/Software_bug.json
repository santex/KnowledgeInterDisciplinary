{"cursor":"32042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'software bug' is an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer\nprogram or system that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or causes it\nto behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made by\npeople in either a program's source code or its design, and a few are caused by\ncompilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of\nbugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be\nbuggy. Reports detailing bugs in a program are commonly known as bug reports,\ndefect reports, fault reports, problem reports, trouble reports, change\nrequests, and so forth.\n\nBugs trigger errors that can in turn have a wide variety of ripple effects, with\nvarying levels of inconvenience to the user of the program. Some bugs have only\na subtle effect on the program's functionality, and may thus lie undetected for\na long time. More serious bugs may cause the program to crash or freeze. Others\nqualify as security bugs and might for example enable a malicious user to bypass\naccess controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.\n\nThe results of bugs may be extremely serious. Bugs in the code controlling the\nTherac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for some patient\ndeaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1 billion\nprototype Ariane 5 rocket was destroyed less than a minute after launch, due to\na bug in the on-board guidance computer program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force\nChinook crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially\ndismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by [[Computer Weekly]] uncovered\nsufficient evidence to convince a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been\ncaused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine control computer.\n\nIn 2002, a study commissioned by the US Department of Commerce' National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology concluded that \"software bugs, or errors,\nare so prevalent and so detrimental that they cost the US economy an estimated\n$59 billion annually, or about 0.6 percent of the gross domestic\nproduct\".\n","linknr":504,"url":"Software_bug","recorded":1362563151,"links":67,"instances":["computer_science","computing","engineering","computer_science","programming_language","computer_graphics","programming_language","programming","computer_programming","program_lifecycle_phase","computing","technology","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Software
