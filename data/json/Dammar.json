Most is produced by\ntapping trees; however, some is collected in fossilized form from the ground.\nThe gum varies in colour from clear to pale yellow, while the fossilized form is\ngrey-brown. Dammar gum is a triterpenoid resin, containing a large number of\ntriterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight\ncompounds (dammarane, dammarenolic acid, oleanane, oleanonic acid, etc.), but\ndammar also contains a polymeric fraction, composed of\npolycadinene.
