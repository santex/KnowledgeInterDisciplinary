(ed)The Oxford Companion\nto Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 1995.</ref> In theism, God is the\ncreator and sustainer of the universe. In deism, God is the creator (but not the\nsustainer) of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself.\nTheologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different\nconceptions of God. Common among these are omniscience (infinite knowledge),\nomnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere),\nomnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary\nexistence. Monotheism is the belief in the existence of one God or in the\noneness of God. God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial), a\npersonal being, the source of all moral obligation, and the \"greatest\nconceivable existent\".<ref name=Swinburne/> Many notable medieval philosophers\nand modern philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence\nof God.<ref name=\"Platinga\" />\n\nThere are many names for God, and different names are attached to different\ncultural ideas about who God is and what attributes he possesses. In the Hebrew\nBible \"I Am that I Am\", and the \"Tetragrammaton\" YHVH are used as names of God,\nwhile Yahweh, and Jehovah are sometimes used in Christianity as vocalizations of\nYHVH. In Arabic, the name Allah (\"the God\") is used, and because of the\npredominance of Islam among Arab speakers, the name \"Allah\" has connotations\nwith Islamic faith and culture. Muslims regard a multitude of titular names for\nGod, while in Judaism it is common to refer to God by the titular names Elohim\nor Adonai. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic\ndeity.<ref>Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity - Page 136, Michael P.\nLevine - 2002</ref> Other religions have names for God, for instance, Baha in\nthe Bahá'í Faith,<ref>A Feast for the Soul: Meditations on the Attributes of God\n: ... - Page x, Baháʾuʾlláh, Joyce Watanabe - 2006</ref> Waheguru in\nSikhism,<ref>Philosophy and Faith of Sikhism - Page ix, Kartar Singh Duggal -\n1988</ref> and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.<ref>The Intellectual Devotional:\nRevive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Roam confidently with the\ncultured class, David S.
