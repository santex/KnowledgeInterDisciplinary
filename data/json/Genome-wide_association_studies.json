{"cursor":"36142","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" depicting several strongly associated risk loci. Each dot represents a SNP,\n with the X-axis showing genomic location and Y-axis showing association level.\n This example is taken from a GWA study investigating microcirculation, so the\n tops indicates genetic variants that more often are found in individuals with\n constrictions in small blood vessels. ]] In\n genetic epidemiology, a 'genome-wide association study' (GWA study, or GWAS),\n also known as 'whole genome association study' (WGA study, or WGAS), is an\n examination of many common genetic variants in different individuals to see if\n any variant is associated with a trait. GWAS typically focus on associations\n between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major diseases.\n\nThese studies normally compare the DNA of two groups of participants: people\nwith the disease (cases) and similar people without (controls). Each person\ngives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using\nSNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people\nwith the disease, the SNP is said to be \"associated\" with the disease. The\nassociated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome which\ninfluences the risk of disease. In contrast to methods which specifically test\none or a few genetic regions, the GWA studies investigate the entire genome. The\napproach is therefore said to be non-candidate-driven in contrast to gene-\nspecific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants\nin DNA which are associated with a disease, but cannot on their own specify\nwhich genes are causal.\n\nThe first successful GWA study was published in 2005 and investigated patients\nage-related macular degeneration. It found two SNPs which had significantly\naltered allele frequency when comparing with healthy controls. , hundreds or thousands of individuals are tested,\nover 1,200 human GWA studies have examined over 200 diseases and traits, and\nalmost 4,000 SNP associations have been found.\nSeveral GWA studies have received criticism for omitting important quality\ncontrol steps, rendering the findings invalid, but modern publications address\nthese issues. However, the methodology itself still has opponents.\n","linknr":642,"url":"Genome-wide_association_studies","recorded":1362505177,"links":34,"instances":["genetics","genetics","genetics","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic epidemiology","Genetics","Human genome projects"],"headings":["Background","Methods","Results","Clinical applications","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Manhattan_Plot.png/300px-Manhattan_Plot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/GWAS_Disease_allele_effects.png/340px-GWAS_Disease_allele_effects.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Method_example_for_GWA_study_designs.png/300px-Method_example_for_GWA_study_designs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Regional_Association_Plot.png/220px-Regional_Association_Plot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg/8px-Closed_Access_logo_alternative.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deletion","genetics"],["insertion","genetics"],["biomarker","medicine"],["dominance","genetics"]],"members":["dominance","insertion","deletion","biomarker"],"related":["Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Genetic_association","Microcirculation","Genetic_epidemiology","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Single-nucleotide_polymorphisms","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","SNP_array","Allele","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Allele_frequency","Human_genome","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Deletion_(genetics)","Insertion_(genetics)","Copy_number_variation","Phenotype","Genetic_linkage","Genetic_association","Allele","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Biobanks","International_HapMap_Project","Haplotype","SNP_array","Chi-squared_test","Genetic_association","Coronary_artery_disease","Case-control_study","Allele_frequency","Odds_ratio","P-value","Chi-squared_test","Biomarker_(medicine)","Expression_quantitative_trait_loci","Dominance_(genetics)","Recessive","Bioinformatics","Confounding","Population_stratification","Manhattan_plot","Multiple_comparisons","LDL-cholesterol","Haplotype","Genetic_association","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Complement_factor_H","Wellcome_Trust","Coronary_heart_disease","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Crohn's_disease","Bipolar_disorder","Hypertension","Odds_ratios","Blood_lipids","Proinsulin","Heritability","Monozygotic","Drug_development","Pharmaceutical_drug","Medical_diagnosis","Prognosis","Pathophysiology","Hepatitis_C","Pegylated_interferon-alpha-2a","Pegylated_interferon-alpha-2b","Ribavirin","Interleukin_28B","Gene_expression","Expression_quantitative_trait_loci","Small_interfering_RNA","Knockout_mouse","Low-density_lipoprotein","Cardiovascular_disease","Multiple_comparisons","Population_stratification","False-positive","SNP_array","Retraction","Linkage_analysis","Sequencing","SNP_array","Association_mapping","Genetic_association","Genetic_linkage","Linkage_disequilibrium","National_Human_Genome_Research_Institute"]}
