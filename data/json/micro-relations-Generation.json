In kinship terminology, it is a\nstructural term designating the parent-child relationship. The term is also\noften used synonymously with [[cohort]] in social science, even though some\nresearchers believe that this usage is misleading; under this formulation the\nterm means \"people within a delineated population who experience the same\nsignificant event within a given period of time.\"\nGeneration in this sense of birth cohort, also known as a \"social generation,\"\nis widely used in popular culture, and has been the basis for much social\nanalysis. Serious analysis of generations began in the 19th century, emerging\nfrom an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and\nthe idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some\nanalysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories\nin a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other\nfactors such as class, gender, race, education and so on.\n","linknr":480,"url":"Generation","recorded":1362483008,"links":51,"instances":["statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.uneca.org/acgs/mdgs/Education_Empirical_report.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/49/41919586.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db21.pdf"],"categories":["Demographics","Cultural generations"],"headings":["Familial generation","Social generation","Generational Theory","Generational Tension","List of generations","Other generations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Lynch_Armenia_Five_generations.png/300px-Lynch_Armenia_Five_generations.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Uspop.svg/300px-Uspop.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Baby_Mother_Grandmother_and_Great_Grandmother.jpg/250px-Baby_Mother_Grandmother_and_Great_Grandmother.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Logo_sociology.svg/28px-Logo_sociology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cohort","statistics"],["cohort","statistics"]],"members":["cohort"],"related":["Mother","Grandmother","Great-grandmother","Latin","Reproduction","Biology","Offspring","Social_science","Emile_Littré","Modernisation","Industrialisation","Westernisation","Age_of_Enlightenment","Social_progress","Young_Italy","Young_Germany","Sturm_und_Drang","German_Youth_Movement","Romantic_movement","Childhood","Adulthood","White-collar_worker","Nationalism","Public_education","Auguste_Comte","John_Stuart_Mill","Wilhelm_Dilthey","Karl_Mannheim","Theory_of_generations","Martin_Heidegger","Jose_Ortega_y_Gasset","William_Strauss","Neil_Howe","Strauss-Howe_generational_theory","Baby_boomers","Pew_Research_Center","Western_world","Lost_Generation","Gertrude_Stein","World_War_I","Greatest_Generation","Veterans","World_War_II","Great_Depression","Tom_Brokaw","Greatest_Generation","Silent_Generation","Military_service","Baby_boomer","World_War_II","Generation_X","Baby_boom","Subcultures","Counterculture","Generation_Y","Millennials","Generation_Z","Cohort_(statistics)","Generation_Y","China","Post-80s","China's_Generation_Y","Little_Emperor_Syndrome","People's_Republic_of_China","One-child_policy","Consumerism","Entrepreneurship","World_economy","Superpower","Post-80s","Hong_Kong","Opposition_to_the_Guangzhou-Hong_Kong_Express_Rail_Link","Post-materialism","Lee_Tung_Street","Anti-colonialism","Sustainable_development","South_Korea","386_generation","Syngman_Rhee","India","Indian_Emergency","Beat_Generation","Counterculture_of_the_1960s","Jonathan_Pontell","Cohort_(statistics)","Anglosphere","Post–World_War_II_baby_boom","Generation_X","Hip_Hop_Generation","Stolen_Generation","Financial_crisis_of_2007-2008","Greek_people","Twixter","Career","Underemployment","Salary","2010–2011_Greek_protests","MTV_Generation","Generationism","Intergenerationality","Generational_accounting","Intergenerational_equity","Strauss-Howe_generational_theory","Transgenerational_design","Generation_Gap","Strauss_and_Howe"]}
