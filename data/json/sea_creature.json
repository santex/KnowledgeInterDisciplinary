      "text" : "\n\n\n'Marine biology' is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other\nmarine or brackish bodies of water. Given that in biology many phyla, families\nand genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land,\nmarine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on\ntaxonomy. Marine biology differs from marine ecology as marine ecology is\nfocused on how organisms interact with each other and the environment, and\nbiology is the study of the organisms themselves.\n\nA large proportion of all life on Earth exists in the oceans. Exactly how large\nthe proportion is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered.\nOceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, and because of their depth they\ncontain about 300 times the habitable volume of the terrestrial habitats on\nEarth. The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny\nlayers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in\nsurface tension between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the oceanic\ntrenches, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean.\nSpecific habitats include coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows,\ntidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean (pelagic) zone,\nwhere solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible\nboundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic phytoplankton and\nzooplankton to huge cetaceans (whales) 30 meters (98 feet) in length.\n\nMarine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in\naddition to helping to support recreation and tourism all over the world. At a\nfundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet.\nMarine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved\nin the regulation of the Earth's climate.<ref name = DMS>{{cite journal\n| title = Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the\n| feedback response volume = 18 issue = 1 coauthors = Karl E.

It is\nalso becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other\norganisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge\nregarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is\nrapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles\ninclude those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's\nrespiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean).\nLarge areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.\n",
