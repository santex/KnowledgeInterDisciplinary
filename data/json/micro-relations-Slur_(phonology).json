{"cursor":"14684","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Relaxed pronunciation' (also called 'condensed pronunciation' or 'word slurs')\nis a phenomenon that happens when the syllables of common words are slurred\ntogether. It is almost always present in normal speech, in all natural languages\nbut not in some constructed languages, such as Loglan or Lojban, which are\ndesigned so that all words are parsable.\n\nSome shortened forms of words and phrases, such as contractions or weak\nforms can be considered to derive from relaxed pronunciations, but a phrase\nwith a relaxed pronunciation is not the same as a contraction. In English,\nwhere contractions are common, they are considered part of the standard\nlanguage and accordingly used in many contexts (except on very formal speech\nor in formal/legal writing); however, relaxed pronunciation is markedly\ninformal in register. This is also sometimes reflected in writing:\ncontractions have a standard written form, but relaxed pronunciations may\nnot, outside of dialect spelling.\n\nCertain relaxed pronunciations occur only in specific grammatical contexts, the\nexact understanding of which can be complicated.
