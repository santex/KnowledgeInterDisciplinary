{"cursor":"3624","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'third farthing' was a British coin ( of a penny, of a pound) which was\nproduced in various years between 1827 and 1913.\n\nThe coin was produced in 1827 exclusively for use in Malta, but it is considered\nto be part of the British coinage as at that time Malta was considered more as a\npart of Britain than a colony. The farthing coin was already in circulation in\nMalta, as a '3 grani' coin, and the third farthing was introduced as '1 grano'.\nA proclamation issued in Malta on 3 November 1827 legalised the new coins,\nreferring to them as British Grains. The cost of living in Malta was lower than\nin Britain, and it was not considered appropriate to introduce them in Britain.\n\nThe obverse of the 1827 coin bears the left-facing portrait of King George IV,\nwith the inscription GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA 1827 while the\nreverse shows a seated Britannia with shield, facing right and holding a\ntrident, with the inscription BRITANNIAR REX FID DEF . There was\nno indication of its value. The coin was made of copper, weighed 1.5 to\n1.6 grams, and had a diameter of 16 millimetres.\n\nIn 1835, in the reign of King William IV there was another issue, also of\ncopper, 16 millimetres in diameter, and weighing 1.5 to 1.6 grams. The\nobverse of this coin bears the right-facing portrait of William IV with the\ninscription GULIELMUS IIII DEI GRATIA 1835 , and the same reverse\nas before.\n\nComparatively few coins were needed for Malta in the reign of Queen Victoria, so\ncopper third farthings were only minted in 1844, to the same physical standards\nas beforeâthe obverse shows a left-facing portrait of Victoria inscribed\nVICTORIA DEI GRATIA 1844 and the reverse shows the seated\nBritannia with the inscription BRITANNIAR REG FID DEF .\n\nBy the time a further mintage of the denomination was needed, in 1866, the coins\nwere made of bronze, and were only 15 millimetres in diameter, weighing between\n0.9 and 1.0 gram. The inscription around the Queen's head this time was\nVICTORIA D G BRITT REG F D , while the design of the reverse\ncontained a crown over the words ONE THIRD FARTHING date within a\nwreath. The issue was repeated in 1868, 1876, 1878, 1881, 1884, and 1885.\n\nAt the start of the reign of King Edward VII, in 1902 a further Â£100 worth of\nthe denomination (i.e. 288,000 coins) was produced, to the same standards and\nreverse design as before. The obverse shown the right-facing head of King Edward\nVII and the inscription EDWARDVS VII D G BRITT OMN REX F D IND\nIMP .\n\nIn 1913 a final issue of Â£100 worth of coins was made, bearing the left facing\nhead of King George V with the inscription GEORGIVS V D G BRITT OMN REX F\nD IND IMP on the obverse, and the same reverse design, size and weight\nas before.\n\nFor other denominations, see British coinage.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Third_farthing_(British_coin)","recorded":1375060775,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/British_coinage","/wiki/Farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/British_coinage","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.coinsgb.com","http://www.coinwiki.co.uk/index.php?title=Third_Farthings","/wiki/Template:British_coinage","/wiki/Template_talk:British_coinage","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:British_coinage&action=edit","/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling","/wiki/Penny_(British_decimal_coin)","/wiki/Two_pence_(British_decimal_coin)","/wiki/Five_pence_(British_coin)","/wiki/Ten_pence_(British_coin)","/wiki/Twenty_pence_(British_coin)","/wiki/Fifty_pence_(British_coin)","/wiki/One_pound_(British_coin)","/wiki/Two_pounds_(British_coin)","/wiki/British_twenty-five_pence_coin","/wiki/Five_pounds_(British_coin)","/wiki/Royal_Maundy","/wiki/Quarter_sovereign_(British_coin)","/wiki/Half_sovereign_(British_coin)","/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin)","/wiki/Britannia_(coin)","/wiki/Halfpenny_(British_decimal_coin)","/wiki/Quarter_farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Half_farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Halfpenny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)","/wiki/Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)","/wiki/Threepence_(British_coin)","/wiki/Groat_(coin)","/wiki/Sixpence_(British_coin)","/wiki/Shilling_(British_coin)","/wiki/Two_shillings_(British_coin)","/wiki/Half_crown_(British_coin)","/wiki/Double_florin_(British_coin)","/wiki/Crown_(British_coin)","/wiki/Half_guinea","/wiki/Guinea_(British_coin)","/wiki/Pound_sterling","/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling","/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling","/wiki/List_of_British_banknotes_and_coins","/wiki/Scottish_coinage","/wiki/Coins_of_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_people_on_coins_of_the_United_Kingdom","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&oldid=550747951","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Coins_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:History_of_British_coinage","/wiki/Category:Malta_Colony","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Third+farthing+%28British+coin%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Third+farthing+%28British+coin%29","/wiki/Third_farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Talk:Third_farthing_(British_coin)","#","/wiki/Third_farthing_(British_coin)","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Third_farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Third_farthing_(British_coin)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&oldid=550747951","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(British_coin)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7785056","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Third_farthing_%28British_coin%29&id=550747951","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Third+farthing+%28British+coin%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Third+farthing+%28British+coin%29&oldid=550747951&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Third_farthing_(B
