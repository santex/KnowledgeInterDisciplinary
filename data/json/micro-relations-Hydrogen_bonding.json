{"cursor":"31603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" dimer complex reported by Meijer and coworkers. The hydrogen bonds\n are the dotted lines.]] helps stabilize the enol tautomer.]]\n\nA 'hydrogen bond' is the electromagnetic attractive interaction of a polar\nhydrogen atom in a molecule or chemical group and an electronegative atom, such\nas nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine, from another molecule or chemical group. It is\nnot a covalent chemical bond. The hydrogen atom has an attraction to another\nelectronegative atom. These attractions can occur between molecules\n(intermolecularly), or within different parts of a single molecule\n(intramolecularly). The hydrogen bond (5 to 30 kJ/mole) is stronger\nthan a van der Waals interaction, but weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. This\ntype of bond occurs in both inorganic molecules such as water and organic\nmolecules like DNA and proteins.\n\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of\nwater (100 Â°C) compared to the other group 16 hydrides that have no hydrogen\nbonds. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding is partly responsible for the secondary,\ntertiary, and quaternary structures of proteins and nucleic acids. It also plays\nan important role in the structure of polymers, both synthetic and natural.\n\nIn 2011 an IUPAC Task Group recommended a modern evidence-based definition of\nhydrogen bonding. This new definition was published in the IUPAC journal [[Pure\nand Applied Chemistry]], this detailed technical report provides the\nrationale behind the new definition.\n","linknr":570,"url":"Hydrogen_bonding","recorded":1362508408,"links":69,"instances":["physics","chemistry","mathematics","molecule","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical
