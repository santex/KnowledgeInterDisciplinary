{"cursor":"4361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn chemistry, the 'empirical formula' of a chemical compound is the simplest\npositive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound. A simple\nexample of this concept is that the empirical formula of hydrogen peroxide, or\nH 2O 2, would simply be HO.\n\nAn empirical formula makes no reference to isomerism, structure, or absolute\nnumber of atoms. The empirical formula is used as standard for most ionic\ncompounds, such as CaCl 2, and for macromolecules, such as\nSiO 2.\n\nIn contrast, the molecular formula identifies the number of each type of atom in\na molecule, and the structural formula also shows the structure of the molecule.\n\nFor example, glucose (), ribose (), acetic acid (), and formaldehyde () all have\ndifferent molecular formulas but the same empirical formula: . This is the\nactual molecular formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number\nof atoms, ribose has five times the number of atoms, and glucose has six times\nthe number of atoms.\n\nFor example, the chemical compound n-hexane has the structural formula , which\nshows that it has 6 carbon atoms arranged in a chain, and 14 hydrogen atoms.\nHexane's molecular formula is , and its empirical formula is , showing a C:H\nratio of 3:7. Different compounds can have the same empirical formula.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Chemical_composition","recorded":1362672357,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical formulas","Experimental physics"],"headings":["Calculating Empirical Formulas","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/b/24ba814129ece40129f7f7336d690057.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/3/4639a17648536b98b910940c4909235d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/c/1ac23d2dbef55168dcbb420f2c042bc0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/e/4/be40ac0f098257a8ffda92a3c5f38671.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/7/1/e711343f12408086682618382ed62f1f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/e/9/be9b72a195db70e9cdebfaf3478a1e55.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/8/4d84d20ab2f3a3fa36d7f9b8f4bf857b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/b/00b7f2ad5d9d485569792be54c2402ed.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/9/98937cf001a593175629207f426cbcfb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_compound","Atom","Hydrogen_peroxide","Isomer","Calcium_chloride","Macromolecules","Silicon_dioxide","Molecular_formula","Structural_formula","Glucose","Ribose","Acetic_acid","Formaldehyde","N-hexane","Carbon","Hydrogen","Methyl_acetate","Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen"]}
