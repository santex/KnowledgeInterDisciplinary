Some plants have physical\ndefenses such as thorns, but by far the most common protection is\nchemical. Keddy, P.A. 2007. [http://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-\nConsequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes,\nConsequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter\n7. Over millennia, natural selection has produced a complicated and vast\narray of chemical compounds that deter herbivores. Tannin is a compound that\nemerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more\ncomplex molecules such as polyacetylenes are found in younger groups of plants\nsuch as the Asterales. Many of the plant defense compounds arose to defend\nagainst consumption by insects, although when livestock or humans consume such\nplants, they may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild\ndiscomfort to death.\n\nMany of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal\nbenefits. Lewis, W.H. and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis. 1977. Medical Botany. Plants\nAffecting Man's Health. Wiley, New Yok. 515 p. p. 123-124. There are so\nmany kinds of plant defenses that there are many unanswered questions about\nthem. Questions include (1) which plants have which type of defenses, (2) which\nherbivores are the plants defended against, (3) what are the chemical structures\nof the compounds that provide defense, (4) and what are the potential medical\nuses of these compounds? This is still an active area of research with important\nimplications for understanding plant evolution, and for medical research.\n\nBelow is an extensive, if incomplete, list of plants containing poisonous parts\nthat pose a serious risk of illness, injury, or death to humans or animals.\nHuman fatalities caused by poisonous plants â especially resulting from\naccidental ingestion â are rare in the USA.
