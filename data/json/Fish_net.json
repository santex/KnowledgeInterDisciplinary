Fishing nets are usually meshes\nformed by knotting a relatively thin thread. Early nets were woven from grasses,\nflaxes and other fibrous plant material. Later cotton was used. Modern nets are\nusually made of artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of organic\npolyamides such as wool or silk thread were common until recently and are still\nused. __TOC__\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fish_net","recorded":1372152437,"links":[],"instances":["physics","material","material","archaeological_site","device"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fishing nets|!"],"headings":["History","Types","Fishing lines","Floats","Weights and anchors","Environmental impact","Miscellany","Gallery","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["net","device"],["net","device"],["león_viejo","archaeological_site"],["tension","physics"],["cork","material"],["fishnet","material"]],"members":["tension","fishnet","cork","león_viejo","net"],"related":["Net_(device)","Fishing","Net_(device)","Mesh","Knot","Polyamide","Nylon","Wool","Silk","Secutor","Net_of_Antrea","Karelia","Antrea","Willow","University_of_Helsinki","Mesolithic","Rock_carvings_at_Alta","Columbia_River","Seine_net","Māori_people","Ovid","Ancient_Rome","Mosaic","Gladiator","Retiarius","Trident","Net_casting","Secutor","Murmillo","Oppian","Norse_mythology","Rán","New_Testament","Gospel_according_to_Luke","Gospel_according_to_John","Miraculous_catch_of_fish","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Settler","Midwestern_United_States","Rope","León_Viejo_(archaeological_site)","Fishing_line","Fossil","Lascaux","Before_Christ","Date_palm","Flax","Grass","Papyrus","Leather","Hemp","Net_of_Antrea","Tacuinum_sanitatis","Albrecht_Dürer","Bottom_trawling","Demersal_fish","Groundfish","Cod","Squid","Halibut","Sebastidae","Commercial_trawler","UN_Millennium_Project","Kofi_Annan","Trawling","Cast_net","Schooling","Coracle","Coracle","Seine_net","Drift_net","Drift_net","Shoaling_and_schooling","Forage_fish","Caesionidae","Trawl","Gillnet","Sardine","Salmon","Cod","Ghost_net","Hand_net","Muskellunge","Northern_pike","Fisherman","England","Eel","River_Parrett","River_Severn","Lave_net","River_Severn","Sturgeon","Midwater_trawling","Pelagic_fish","Anchovies","Shrimp","Tuna","Mackerel","Pair_trawling","Research_vessel","Purse_seine","Schooling_fish","Shoaling_and_schooling","Seine_net","Seine_fishing","Purse_seine","Pelagic","Kochi,_India","Chinese_fishing_nets","Surrounding_net","Tangle_net","Rope","Fibre","Braid","Tension_(physics)","Twine","Braided_fishing_line","Multifilament_fishing_line","Monofilament_fishing_line","Fishing_line","Manila_rope","Abacá","Fishing_float","Cork_(material)","Birch","Finland","Russia","Pneumatophores","Southeast_Asia","Subsistence_fishermen","Native_Hawaiians","Wiliwili","Glass_float","Dropline","Longline_fishing","Flag","Longline_fishing","Dropline","Pentagram","Hvide_Sande","Dog_conch","Cucuteni-Trypillian_culture","Laevistrombus_canarium","Fisheries","Bycatch","Longline_fishing","Trawling","Gillnet","Ghost_net","Fish","Dolphin","Sea_turtle","Shark","Dugong","Crocodile","Seabird","Crab","Loggerhead_sea_turtle","Monofilament_fishing_line","Fishing_line","Scalpel","Zuiderzeemuseum","Trawl_net","Bangor,_County_Down","Ostend","Lyme_Regis","Bordeaux","Miraculous_catch_of_fish","Fishnet_(material)","FAO"]}
