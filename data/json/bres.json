His parents\nwere Prince Elatha of the Fomorians and Eri, daughter of Delbaith. He was an\nunpopular king, and favoured his Fomorian kin. He grew so quickly that by the\nage of seven he was the size of a 14-year-old.\n\nIn the First Battle of Magh Tuiredh, King Nuada of the Tuatha Dé Danann lost his\nhand; because he was imperfect, he could not be king. Hoping to reconcile\nrelations between the Fomorians and the Tuatha Dé Danann, Bres was named king\nand Brigid of the Tuatha de Danann married him, giving him a son, Ruadan, who\nwould later be killed trying to assassinate Goibniu.\n\nBres made the Tuatha Dé Danann pay tribute to the Fomorians and work as slaves:\nOgma was forced to carry firewood, and the Dagda had to dig trenches around\nforts. He neglected his duties of hospitality: the Tuatha Dé complained that\nafter visiting his house their knives were never greased and their breaths did\nnot smell of ale. Cairbre, poet of the Tuatha Dé, composed a scathing poem\nagainst him, which was the first satire in Ireland, and everything went wrong\nfor Bres after that.\n\nAfter Bres had ruled for seven years, Nuada had his hand, which had formerly\nbeen replaced with a silver one by Dian Cecht and Creidhne, replaced with one of\nflesh and blood by Dian Cecht's son Miach, with the help of his sister Airmed;\nfollowing the successful replacement, Nuada was restored to kingship and Bres\nwas exiled. He went to his father for help to recover his throne, but Elatha\nwould not help him gain by foul means what he had been unable to keep: \"You have\nno right to get it by injustice when you could not keep it by justice\".<ref\nname=\"Lady Gregory\"></ref> Bres was guided by his father to Balor, another\nleader of the Fomorians, for the help he sought.\n\nHe led the Fomorians in the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh but lost. He was\nfound unprotected on the battlefield by Lugh and pleaded for his life. Lugh\nspared him because he promised to teach the Tuatha Dé agriculture.\n\nIn the Lebor Gabála and Cath Maige Tuired, Bres is portrayed as beautiful to\nbehold, yet harsh and inhospitable. However, a poem of the [[dindsenchas]]\npraises Bres' \"kindly\" and \"noble\" character and calls him the \"flower\" of the\nTuatha Dé Danann. It also tells of his death at the hands of Lugh. Lugh made 300\nwooden cows, and filled them with a bitter, poisonous red liquid which was then\n\"milked\" into pails and offered to Bres to drink. Bres, who was under an\nobligation not to refuse hospitality, drank it down without flinching, and it\nkilled him.<ref>E. J.
