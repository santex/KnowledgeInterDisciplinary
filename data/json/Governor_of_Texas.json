The\ngovernor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Texas\nLegislature, and to convene the legislature. The governor may grant pardons in\ncases other than impeachment (but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons\nand Paroles) or in the case of treason, with permission by the legislature.\n\nCompared to the governors of other U.S. states, the governorship of Texas is a\nfairly weak office. The Lieutenant Governor of Texas, who presides over the\nstate Senate, is considered a more powerful political figure, being able to\nexercise greater personal prerogatives. Current Governor Rick Perry served as Lieutenant Governor from\n1999-2000, under George W. Bush.\n\nThe state's first constitution in 1845 established the office of governor, to\nserve for two years, but no more than four years out of every six (essentially a\nlimit of no more than two consecutive terms). 1845 Const. Art V sec 4\nThe 1861 secessionist constitution set the term start date at the first Monday\nin the November following the election. 1861 Const. art V sec 12 The\n1866 constitution, adopted just after the American Civil War, increased terms to\nfour years, but no more than eight years out of every twelve, and moved the\nstart date to the first Thursday after the organization of the legislature, or\n\"as soon thereafter as practicable.\" 1866 Const. art V sec 4 The\nReconstruction constitution of 1869 removed the limit on terms, 1869 Const.\nArt IV sec 4 and to this day, Texas is one of 14 states [http://www.nga.org/files/pdf/BOS4-\n9.pdf Executive Branch] retrieved 23-October-2008 with no gubernatorial\nterm limit. The present constitution of 1876 shortened terms back to two\nyears, TX Const. Art IV sec 4 but a 1972 amendment increased it again\nto four years. http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_3_1.html\n\nThe gubernatorial election is held every four years on the first Tuesday after\nthe first Monday in November and does not coincide with the presidential\nelections. The governor is sworn-in on the third Tuesday of January every four\nyears along with the lieutenant governor, so Perry and current Lieutenant\nGovernor David Dewhurst both began new terms on January 18, 2011, which end on\nJanuary 20, 2015.\n\n. It is not in common use]] Despite the lack of term limits, no Texas governor\n  in the 19th or 20th centuries ever served more than seven and a half\n  consecutive years in office (Allan Shivers) or eight years total service (Bill\n  Clements, in two non-consecutive four-year terms). Current Governor Rick\n  Perry, who took office in December 2000, has now surpassed both these records,\n  becoming the first Texas governor to serve three consecutive terms. When Perry\n  won the general election on November 2, 2010, he joined Shivers, Price Daniel,\n  and John Connally as the only Texas governors to be elected to three terms. In\n  case of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes\n  governor. TX Const. art IV sec 16 graf d This rule was added only in\n  a 1999 amendment, prior to which the lieutenant governor only acted as\n  governor, except during the time of the 1861 constitution, which said that the\n  lieutenant governor would be styled \"Governor of the State of Texas\" in case\n  of vacancy. 1861 Const art V sec 12\n","linknr":220,"url":"Governor_of_Texas","recorded":1372156217,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Governor_of_Texas&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Governor_of_Texas&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/File:Seal_of_the_Governor_of_Texas.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Seal_of_the_Governor_of_Texas.svg/150px-Seal_of_the_Governor_of_Texas.svg.png","/wiki/Seals_of_the_Governors_of_the_U.S._States","/wiki/File:Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg/165px-Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg","/wiki/Rick_Perry","/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)","/wiki/Official_residence","/wiki/Texas_Governors_Mansion","/wiki/Term_of_office","/wiki/James_Pinckney_Henderson","/wiki/Texas_Constitution","http://www.governor.state.tx.us/","/wiki/Executive_branch","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/Commander-in-chief","/wiki/U.S._state","/wiki/Texas_National_Guard","/wiki/Governor_(United_States)","/wiki/Veto","/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law)","/wiki/Texas_Legislature","/wiki/Pardon","/wiki/Impeachment","/wiki/Texas_Board_of_Pardons_and_Paroles","/wiki/Treason","/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Texas","#cite_note-slate-1","#cite_note-molly-2","/wiki/Rick_Perry","/wiki/George_W._Bush","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/American_Civil_War","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Term_limit","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Texas","/wiki/David_Dewhurst","/wiki/File:Standard_Of_Governor_Of_Texas.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Standard_Of_Governor_Of_Texas.svg/200px-Standard_Of_Governor_Of_Texas.svg.png","/wiki/File:Standard_Of_Governor_Of_Texas.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Flags_of_the_Governors_of_the_U.S._States","/wiki/Allan_Shivers","/wiki/Bill_Clements","/wiki/Rick_Perry","/wiki/Price_Daniel","/wiki/John_Connally","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Governor_of_Texas&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-slate_1-0","http://www.slate.com/id/1004307/","#cite_ref-molly_2-0","/wiki/Molly_Ivins","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-375-75714-7","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","http://www.nga.org/files/pdf/BOS4-9.pdf","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_3_1.html","#cite_ref-10","#cite_ref-11","/w/index.php?title=Governor_of_Texas&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Texas_flag_map.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Texas_flag_map.svg/29px-Texas_flag_map.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Texas","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Texas","/wiki/List_of_Texas_Governors_and_Presidents","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Republic_of_Texas","/wiki/List_of_Lieutenant_Governors_of_Texas","/wiki/Template:US_Chief_Executives","/wiki/Template_talk:US_Chief_Executives","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US_Chief_Executives&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Governor_(United_States)","/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_governors","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Alabama","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Alaska","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Arizona","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Arkansas","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_California","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Colorado","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Connecticut","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Delaware","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Florida","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Georgia","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Hawaii","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Idaho","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Illinois","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Indiana","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Iowa","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kansas","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Kentucky","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Louisiana","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Maine","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Maryland","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Massachusetts","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Michigan","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Minnesota","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Mississippi","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Missouri","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Montana","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Nebraska","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Nevada","
