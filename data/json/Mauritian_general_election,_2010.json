{"cursor":"10970","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'general election' was held in Mauritius on 5 May 2010. The\ncoalition composed of the Mauritius Labour Party under Navin Ramgoolam, the\nMilitant Socialist Movement under Pravind Jugnauth and the Mauritian Social\nDemocrat Party under Xavier Duval, won a majority with 41 seats in the\nparliament. The Mauritian Militant Movement-led coalition\nunder Paul Berenger finished second with 18 seats. The\nMauritian Solidarity Front won one seat and the Rodrigues Movement won the two\nremaining seats. The elections were the ninth to be held\nsince independence from the United Kingdom in 1968.\n\nThe Mauritius Labour Party, the Mauritian Social Democrat Party (PMSD) and the\nMilitant Socialist Movement (MSM) joined together into an alliance called\nAlliance de L'avenir () for this election. Ramgoolam, the alliance\nleader, alloted 35 seats to his own party to compete for the 60 seats on the\nisland, whereas the MSM was given 18 and the PMSD 7.\nBefore the election, it appeared that Berenger might gain back the PM's post\nthat he held from 2003 to 2005; he was the first prime minister since\nindependence that was not of South Asian origin. Berenger led his own\nalliance of parties, known as the Alliance du Coeur (),\na reference to the official logo of the Mauritian Militant Movement, by far the\nbiggest party in that alliance. Parties based in Rodrigues compete for the 2\nother seats, with the Rodrigues People's Organisation and the Rodrigues Movement\nbeing the main parties there.\n\nDuring the election, 62 seats in the National Assembly of Mauritius were\ncontested with a further 8 seats to be designated by the electoral commission\nunder a complex formula designed to keep a balance of ethnic groups in the\nparliament. The candidates must declare which ethnic group\n(Hindu, Muslim, Chinese or \"general population\") they belong to in order to run\nfor a seat. In 2010, 104 of the candidates refused\nto do so, resulting in them being disqualified, leaving 529 candidates for the\nseats. Around 130 foreign observers, including some from\nthe African Union and the Southern African Development Community, were present\nto monitor the voting process.\n\nAround 900,000 people were eligible to vote in the election.\nThe counting of votes began on 6 May with results expected by that\nafternoon. With 30% of votes counted the Alliance de l'Avenir\nwas ahead in 40 of the seats and the Alliance du Coeur in 19. Turnout was\nestimated at 78%, down from 81.5% in 2005's election and the lowest turnout\nsince 1976. The electoral commission said that the voting\nprocess went well and there were no formal complaints.\n\nThis election was marked by an accusation from Paul Berenger of abuse of the state-\nowned television station, the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation, by the\nincumbent government to influence voters.  He also\naccused his political opponents of using communalism to swing votes, given that\nhe forms part of the Franco-Mauritian minority. The\nmain issues debated were economic and constitutional reform, fraud, corruption,\ndrug trafficking and ethnicity.\n\nThe Alliance de l'Avenir obtained 49.31% of the total votes with 41 seats\nwhereas the Alliance du Coeur seized 42.36% of votes with 18 seats. The\nremaining parties and independent candidates obtained 8.14% of the votes. Out of the 62 seats, only ten women were elected.\n\nAfter the Alliance de L'Avenir was declared winner of the poll, its leader,\nNavin Ramgoolam, mentioned that he would govern in the interest of every\nMauritian so as no one is left behind. He added that\nthe priorities of his government are to be the improvement of road\ninfrastructures, the security of the people, education, health and youth\ndevelopment. Paul Berenger, who conceded defeat after the\nelection, said that members of his party will continue their fight for a better\nMauritius. He claimed that this election was not free\nand fair, attributing the defeat of his alliance to numerous factors including\nbias coverage of the election by the state-owned television station, more\nfinancial resources by his political opponents, communalism and the electoral\nsystem. However, he is prepared to work with the\ngovernment for an electoral reform, especially because his alliance had obtained\nonly 18 of the 62 seats despite seizing 43% of popular votes.\n\nOn May 7, 2010, the Electoral Supervisory Commission made their decision on the\nnon-elected candidates to occupy the 8 additional seats in the National Assembly\nbased on the religious and ethnic declarations of the candidates not elected, a\nsystem referred to as the 'Best Loser system'. Exceptionally, instead of 8, only\n7 candidates were designated. Per the normal\nprocedure, 4 best loser seats are alloted to candidates not elected but having\nobtained the highest percentage of votes as a member of a political party.\nHowever, they had to be of an appropriate religion or ethnic to maintain a\nbalance in the parliament. 4 other seats are to be alloted so as not to change\nthe result of the election. The Alliance de L'Avenir was alloted 4 additional\nseats whereas the Alliance du Coeur obtained 2 additional seats. Whereas the Electoral Supervisory Commission had no problem\nin attributing one seat to one candidate of the Rodrigues People's Organisation,\nthey had difficulty in choosing a candidate for the 8th seat, which normally has\nto be a Sino-Mauritian of one of the two other successful parties in this\nelection. But given neither the Mauritian Solidarity Front nor the Rodrigues\nMovement had candidates of this community during this election, no candidate was\nnamed for the 8th additional seat.\n\nObservers from the African Union for this election declared that the Best Loser\nsystem is problematic for the national unity of the country though it can\nreinforce social cohesion. They also considered the\n2010 Mauritian general elections to have been 'free and transparent'.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Mauritian_general_election,_2010","recorded":1375082596,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mauritian_general_election,_2010&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mauritian_general_election,_2010&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Mauritius","/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Mauritius.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Coat_of_arms_of_Mauritius.svg/150px-Coat_of_arms_of_Mauritius.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_Mauritius","/wiki/President_of_Mauritius","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Kailash_Purryag","/wiki/Vice_President_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Monique_Ohsan_Bellepeau","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Mauritius","/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Navin_Ramgoolam","/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Mauritius","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Ganoo&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Elections_in_Mauritius","/wiki/Constituencies_of_Mauritius","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Mauritius","/wiki/Outer_islands_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Agal%C3%A9ga","/wiki/Rodrigues","/wiki/Cargados_Carajos","/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Mauritius","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/16px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_Mauritius","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Mauritius&action=edit","/wiki/Mauritius","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Mauritius_Labour_Party","/wiki/Navin_Ramgoolam","/wiki/Militant_Socialist_Movement","/wiki/Pravind_Jugnauth","/wiki/Mauritian_Social_Democrat_Party","/w/index.php?title=Xavier_Duval&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-defi-2","/wiki/Mauritian_Militant_Movement","/wiki/Paul_Berenger","#cite_note-defi-2","/wiki/Mauritian_Solidarity_Front","/wiki/Rodrigues_Movement","#cite_note-defi-2","#cite_note-timeslive-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-defi2-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-bloom-7","/wiki/Rodrigues","/wiki/Rodrigues_People%27s_Organisation","/wiki/Rodrigues_Movement","/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Mauritius","#cite_note-AFP-8","#cite_note-timeslive-3","#cite_note-timeslive-3","/wiki/African_Union","/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community","#cite_note-timeslive-3","#cite_note-AFP-8","#cite_note-AFP-8","#cite_note-bloom-7","#cite_note-bloom-7","/wiki/Mauritius_Broadcasting_Corporation","#cite_note-lexpress-9","/wiki/Communalism","/wiki/Franco-Mauritian","#cite_note-matinal-10","#cite_note-bbc-11","#cite_note-defi-2","#cite_note-defi-2","#cite_note-matinal2-12","#cite_note-matinal2-12","#cite_note-defi3-13","#cite_note-lexpress4-14","#cite_note-lexpress4-14","#cite_note-lexpress3-15","#cite_note-lexpress3-15","/wiki/Sino-Mauritian","#cite_note-lexpress3-15","#cite_note-lexpress2-16","#cite_note-lexpress2-16","/w/index.php?title=Mauritian_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mauritian_general_election,_2010&action=edit","/wiki/Template_talk:Mauritian_general_election,_2010","/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Mauritius","/wiki/Alliance_de_L%27Avenir","/wiki/Labour_Party_(Mauritius)","/wiki/Parti_Mauricien_Social_D%C3%A9mocrate","/wiki/Mouvement_Socialiste_Militant","/w/index.php?title=Alliance_du_Coeur&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mouvement_Militant_Mauricien","/w/index.php?title=Union_Nationale_(Mauritius)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Mouvement_Mauricien_Socialiste_D%C3%A9mocrate&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Front_Solidarit%C3%A9_Mauricien","/wiki/Mouvement_Rodriguais","/wiki/Organisation_du_Peuple_Rodriguais","http://electoral.gov.mu/English/electionresult/nasselec/Documents/all/resultsNAE2010.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Mauritian_general_election,_2010&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/6937503.html","#cite_ref-defi_2-0","#cite_ref-defi_2-1","#cite_ref-defi_2-2","#cite_ref-defi_2-3","#cite_ref-defi_2-4","http://www.defimedia.info/articles/8239/1/Navin-Ramgoolam-remporte-les-elections-generales-/Page
