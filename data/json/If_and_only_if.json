{"cursor":"12768","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n â â â¡\nLogical symbols representing iff\n\nIn logic and related fields such as mathematics and philosophy, 'if and only if'\n(shortened 'iff') is a biconditional logical connective between statements.\n\nIn that it is biconditional, the connective can be likened to the standard\nmaterial conditional (\"only if\", equal to \"if ... then\") combined with its\nreverse (\"if\"); hence the name. The result is that the truth of either one of\nthe connected statements requires the truth of the other, i.e., either both\nstatements are true, or both are false. It is controversial whether the\nconnective thus defined is properly rendered by the English \"if and only if\",\nwith its pre-existing meaning. Of course, there is nothing to stop us\nstipulating that we may read this connective as \"only if and if\", although this\nmay lead to confusion.\n\nIn writing, phrases commonly used, with debatable propriety, as alternatives to\nP \"if and only if\" Q include Q is [[Necessary and sufficient\nconditions|necessary and sufficient]] for P, P is equivalent (or materially\nequivalent) to Q (compare material implication), P precisely if Q, P precisely\n(or exactly) when Q, P exactly in case Q, and P just in case Q. Many authors\nregard \"iff\" as unsuitable in formal writing; others use it freely.\n\nIn [[formula (mathematical logic)|logic formulae]], logical symbols are used\ninstead of these phrases; see the discussion of notation.\n","linknr":203,"url":"If_and_only_if","recorded":1362554646,"links":43,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Logical connectives","Mathematical terminology","Necessity and sufficiency"],"headings":["Definition","Usage","Distinction from \"if\" and \"only if\"","Advanced considerations","More general usage","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png/32px-Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","mathematics"]],"members":["group"],"related":["Logic","Mathematics","Philosophy","Biconditional","Logical_connective","Biconditional","Material_conditional","Material_conditional","Truth_table","Wolfram_Alpha","XNOR_gate","XOR_gate","Mathematical_logic","First-order_logic","Propositional_logic","Metalogic","Jan_Łukasiewicz","Logical_connective","Exclusive_nor","Logical_system","Proof_theory","Disjunction","Truth-function","John_L._Kelley","Paul_Halmos","Logical_equivalence","Use–mention_distinction","W._V._Quine","Definition","Universal_quantification","Group_(mathematics)","Logical_and","Subset","Vector_space","Linear_independence","Linear_span","Triangular_number","Perfect_number","Mersenne_prime","Prime_number","Exclusive_disjunction","Mathematics","Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions","Mathematical_jargon","Domain_of_discourse","Covariance","Logical_biconditional","Logical_equality","Necessary_and_sufficient_condition","Polysyllogism"]}
