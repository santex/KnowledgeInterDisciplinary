It was developed by the British during World War\nII for military use and saw extensive use by both British and the American\nmilitary engineering units.\n\nA Bailey bridge had the advantages of requiring no special tools or heavy\nequipment to construct. The wood and steel bridge elements were small and light\nenough to be carried in trucks and lifted into place by hand, without requiring\nthe use of a crane. The bridges were strong enough to carry tanks. Bailey\nbridges continue to be extensively used in civil engineering construction\nprojects and to provide temporary crossings for foot and vehicle traffic.\n",
