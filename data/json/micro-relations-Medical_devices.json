Summarised from the\nFDA's definition as per http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandgu-\nidance/overview/classifyyourdevice/ucm051512.htm Whereas medicinal\nproducts (also called pharmaceuticals) achieve their principal action by\npharmacological, metabolic or immunological means, medical devices act by other\nmeans like physical, mechanical, or thermal means. Medical devices vary greatly\nin complexity and application. Examples range from simple devices such as tongue\ndepressors, medical thermometers, and disposable gloves to advanced devices such\nas medical robots, cardiac pacemakers, and neuroprosthetics.\n\nThe global medical device market reached roughly 209 billion US Dollar in\n2006.\n","linknr":400,"url":"Medical_devices","recorded":1362505304,"links":26,"instances":["medicine","united_states"],"pdf":["http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/medical-devices/files/list-of-contact-points-within-the-national_en.pdf","http://www.emergogroup.com/files/Canada-Medical-Devices-Regulations-v2.pdf","http://www.tga.gov.au/pdf/devices-argmd.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequirements/QualitySystemsRegulations/UCM134625.pdf"],"categories":["Medical equipment","Medical technology","Regulation of medical devices"],"headings":["Definitions","Classification","Medical devices and technological security issues","Standardization and regulatory concerns","Academic resources","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant","food_and_drug_administration"],"related":["Drug","Tongue_depressors","Medical_thermometer","Medical_gloves","Medical_robots","Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker","Neuroprosthetics","Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency","Medicinal_product","CE_mark","National_Formulary","United_States_Pharmacopoeia","Food_and_Drugs_Act","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Postmarketing_surveillance","Premarket_approval","Certificate_of_Conformity","Notified_Body","CE_mark","List_of_EN_standards","Therapeutic_Goods_Administration","Pacemakers","Operating_room","Defibrillators","Surgical_instruments","Health_information","Medical_professionals","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Organization_for_Standardization","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Risk_management","ISO_13485","ISO_14971","Regulatory_compliance","IEC_60601-1","IEC_62304","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","21_CFR_820","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Therac-25","Diana_Zuckerman","National_Research_Center_for_Women_and_Families","Cleveland_Clinic","Packaging","Package_testing","Lippincott_Williams_&_Wilkins","University_of_Minnesota","University_of_Strathclyde","Flinders_University","Biomedical_engineering","Biomedical_equipment_technician","Clinical_engineering","Design_history_file","Durable_medical_equipment","Electronic_medical_record","In_vitro_diagnostics","GHTF","HL7","Home_medical_equipment","Implant_(medicine)","ISO_13485","Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act","Federal_Institute_for_Drugs_and_Medical_Devices","Medical_Devices_Directive","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Medical_equipment","Medical_logistics","Which_Medical_Device","Medical_software","Pharmacovigilance","Telemedicine","Safety_engineering"]}
