Artisans practice\na craft and may through experience and aptitude reach the expressive levels of\nan artist.\n\nThe adjective \"artisanal\" is sometimes used in describing hand-processing in\nwhat is usually viewed as an industrial process, such as in the phrase\n[[artisanal mining]]. Thus, \"artisanal\" is sometimes used in marketing and\nadvertising as a buzz word to describe or imply some relation with the crafting\nof handmade food products, such as bread, beverages or cheese. Many of these\nhave traditionally been handmade, rural or pastoral goods but are also now\ncommonly made on a larger scale with automated mechanization in factories and\nother industrial areas.\n",
