{"cursor":"11903","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Search neutrality' is a principle that search engines should have no editorial\npolicies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based\nsolely on relevance. This means that when a user\nqueries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results\nfound in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of),\nwithout manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by\nrelevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a\ncertain bias.\n\nSearch neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to\nkeep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services\non the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results\n(results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to\nresults sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any\nmanipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and\ngovern access to the internet from limiting the availability of resources to\naccess any given content.\n","linknr":207,"url":"Search_neutrality","recorded":1362543074,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer law","Net neutrality","Principles","Search engine optimization"],"headings":["\"Vertical search\" spam penalties","Arguments","Related issues","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Principle","Bias","Network_neutrality","Organic_search","Search_engines","Vertical_search","Initiative_for_a_Competitive_Online_Marketplace","Google","Antitrust_laws","Search_engine_results_page","Intellectual_property","Black_hat_hacking","Google","Google_Search","MapQuest"]}
