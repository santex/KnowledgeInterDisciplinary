Cryo-EM is developing\n popularity in structural biology.\n\nThe popularity of cryoelectron microscopy stems from the fact that it allows the\nobservation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, showing\nthem in their native environment, in contrast to X-ray crystallography, which\ngenerally requires placing the samples in non-physiological environments, which\ncan occasionally lead to functionally irrelevant conformational changes. In\npractice, the resolution of cryo-electron microscopy maps is not high enough to\nallow for unambiguous model construction on the basis of EM maps only, and\nmodels obtained by protein crystallography are used to interpret the cryo-EM\nmaps. However, the resolution of cryo-EM maps is improving steadily, and some\nvirus structures obtained by cryo-EM are already at a resolution that can be\ninterpreted in terms of an atomic model.\n\nA version of electron cryomicroscopy is cryo-electron tomography (CET) where a\n3D reconstruction of a sample is created from tilted 2D images.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Cryoelectron_microscopy","recorded":1362371351,"links":14,"instances":["electron_density"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microscopes","Cell biology","Protein structure","Electron microscopy"],"headings":["Development","Biological specimens","Techniques in cryoelectron microscopy","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Cryoem_groel.jpg/220px-Cryoem_groel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resolution","electron_density"]],"members":["resolution"],"related":["Vitreous_ice","Electron_microscopy","Cryogenic","Liquid_nitrogen","Structural_biology","X-ray_crystallography","Cryo-electron_tomography","Radiation_damage","Electron_microscope","Thermonuclear_device","High_vacuum","Negative_stain","Uranyl_acetate","Dehydration","Vitreous_ice","European_Molecular_Biology_Laboratory","Adenovirus","Amorphous_ice","Ethane","Liquid_nitrogen","Vacuum","Electron_microscope","Radiation","Radiation","Signal_noise","Single_particle_analysis","Ribosome","Virus","Crystals","Transmembrane_proteins","Helical","Electron_crystallography","Cryofixation","High_pressure_freezing","Ultramicrotome","Single_particle_analysis","Electron_tomography","Single_particle_analysis","Resolution_(electron_density)","EM_Data_Bank","Oxford_University_Press"]}
