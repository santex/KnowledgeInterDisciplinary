Revonsuo reviewed a spectrum of meanings and identified two common\nversions, Revonsuo, A. (1999) Binding and the Phenomenal Unity of\nConsciousness. Consciousness and Cognition 8, 173-185.  corresponding\nbroadly to what Smythies called BP1 and BP2 Smythies, J.R. (1994) The walls\nof Platoâs cave. Aldershot, Avebury. Smythies, J.R. (1994) Requiem for\nthe identity theory. Inquiry, 37, 311-329. . Although there may be an\nargument for separating these formally, there are reasons for thinking that they\nare inter-related, even if in ways we do not understand. Moreover, the\nhistorical literature is often ambiguous as to whether it is addressing BP1, BP2\nor both [1,2,3].\n\nFirstly, there is the practical computational problem of how brains segregate\nelements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to\ndiscrete 'objects'. In other words, when we see a blue square and a yellow\ncircle, what neural mechanisms ensure that the sensing of blue is handled with\nsquare and yellow is handled with circle (and not vice versa)?\n\nSecondly, there is the problem of how objects, background and abstract or\nemotional features are combined in phenomenal experience: \"how the unity of\nconscious perception is brought about by the distributed activities of the\ncentral nervous system.\" Revonsuo, A. and Newman, J. (1999). Binding and\nConsciousness. Consciousness and Cognition 8, 123-127.\n\nThe first question is a conventional one about the physical basis of computation\nthat could equally be applied to a mechanical computer. The second specifically\ninvokes a concept of subjective experience or phenomenality. As such it is\narguably outside the current scope of physical science in that although the\n'unity' in 'unity of consciousness' is an intuitive feature of experience it is\nunclear what it might mean in terms of physics. Perhaps the clearest exposition\nof BP2 is in William James's Principles of Psychology James, W. Principles\nof Psychology (1890) Chapter 6, free access online at\nhttp://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/index.htm where he refers\nto it as the combination problem.\n","linknr":232,"url":"Binding_problem","recorded":1362371624,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf","http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf"],"categories":["Attention","Cognition","Cognitive science","Memory","Perception","Unsolved problems in neuroscience"],"headings":["BP1: The segregation problem","BP2: The combination problem","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neuroscience","Cognitive_science","Philosophy_of_mind","William_James","Visual_cortex","Color_vision","Motion_perception","Shape","Ambiguity","Neural_oscillation","Feature_integration_theory","Descartes","Leibniz","Attention","Consciousness","Feature_integration_theory","Frame_problem","Hard_problem_of_consciousness","Perception","Philosophy_of_perception","Symbol_grounding"]}
