Appetite exists in all\nhigher life-forms, and serves to regulate adequate energy intake to maintain\nmetabolic needs. It is regulated by a close interplay between the digestive\ntract, adipose tissue and the brain. Appetite has a relationship with every\nindividual's behavior. Appetitive and consummatory behaviours are the only\nprocesses that involve energy intake, whereas all other behaviours affect the\nrelease of energy Stephanie Fulton, [http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.m-\nyaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/13321537370405640412.pdf], \"Frontiers in\nNeuroendocrinology\", 2010 When stressed, appetite levels may increase and\nresult in an increase of food intake. Decreased desire to eat is termed\nanorexia, while polyphagia (or \"hyperphagia\") is increased eating. Dysregulation\nof appetite contributes to anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, cachexia,\novereating, and binge eating disorder.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Appetite","recorded":1362503082,"links":43,"instances":["medicine","motivational_state","symptom"],"pdf":["http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/13321537370405640412.pdf"],"categories":["Endocrinology","Food and drink"],"headings":["Physiological factors","Regulation","Role in disease","Pharmacology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hunger","motivational_state"],["anorexia","symptom"],["stress","medicine"],["anorexia","symptom"]],"members":["stress","hunger","anorexia"],"related":["Eating","Food","Hunger_(motivational_state)","Metabolism","Digestive_tract","Adipose_tissue","Brain","Anorexia_(symptom)","Polyphagia","Anorexia_nervosa","Bulimia_nervosa","Cachexia","Overeating","Binge_eating_disorder","Leptin","Adipose_tissue","Gastrointestinal_tract","Hormone","Central_nervous_system","Autonomic_nervous_system","Hypothalamus","Neuron","Serotonin","Neuropeptide_Y","Agouti-related_peptide","Vagus_nerve","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Autonomic_nervous_system","Thyroid","Thyroxine","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis","Opioid_receptor","Nucleus_accumbens","Pallidum","Palatability","Leptin","Ghrelin","PYY_3-36","Orexin","Cholecystokinin","Adipose_tissue","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Interleukin","Corticotropin-releasing_hormone","Circadian_cycle","Limbic_system","Cerebral_cortex","Clinical_depression","Stress_(medicine)","Malnutrition","Obesity","Anorexia_(symptom)","Hyperphagia","Clinical_depression","Dyspepsia","Anorexia_nervosa","Bulimia_nervosa","Binge_eating_disorder","Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Prader-Willi_syndrome","Satiety","Obesity","Anorectic","Fenfluramine","Phentermine","Sibutramine","Serotonin","Noradrenaline","Central_nervous_system","Rimonabant","Recombinant_DNA","PYY_3-36","Weight_loss","Obesity","Specific_appetite","Orexigenic"]}
