{"cursor":"41193","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}}\n\n\nThe term 'business cycle' (or 'economic cycle') refers to economy-wide\nfluctuations in production, trade and economic activity in general over several\nmonths or years in an economy organized on free-enterprise principles. A. F.\nBurns and W. C. Mitchell, Measuring business cycles, New York, National Bureau\nof Economic Research, 1946. These fluctuations occur around a long-term\ngrowth trend, and typically involve shifts over time between periods of\nrelatively rapid economic growth (an expansion or boom), and periods of relative\nstagnation or decline (a contraction or recession).\n\nBusiness cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of real\ngross domestic product. Despite being termed , these fluctuations in economic\nactivity do not follow a mechanical or predictable periodic pattern.\n","linknr":652,"url":"Business_cycle","recorded":1362477304,"links":60,"instances":["economics","economic","marxian","economics","economics","historical"],"pdf":["http://www.albany.edu/~bd445/Eco_301/Slides/Business_Cycle_Notes_(Print).pdf","http://mises.org/books/historyofmoney.pdf","http://mises.org/books/historyofmoney.pdf","http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR1043.pdf","http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR1043.pdf"],"categories":["Business
