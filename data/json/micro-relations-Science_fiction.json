{"cursor":"103663","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":1502,"url":"Science_fiction","article":"\n\n\n'Science fiction' is a genre of fiction with imaginative but more or less\nplausible content such as settings in the future, futuristic science and\ntechnology, space travel, parallel universes, aliens, and paranormal abilities.\nExploring the consequences of scientific innovations is one purpose of science\nfiction, making it a \"literature of ideas\". Science fiction has been used by authors as a device to\ndiscuss philosophical ideas such as identity, desire, morality and social\nstructure.\n\nScience fiction is largely based on writing rationally about alternative\npossible worlds or futures.\nIt is similar to, but differs from fantasy in that, within the context of the\nstory, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically\nestablished or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in\na story might still be pure imaginative speculation).\n\nThe settings for science fiction are often contrary to consensus reality, but\nmost science fiction relies on a considerable degree of suspension of disbelief,\nwhich is facilitated in the reader's mind by potential scientific explanations\nor solutions to various fictional elements. Science fiction elements include:\n* A time setting in the future, in alternative timelines, or in a historical\n  past that contradicts known facts of history or the archaeological record.\n* A spatial setting or scenes in outer space (e.g. spaceflight), on other\n  worlds, or on subterranean earth.\n* Characters that include aliens, mutants, androids, or humanoid robots.\n* Futuristic technology such as ray guns, teleportation machines, and humanoid\n  computers.\n* Scientific principles that are new or that contradict accepted laws of nature,\n  for example time travel, wormholes, or faster-than-light travel.\n* New and different political or social systems, e.g. dystopian, post-scarcity,\n  or post-apocalyptic.\n* Paranormal abilities such as mind control, telepathy, telekinesis, and\n  teleportation.\n* Other universes or dimensions and travel between them.\n","recorded":1362124376,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1503","instances":["literature","novel","science_fiction","narrative","comics","film_series","fantasy","1989_film","writer","literature","literature","arts","literature","narrative","kepler","subgenre","physics","journal","novel","film","novel","author","fantasy","novel","genre","westerfeld_novel","fanzines","2004_film","science_fiction","novel","fiction","film","novel","science_fiction","novel","narrative","narrative","author","science_fiction","robot","1990_film","film","disambiguation","film","science_fiction","novel","arts","fiction","fiction","fictional","soil_study","magazine","comics","1928_film","person","1979_film","genre","series","narrative_mode","1934_film","narrative","geography","1934_film","author","theatre","novel","literary_technique","novel","magazine","tv_series","film","novel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Literary
