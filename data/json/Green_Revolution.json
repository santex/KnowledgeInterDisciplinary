{"cursor":"49861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Green Revolution' refers to a series of research, development, and technology\ntransfer initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s, that\nincreased agriculture production around the world, beginning most markedly in\nthe late 1960s. It forms a part of the 'neo-colonial' system of agriculture\nwherein agriculture was viewed as more of a commercial sector than a subsistence\none.\n\nThe initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug, the \"Father of the Green Revolution\"\ncredited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the\ndevelopment of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation\ninfrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of\nhybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.\n\nThe term \"Green Revolution\" was first used in 1968 by former United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID) director William Gaud, who noted\nthe spread of the new technologies: \"These and other developments in\nthe field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a\nviolent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution\nlike that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution.\"\n","linknr":868,"url":"Green_Revolution","recorded":1362504040,"links":70,"instances":["organism","india","legume","rice"],"pdf":["http://www.irri.org/publications/chandler/pdfs/chap4a.pdf","http://www.nso.malawi.net/data_on_line/economics/Trade%20on%20NSO%20website/Malawi%202005%20Trade%20Statistics%20Brief_Release.pdf","http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf","http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/stateplan/sdr_pdf/shdr_pun04.pdf"],"categories":["Industrial
