Symptoms began with\nsevere abdominal pains and the condition was occasionally fatal. Cider is the\ntraditional drink of Devonians, and the connection between the colic and cider\ndrinking had been observed for many years. This was commonly attributed to the\nacidity of the beverage.\n\nWilliam Musgrave's publication De arthritide symptomatica (2nd edn, 1715)\nincluded the first scientific description of \"Devonshire colic\" â it was later\nreferred to by John Huxham and Sir George Baker. Alick Cameron,\nâMusgrave, William (1655â1721)â, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford\nUniversity Press, Sept 2004\n\nHowever, the precise cause was not discovered until the 1760s when Dr George\nBaker put forwards the hypothesis that poisoning from lead in cider was to\nblame. He observed that the symptoms of the colic were similar to those of lead\npoisoning. He pointed out that lead was used in the cider making process both as\na component of the cider presses and in the form of lead shot which was used to\nclean them. He also conducted chemical tests to demonstrate the presence of lead\nin Devon apple juice.\n\nThe publication of his results met with some hostile reaction from cider\nmanufacturers, keen to defend their product.\n\nOnce Baker's conclusions became accepted and the elimination of lead from the\ncider presses was undertaken, the colic declined. By 1818, Baker's son reported\nthat it was \"hardly known to exist\" in Devon.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Devon_colic","recorded":1364125351,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Colic","/wiki/File:Cyder-rebuttal.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Cyder-rebuttal.jpg/220px-Cyder-rebuttal.jpg","/wiki/File:Cyder-rebuttal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Lead_poisoning","/wiki/Devon","/wiki/Abdominal_pain","/wiki/Cider","/wiki/William_Musgrave","/wiki/John_Huxham","/wiki/George_Baker,_1st_Baronet","#cite_note-ODNB-1","/wiki/Lead","/wiki/Lead_shot","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-ODNB_1-0","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=edit&section=2","http://www.devon.gov.uk/etched?_IXP_=1&_IXR=100676","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&oldid=543993486","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:History_of_Devon","/wiki/Category:Lead_poisoning","/wiki/Category:17th-century_health_disasters","/wiki/Category:18th-century_health_disasters","/wiki/Category:17th_century_in_England","/wiki/Category:18th_century_in_England","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_dead_external_links_from_January_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Devon+colic&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Devon+colic","/wiki/Devon_colic","/wiki/Talk:Devon_colic","#","/wiki/Devon_colic","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Devon_colic","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Devon_colic","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&oldid=543993486","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Devon_colic&id=543993486","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Devon+colic","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Devon+colic&oldid=543993486&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Devon_colic&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colique_du_Devonshire","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Devon
