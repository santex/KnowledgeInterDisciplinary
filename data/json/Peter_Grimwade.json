He would occupy this position on a further five serials. In 1977 he got\nhis first chance to direct, being asked to film some model shots for the serial\n[[The Robots of Death]] while the serial's actual director, Michael E. Briant,\ndirected the rest of the serial in the studio. Tom Baker, meanwhile, used\nGrimwade's name to replace the scripted \"Grimwold's Syndrome\" illness mentioned\nin the script. Richards, J and Martin, A: Doctor Who - the Book of Lists BBC\nBooks 1997 The serial's Production Unit Manager, George Gallaccio, would\nlater allow him to make his full directorial debut on the episode \"Out of Body,\nOut of Mind\" in the series [[The Omega Factor]] (1979). Grimwade was also at\nthis time Production Assistant on the BBC's serialised dramatisation of John le\nCarrÃ©'s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1979).\n\nGrimwade next directed some episodes of the drama series [[All Creatures Great\nand Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]] (1978) (which\ncoincidentally featured Peter Davison, who Grimwade would direct twice and write\nfor three times on Doctor Who) before returning to Doctor Who as a director.\nAfter directing the serial [[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]] (1980)\nGrimwade was given the task of directing Tom Baker's final serial,\n[[Logopolis]]. When Peter Davison became the Doctor, Grimwade first directed him\nin the serial [[Kinda (Doctor Who)|Kinda]] (1982) and then directed\n[[Earthshock]], featuring the return of the Cybermen to the show after eight\nyears and the death of the character Adric.\n\nEarthshock would prove to be the last time he was a director on the series. A\nyear later, Grimwade was scheduled to direct the serial The Return (which would\nultimately become [[Resurrection of the Daleks]]). Industrial action initially\nprevented the serial from being filmed. When the story was postponed, Grimwade\ntook the cast and crew out to dinner, but did not invite John Nathan-Turner,\nbecause he had intended to take Nathan-Turner out separately. But Nathan-Turner\nfelt slighted by the omission and refused to allow Grimwade to direct the story\nwhen it was re-scheduled for Season 21. Prior to this, Grimwade had written two\nserials - [[Time-Flight]] and [[Mawdryn Undead]] (1983). Afterwards, Grimwade\nwas asked to write Davison's penultimate story, which would become [[Planet of\nFire]]. Because the story's requirements were in constant flux, mainly due to\nuncertainty over the filming location and cast changes, he eventually became\nfrustrated and allowed script editor Eric Saward to finish the serial.\n\nOutside of Doctor Who, Grimwade wrote and directed The Come-Uppance of Captain\nKatt for the ITV children's drama series [[Dramarama (television)|Dramarama]].\nThe play was about events behind-the-scenes on a low-budget television science\nfiction series, which Grimwade openly acknowledged was inspired by his\nexperience working on Doctor Who.\n\nWhen the BBC gave the publisher W. H. Allen the rights to use Vislor Turlough in\nthe novel Turlough and the Earthlink Dilemma, W. H. Allen offered Grimwade a\nchance to publish an original novel. The result was Robot (ISBN 0-352-32036-2),\na book filled with Doctor Who references.\n\nAfterwards, Grimwade left the BBC and mainly worked in producing industrial\ntraining videos. He died in 1990 of leukaemia.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Peter_Grimwade","recorded":1375068988,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","/wiki/Leukaemia","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Television","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Television_series","/wiki/Doctor_Who","/wiki/Truro_Cathedral_School","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Jon_Pertwee","/wiki/Spearhead_from_Space","/wiki/The_Robots_of_Death","/wiki/Michael_E._Briant","/wiki/Tom_Baker","#cite_note-1","/wiki/George_Gallaccio","/wiki/The_Omega_Factor","/wiki/John_le_Carr%C3%A9","/wiki/All_Creatures_Great_and_Small_(TV_series)","/wiki/Peter_Davison","/wiki/Full_Circle_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/Tom_Baker","/wiki/Logopolis","/wiki/Kinda_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/Earthshock","/wiki/Cyberman","/wiki/Adric","/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Time-Flight","/wiki/Mawdryn_Undead","/wiki/Planet_of_Fire","/wiki/Eric_Saward","/wiki/ITV","/wiki/Dramarama_(television)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Vislor_Turlough","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0352320362","/wiki/Leukaemia","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342374/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecl6nb/OnTarget/authors/grim/grimwade.htm","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/36066299","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&oldid=548283651","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1942_births","/wiki/Category:1990_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_television_directors","/wiki/Category:British_television_writers","/wiki/Category:Gay_writers","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Truro_Cathedral_School","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_July_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2010","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Grimwade&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Grimwade","/wiki/Peter_Grimwade","/wiki/Talk:Peter_Grimwade","#","/wiki/Peter_Grimwade","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Peter_Grimwade","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Peter_Grimwade","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&oldid=548283651","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Grimwade&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7174392","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Peter_
