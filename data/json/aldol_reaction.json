Increased complexity arises because up to two new\nstereogenic centers (on the α- and β-carbon of the aldol adduct, marked with\nasterisks in the scheme below) are formed. Modern methodology is capable of not\nonly allowing aldol reactions to proceed in high yield but also controlling both\nthe relative and absolute stereochemical configuration of these stereocenters.\nThis ability to selectively synthesize a particular stereoisomer is significant\nbecause different stereoisomers can have very different chemical or biological\nproperties.\n\nFor example, stereogenic aldol units are especially common in polyketides, a\nclass of molecules found in biological organisms. In nature, polyketides are\nsynthesized by enzymes that effect iterative Claisen condensations. The 1,3-\ndicarbonyl products of these reactions can then be variously derivatized to\nproduce a wide variety of interesting structures. Often, such derivitization\ninvolves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups, producing the aldol\nsubunit. Some of these structures have potent biological properties: the potent\nimmunosuppressant FK506, the anti-tumor agent discodermolide, or the antifungal\nagent amphotericin B, for example. Although the synthesis of many such compounds\nwas once considered nearly impossible, aldol methodology has allowed their\nefficient synthesis in many cases.<ref name=MahrwaldSchetter2006> {{cite journal\n| title = Modern Aldol Methods for the Total Synthesis of Polyketides author =\n| Schetter, B. coauthors = Mahrwald, R. journal =Angew.

Ed. year\n| =2006 volume =45 pages =7506–7525 doi = 10.1002/anie.200602780 pmid = 17103481\n| issue = 45 }}</ref>\n\n\n\nA typical modern aldol addition reaction, shown above, might involve the\nnucleophilic addition of a ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the\naldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated\ncarbonyl compound. This is called [[aldol condensation]]. A variety of\nnucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols,\nenolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other carbonyl\ncompounds. The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many\nvariations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and\nelectrophile are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on\nthe converse, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction\nis called aldol [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]]. (LDA) in tetrahydrofuran\n(THF). The flask on the left is a solution of the lithium enolate of tert-butyl\npropionate (formed by addition of LDA to tert-butyl propionate). An aldehyde\ncan then be added to the enolate flask to initiate an aldol addition\nreaction.<br /> Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath\n(−78&nbsp;°C) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple\n(the wire on the left).]]\n",
