A letter of recall is the opposite, a letter\nsent from one head of state to another head of state recalling an ambassador,\neither as a means of diplomatic protest (see letter of protest) or because the\ndiplomat is being reassigned elsewhere and is being replaced by another envoy.\n\nIn parliamentary democracies, heads of state or their representatives accept or\nreject letters of credence on the basis of advice (that is, instructions from\nthe government which put the head of state under obligation) from their state's\ngovernment. In reality, however, they are almost invariably accepted, as both\nstates will have informally discussed the issue prior to the formal ceremony. If\na problem were to arise, it would be sorted out in these earlier government to\ngovernment contacts.\n\nUntil a head of state or his or her delegate formally accepts a letter of\ncredence, an ambassador-designate does not formally assume diplomatic status,\nincluding the possession of diplomatic immunity. In many states, a minister in\nthe government or in cabinet will attend (that is, be present with) the head of\nstate at the actual ceremony, to symbolize the fact that the acceptance or\nrejection of the letter of credence is on the basis of government advice.\n","linknr":269,"url":"Letter_of_credence","recorded":1362891074,"links":36,"instances":["manner_of_address","message","government","external_relations_act_1936","government","logic","diplomacy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diplomacy","Letters (message)"],"headings":["Disputes regarding mode of address","Head of state"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Canadian_Governor-General_Michelle_Jean_accepts_US_Ambassador%27s_credentials.jpg/250px-Canadian_Governor-General_Michelle_Jean_accepts_US_Ambassador%27s_credentials.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Lukens_presents_credentials_to_Wade_2011-08-11.jpg/250px-Lukens_presents_credentials_to_Wade_2011-08-11.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Shapiro_presenting_credentials_to_Peres_2011-08-03.jpg/250px-Shapiro_presenting_credentials_to_Peres_2011-08-03.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Vladimir_Putin_with_Tekiso_Hati.jpg/250px-Vladimir_Putin_with_Tekiso_Hati.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/China_amb_zhang_yesui_600.jpg/250px-China_amb_zhang_yesui_600.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["letter","message"],["ambassador","diplomacy"],["executive","government"],["cabinet","government"],["style","manner_of_address"],["style","manner_of_address"],["kingdom_of_italy","1861–1946"],["converse","logic"],["executive_authority","external_relations_act_1936"]],"members":["style","letter","cabinet","executive_authority","executive","converse","ambassador","kingdom_of_italy"],"related":["United_States","Canada","Governor_General_of_Canada","Michaëlle_Jean","Dakar","Shimon_Peres","Russian_President","Vladimir_Putin","Barack_Obama","Zhang_Yesui","People’s_Republic_of_China","White_House","Letter_(message)","Head_of_state","Diplomatic_accreditation","Diplomat","Ambassador_(diplomacy)","Letter_of_protest","Diplomat","Parliamentary_democracy","Head_of_state","Executive_(government)","Ceremony","Diplomatic_immunity","Cabinet_(government)","Style_(manner_of_address)","Style_(manner_of_address)","Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)","Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia","Ethiopia","Emperor_of_Ethiopia","King_of_Italy","Victor_Emmanuel_III_of_Italy","Diplomatic_recognition","George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom","British_monarchy","Monarchy_in_Ireland","Éamon_de_Valera","Irish_Free_State","United_Kingdom","Irish_constitution","Irish_language","Sovereignty","Her_Majesty's_Government","Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom","Mary_Robinson","Mary_McAleese","Belfast_Agreement","Northern_Ireland","President_of_Ireland","Majestic_plural","Converse_(logic)","Governor-general","Republic_of_Ireland","Republic_of_Ireland_Act","Irish_head_of_state_from_1936_to_1949","King_of_Ireland","Executive_Authority_(External_Relations)_Act_1936","Canada","Monarchy_in_Canada","Governor_General_of_Canada","Australia","New_Zealand","Private_Secretary_to_the_Sovereign","Monarchist_League_of_Canada"]}
