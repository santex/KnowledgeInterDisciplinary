The term originates\nfrom English common law where felonies were originally crimes which involved the\nconfiscation of a convicted person's land and goods; other crimes were called\nmisdemeanors. Many common law countries have now abolished the\nfelony/misdemeanor distinction and replaced it with other distinctions such as\nbetween indictable offences and summary offences. A felony is generally\nconsidered to be a crime of \"high seriousness\", while a misdemeanor is not.\n\nA person convicted in a court of law of a felony crime is known as a 'felon'. In\nthe United States, where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely\napplied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death\nor imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or\nless, it is classified as a misdemeanor.<ref></ref> The individual states may\ndiffer in this definition, using other categories as seriousness or context.\n\nSimilar to felonies in some civil law countries (Italy, etc.) are [[delict]]s,\nwhereas in others (France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland etc.) crimes (more\nserious) and delicts (less serious).\n",
