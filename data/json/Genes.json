It is widely\naccepted by the scientific community as a name given to some stretches of DNA\nand RNA that code for a polypeptide or for an RNA chain that has a function in\nthe organism, though there still are controversies about what plays the role of\nthe genetic material. Sarkar, S. and Plutynski, A. (2008). A Companion to\nthe Philosophy of Biology. Oxford: Blackwell. Living beings depend on\ngenes, as they specify all proteins and functional RNA chains. Genes hold the\ninformation to build and maintain an organism's cells and pass genetic traits to\noffspring. All organisms have many genes corresponding to various biological\ntraits, some of which are immediately visible, such as eye color or number of\nlimbs, and some of which are not, such as blood type, increased risk for\nspecific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise\nlife. double helix.]]\n\nA modern working definition of a gene is \"a [[Locus (genetics)|locatable\nregion]] of [[genome|genomic]] sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance,\nwhich is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions, and or other\nfunctional sequence regions \". Colloquial usage of the term gene (e.g. \"good genes\", \"hair\ncolor gene\") may actually refer to an allele: a gene is the basic instructionâa\nsequence of nucleic acids (DNA or, in the case of certain viruses RNA), while an\nallele is one variant of that gene. Referring to having a gene for a trait is no\nlonger the scientifically accepted usage. In most cases, all people would have a\ngene for the trait in question, but certain people will have a specific allele\nof that gene, which results in the trait variant. Further, genes code for\nproteins, which might result in identifiable traits, but it is the gene, not the\ntrait, which is inherited.\n","linknr":874,"url":"Genes","recorded":1362508464,"links":100,"instances":["genetics","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","genetics","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","journal","biology","theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cloning","Genes|","Molecular
