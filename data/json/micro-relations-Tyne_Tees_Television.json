As of\n2009, it forms part of a non-franchise ITV Tyne Tees & Border region, shared\nwith the ITV Border region. Tyne Tees is owned and operated by ITV plc under the\nlicensee of ITV Broadcasting Limited. The analogue signals in the\nTyne Tees region were switched off in 2012, making the station, along with ITV\nLondon and UTV, one of the last ITV regions to solely broadcast digitally.\n\nTyne Tees launched on 15 January 1959 from studios at a converted warehouse in\nCity Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, remaining in the city until July 2005 when Tyne\nTees moved to smaller studios in Gateshead. Tyne Tees has contributed various\nprogramming to the ITV network and Channel 4, as well as its regional output.\nSome of Tyne Tees best known programming includes the groundbreaking music show\n[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]], critically acclaimed adaptations of Catherine\nCookson novels, and children's programmes such as [[Supergran]]. Its current\nregional news programme is [[ITV News Tyne Tees]].\n\nThe ownership and management structure of Tyne Tees has altered across its\nhistory, particularly in various mergers with Yorkshire Television. The two\nstations were managed by Trident Television during the 1970s, and the two\nstations were merged again in the 1990s to form Yorkshire-Tyne Tees\nTelevision. A series of takeovers and mergers across the ITV network,\ninstigated by the large groups Granada and Carlton, led to Tyne Tees becoming\npart of ITV plc in 2004.\n","linknr":1001,"url":"Tyne_Tees_Television","recorded":1362565890,"links":29,"instances":["band","newsreader","film","television_presenter","tv_network","shopping_centre","computer_science","comedian","tv_producer","uk_parliament_constituency"],"pdf":["http://www.competition-ommission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1983/fulltext/174c05.pdf","http://www.competition-ommission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1983/fulltext/174c05.pdf"],"categories":["ITV
