Swings'\n(24 September 1906, Ransart, Belgium-28 October 1983) was a Belgian\nastrophysicist who was known for his studies of the composition and structure of\nstars and comets. He used spectroscopy to identify the elements in astronomical\nbodies, and, in particular, comets. Swings studied at the University of LiÃ¨ge,\nwhere he was professor of spectroscopy and astrophysics from 1932 to 1975. He\nwas also a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the United States\n(1939â43, 1946â52).\n\nFrom his study of cometary atmospheres, he is credited with the discovery of the\n'Swings bands' and the 'Swings effect'. Swings bands are emission lines\nresulting from the presence of certain atoms of carbon; the Swings effect was\ndiscovered with the aid of a slit spectrograph and is attributed to fluorescence\nresulting partly from solar radiation.\n\nMoreover, Swings studied spectroscopy of interstellar space and investigated the\nrotation of stars, as well as nebulae, novae, and variable stars. Pol Swings was\nawarded the Francqui Prize for Exact Sciences in 1948.\n\n1637 Swings, an asteroid of the Main belt is named after him.\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Swings, Pol ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = astrophysicist DATE\n| OF BIRTH = 24 September 1906 PLACE OF BIRTH = Ransart, Belgium DATE OF DEATH =\n| 28 October 1983 PLACE OF DEATH =\n}}\n","linknr":142,"url":"Pol_Swings","recorded":1362564651,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1906 births","1983 deaths","Belgian astronomers","Walloon people","University of Liège alumni"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Pol_Swings.jpg/150px-Pol_Swings.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg/30px-Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg/40px-Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ransart","Belgium","Belgium","Astrophysics","University_of_Chicago","University_of_Liège","Spectroscopy","Francqui_Prize","Ransart","Belgium","Astrophysics","Spectroscopy","University_of_Liège","University_of_Chicago","United_States","Spectral_line","Fluorescence","Spectroscopy","Francqui_Prize","1637_Swings","Asteroid","Main_belt","Ransart","Belgium"]}
