{"cursor":"29470","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" meteoroid detection satellite.]] The 'Saturn' family of American rocket\n boosters was developed by a team of mostly German rocket scientists led by\n Wernher von Braun to launch heavy payloads to Earth orbit and beyond.\n Originally proposed as a military satellite launcher, they were adopted as the\n launch vehicles for the Apollo moon program. The two most important members of\n the family were the Saturn IB and the Saturn V.\n\nThe predecessor of those two was the Saturn I. President John F. Kennedy\nidentified this booster, and the SA-5 launch in particular, as being the point\nwhere US lift capability would surpass the Soviets, after having been behind\nsince Sputnik. This was last mentioned by him in a speech he gave at Brooks AFB\nin San Antonio on the day before he was assassinated. He never lived to see the\ncapability of any boosters from the Saturn family, started under the Eisenhower\nadministration, realized.\n\nTo date, the Saturn V is the only launch vehicle to transport human beings\nbeyond Low Earth Orbit. A total of 24 humans were flown to the Moon in the four-\nyears spanning December 1968 through December 1972.\n","linknr":443,"url":"Saturn_rocket","recorded":1362267845,"links":39,"instances":["rocket_engine","rocket_family","rocket_engine","apollo","rocket_engine","rocket","apollo","apollo","rocket_family","rocket","rocket","apollo","rocket_engine","apollo","rocket_stage"],"pdf":["http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4230.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4230.pdf"],"categories":["Spacecraft propulsion","Expendable space launch systems","Rockets and missiles","Saturn (rocket family)|*"],"headings":["History","Project Apollo","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Saturn_SA9_launch.jpg/220px-Saturn_SA9_launch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/F-1_rocket_engine_at_KSC.jpg/220px-F-1_rocket_engine_at_KSC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/USAF_ICBM_and_NASA_Launch_Vehicle_Flight_Test_Successes_and_Failures.png/600px-USAF_ICBM_and_NASA_Launch_Vehicle_Flight_Test_Successes_and_Failures.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Ksc-69pc-442.jpg/100px-Ksc-69pc-442.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saturn_ib","rocket"],["sa-5","apollo"],["redstone","rocket"],["atlas","rocket_family"],["titan","rocket_family"],["h-1","rocket_engine"],["f-1","rocket_engine"],["centaur","rocket_stage"],["e-1","rocket_engine"],["h-1","rocket_engine"],["s-3d","rocket_engine"],["nova","rocket"],["sa-1","apollo"],["sa-2","apollo"],["sa-3","apollo"],["sa-4","apollo"],["sa-5","apollo"],["a-101","sa-6"],["a-102","sa-7"],["a-103","sa-9"],["a-104","sa-8"],["a-105","sa-10"],["boilerplate","spaceflight#apollo_boilerplates"]],"members":["atlas","nova","titan","redstone","saturn_ib","centaur","boilerplate"],"related":["Rocket","Wernher_von_Braun","Apollo_program","Saturn_IB_(rocket)","Saturn_V","Saturn_I","John_F._Kennedy","SA-5_(Apollo)","Sputnik","Eisenhower_administration","Low_Earth_Orbit","List_of_Apollo_astronauts","V-2_rocket","US_Navy","Viking_rocket","US_Army","MGM-5_Corporal","PGM-19_Jupiter","Redstone_(rocket)","US_Air_Force","Atlas_(rocket_family)","Titan_(rocket_family)","United_States_Department_of_Defense","Charles_Erwin_Wilson","PGM-19_Jupiter","Spy_satellite","Top_secret","Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency","Army_Ballistic_Missile_Agency","Heinz-Hermann_Koelle","John_Bruce_Medaris","H-1_(rocket_engine)","F-1_(rocket_engine)","Centaur_(rocket_stage)","General_Dynamics","E-1_(rocket_engine)","International_Geophysical_Year","US_Navy","Project_Vanguard","Viking_rocket","Sounding_rocket","Soviet_Union","Sputnik_I","Time_Magazine","Jupiter_C","Juno_I","Sputnik_II","Explorer_I","Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency","Titan_C","Liquid_hydrogen","Lockheed_CL-400_Suntan","Spy_plane","Krafft_Ehricke","Dyna-Soar","Kerosene","Juno_I","Juno_II","H-1_(rocket_engine)","S-3D_(rocket_engine)","NASA","Direct_ascent","Moon","Nova_(rocket)","Project_Horizon","Earth_orbit_rendezvous","Lunex_Project","Space_Launch_System","Silverstein_Committee","Titan_rocket","Centaur_rocket","S-IV","S-IV","S-II","Douglas_Aircraft_Company","Saturn_I","SA-1_(Apollo)","LC-34","SA-2_(Apollo)","SA-3_(Apollo)","SA-4_(Apollo)","SA-5_(Apollo)","LC-37B","A-101_(SA-6)","A-102_(SA-7)","A-103_(SA-9)","A-104_(SA-8)","A-105_(SA-10)","Saturn_IB","AS-201","AS-203","AS-202","Saturn_V","Apollo_4","LC-39A","Apollo_5","Apollo_6","Apollo_7","Apollo_8","Apollo_9","Apollo_10","LC-39B","Apollo_11","Apollo_12","Apollo_13","Apollo_14","Apollo_15","Apollo_16","Apollo_17","Skylab_1","Skylab_2","Skylab_3","Skylab_4","Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project","John_F._Kennedy","Astronaut","Moon","Nova_rocket","Nova_rocket","Saturn_V","Lunar_orbit_rendezvous","Saturn_I","Redstone_rocket","Jupiter_IRBM","Saturn_I","Pegasus_satellite_program","Saturn_IB","S-IB","S-IVB","Skylab","Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project","Saturn_V","Skylab"]}
