{"cursor":"63613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n'Brewing' is the production of beer through steeping a starch source (commonly\ncereal grains) in water and then fermenting with yeast. Brewing has taken place\nsince around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that\nthis technique was used in ancient Egypt. Descriptions of various beer recipes\ncan be found in Sumerian writings, some of the oldest known writing of any\nsort. Brewing is done in a brewery by a brewer,\nand the brewing industry is part of most western economies.\n\nThe basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley,\nwhich is able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a brewer's yeast to\nproduce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as hops.

Retrieved 29 September\n2008 The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively\ncalled the grain bill.\n\nThere are several steps in the brewing process, which include malting, milling,\nmashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging.\nThere are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool and wild or spontaneous.\nFermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary\nfermentation that can take place in the brewery, in the cask, or in the bottle.\n\nBrewing specifically includes the process of steeping, such as with making tea,\nsake, and soy sauce. Technically, wine, cider and mead are not brewed but rather\nvinified as there is no steeping process involving solids.\n","linknr":1083,"url":"Brewing","recorded":1362505730,"links":56,"instances":["microbiology","beer","chemistry","brewing","beer","beer","taste","brewing","grinding","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/consultationresponse/summrespvegi.pdf","http://www.ab-inbev.com/documents/press_release.pdf","http://www.ab-inbev.com/documents/press_release.pdf"],"categories":["Brewing|","Fermentation
