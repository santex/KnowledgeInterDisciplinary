The packing can be randomly filled with\nsmall objects like Raschig rings or else it can be a specifically designed\nstructured packing. Packed beds may also contain catalyst particles or\nadsorbents such as zeolite pellets, granular activated carbon, etc.\n\nThe purpose of a packed bed is typically to improve contact between two phases\nin a chemical or similar process. Packed beds can be used in a chemical reactor,\na distillation process, or a scrubber, but packed beds have also been used to\nstore heat in chemical plants. In this case, hot gases are allowed to escape\nthrough a vessel that is packed with a refractory material until the packing is\nhot. Air or other cool gas is then fed back to the plant through the hot bed,\nthereby pre-heating the air or gas feed.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Packed_bed","recorded":1362500425,"links":18,"instances":["matter","chemistry","chemistry","material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Distillation"],"headings":["Applications","Theory","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Anelli_Raschig.jpg/200px-Anelli_Raschig.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Riempimento_strutturato.jpg/200px-Riempimento_strutturato.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tubing","material"],["phase","matter"],["absorption","chemistry"],["stripping","chemistry"]],"members":["phase","stripping","absorption","tubing"],"related":["Chemical_process","Tubing_(material)","Raschig_ring","Structured_packing","Phase_(matter)","Chemical_reactor","Distillation","Scrubber","Heat","Refractory","Separation_process","Absorption_(chemistry)","Stripping_(chemistry)","Distillation","Pressure_vessel","Chromatography","Structured_packing","Mass_transfer","Theoretical_plate","Theoretical_plate","Catalyst","Reaction_rate","Sabri_Ergun","Velocity","Viscosity","Density","Theoretical_plate","Continuous_distillation","Kozeny-Carman_equation","Fluidized_bed"]}
