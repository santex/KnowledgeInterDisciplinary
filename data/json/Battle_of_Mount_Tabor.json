General\nBonaparte was besieging Acre, and Damascus sent its army to relieve the siege.\nOperating to the south of Acre, Israel. Smith, D. p.151\n\nAfter the successes of other elements of Napoleonâs army, KlÃ©ber decided to\nsurprise the main Ottoman concentration of about 35,000 men (25,000 cavalry â\nmany of them Mamelukes, 10,000 infantry and the Pasha â much of the Ottoman army\nbeing a poorly trained rabble of volunteers and militia), which he had come\nacross camped below Mount Tabor in the Plain of Esdraelon - South of Murat, with\njust a division of approximately 2,000 in a daring night raid which he hoped\nwould hold him in good stead with Napoleon. He must have believed that he had at\nleast a few chances of victory, with his peers and himself being outnumbered and\nwinning previous battles where the enemy knew of their presence. He decided upon\na night attack, on the 15th April, where he would march round Mount Tabor from\nthe North and destroy the Ottoman Camp. KlÃ©ber sent dispatches to Napoleon about\nthe forthcoming action which would reach him around the time of the battle but\nnot give him a chance to intervene with its outset. Napoleon having been handed\nthe dispatches decided to support and reinforce KlÃ©ber with a few thousand men\nthat were based around Acre, but no where near enough, even with the 2,000 under\nKlÃ©ber, to beat the Pashaâs main army in a set piece battle. KlÃ©ber marched from\nNazareth East round Mount Tabor and West of the River Jourdan.\n\nUnfortunately for KlÃ©ber his march time was badly estimated and at the break of\ndawn (at around six oâclock) he was at the base on the Southern side of Mount\nTabor. With KlÃ©berâs headquarters was General Verdierâs wife, Verdier commanding\na brigade during the forthcoming battle. The body of troops was soon spotted by\nthe Ottomanâs and KlÃ©ber realised that his best bet was to form square (in this\ncase two squares were formed) to preserve as many men a possible; it would have\nbeen difficult for him to make a quick dash to any prominent position but in\nhindsight he could have moved much closer to the river which could have helped\nhis logistical position (with nearby/closer water) and tactical position (with\nthe Ottomans struggling to attack through/from the water); even though he\nprobably would have not been able to make it even within musket range of the\nwaters edge before he came under contact. Another option would have been to\nattempt to climb as much of Mount Tabor as would be possible in his limited\namount of time.\n\nSo the fighting began and for ten hours from 6am-4pm the French stood against\nrepeated Ottoman charges, their casualties were few and their square remained\nbut the ammunition stocks were low and the men were full of thirst and hunger.\nThe Frenchmen had very little time in which they could eat and when they could\nthe soldiers were not able to take advantage of it for they could hardly speak\nthrough fatigue and thirst, although many of them would happily have replaced\nthe little food which they possessed with musket balls and gunpowder. The\nOttomans suffered substantial losses, but they could easily replace their\ncasualties and keep up with good supplies and strength to continue repeated\nstrikes throughout the day.\n\nJust when all seemed to be lost, and KlÃ©ber was preparing to make a last ditch\nbreakout towards the river to the East, a few soldiers saw a brief glimpse of a\nmilitary force advancing upon them from the North. KlÃ©ber moved to indulge\nhimself in the view of a new force which could easily be a relief column under\nNapoleon, but he saw nothing but the open desert and a monstrous enemy force.\nWhat had actually happened was that the relief column under the personal command\nof Napoleon Bonaparte was only momentarily in the view of the square until it\nhad marched right into a dip, just when KlÃ©ber was looking. Soon, though, KlÃ©ber\nsaw the relief column and the men began to feel that their general was going to\nsave their lives which just a few minutes earlier had seemed in doubt. They\nshould not have been confident though because man for man the French were better\nthan the Ottomans but they still had many times more men than Napoleon and\nKlÃ©ber could ever gather. Napoleon made an attempt at dislodging the confidence\nof the Ottomans, when he eventually arrived, by detaching 300 men to pillage and\ndestroy the Ottoman camp; for Napoleon was advancing into the divide between the\nOttomans and their camp. This had consequences that Napoleon could never have\nimagined as he advanced upon the Ottoman forces. The Turks, seeing the\ndestruction of their belongings, themselves felt surrounded and a small retreat,\nto the South and across the River Jourdan, from a few turned into a general rout\nand they were pursued by KlÃ©ber â who had ordered his men to charge in a last\neffort for the day â and Napoleon â whoâs men were relatively fresh - being cut\nto pieces by the victorious Frenchmen who had suffered from such serious fatigue\nover the preceding hours. KlÃ©berâs men had their thirst replaced by an\nadrenaline rush for the river to run red with blood, many Turks were killed in\nthe rout. Overall KlÃ©berâs casualties were two dead and seventeen wounded but if\nNapoleon had arrived just an hour later they could have been so many more. While\nthe Ottomans, although estimates can not be relied upon, had lost a large\nproportion of their overall force, especially when compared to French\ncasualties. This victory ended any major threat of the Pashaâs Army disrupting\nthe Siege of Acre. In fact the surviving Ottomans were scattered and the army\nwas not totally destroyed but there was little need for Napoleon to worry for a\nlong time.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Battle_of_Mount_Tabor","recorded":1375078420,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(biblical)","/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars","/wiki/File:La_Bataille_du_mont_Tabor,_en_Syrie,_le_27_germinal_an_VI_by_Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Lejeune_Salon_de_1804.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/La_Bataille_du_mont_Tabor%2C_en_Syrie%2C_le_27_germinal_an_VI_by_Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Lejeune_Salon_de_1804.jpg/300px-La_Bataille_du_mont_Tabor%2C_en_Syrie%2C_le_27_germinal_an_VI_by_Louis_Fran%C3%A7ois_Lejeune_Salon_de_1804.jpg","/wiki/Mount_Tabor,_Israel","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281453-1517%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281453-1517%29.svg.png","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/France","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","/wiki/First_French_Republic","/wiki/Jezzar_Pasha","/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Kl%C3%A9ber","/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France","#cite_note-smith-1","#cite_note-smith-1","#cite_note-smith-1","#cite_note-smith-1","/wiki/Template:Campaignbox_Egypt-Syria","/wiki/Template_talk:Campaignbox_Egypt-Syria","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Campaignbox_Egypt-Syria&action=edit","/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars","/wiki/French_Campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria","/wiki/Battle_of_Shubra_Khit","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pyramids","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile","/wiki/Revolt_of_Cairo","/wiki/Siege_of_El_Arish","/wiki/Siege_of_Jaffa","/wiki/Siege_of_Acre_(1799)","/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tabor","/wiki/Battle_of_Abukir_(1799)","/wiki/Battle_of_Heliopolis_(1800)","/wiki/Battle_of_Abukir_(1801)","/wiki/Battle_of_Mandora","/wiki/Battle_of_Alexandria","/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Cairo_(1801)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Siege_of_Alexandria","/wiki/File:NazarethSouth1799.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/NazarethSouth1799.jpg/220px-NazarethSouth1799.jpg","/wiki/File:NazarethSouth1799.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Pierre_Jacotin","/wiki/First_French_Empire","/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Kl%C3%A9ber","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Pasha","/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France","/wiki/Siege_of_Acre_(1799)","/wiki/Damascus","/wiki/Acre,_Israel","#cite_note-smith-1","/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Verdier","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-smith_1-0","#cite_ref-smith_1-1","#cite_ref-smith_1-2","#cite_ref-smith_1-3","#cite_ref-smith_1-4","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.napoleonguide.com/","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&params=32_36_44.81_N_35_19_35.85_E_region:IL","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&oldid=563709812","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Conflicts_in_1799","/wiki/Category:1799_in_Ottoman_Syria","/wiki/Category:Battles_of_the_French_Revolutionary_Wars","/wiki/Category:Battles_involving_the_Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Category:Battles_involving_France","/wiki/Category:1790s_in_the_Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Category:1799_in_Asia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Battle+of+Mount+Tabor+%281799%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Battle+of+Mount+Tabor+%281799%29","/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)","/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)","#","/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mount_Tabor_(1799)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/w
