      "text" : "{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}}\n\n debutante ball at Chicago's Palmer House Hotel.]]\n\nA 'debutante' (from the French débutante, \"female beginner\") is a girl or young\nlady from an aristocratic or upper class family who has reached the age of\nmaturity and, as a new adult, is introduced to society at a formal \"debut\"\npresentation. Originally, it meant the young woman was eligible to marry, and\npart of the purpose was to display her to eligible bachelors and their families\nwith a view to marriage within a select upper class circle. Debutantes may be\nrecommended by a distinguished committee or sponsored by an established member\nof elite society. It should not be confused with an Irish \"deb.\"\n\nDebut presentations vary by regional culture and are also frequently referenced\nas \"debutante balls,\" \"cotillion balls\" or \"coming-out\" parties. The male\nequivalent is often referred to as \"beautillion ball\". A lone debutante might\nhave her own debut, or she might share it with a sister or other close relative.\nModern debutante balls are often charity events: the parents of the debutante\ndonate a certain amount of money to the designated cause, and the invited guests\npay for their tickets. These balls may be elaborate formal affairs and involve\nnot only \"debs\" but junior debutantes, escorts and ushers, flower girls and\npages as well.\n",
