Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the\nMinnesota Territory and admitted to the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858.\nKnown as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the state's name comes from a Dakota word\nfor \"sky-tinted water\". Those waters, together with forests, parks, and\nwilderness areas, offer residents and tourists a variety of outdoor recreational\nopportunities.\n\nMinnesota is the 12th most extensive and the 21st most populous of the U.S.\nStates. Nearly 60% of its residents live in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul\nmetropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation,\nbusiness, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally\nknown arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies\nnow given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now\ncleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for\nmining, forestry, and recreation.\n\nMinnesota is known for its relatively mixed social and political orientations\nand its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. It ranks among the\nhealthiest states, and has a highly literate population. The large majority of\nresidents are of Scandinavian and German descent. The state is known as a center\nof Scandinavian American culture. Ethnic diversity has increased in recent\ndecades. Substantial influxes of Asian, African, and Latin American immigrants\nhave joined the descendants of European settlers and the original Native\nAmerican inhabitants.\n","title":"minnesota","headings":["Etymology","Geography","History","Cities and towns","Demographics","Economy","Culture","Health","Education","Transportation","Law and
