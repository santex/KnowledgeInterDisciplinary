There were also several minor\nbranch railways in the province of New Brunswick that were acquired by CGR\nduring this time. Kieth MacKenzie, The History of the Canadian National,\nBison Books (1988) p. 61\n\nThe deepening financial crisis in Canada's railway industry toward the end of\nthe First World War saw the majority of major railways across the country\nnationalized by the federal government. The CGR played a vital role in Canada's\nwartime effort, moving vast numbers of troops and supplies. A notable role was\nthe relief and reconstruction in Halifax after the 1917 Halifax Explosion and\none CGR employee, Vince Coleman became a celebrated hero in the\nexplosion. *[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/coleman.html Dan Conlin,\n\"Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion\", Maritime Museum of the Atlantic web\npage]\n\nThe first system to be taken over was the bankrupt Canadian Northern Railway\n(CNoR) on September 6, 1918 whereby the government-appointed Board of Management\nfor CNoR was instructed to take responsibility for all CGR operations as well.\nLater that year, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways\n(CNR) as a means to simplify the funding and administration of the nationalized\nrailway system; this was formally brought about by an order issued on December\n20, 1918, by the Privy Council. Robert F. Leggett, Railways of Canada\nDouglas and MacIntyre (1973), p. 117-118\n\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR) was nationalized after defaulting on loan\npayments March 7, 1919 and entered the CNR fold on July 12, 1920. GTPR's parent\ncompany, the bankrupt Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was nationalized on May 21, 1920\nand was absorbed into the CNR on January 30, 1923.\n\nAlthough the CGR only existed for a short period of time before evolving into\nthe Canadian National Railway, it was a very visible Canadian railway in World\nWar One due to the large scale of wartime railway operation. Large amounts of\nrolling stock were lettered for the CGR, although in many regions, such as the\nMaritimes, the public continued to refer to its trains and facilities by their\nold name of the Intercolonial. The CGR moniker ceased to be used after 1918 but\nthe CGR itself existed on paper until the late 20th century, largely due to real\nestate leases and other agreements. A Privy Council order dated July 22, 1993\nauthorized the sale of CGR to the Crown corporation CN for one dollar (CAD).\n","linknr":121,"url":"Canadian_Government_Railways","recorded":1375061454,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Help:Template","/wiki/Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2013_July_27#Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Reporting_mark","/wiki/Manitoba","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Quebec","/wiki/New_Brunswick","/wiki/Nova_Scotia","/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island","/wiki/Track_gauge","/wiki/Standard_gauge","/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island","/wiki/Reporting_mark","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Intercolonial_Railway_of_Canada","/wiki/National_Transcontinental_Railway","/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island_Railway","/wiki/Hudson_Bay_Railway","/wiki/New_Brunswick","#cite_note-2","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Nationalized","/wiki/Halifax_Explosion","/wiki/Vince_Coleman_(train_dispatcher)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/wiki/Order_in_Council","/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/Crown_corporation","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_dollar","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Railway_Equipment_and_Publication_Company&action=edit&redlink=1","http://books.google.com/books?id=1A3WAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT309","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/coleman.html","#cite_ref-4","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&oldid=543559388","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Manitoba_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Ontario_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Quebec_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_New_Brunswick_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Nova_Scotia_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Prince_Edward_Island_railways","/wiki/Category:Canadian_National_Railway_subsidiaries","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Government+Railways&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Government+Railways","/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","/wiki/Talk:Canadian_Government_Railways","#","/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Canadian_Government_Railways","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Canadian_Government_Railways","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&oldid=543559388","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1032142","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Canadian_Government_Railways&id=543559388","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Canadian+Government+Railways","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Canadian+Government+Railways&oldid=543559388&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Government_Railways&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1032142#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wik
