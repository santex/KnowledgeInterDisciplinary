It comprises the\nkinds of technology that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in\napplication, usually because they are impractical in civilian application,\nhave no legal civilian usage, or are dangerous to use without appropriate\nmilitary training.\n\nIt is common for military technology to have been researched and developed by\nscientists and engineers specifically for use in battle by the armed forces.\nMany new technologies came as a result of the military funding of science.\n'Weapons engineering' is the design, development, testing and lifecycle\nmanagement of military weapons and systems. It draws on the knowledge of several\ntraditional engineering disciplines, including mechanical engineering,\nelectrical engineering, mechatronics, electro-optics, aerospace engineering,\nmaterials engineering, and chemical engineering.\n\nThere are a significant number of military inventions that are technologies\noriginally developed and designed for military purposes, and which are now used\nby civilians with sometimes minor or no modifications at all.\n","linknr":526,"url":"Military_equipment","recorded":1362538264,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military technology","Technology-related lists","Military equipment","Military lists"],"headings":["[[Weapons]] and [[munition]]s","[[Armour]]","Vehicles and transports","[[Military robot]]s","[[Fortifications]]","Sensors and communications","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/USAF_F-15C_fires_AIM-7_Sparrow.jpg/300px-USAF_F-15C_fires_AIM-7_Sparrow.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["list_of_cartridges","weaponry,_pistol_and_rifle"]],"members":["list_of_cartridges"],"related":["Missile_guidance","Warfare","Military_training","Scientist","Engineer","Military_funding_of_science","Mechanical_engineering","Electrical_engineering","Mechatronics","Electro-optics","Aerospace_engineering","Materials_engineering","Chemical_engineering","Military_invention","Automatic_firearm","Rocket","Turret","Sword","Spear","Axe","Hand-to-hand_combat","Medieval_siege_weaponry","Ammunition","Bomb","Missile","Warhead","Bullet","List_of_rifle_cartridges","List_of_handgun_cartridges","List_of_cartridges_(weaponry),_pistol_and_rifle","List_of_Shotgun_cartridges","Missile","List_of_missiles","Bomb","List_of_bombs","Land_mine","List_of_landmines","Minelaying","Naval_mine","List_of_armour_types","Armoured_fighting_vehicle","List_of_military_vehicles","List_of_armoured_fighting_vehicles","List_of_tanks","List_of_aircraft","List_of_aircraft_weapons","Submarine","Rigging","Age_of_Sail","List_of_aircraft_carriers","List_of_submarines","List_of_submarine_classes","Autonomous_robot","Robotics","Powered_exoskeleton","Bomb_disposal","Unmanned_ground_vehicle","Unmanned_combat_air_vehicle","Autonomous_underwater_vehicle","List_of_fortifications","List_of_forts","Radar","Missile_guidance","Materiel"]}
