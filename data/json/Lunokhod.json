{"cursor":"18971","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Lunokhod' (, \"Moonwalker\") was a series of Soviet robotic lunar rovers designed\nto land on the Moon between 1969 and 1977. The 1969 Lunokhod 1A was destroyed\nduring launch, the 1970 Lunokhod 1 and the 1973 Lunokhod 2 landed on the moon\nand the 1977 Lunokhod was never launched. The successful missions were in\noperation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and\nlanding missions. The Lunokhods were primarily designed to support the Soviet\nmanned moon missions and to be used as automatic remote-controlled robots to\nexplore the surface and return pictures. The Lunokhods were transported to the\nlunar surface by Luna spacecraft, which were launched by Proton rockets. The\nmoon lander part of the Luna spacecraft for Lunokhods were similar to the ones\nfor sample return missions. The Lunokhods were designed by Alexander\nKemurdjian at NPO Lavochkin. Not until the 1997 Mars Pathfinder was\nanother remote-controlled vehicle put on an extraterrestrial body. In 2010,\nnearly forty years after the 1971 loss of signal from Lunokhod 1, the NASA Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter photographed its tracks and final location, and\nresearchers, using a telescopic pulsed-laser rangefinder, detected the robot's\nretroreflector.\n","linknr":576,"url":"Lunokhod","recorded":1362268748,"links":59,"instances":["electricity","chernobyl","space_exploration"],"pdf":["http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1194.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1194.pdf"],"categories":["Lunokhod
