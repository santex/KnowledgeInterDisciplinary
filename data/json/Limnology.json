It is often regarded as a division of ecology or environmental science.\nIt covers the biological, chemical, physical, geological, and other attributes\nof all inland waters (running and standing waters, both fresh and saline,\nnatural or man-made). This includes the study of lakes and ponds, rivers,\nsprings, streams and wetlands. Wetzel, R.G. 2001. Limnology:\nLake and River Ecosystems, 3rd ed. Academic Press (ISBN 0-12-744760-1) A\nmore recent sub-discipline of limnology, termed landscape limnology, studies,\nmanages, and conserves these aquatic ecosystems using a landscape perspective.\n\nLimnology is closely related to aquatic ecology and hydrobiology, which study\naquatic organisms in particular regard to their hydrological environment.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Limnology","recorded":1362511678,"links":67,"instances":["hydrosphere"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Limnology|*","Hydrography","Lakes","Physical geography"],"headings":["History","Lake classification","Organizations","Journals","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Lake_Hawea%2C_New_Zealand.jpg/300px-Lake_Hawea%2C_New_Zealand.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg/110px-Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","hydrosphere"]],"members":["spring"],"related":["New_Zealand","Ecology","Environmental_science","Biology","Chemistry","Physics","Geology","Lake","Pond","River","Spring_(hydrosphere)","Stream","Wetland","Landscape_limnology","Aquatic_ecology","Hydrobiology","François-Alphonse_Forel","Lake_Geneva","August_Thienemann","Einar_Naumann","International_Society_of_Limnology","Societas_Internationalis_Limnologiae","Oceanography","G._Evelyn_Hutchinson","Edward_Smith_Deevey,_Jr.","Edward_Ashael_Birge","Chancey_Juday","Trophic_state_index","Primary_production","Eutrophication","Algal_blooms","Humic_matter","American_Society_of_Limnology_and_Oceanography","Asociación_Ibérica_de_Limnología","International_Society_of_Limnology","Polish_Limnological_Society","G._Evelyn_Hutchinson","Freshwater_biology","Hydrology","Lake_aeration","Lake_ecosystem","Landscape_limnology","Lentic_ecosystems","Limnic_eruption","Lotic_ecosystems","Marine_biology","Oceanography","Paleolimnology","George_Evelyn_Hutchinson","Prentice_Hall","Wiley-Blackwell","Gene_E._Likens","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Edward_A._Birge","Chancey_Juday"]}
