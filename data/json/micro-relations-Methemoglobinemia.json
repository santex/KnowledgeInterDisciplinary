Methemoglobin is an oxidized form of hemoglobin that has an increased\naffinity for oxygen and also results in an increased affinity of oxygen to the\nthree other heme sites (that are still ferrous) within the same tetrameric\nhemoglobin unit. This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell\nto release oxygen to tissues, with the associated oxygenâhemoglobin dissociation\ncurve therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is\nelevated in red blood cells, tissue hypoxia can occur.\n","linknr":381,"url":"Methemoglobinemia","recorded":1362482257,"links":29,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Red blood cell disorders","Autosomal recessive disorders"],"headings":["Pathophysiology","Types","Treatment","Symptoms","Carriers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sulfonamide","medicine"]],"members":["sulfonamide"],"related":["Methemoglobin","Blood","Hemoglobin","Oxygen–haemoglobin_dissociation_curve","Red_blood_cells","Tissue_hypoxia","Oxidative_stress","Ferrous","Heme","Ferric","Cytochrome-b5_reductase","Enzyme","White_people","Recessive_gene","Hemoglobin_h","Redox","Pyruvate_kinase_deficiency","NADH","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","NADPH","Benzocaine","Dapsone","Nitrate","Antibiotic","Trimethoprim","Sulfonamide_(medicine)","Dapsone","Local_anesthetic","Articaine","Prilocaine","Aniline","Metoclopramide","Chlorate","Bromate","Nitrates","Bismuth_nitrate","Blue-baby_syndrome","Benzocaine","Teething","Methylene_blue","Redox","Methemoglobin_reductase","Hexose_monophosphate_shunt","Cyanosis","Hazard,_Kentucky","Recessive_gene","Gene","Lurgan","Idiopathic","Republic_of_Ireland","Ascorbic_acid","Sodium_bicarbonate","Argyria","Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"]}
