{"cursor":"12858","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Subrogation' is the legal doctrine whereby one person takes over the rights or\nremedies of another against a third party. Rights of subrogation can\narise two different ways: either automatically as a matter of law, or by\nagreement as part of a contract. Subrogation by contract most\ncommonly arises in contracts of insurance. Subrogation as a matter of law is an\nequitable doctrine, and forms part of a wider body of law known as unjust\nenrichment. The two most common areas where subrogation is relevant are\ninsurance and sureties. In each case, the basic premise is that where one person\n(i.e. typically an insurer or a guarantor) makes a payment on an obligation\nwhich, in law, is the primary responsibility of another party, then the person\nmaking the payment is subrogated to the claims of the person to whom they made\nthe payment with respect to any claims or remedies which are exercisable against\nthe primarily responsible party. For example, if a car owner has collision\ninsurance http://www.irmi.com/online/insurance-glossary/terms/c/collision-\ninsurance.aspx on their car and the car is damaged by a negligent third\nparty, if the car owner elects to claim under his insurance policy, then any\nclaims which the car owner had against the negligent party will pass to the\ninsurance company in jurisdictions which recognise the doctrine. Similarly, if a\nfather guarantees the debts of his son to the bank (i.e. a contract of\nsuretyship), and the bank elects to call upon the guarantee rather than claiming\nagainst the son directly, then if the father pays out on the guarantee, he will\nbecome subrogated to the bank's claims against the son.\n\nThe doctrine of subrogation can also pass proprietary rights, i.e. a security\ninterest or claim to ownership of goods. If a work of art is stolen, and the\ninsurance company pays out under a policy of insurance to the owner, if the art\nis later recovered, then legally it will belong the insurance company under\nrights of subrogation. Similarly, if a ship is insured and then sinks, any\nrights of salve will pass to the insurer if the claim is paid out as a total\nloss. If a guarantee is paid out by a guarantor, but the bank also held a\nmortgage over the debtor's home, then the guarantor will be subrogated to the\nbank's rights as a mortgagee with respect to the debtor's home.\n\nIn the most common areas where subrogation arises as a matter of law, it will\nalso commonly be regulated in the terms of the relevant contract. For example,\nin a contract of guarantee, the guarantee will often provide that the guarantor\neither waives their right of subrogation, or agrees not to exercise it unless\nthe bank has completely been paid in full. In a contract of insurance, in\naddition to right of subrogation at law, there will often be a contractual right\nof subrogation which will be bolstered by the insured party agreeing that they\nwill provide all necessary assistance to the insurance company in pursuing any\nsubrogated claims.\n\nSubrogation is sometimes misunderstood by lay people and criticised on the basis\nthat payment under an insurance claim is simply a right based upon their\npayments of insurance premia, and a belief that they should also retain a right\nto exercise any claims arising from the insured event. However, an insurance\ncontract is a contract of indemnity, and to allow a party to receive insurance\nproceeds and claim against third parties would mean that they might recover more\nthan their total loss. Because subrogation operates to prevent such over-\nrecovery, it is considered to form part of the general law of unjust enrichment\n(i.e. preventing a party by being unjustly enriched by pursuing a claim for a\nloss in respect of which they have already been indemnified).\n\nSubrogation is an equitable remedy and is subject to all the usual limitations\nthat apply to equitable remedies.\n\nAlthough the basic concept is relatively straightforward, subrogation is\nconsidered to be a highly technical area of the law.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Subrogation","recorded":1374863705,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Law","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Contract","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Insurance","/wiki/Equity_(law)","/wiki/Unjust_enrichment","/wiki/Surety","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Loan_guarantee","/wiki/Security_interest","/wiki/Equitable_remedy","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","#Types_of_subrogation","#Indemnity_insurer.27s_subrogation_rights","#Surety.27s_subrogation_rights","#Subrogation_rights_against_trustees","#Lender.27s_subrogation_rights","#Banker.27s_subrogation_rights","#Remedies","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Trustee","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Surety","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Bill_of_exchange","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Security_interest","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Trustee","/wiki/Trust_law","/wiki/Beneficiary_(trust)","/wiki/Lien","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Trust_instrument","/wiki/Derivative_(finance)","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Ultra_vires","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Bank","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords","/wiki/Equitable_lien","/wiki/Damages","/wiki/Preferential_creditor","/wiki/Deductible","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Roger_Baron","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","http://thelawdictionary.org/subrogation/","#cite_ref-2","http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subrogation","#cite_ref-3","http://www.irmi.com/online/insurance-glossary/terms/c/collision-insurance.aspx","#cite_ref-4","http://www.adjustersinternational.com/AdjustingToday/ATfullinfo.cfm?start=2&page_no=2&pdfID=27","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0198259387","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","#cite_ref-13","#cite_ref-14","#cite_ref-15","/wiki/Lord_Goff","#cite_ref-16","/wiki/Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords","#cite_ref-17","#cite_ref-18","http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2004/2004-ohio-4886.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit&section=9","http://www.subrogation.org","http://www.subrolitigators.com","http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2004/2004-Ohio-4886.pdf","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&oldid=564818243","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Common_law","/wiki/Category:Insurance_law","/wiki/Category:Restitution","/wiki/Category:Insurance_terms","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_specifically_marked_weasel-worded_phrases_from_March_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Subrogation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Subrogation","/wiki/Subrogation","/wiki/Talk:Subrogation","#","/wiki/Subrogation","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Subrogation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Subrogation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&oldid=564818243","/w/index.php?title=Subrogation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q322768","/w/index.
