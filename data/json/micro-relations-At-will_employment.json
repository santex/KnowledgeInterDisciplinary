{"cursor":"22273","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'At-will employment' is a doctrine of American law that defines an employment\nrelationship in which either party can immediately terminate the relationship\nat any time with or without any advance warning, Jay Shepherd, Firing At\nWill: A Manager's Guide (New York: Apress Media, 2011), 3-4. and with no\nsubsequent liability, provided there was no express contract for a definite\nterm governing the employment relationship and that the employer does not\nbelong to a collective bargaining group (i.e., has not recognized a union).\nUnder this legal doctrine:\n\n\n\nIn a decision largely reaffirming employers' rights under the at-will doctrine\ntaken in October 5, 2000, the Supreme Court of California explained:\n\n\n\nSeveral statutory and judge-made exceptions to the doctrine exist, especially if\nunlawful discrimination is involved regarding the termination of an employee.\nHowever, in the USA at least, such exceptions are often considered to be\ncontentious; Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok have argued, in their macroeconomics\ntextbook, that employers become more reluctant to hire employees if they are\nuncertain about their ability to immediately fire them. Tyler Cowen and Alex\nTabarrok, Modern Principles: Macroeconomics (New York: Worth Publishers, 2010),\n202. In a 1992 study, the RAND Corporation concluded that imposing\nexceptions to at-will employment resulted in a long-term drop in aggregate\nemployment of two to five percent. Timothy Sandefur, The Right to Earn a\nLiving: Economic Freedom and the Law (Washington, D.C., Cato Institute, 2010),\n235â236.\n\nThe doctrine of at-will employment has been criticized as predicated upon flawed\nassumptions about the inherent distribution of power and information in the employee-\nemployer relationship, John W. Budd, Employment with a Human Face: Balancing\nEfficiency, Equity, and Voice (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2004),\n86â88. as well as for its brutal harshness upon employees. Clyde W.\nSummers, Employment At Will in the United States: The Divine Right of Employers,\n3 U. Pa. J. Lab. & Emp. L. 65 (2000). However, scholars in the field of\nlaw and economics such as Professors Richard A. Epstein Roger Blanpain,\nSusan Bison-Rapp, William R. Corbett, Hilary K. Josephs, & Michael J. Zimmer,\nThe Global Workplace: International and Comparative Employment Law â Cases and\nMaterials (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 101â102. and\nRichard Posner Richard Posner, Overcoming Law (Cambridge: Harvard University\nPress, 1995), 305â311. credit employment at will as a major factor\nunderlying the strength of the U.S. economy. At-will employment has also been\nstressed as a significant reason for the success of Silicon Valley as an entrepreneur-\nfriendly environment. Alan Hyde, Working in Silicon Valley: Economic and\nLegal Analysis of a High-Velocity Labor Market (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2003),\nxvi and 92â97. Hyde's book explores \"how high-velocity work practices contribute\nto economic growth,\" including and especially the dominant American high-\nvelocity work practice of at-will employment.\n\nAt-will employment disclaimers are a staple of employee handbooks in the United\nStates. It is common for employers to define what at-will employment means,\nexplain that an employeeâs at-will status cannot be changed except in a writing\nsigned by the company president (or chief executive), and require that an\nemployee sign an acknowledgment of his or her at-will status.\n","linknr":552,"url":"At-will_employment","recorded":1362572409,"links":23,"instances":["conflict_of_laws"],"pdf":["http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060322225959/http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf","http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf","http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf"],"categories":["Labor law of the United States","Human resource management","Ethically disputed business practices"],"headings":["Origins","Public policy exceptions","Implied contract exceptions","Covenant of good faith and fair dealing exceptions (aka. \"Implied-in-law\" Contracts)","Statutory exceptions","See also","Notes","External references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/At-will_employment_-_public_policy_exceptions.svg/250px-At-will_employment_-_public_policy_exceptions.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/At-will_employment_-_implied-contract_exceptions.svg/250px-At-will_employment_-_implied-contract_exceptions.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/At-will_employment_-_covenant-of-good-faith-and-fair-dealing_exceptions.svg/250px-At-will_employment_-_covenant-of-good-faith-and-fair-dealing_exceptions.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["public_policy_doctrine","conflict_of_laws"],["georgia","u.s._state"],["georgia","u.s._state"]],"members":["public_policy_doctrine","georgia"],"related":["Law_of_the_United_States","Trade_union","Supreme_Court_of_California","Tyler_Cowen","Alex_Tabarrok","Macroeconomics","RAND_Corporation","Cato_Institute","Clyde_Summers","Law_and_economics","Richard_Allen_Epstein","Richard_Posner","Silicon_Valley","Horace_Gray_Wood","U.S._state","California_Courts_of_Appeal","ARCO","Common_law","Statute_law","Probationary_period","Public_policy","Public_policy_doctrine_(conflict_of_laws)","District_of_Columbia","Alabama","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Louisiana","Maine","Nebraska","New_York","Rhode_Island","Florida","Delaware","Florida","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Indiana","Louisiana","Massachusetts","Missouri","Montana","North_Carolina","Pennsylvania","Rhode_Island","Texas","Virginia","Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","California","Delaware","Idaho","Massachusetts","Montana","Nevada","Utah","Wyoming","Just-cause","Wrongful_termination","Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963","Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964","Age_Discrimination_in_Employment_Act","1973_Rehabilitation_Act","Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990","National_Labor_Relations_Act","National_Labor_Relations_Board","National_Labor_Relations_Act","National_Labor_Relations_Board","National_Labor_Relations_Act","American_Red_Cross","Hyatt_Hotels","Unite_Here","Employment_Rights_Act_1996","Contracts_of_Employment_Act_1963","Employment_agency","European_Social_Charter","UK_agency_worker_law","Worker_Adjustment_and_Retraining_Notification_Act"]}
