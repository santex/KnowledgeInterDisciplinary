Parenting refers\n to the aspects of raising a child aside from the biological relationship.\n\nParenting is usually done by the biological parents of the child in\nquestion, although governments and society take a role as well. In\nmany cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent\nblood relations. Others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an\norphanage.\n","linknr":508,"url":"Parenting","recorded":1362486177,"links":58,"instances":["social_science","sociology"],"pdf":["http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/ETD/image/etd1359.pdf","http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/A_Fletcher_Parenting_2008.pdf","http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/A_Fletcher_Parenting_2008.pdf","http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV181.pdf","http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV181.pdf","http://www.ccl-cca.ca/pdfs/LessonsInLearning/Dec-13-07-Parenting-styles.pdf","http://www.wcss.wa.edu.au/pdf/importanceoftheplay_AAP.pdf","http://www.wcss.wa.edu.au/pdf/importanceoftheplay_AAP.pdf"],"categories":["Parenting|","Childhood"],"headings":["Factors that affect parenting decisions","Parenting styles","Views on parental roles and responsibilities in the United States","Stresses of role transition","Changes with the arrival of children","Parenting across the lifespan","Assistance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Nepalese-woman-with-baby.JPG/220px-Nepalese-woman-with-baby.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/TSgt_Pattee_meets_daughter.jpg/220px-TSgt_Pattee_meets_daughter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Father_and_child.jpg/220px-Father_and_child.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Parenting.JPG/220px-Parenting.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Maud_Humphrey_-_Maternal_cares.png/220px-Maud_Humphrey_-_Maternal_cares.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifestyle","sociology"],["identity","social_science"]],"members":["identity","lifestyle"],"related":["Physical_fitness","Emotion","Social_development","Intellectual_development","Child","Infant","Adult","Government","Society","Orphaned","Adoption","Foster_care","Orphanage","Social_class","Wealth","Income","Developmental_psychology","Diana_Baumrind","Parenting_styles","Child_development","Shared_Earning/Shared_Parenting_Marriage","Kerala","India","Family_planning","Reproductive_health","Pregnancy","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Pregnancy","Short-term_memory","Newborn","Crying","Pacifier","Breastfeeding","Attachment_in_children","Tantrum","Education","Child_discipline","Adolescence","Identity_(social_science)","Peer_group","Risk","Rebellious","Teenager","Childlessness","Empty_nest_syndrome","Family_law","Motherhood_constellation","Outline_of_children","Parental_alienation","Parental_supervision","Parenting_Coordinator","Parenting_practices","Parents_Helping_Parents","Pedagogy","Chaley_Scott"]}
