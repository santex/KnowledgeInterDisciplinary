For example it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter\nthan wire thickness.\n\nLength may be distinguished from height, which is vertical extent, and width or\nbreadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object\nat right angles to the length. Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas\narea is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of\nthree dimensions (length cubed).
