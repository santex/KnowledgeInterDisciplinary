{"cursor":"44842","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, the first genetically modified animal to be sold as a pet]] A 'genetically\nmodified organism' ('GMO') is an organism whose genetic material has been\naltered using genetic engineering techniques. Organisms that have been\ngenetically modified include micro-organisms such as bacteria and yeast,\ninsects, plants, fish, and mammals. GMOs are the source of genetically modified\nfoods, and are also widely used in scientific research and to produce goods\nother than food. The term GMO is very close to the technical legal term, 'living\nmodified organism' defined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which\nregulates international trade in living GMOs (specifically, \"any living organism\nthat possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through the use\nof modern biotechnology\").\n\nThis article focuses on what organisms have been genetically engineered, and for\nwhat purposes. The article on genetic engineering focuses on the history and\nmethods of genetic engineering, and on applications of genetic engineering and\nof GMOs. Both articles cover much of the same ground but with different\norganizations (sorted by organism in this article; sorted by application in the\nother). There are separate articles on genetically modified crops, genetically\nmodified food, regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms, and\ncontroversies.\n","linknr":970,"url":"Genetically_modified_organism","recorded":1362503647,"links":87,"instances":["medical","genetics","biology","genetics","genus"],"pdf":["http://www.ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/25239/1/018_33.pdf","http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/infosheets/bt.pdf","http://jag.igr.poznan.pl/2007-Volume-48/1/pdf/2007_Volume_48_1-47-60.pdf","http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ncmh/BGER/pdf/volume_25/11-Prather.pdf","http://www.idpublications.com/journals/pdfs/cimid/cimid_mostdown_1.pdf","http://pmbcii.psy.cmu.edu/evans/2006_Lia.pdf","http://pmbcii.psy.cmu.edu/evans/2006_Lia.pdf","http://www.oxitec.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OXITEC-Newsletter-March-11-Final.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-12-26/pdf/2012-31118.pdf","http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/events/event/gmo081203-m.pdf"],"categories":["Genetically
