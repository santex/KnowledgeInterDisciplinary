It is manifest as a\nfailure to express feelings either verbally or non-verbally, especially when\ntalking about issues that would normally be expected to engage the emotions.\nExpressive gestures are rare and there is little animation in facial expression\nor vocal inflection.\n\nBlunt affect \"can be symptomatic of schizophrenia, depression, or brain\ndamage\". D. and D. M. Sue, Foundations of Counselling and Psychotherapy\n(2007) p. 65 \"The difference between flat and blunted affect is in degree.\nA person with flat affect has no or nearly no emotional expression. He or she\nmay not react at all to circumstances that usually evoke strong emotions in\nothers. A person with blunted affect, on the other hand, has a significantly\nreduced intensity in emotional expression\". A. Tasman/W. K.
