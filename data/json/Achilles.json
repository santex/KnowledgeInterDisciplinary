{"cursor":"41335","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n Cymothoe: Attic red-figure kantharos from Volci (Cabinet des MÃ©dailles,\n BibliothÃ¨que nationale, Paris)]] In Greek mythology, 'Achilles' (, Akhilleus, )\n was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest\n warrior of Homer's [[Iliad]]. Achilles was said to be a demigod; his mother was\n the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.\n\nAchillesâ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan\nhero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not\npresented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of\nthe Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends\n(beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was\ninvulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a\nsmall wound in the heel, the term [[Achilles' heel]] has come to mean a person's\npoint of weakness.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Achilles","recorded":1372152429,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","mythology","ancient_greece","band","mythology","geographer","band","black_sea","mythology","mythology","actor","military","homer","son_of_amyntor","mythology","band","mythology","amazon","1931"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Characters
