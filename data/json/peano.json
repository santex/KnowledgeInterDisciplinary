The author of over 200\nbooks and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to\nwhich he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural\nnumbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made\nkey contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method\nof mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at\nthe University of Turin.\n","title":"Giuseppe%20Peano","headings":["Biography","Milestones and honors received","See also","Bibliography","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Italy","5: University_of_Turin","3: Cuneo","3: Piedmont","3: Turin","3: Accademia_dei_Lincei","3: Peano_axioms","2: Enrico_D'Ovidio","2: Angelo_Genocchi","2: Bertrand_Russell","2: Axiomatization","2: Infinitesimal_calculus","2: International_Congress_of_Mathematicians","1: Kingdom_of_Sardinia","1: Kingdom_of_Italy","1: Mathematics","1: Francesco_Faà_di_Bruno","1: Peano_existence_theorem","1: Formulario_mathematico","1: Latino_Sine_Flexione","1: Euclid","1: Gottlob_Frege","1: Giovanni_Vailati","1: Mathematician","1: Philosopher","1: Mathematical_logic","1: Set_theory","1: Natural_number","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Liceo_classico_Cavour","1: Luigi_Crosio","1: Space-filling_curve","1: Counterexample","1: Fractal","1: Formulario_Project","1: Zürich","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Paris","1: International_Conference_of_Philosophy","1: Mario_Pieri","1: Alessandro_Padoa","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Differential_equation","1: Latin","1: Interlingua","1: International_Auxiliary_Language_Association","1: Idiom_Neutral","1: Latino_sine_flexione","1: International_auxiliary_language","1: Myocardial_infarction","1: Order_of_Saints_Maurice_and_Lazarus","1: Order_of_the_Crown_of_Italy","1: Rome","1: Jean_van_Heijenoort","1: Ivor_Grattan-Guinness"]}
