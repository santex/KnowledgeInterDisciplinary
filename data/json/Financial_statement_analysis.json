{"cursor":"6015","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Financial statement analysis' (or 'financial analysis') the process of\nunderstanding the risk and profitability of a firm (business, sub-business or\nproject) through analysis of reported financial information, by using different\naccounting tools and techniques.\n\nFinancial statement analysis consists of 1) reformulating reported financial\nstatements, 2) analysis and adjustments of measurement errors, and 3) financial\nratio analysis on the basis of reformulated and adjusted financial statements.\nThe first two steps are often dropped in practice, meaning that financial ratios\nare just calculated on the basis of the reported numbers, perhaps with some\nadjustments. Financial statement analysis is the foundation for evaluating and\npricing credit risk and for doing fundamental company valuation.\n\n1) Financial statement analysis typically starts with reformulating the reported\n   financial information. In relation to the income statement, one common\n   reformulation is to divide reported items into recurring or normal items and\n   non-recurring or special items. In this way, earnings could be separated into\n   normal or core earnings and transitory earnings. The idea is that normal\n   earnings are more permanent and hence more relevant for prediction and\n   valuation. Normal earnings are also separated into net operational profit\n   after taxes (NOPAT) and net financial costs. The balance sheet is grouped,\n   for example, in net operating assets (NOA), net financial debt and equity.\n\n2) Analysis and adjustment of measurement errors question the quality of the\n   reported accounting numbers. The reported numbers can for example be a bad or\n   noisy representation of invested capital, for example in terms of NOA, which\n   means that the return on net operating assets (RNOA) will be a noisy measure\n   of the underlying profitability (the internal rate of return, IRR). Expensing\n   of R&D is an example when such investment expenditures are expected to yield\n   future economic benefits, suggesting that R&D creates assets which should\n   have been capitalized in the balance sheet. An example of an adjustment for\n   measurement errors is when the analyst removes the R&D expenses from the\n   income statement and put them in the balance sheet. The R&D expenditures are\n   then replaced by amortization of the R&D capital in the balance sheet.\n   Another example is to adjust the reported numbers when the analyst suspects\n   earnings management.\n\n3) Financial ratio analysis should be based on regrouped and adjusted financial\n   statements. Two types of ratio analysis are performed: 3.1) Analysis of risk\n   and 3.2) analysis of profitability:\n\n3.1) Analysis of risk typically aims at detecting the underlying credit risk of\n     the firm. Risk analysis consists of liquidity and solvency analysis.\n     Liquidity analysis aims at analyzing whether the firm has enough liquidity\n     to meet its obligations when they should be paid. A usual technique to\n     analyze illiquidity risk is to focus on ratios such as the current ratio\n     and interest coverage. Cash flow analysis is also useful. Solvency analysis\n     aims at analyzing whether the firm is financed so that it is able to\n     recover from a loss or a period of losses. A usual technique to analyze\n     insolvency risk is to focus on ratios such as the equity in percentage of\n     total capital and other ratios of capital structure. Based on the risk\n     analysis the analyzed firm could be rated, i.e. given a grade on the\n     riskiness, a process called synthetic rating.\n\nRatios of risk such as the current ratio, the interest coverage and the equity\npercentage have no theoretical benchmarks. It is therefore common to compare\nthem with the industry average over time. If a firm has a higher equity ratio\nthan the industry, this is considered less risky than if it is above the\naverage. Similarly, if the equity ratio increases over time, it is a good sign\nin relation to insolvency risk.\n\n3.2) Analysis of profitability refers to the analysis of return on capital, for\n     example return on equity, ROE, defined as earnings divided by average\n     equity. Return on equity, ROE, could be decomposed: ROE = RNOA + (RNOA -\n     NFIR) * NFD/E, where RNOA is return on net operating assets, NFIR is the\n     net financial interest rate, NFD is net financial debt and E is equity. In\n     this way, the sources of ROE could be clarified.\n\nUnlike other ratios, return on capital has a theoretical benchmark, the cost of\ncapital - also called the required return on capital. For example, the return on\nequity, ROE, could be compared with the required return on equity, kE, as\nestimated, for example, by the capital asset pricing model. If ROE  WACC, where WACC is the weighted average cost of capital), then the firm is\neconomically profitable at any given time over the period of ratio analysis. The\nfirm creates values for its owners.\n\nInsights from financial statement analysis could be used to make forecasts and\nto evaluate credit risk and value the firm's equity. For example, if financial\nstatement analysis detects increasing superior performance ROE - kE > 0 over the\nperiod of financial statement analysis, then this trend could be extrapolated\ninto the future. But as economic theory suggests, sooner or later the\ncompetitive forces will work - and ROE will be driven toward kE. Only if the\nfirm has a sustainable competitive advantage, ROE - kE > 0 in \"steady state\".\n","linknr":157,"url":"Financial_statement_analysis","recorded":1374547191,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Accountancy","/wiki/Accountant","/wiki/Accounting_period","/wiki/Accrual","/wiki/Bookkeeping","/wiki/Comparison_of_cash_and_accrual_methods_of_accounting","/wiki/Cash_flow_forecasting","/wiki/Chart_of_accounts","/wiki/Convergence_of_accounting_standards","/wiki/General_journal","/wiki/Special_journal","/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold","/wiki/Trade_credit","/wiki/Debits_and_credits","/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system","/wiki/Mark-to-market_accounting","/wiki/FIFO_and_LIFO_accounting","/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)","/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards","/wiki/Management_Accounting_Principles","/wiki/General_ledger","/wiki/Goodwill_(accounting)","/wiki/Historical_cost","/wiki/Matching_principle","/wiki/Revenue_recognition","/wiki/Trial_balance","/wiki/Cost_accounting","/wiki/Financial_accountancy","/wiki/Forensic_accounting","/wiki/Fund_accounting","/wiki/Management_accounting","/wiki/Tax_accounting_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Financial_statement","/wiki/Balance_sheet","/wiki/Cash_flow_statement","/wiki/Income_statement","/wiki/Statement_of_retained_earnings","/wiki/Notes_to_financial_statements","/wiki/Management_discussion_and_analysis","/wiki/XBRL","/wiki/Audit","/wiki/Auditor%27s_report","/wiki/Control_self-assessment","/wiki/Financial_audit","/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Auditing_Standards","/wiki/International_Standards_on_Auditing","/wiki/Internal_audit","/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act","/wiki/Certified_Internal_Auditor","/wiki/Chartered_Accountant","/wiki/Association_of_International_Accountants","/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant","/wiki/Chartered_Certified_Accountant","/wiki/Certified_General_Accountant","/wiki/Certified_Management_Accountant","/wiki/Certified_Accounting_Technician","/wiki/Association_of_Accounting_Technicians","/wiki/Certified_Fraud_Examiner","/wiki/Certified_Internal_Control_Auditors","/wiki/Association_of_Chartered_Certified_Accountants","/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Management_Accountants","/wiki/Chartered_Global_Management_Accountant","/wiki/Template:Accounting","/wiki/Template_talk:Accounting","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Accounting&action=edit","/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return","/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","#Associations","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Business_valuation","/wiki/Fundamental_analysis","/wiki/Financial_statement","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit&section=4","http://www.sfaf.com","http://www.aciia.org","http://www.effas.com","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&oldid=563978654","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Management_accounting","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Financial+statement+analysis&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Financial+statement+analysis","/wiki/Financial_statement_analysis","/wiki/Talk:Financial_statement_analysis","#","/wiki/Financial_statement_analysis","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Financial_statement_analysis&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:
