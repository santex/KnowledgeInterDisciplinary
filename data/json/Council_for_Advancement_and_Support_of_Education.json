{"cursor":"4664","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE)' is a nonprofit\nassociation of educational institutions. It serves professionals in the field of\neducational advancement. This field encompasses alumni relations,\ncommunications, marketing and development (fund-raising) for educational\ninstitutions such as universities and independent or private schools.\n\nCASE, headquartered in Washington, D.C., in the United States, was founded in\n1974 as the result of a merger between the 'American Alumni Council' and the\n'American College Public Relations Association'. It is one of the largest\ninternational associations of education institutions, serving nearly 3,400\nuniversities, colleges, schools, and related organizations in 61 countries.\n\nIts North American member institutions are divided into eight geographic\ndistricts that provide support to members through regional programs.

2007.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","recorded":1363351337,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Nonprofit_organization","/wiki/Educational_institution","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","#cite_note-bu-1","#Activities","#Major_awards_and_events","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Webinar","/wiki/Ethical_code","/wiki/Government_relations","#cite_note-bu-1","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Carnegie_Foundation_for_the_Advancement_of_Teaching","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-bu_1-0","#cite_ref-bu_1-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1576078604","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit&section=4","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i26/26a02702.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i15/15a01102.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i15/15a01001.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i26/26a00101.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i34/34c00301.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v51/i33/33c00201.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v51/i47/47a03003.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v51/i27/27a02701.htm","http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i10/10a03401.htm","http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,23476.shtml","http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2006-2007/111606Prof_of_Year.html","http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news763478.html","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit&section=5","http://www.case.org/","http://www.case.org/summit/","http://www.usprofessorsoftheyear.org/default.cfm","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&oldid=490892986","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Non-profit_organizations_based_in_Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Category:Educational_organizations_based_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Council+for+Advancement+and+Support+of+Education&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Council+for+Advancement+and+Support+of+Education","/wiki/Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","/wiki/Talk:Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","#","/wiki/Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&oldid=490892986","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&id=490892986","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Council+for+Advancement+and+Support+of+Education","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Council+for+Advancement+and+Support+of+Education&oldid=490892986&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Council_for_Advancement_and_Support_of_Education&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_At
