{"cursor":"30455","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn developmental biology, 'cellular differentiation' is the process by which a\nless specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type. Differentiation\noccurs numerous times during the development of a multicellular organism as the\norganism changes from a simple zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell\ntypes. Differentiation is a common process in adults as well: adult stem cells\ndivide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and\nduring normal cell turnover. Differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size,\nshape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals.\nThese changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene\nexpression. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never\ninvolves a change in the DNA sequence itself. Thus, different cells can have\nvery different physical characteristics despite having the same genome.\n\nA cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism\nis known as [[pluripotent]]. Such cells are called embryonic stem cells in\nanimals and meristematic cells in higher plants. A cell that is able to\ndifferentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as\n[[totipotent]]. In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are\ntotipotent, while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with\nsimple laboratory techniques. In cytopathology, the level of cellular\ndifferentiation is used as a measure of cancer progression. \"Grade\" is a marker\nof how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.\n","linknr":510,"url":"Cellular_differentiation","recorded":1362480599,"links":44,"instances":["protein","tumors","biology","genetics","biology","genetics","biology","biology","phylogenetics","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Developmental biology"],"headings":["Mammalian cell types","Dedifferentiation","Mechanisms","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Dedifferentiated_liposarcoma_-_intermed_mag.jpg/220px-Dedifferentiated_liposarcoma_-_intermed_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif/lossy-page1-600px-Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Cell_Differentiation.jpg/400px-Cell_Differentiation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["grading","tumors"],["egg","biology"],["basal","phylogenetics"],["regeneration","biology"],["induction","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["enhancer","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["smad","protein"]],"members":["smad","grading","tissue","transcription","regeneration","enhancer","induction","promoter","basal","cell","egg"],"related":["Developmental_biology","Cell_(biology)","Cell_type","Multicellular_organism","Zygote","Tissue_(biology)","Adult_stem_cell","Cell_division","Membrane_potential","Metabolism","Gene_expression","DNA","Genome","Embryonic_stem_cell","Meristem","Cell_type","Blastomere","Cytopathology","Cancer","Grading_(tumors)","Germ_cell","Somatic_cell","Stem_cell","Genome","Red_blood_cell","Diploid","Chromosome","Gametes","Sperm","Egg_(biology)","Blastocyst","Inner_cell_mass","Pluripotent","Multipotent","Progenitor_cell","Bone_marrow","Red_blood_cell","White_blood_cell","Platelet","Bone_marrow","Muscle_tissue","Arginine","Glycine","Asparagine","Serine","Gastrulation","Blastula","Germ_layer","Ectoderm","Mesoderm","Endoderm","Liposarcoma","Lipoblast","Blood_vessels","Adipose_tissue","H&E_stain","Basal_(phylogenetics)","Worm","Amphibian","Regeneration_(biology)","Cell_culture","Cancer","Reversine","Purine","Myotube","Osteoblast","Adipocyte","Cell_type","Gene_expression","Subset","Gene","Genome","Species","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Gene_regulatory_network","Systems_biology","Morphogenesis","Evolution","Cell_signaling","Growth_factor","Induction_(biology)","Asymmetric_cell_division","Cytokinesis","RNA","Genome","Gene","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Cis-regulatory_element","Trans-regulatory_element","Promoter_(biology)","Enhancer_(genetics)","Cell_division","Epigenetic","Mammalian","Stem_cells","Human","Induced_pluripotent_stem_cells","Embryonic_stem_cells","DNA_methylation","Adipose","Lung","Fibroblasts","OCT4","SOX2","KLF4","MYC","CpG_site","In_vitro","Transcription_(genetics)","Homeobox_protein_NANOG","Pluripotency","Chromatin","Histone_modification","Gene_silencing","PRC2","Polycomb-group_proteins","RNA_polymerase_II","DNA_methyltransferase","Apoptosis","Cell_signaling","Epigenome","Wnt_signaling_pathway","Beta-catenin","Growth_factors","Bone_morphogenetic_proteins","Transforming_growth_factors","Fibroblast_growth_factors","SMAD_(protein)","Leukemia_inhibitory_factor","Retinoic_acid","Notch_signaling","Sonic_hedgehog","Bmi1","Gli1","Gli2","Hedgehog_signaling_pathway"]}
