{"cursor":"3709","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn thermodynamics, the word 'endothermic' describes a process or reaction in\nwhich the system absorbs energy from its surroundings in the form of heat. It is\na modern coinage from Greek roots. The prefix endo- derives from the Greek word\n\"endon\" (á¼Î½Î´Î¿Î½) meaning \"within,\" and the latter part of the word comes from the\nGreek word root \"therm\" (Î¸ÎµÏÎ¼-) meaning \"hot.\" The intended sense is that of a\nreaction that depends on taking in heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an\nendothermic process is an exothermic process, one that releases, \"gives out\"\nenergy in the form of heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the\nprefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs. The term endothermic\nwas coined by Marcellin Berthelot (25 October 1827 â 18 March 1907).\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in physical sciences to, for example, chemical\nreactions, where thermal energy (heat) is converted to chemical bond energy.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Endothermic","recorded":1362512958,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thermochemistry","Thermodynamics","Chemical thermodynamics"],"headings":["Implications for chemical reactions","Contrast between thermodynamic and biological terminology","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Thermodynamics","Energy","Heat","Exothermic","Marcellin_Berthelot","Physical_sciences","Chemical_reactions","Thermal_energy","Bond_energy","Ice_pack","Metabolism","Ectotherm","Endotherm","Photosynthesis","Ice","Thermal_decomposition","Cation","Ammonium_chloride","Tritium","Lithium-7","Endothermic","Institute_for_Energy_and_Environmental_Research","Endergonic","Exothermic","Exergonic","Exergonic_reaction"]}
