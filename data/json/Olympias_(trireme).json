It is also a commissioned ship in the Greek\nnavy, the only commissioned vessel of its kind in any of the world's navies.\n\nShe was constructed from 1985 to 1987 by a shipbuilder in Piraeus. The ship was\nbuilt to drawings by the naval architect John F. Coates which he developed\nthrough long discussions with the historian J. S. Morrison following the\nlongest correspondence on any subject in The Times of London in the early\n1980s. The work was also advised by the classics teacher Charles Willink and\ndrew on evidence gained from Greek literature, history of art and archaeology\nabove and below water. Finance came from the Hellenic Navy and donors such as\nFrank Welsh (a Suffolk banker, writer and trireme enthusiast). Morrison, Coates\nand Willink founded the Trireme Trust with Welsh. The Trireme Trust is now\nchaired by Professor Boris Rankov, Professor of Classics at Royal Holloway\nUniversity of London.\n\nThe bronze bow ram weighed 200 kg. The ship was built from Oregon pine and\nVirginia oak. The keel is of iroko.\n\nThe important ''hypozomata'' (bracing ropes) had to be replaced by a steel rope\nas neither natural fibre ropes nor synthetic fibre ropes with about the same\nelastic modulus as hemp could be obtained. The steel hypozomata tension varied\nas the hull bent on waves, rather than exerting a substantially constant tension\nlike a natural fibre rope. This caused the alarming possibility of the rope\nbreaking and endangering the crew, so protective measures had to be\nfitted.

Olympias achieved a speed of 9 knots (17 km/h) and was able\nto execute 180 degree turns within one minute, in an arc no wider than two and a\nhalf (2.5) ship-lengths. These results, achieved with an inexperienced crew,\nsuggest that the ancient writers were not exaggerating about the capabilities of\nsuch vessels.\n\nOlympias was transported to Britain in 1993, to take part in events celebrating\nthe 2,500 years since the beginning of democracy. In 2004 Olympias was used to\ntransport the Olympic Flame ceremonially from the port of Keratsini to the main\nport of Piraeus, as the Olympic Torch Relay entered its final stages in the run-\nup to the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. She is now an exhibit in a dry\ndock in Faliron, Athens, Greece.\n\nA trireme of the classical period would have had a crew of 200, including five\nofficers. This would be made up of:\n\n*trierarchos ( \" \") â the commanding officer, responsible for supporting the\nship *kybernetes (ÎºÏÎ²ÎµÏÎ½Î®ÏÎ·Ï: ÎºÏÎ²ÎµÏÎ½Î¬Ï \"steer\") â executive
