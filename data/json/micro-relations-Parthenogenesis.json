In plants, parthenogenesis\nmeans development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component\nprocess of apomixis.\n\nGynogenesis and pseudogamy are closely related phenomena in which a sperm or\npollen triggers the development of the egg cell into an embryo but makes no\ngenetic contribution to the embryo. The rest of the cytology and genetics of\nthese phenomena are mostly identical to that of parthenogenesis.\n\nThe word parthenogenesis comes from the Greek ÏÎ±ÏÎ¸Î­Î½Î¿Ï, parthenos, meaning\n\"virgin\", and Î³Î­Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï, genesis, meaning \"birth\". Liddell, Scott, Jones. [ht-\ntp://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3Dge-\n/nesis Î³Î­Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï] A.II, A Greek-English Lexicon, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940.\nq.v.. The term is sometimes used inaccurately to describe reproduction\nmodes in hermaphroditic species that can reproduce by themselves because they\ncontain reproductive organs of both sexes in a single individual's body.\n\nParthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, some invertebrate animal\nspecies (including nematodes, water fleas, some scorpions, aphids, some bees,\nsome Phasmida, and parasitic wasps) and a few vertebrates (such as some fish, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-\ndyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201405.html \"Female Sharks Can Reproduce\nAlone, Researchers Find\"], Washington Post, Wednesday, May 23, 2007; Page\nA02 amphibians, reptiles, and very\nrarely birds ). This type of reproduction has been induced\nartificially in a few species including fish and amphibians.\n\nNormal egg cells form after meiosis and are haploid, with half as many\nchromosomes as their mother's body cells. Haploid individuals, however, are\nusually non-viable, and parthenogenetic offspring usually have the diploid\nchromosome number. Depending on the mechanism involved in restoring the diploid\nnumber of chromosomes, parthenogenetic offspring may have anywhere between all\nand half of the mother's alleles. The offspring having all of the mother's\ngenetic material are called 'full [[Cloning|clones]]' and those having only half\nare called '\"half clones\"'. Full clones are usually formed without meiosis. If\nmeiosis occurs, the offspring will get only a fraction of the mother's alleles.\n\nParthenogenetic offspring in species that use either the XY or the X0 sex-\ndetermination system have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use\nthe ZW sex-determination system, they have either two Z chromosomes (male) or\ntwo W chromosomes (mostly non-viable but rarely a female), or they could have\none Z and one W chromosome (female).\n","linknr":832,"url":"Parthenogenesis","recorded":1362480623,"links":59,"instances":["1973_film","house","doctor_who","mouse","film","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.zin.ru/Journals/compcyt/pdf/1/GavrilovKuznetsova.pdf","http://www.zin.ru/Journals/compcyt/pdf/1/GavrilovKuznetsova.pdf"],"categories":["Reproduction"],"headings":["Life history types","Types and mechanisms","Natural occurrence","Similar phenomena","In popular culture","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Cnemidophorus-ThreeSpecies.jpg/280px-Cnemidophorus-ThreeSpecies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Central_fusion_and_terminal_fusion_automixis.svg/280px-Central_fusion_and_terminal_fusion_automixis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Plumpollen0060.jpg/220px-Plumpollen0060.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Varanus_komodoensis5.jpg/220px-Varanus_komodoensis5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Parthenogenesis_-_Bischoff%2C_Steve_R_2010.tif/lossy-page1-400px-Parthenogenesis_-_Bischoff%2C_Steve_R_2010.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["kaguya","mouse"],["jurassic_park","novel"],["jurassic_park","film"],["partners_in_crime","doctor_who"],["joy_to_the_world","house"],["the_wicker_man","1973_film"]],"members":["the_wicker_man","joy_to_the_world","partners_in_crime","kaguya","jurassic_park","egg"],"related":["Cnemidophorus_inornatus","Cnemidophorus_tigris","Asexual_reproduction","Embryos","Fertilization","Plant","Gametophyte","Apomixis","Pseudogamy","Sperm","Pollen","Embryo","Cell_biology","Genetics","Greek_language","Virgin","Hermaphrodite","Invertebrate","Nematodes","Water_flea","Scorpion","Aphid","Bee","Phasmida","Parasitic_wasp","Vertebrate","Fish","Amphibians","Reptile","Bird","Meiosis","Haploid","Diploid","Allele","XY_sex-determination_system","X0_sex-determination_system","ZW_sex-determination_system","Bdelloidea","Aphid","Gall_wasps","Rotifers","Cladocerans","Daphnia","Thelytoky","Arrhenotoky","Gametophyte","Meiosis","Ants","Blastomeres","Self-fertilization","Anaphase_I","Sister_chromatids","Aphid","XY_sex-determination_system","ZW_sex-determination_system","Endoreplication","Aphid","Rotifer","Nematode","Komodo_dragon","Hammerhead_shark","Blacktip_shark","Asexual_reproduction","Animal_cloning","Cell_nucleus","Diploid","Mitosis","Thelytoky","Arrhenotoky","Hymenopteran","Pseudogamy","Strepsiptera","Egg_(biology)","Haplodiploidy","Hymenopteran","Honey_bee","Diploid","Parasitic_wasp","Formicinae","Electric_ants","Water_flea","Decapoda","Crustaceans","Marmorkrebs","Crayfish","Fishkeeping","Rotifers","Turbellaria","Phylum","Platyhelminthes","Polyploid","Sperm","Pseudogamous","Thiaridae","Cnemidophorus","Lepidodactylus_lugubris","Darevskia","Ramphotyphlops_braminus","Komodo_dragon","Boa_constrictor","Ramphotyphlops_braminus","Cnemidophorus_neomexicanus","Polyploid","Aspidoscelis","Fecundity","Lesser_Caucasus","Komodo_dragon","Bonnethead","Hammerhead_shark","Henry_Doorly_Zoo","Stingray","White-spotted_bamboo_shark","Belle_Isle_Aquarium","Blacktip_shark","XY_sex-determination_system","Zebra_shark","Giraldus_Cambrensis","Barnacle_Goose","Haploid","Diploid","Homogametic_sex","Gregory_Goodwin_Pincus","Rabbit","Internet_Archive","Tokyo_University_of_Agriculture","Kaguya_(mouse)","MEG3","Longevity","Mouse","Monkey","Genomic_imprinting","Placenta","Embryonic_stem_cells","International_Stem_Cell_Corporation","Elena_Revazova","Human_leukocyte_antigen","DNA","Haplotype","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Hwang_Woo-Suk","Oomycetes","Oospore","Sperm","Salamander","Amazon_molly","Jurassic_Park_(novel)","Chaos_theory","Jurassic_Park_(film)","Doctor_Who","Partners_in_Crime_(Doctor_Who)","Mass_Effect","Joy_to_the_World_(House)","House_MD","Shriekback","The_Wicker_Man_(1973_film)","When_It_Changed","Joanna_Russ","Apomixis","Arrhenotoky","Miraculous_births","Parthenocarpy","Thelytoky","Charles_Bonnet","Jacques_Loeb","Sea_urchin","Gregory_Goodwin_Pincus"]}
