Currently edited by Alan Rusbridger, it has\ngrown from a 19th-century local paper to a national paper associated with a\ncomplex organisational structure and international multimedia and web presence.\nIts sister papers include [[The Observer]] (British Sunday paper) and [[The\nGuardian Weekly]].\n\nThe Guardian in paper form had a certified average daily circulation of 204,222,\nbehind The Daily Telegraph and The Times, but ahead of The Independent. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jan/11/guardian-\ntelegraph-financial-times-december-abcs The Guardian, 11 January 2013.]\nThe newspaper's online offering is the second most popular British newspaper\nwebsite, behind the [[Daily Mail]]'s Mail Online.\n\nFounded in 1821 by John Edward Taylor in Manchester with backing from the non-\nconformist Little Circle group of local businessmen, The Manchester Guardian\nreplaced the radical [[Manchester Observer]], which championed the Peterloo\nprotesters. The paper currently identifies with social liberalism. In the last\nUK general election in 2010 the paper supported the Liberal Democrats, who\nwent on to form a coalition government with the Conservatives. The paper is\ninfluential in the design and publishing arena, sponsoring many awards in\nthese areas.\n\nThe Guardian has changed format and design over the years, moving from\nbroadsheet to Berliner. It has become an international media organisation with\naffiliations to other national papers with similar aims. The Guardian Weekly,\nwhich circulates worldwide, contains articles from The Guardian and its sister\nSunday paper The Observer, as well as reports, features and book reviews from\n[[The Washington Post]] and articles translated from [[Le Monde]]. Other\nprojects include GuardianFilm, the current editorial director of which is\nMaggie O'Kane.\n\nOne notable scoop was the breaking of the News International phone hacking\nscandal in 2011, particularly with the revelation of the hacking of murdered\nteenager Milly Dowler's phone. http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/tim-de-lisle/can-\nguardian-survive?page=0%2C2 The investigation brought about the closure of\none of the highest circulation newspapers in the world, the [[News of the World]].
