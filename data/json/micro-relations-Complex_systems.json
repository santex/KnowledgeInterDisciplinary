Complex systems is\na new approach to science that studies how relationships between parts give rise\nto the collective behaviors of a system and how the system interacts and forms\nrelationships with its environment.\n\nThe equations from which complex system models are developed generally derive\nfrom statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics, and\nrepresent organized but unpredictable behaviors of systems of nature that are\nconsidered fundamentally complex. The physical manifestations of such systems\ncannot be defined, so the usual choice is to refer to \"the system\" as the\nmathematical information model, without referring to the undefined physical\nsubject the model represents. One of a variety of journals using this approach\nto complexity is [[Complex Systems (journal)|Complex Systems]].\n\nSuch systems are used to model processes in computer science,\nbiology, Chapouthier, G, Mosaic structures â a working hypothesis for the\ncomplexity of living organisms, E-Logos (Electronic Journal for Philosophy),\n2009, 17, http://nb.vse.cz/kfil/elogos/biocosmology/chapouthier09.pdf\neconomics, physics, chemistry, J. M. Zayed, N. Nouvel, U. Rauwald, O.

It is also called complex systems theory, complexity\nscience, study of complex systems, sciences of complexity, non-equilibrium\nphysics, and historical physics. A variety of abstract theoretical complex\nsystems is studied as a field of mathematics.\n\nThe key problems of complex systems are difficulties with their formal modelling\nand simulation. From such a perspective, in different research contexts complex\nsystems are defined on the basis of their different attributes. Since all\ncomplex systems have many interconnected components, the science of networks and\nnetwork theory are important aspects of the study of complex systems. A\nconsensus regarding a single universal definition of [[complex system]] does not\nyet exist.\n\nFor systems that are less usefully represented with equations various other\nkinds of narratives and methods for identifying, exploring, designing and\ninteracting with complex systems are used.\n","linknr":531,"url":"Complex_systems","recorded":1362476890,"links":42,"instances":["based_on_eci_estimates","software","colombia"],"pdf":["http://nb.vse.cz/kfil/elogos/biocosmology/chapouthier09.pdf","http://www.unites.uqam.ca/philo/pdf/Caldwell_2003-01.pdf","http://csis.org/files/publication/090410_Organizing_for_a_Complex_World_The_Way_Ahead_0.pdf","http://predictivemodeler.com/sitecontent/book/Ch06_Applications/Actuarial/HEC_Model/Healthcare%20Exchange%20Complexity%20Model%20-%20Report%20-%20Aug2011.pdf","http://amaral.northwestern.edu/Publications/Papers/Amaral-2004-Eur.Phys.J.B-38-147.pdf","http://www.oeaw.ac.at/byzanz/repository/Preiser_WorkingPapers_Calculating_I.pdf"],"categories":["Complex
