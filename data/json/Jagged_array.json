{"cursor":"2018","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer programming, an 'Iliffe vector', also known as a 'display', is a\ndata structure used to implement multi-dimensional arrays. An Iliffe vector for\nan n-dimensional array (where n > 2) consists of a vector (or 1-\ndimensional array) of pointers to an (n â 1)-dimensional array. They\nare often used to avoid the need for expensive multiplication operations when\nperforming address calculation on an array element. They can also be used to\nimplement triangular arrays, or other kinds of irregularly shaped arrays. The\ndata structure is named after John K. Iliffe,\n\nTheir disadvantages include the need for multiple chained pointer indirections\nto access an element, and the extra work required to determine the next row in\nan n-dimensional array to allow an optimising compiler to prefetch it. Both of\nthese are a source of delays on systems where the CPU is significantly faster\nthan main memory.\n\nThe Iliffe vector for a 2-dimensional array is simply a vector of pointers to\nvectors of data, i.e., the Iliffe vector represents the columns of an array\nwhere each column element is a pointer to a row vector.\n\nMultidimensional arrays in languages such as Java, Python (multidimensional\nlists), Ruby, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, Objective-C, and Atlas Autocode are\nimplemented as Iliffe vectors.\n\nIliffe vectors are contrasted with dope vectors in languages such as Fortran,\nwhich contain the stride factors and offset values for the subscripts in each\ndimension.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Jagged_array","recorded":1362540260,"links":13,"instances":["programming_language","computer_programming","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arrays"],"headings":["Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/LampFlowchart.svg/22px-LampFlowchart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pointer","computer_programming"],["java","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"]],"members":["python","pointer","java","ruby"],"related":["Computer_programming","Data_structure","Array_data_structure","Pointer_(computer_programming)","Triangular_array","John_K._Iliffe","Java_(programming_language)","Python_(programming_language)","Ruby_(programming_language)","Perl","PHP","JavaScript","Objective-C","Atlas_Autocode","Dope_vector"]}
