(engraving date unknown)]]\n\n'Publishing' is the process of production and dissemination of literature,\nmusic, or information â the activity of making information available to the\ngeneral public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning:\noriginators and developers of content also provide media to deliver and display\nthe content for the same. Also, the word publisher can refer to the individual\nwho leads a publishing company or imprint or to a person who owns a magazine.\n\nTraditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as\nbooks (the \"book trade\") and newspapers. With the advent of digital information\nsystems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include\nelectronic resources, such as the electronic versions of books and periodicals,\nas well as micropublishing, websites, blogs, video game publishers and the like.\n\nPublishing includes the stages of the development, acquisition, copyediting,\ngraphic design, production â printing (and its electronic equivalents), and\nmarketing and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books, literary works,\nmusical works, software and other works dealing with information, including the\nelectronic media.\n\nPublication is also important as a legal concept: #As the process of giving\nformal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to marry or\nenter bankruptcy; #As the essential precondition of being able to claim\ndefamation; that is, the alleged libel must have been published, and #For\ncopyright purposes, where there is a difference in the protection of published\nand unpublished works.\n\nThere are three different categories in which publication house can be divided\n#Non-Paid Publishers : The term non-paid publisher refers to those publication\nhouses which do not charge author at all to publish the book. #Semi-Paid\nPublishers : Publication houses that charge partially the author in order to\nmeet the expenses of the book. Author has full right to claim 50% of the copies\nprinted in case author has met with the burden of paying 50% of the total amount\nto get the books published. #Paid Publishers : These days paid publication has\nbecome very common, here the author has to meet with the total expense to get\nthe book published and author has full right to set up marketing policies.\n","linknr":537,"url":"published","recorded":1362897657,"links":58,"instances":["book_publishing","media_and_publishing","publishing","business","communication","journalism","setting","book"],"pdf":["http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf","http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf"],"categories":["Publishing|*"],"headings":["The
