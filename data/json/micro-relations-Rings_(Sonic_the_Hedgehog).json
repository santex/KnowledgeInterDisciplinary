The\nfranchise centers on a series of platform games, but several are spin-offs in\ndifferent genres. The protagonist of the series is a blue hedgehog named Sonic\nthe Hedgehog, whose peaceful life is often interrupted by the series's main\nantagonist, Doctor Eggman. Sonic usually must stop Eggman and foil any plans of\nworld domination. The first game in the series, published in 1991, was conceived\nby Sega's Sonic Team division after Sega requested a mascot character; the title\nwas a success and spawned sequels, and transformed Sega into a leading video\ngame company during the 16-bit era in the early to mid-1990s.\n\nSonic Team has since developed many titles in the franchise. Prominent members\nof its initial staff included Naka, designer Naoto Ohshima and game planner\nHirokazu Yasuhara. Other developers of Sonic games have included the American\nSega Technical Institute, Japanese Dimps, Canadian BioWare, and British\nTraveller's Tales. While the first games in the series were platform games, the\nseries has expanded into other genres such as action-adventure, fighting,\nracing, role-playing, and sports.\n","linknr":1719,"url":"Rings_(Sonic_the_Hedgehog)","recorded":1362687858,"links":43,"instances":["pharmacy","series","2006_video_game","musician","fourth_generation","band","media","device","video_gaming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Video
