However, many variations at the genetic\nlevel result in little or no observable variation.\n\nMost multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes, that is, they are\ndiploid. These chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Diploid\norganisms have one copy of each gene (and therefore one allele) on each\nchromosome. If both alleles are the same, they are homozygotes. If the alleles\nare different, they are heterozygotes.\n\nA population or species of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each\nlocus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as\nthe number of alleles (polymorphism) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes\nin the population.\n\nFor example, at the gene locus for the ABO blood type carbohydrate antigens in\nhumans,<ref name=\"<ref name=\"OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan\"/> classical\ngenetics recognizes three alleles, I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and\nI<sup>O</sup>, that determine compatibility of blood transfusions. Any\nindividual has one of six possible genotypes (AA, AO, BB, BO, AB, and OO) that\nproduce one of four possible phenotypes: \"A\" (produced by AA homozygous and AO\nheterozygous genotypes), \"B\" (produced by BB homozygous and BO heterozygous\ngenotypes), \"AB\" heterozygotes, and ″O″ homozygotes. It is now known that each\nof the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with\ndifferent DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more\nthan 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus.<ref name=\"Sequence variation at the\nhuman ABO locus\"/> An individual with \"Type A\" blood may be an AO heterozygote,\nan AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different ″A″ alleles.\n\nThe word \"allele\" is a short form of allelomorph (″other form″), which was used\nin the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of a gene detected as\ndifferent phenotypes. It derives from the Greek prefix ἀλλήλ- [″allel-″],\nmeaning \"reciprocal\" or \"each other\", which itself is related to the Greek\nadjective ἄλλος (allos; cognate with Latin ″alius″), meaning \"other\".\n","title":"allele","headings":["Dominant and recessive alleles","Allele and genotype frequencies","Allelic variation in genetic disorders","See also","References and notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Gene","2: Recessive","1: Phenotypic_trait","1: Multicellular_organism","1: Chromosome","1: Diploid","1: Homologous_chromosome","1: Homozygote","1: Heterozygote","1: Population","1: Species","1: ABO","1: Blood_type","1: Carbohydrate","1: Antigen","1: Blood_transfusion","1: Genotype","1: Phenotype","1: Allelomorph","1: Genetics","1: Phenotypes","1: Gregor_Mendel","1: Quantitative_trait_locus","1: Wild_type","1: Drosophila_melanogaster","1: Mutant","1: Genetic_diseases","1: Genetic_carrier","1: Hardy-Weinberg_principle","1: Genetic_disorders","1: Albinism","1: Cystic_Fibrosis","1: Galactosemia","1: Phenylketonuria","1: Tay-Sachs_Disease","1: Hemizygosity","1: Color_blindness","1: Fragile_X_syndrome","1: Huntington_disease","1: Allozyme","1: Evolution","1: Genealogical_DNA_test","1: Haplo-sufficiency","1: Meiosis","1: Mendelian_error","1: Mendelian_inheritance","1: Mitosis","1: Punnett_square"]}
