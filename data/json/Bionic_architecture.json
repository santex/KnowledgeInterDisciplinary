{"cursor":"1655","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bionic architecture' is a movement for the design and construction of\nexpressive buildings whose layout and lines borrow from natural (i.e.\nbiological) forms. The movement began to mature in the early 21st century, and\nthus in early designs research was stressed over practicality. Bionic\narchitecture sets itself in opposition to traditional rectangular layouts and\ndesign schemes by using curved forms and surfaces reminiscent of structures in\nbiology and fractal mathematics. One of the tasks set themselves by the\nmovement's early pioneers was the development of aesthetic and economic\njustifications for their approach to architecture.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Bionic_architecture","recorded":1362504032,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Architecture","Biotechnology"],"headings":["Related terms","Architects of Bionic architecture","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Column_impost.svg/34px-Column_impost.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fractal","Bionics","Eco-tech","Organi-tech","Bio-tech","Biourbanism","Greg_Lynn","Bates_Smart","Nicholas_Grimshaw","Santiago_Calatrava","Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank","Ken_Yeang","Daniel_Libeskind","Jan_Kaplick√Ω","Megaproject","Simon_Rastorguev"]}
