[http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/hydrophilic Merriam-Webster dictionary] Hydrophilic\nsubstances can seem to attract water out of the air, the way salts (which are\nhydrophilic) do. Sugar, too, is hydrophilic, and like salt is sometimes used to\ndraw water out of foods.\n\nThis is thermodynamically favorable, and makes these molecules soluble not only\nin water but also in other polar solvents. There are hydrophilic and hydrophobic\nparts of the cell membrane.\n\nA hydrophilic molecule or portion of a molecule is one that is typically charge-\npolarized and capable of hydrogen bonding, enabling it to dissolve more readily\nin water than in oil or other hydrophobic solvents. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic\nmolecules are also known as polar molecules and nonpolar molecules,\nrespectively. Some hydrophilic substances do not dissolve. This type of mixture\nis called a colloid. Soap, which is amphipathic, has a hydrophilic head and a\nhydrophobic tail, allowing it to dissolve in both waters and oils.\n\nAn approximate rule of thumb for hydrophilicity of organic compounds is that\nsolubility of a molecule in water is more than 1 mass % if there is at least one\nneutral hydrophile group per 5 carbons, or at least one electrically charged\nhydrophile group per 7 carbons.
