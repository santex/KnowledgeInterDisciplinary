He was the\nprofessional of Antoinette Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, and he was also a member of the Algonquin Round\nTable. [http://algonquinroundtable.org/members.html Members of the Algonquin\nRound Table] and\n\nPemberton was born in Leavenworth, Kansas and attended the University of Kansas,\nbefore becoming a press agent in New York City. Later, Pemberton directed and\nproduced the American premiere of Luigi Pirandello's [[Six Characters in Search\nof an Author]] in 1922, [http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9143 \"Six\nCharacters in Search of an Author\" (1922)] on IBDB.com as well as its\nfirst Broadway revival. [http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9473\"Six\nCharacter in Search of an Author\" (1924)] on IBDB.com In 1929 he produced\nand directed Preston Sturges' play [[Strictly Dishonorable (play)|Strictly\nDishonorable]], which was filmed twice, in 1931 and again in 1951.\n\nAmong his other productions was [[Miss Lulu Bett]], whose writer Zona Gale\nbecame the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in Drama, [[Personal\nAppearance]] by Lawrence Riley, which was a Broadway hit and was later turned\ninto the film [[Go West, Young Man]] and [[Harvey (play)|Harvey]], Mary Chase's\nplay about a man whose best friend is a large imaginary rabbit, later made into\na film starring Jimmy Stewart.\n\nPemberton gave the Antoinette Perry Award its nickname, the Tony. As Perry's\nofficial biography at the Tony Awards website states, \"At\n[ Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion,\n[Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and\ntechnical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award,\nhe called it a Tony. The name stuck.\n\nMonths after his death in 1950, a Tony Award was given to him posthumously\nin recognition of his role as the founder and the original chairman of the\nTony Awards.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Brock_Pemberton","recorded":1374539417,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Brock_Pemberton_(baseball)","/wiki/File:Brock_pemberton.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Brock_pemberton.jpg","/wiki/File:Brock_pemberton.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Theatrical_producer","/wiki/Theatre_director","/wiki/Tony_Awards","/wiki/Antoinette_Perry","/wiki/American_Theatre_Wing","#cite_note-tony-1","/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Leavenworth,_Kansas","/wiki/University_of_Kansas","/wiki/Press_agent","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Luigi_Pirandello","/wiki/Six_Characters_in_Search_of_an_Author","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Preston_Sturges","/wiki/Strictly_Dishonorable_(play)","/wiki/Strictly_Dishonorable_(1931_film)","/wiki/Strictly_Dishonorable_(1951_film)","/wiki/Miss_Lulu_Bett","/wiki/Zona_Gale","/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize","/wiki/Personal_Appearance","/wiki/Lawrence_Riley","/wiki/Broadway_theatre","/wiki/Go_West,_Young_Man","/wiki/Harvey_(play)","/wiki/Mary_Chase","/wiki/Harvey_(film)","/wiki/Jimmy_Stewart","/wiki/Warner_Bros.","#cite_note-tony-1","/wiki/Tony_Award","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-tony_1-0","#cite_ref-tony_1-1","http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/perry.html","#cite_ref-2","http://algonquinroundtable.org/members.html","#cite_ref-3","http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9143","/wiki/IBDB.com","#cite_ref-4","http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=9473","/wiki/IBDB.com","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit&section=2","http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=15851","/wiki/Internet_Broadway_Database","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0671465/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/16609594","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:P_culture.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/P_culture.svg/35px-P_culture.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Theat-bio-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Theat-bio-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Theat-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&oldid=562894967","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1885_births","/wiki/Category:1950_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Leavenworth,_Kansas","/wiki/Category:University_of_Kansas_alumni","/wiki/Category:American_theatre_managers_and_producers","/wiki/Category:Tony_Awards","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brock+Pemberton&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brock+Pemberton","/wiki/Brock_Pemberton","/wiki/Talk:Brock_Pemberton","#","/wiki/Brock_Pemberton","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Brock_Pemberton","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Brock_Pemberton","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&oldid=562894967","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Pemberton&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4972745","/w/index.php?title=Spec
