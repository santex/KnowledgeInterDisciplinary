{"cursor":"3754","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fine bubble diffusers' are a pollution control technology used to aerate\nwastewater for sewage treatment. They produce a plethora of very small air\nbubbles which rise slowly from the floor of a wastewater treatment plant or\nsewage treatment plant aeration tank and provide substantial and efficient mass\ntransfer of oxygen to the water. The oxygen, combined with the food source,\nsewage, allows the bacteria to produce enzymes which help break down the waste\nso that it can settle in the secondary clarifiers or be filtered by membranes. A\nfine bubble diffuser is commonly manufactured in various forms: tube, disc,\nplate, and dome.
