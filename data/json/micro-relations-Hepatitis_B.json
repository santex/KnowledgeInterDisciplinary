Originally\nknown as \"serum hepatitis\", the disease has caused\nepidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. About a third of the world population has been\ninfected at one point in their lives, including\n350 million who are chronic carriers.\n\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids such as\nsemen and vaginal fluids, while viral DNA has been detected in the saliva,\ntears, and urine of chronic carriers. Perinatal infection is a major route of\ninfection in endemic (mainly developing) countries. Other risk\nfactors for developing HBV infection include working in a healthcare setting,\ntransfusions, dialysis, acupuncture, tattooing, extended overseas travel, and\nresidence in an institution. However, viruses cannot be spread by holding hands,\nsharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, kissing, hugging, coughing,\nsneezing, or breastfeeding.\n\nThe acute illness causes liver inflammation, vomiting, jaundice, and, rarely,\ndeath. Chronic may eventually cause cirrhosis and liver cancerâa disease with\npoor response to all but a few current therapies.\nThe infection is preventable by vaccination.\n\n virus is a hepadnavirusâhepa from hepatotropic (attracted to the liver) and dna\n because it is a DNA virus âand it has a circular genome of\n partially double-stranded DNA. The viruses replicate through an RNA\n intermediate form by reverse transcription, which in practice relates them to\n retroviruses. Although replication takes place in the\n liver, the virus spreads to the blood where viral proteins and antibodies\n against them are found in infected\n people.
