{"cursor":"98966","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n culture, ca. 1200 BC, language unknown, but before the estimated window of Proto-\n Germanic, and therefore possibly Pre-Proto-Germanic. This region was included\n in the range of subsequent Iron-Age cultures undoubtedly speaking Proto-\n Germanic.]]\n\n'Proto-Germanic' (often abbreviated 'PGmc.'), 'Common Germanic' or 'Ur-\nGermanic', as it is sometimes known, is the unattested, reconstructed proto-\nlanguage of all the Germanic languages, including English. Another, less\ncommon name used in English-language literature by a few noteworthy scholars is\n'(Primitive) [[Germanic Parent Language]]'. For example, see  By\ndefinition, Proto-Germanic is the stage of the language constituting the most\nrecent common ancestor of the attested Germanic languages. Proto-Germanic is\nitself descended from Proto-Indo-European (PIE).\n\nAlthough Proto-Germanic was reconstructed as a node in the tree model of\nlanguage development, its main innovations must have followed a logical and\ntherefore a chronological sequence, leading to the hypothesis that, over its\nestimated life of nearly one thousand years, roughly 500 BC to 500, it underwent\nphases of development. Each phase but the last featured some, but not all, of\nthe common innovations. Moreover, the final phases, and perhaps the initial,\nwere already divided into dialects, some of which would lead to distinct\nlanguages, which began at the point of mutual unintelligibility. That point is\noften difficult to determine, and as such there may have never been any uniform\nProto-Germanic.\n\nThe Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any surviving texts but\nhas been reconstructed using the comparative method. However, a few surviving\ninscriptions in a runic script from Scandinavia, the Vimose inscriptions, dated\nto c. 200, may represent a stage of Proto-Norse or, according to Bernard Comrie,\nlate Common Germanic immediately following the \"Proto-Germanic\" stage.\n\nWords in Proto-Germanic written in this article are [[transcription\n(linguistics)|transcribed]] using the system described below
