The lab was established in 1970 and its operations since\nthen have been funded jointly; mainly by the United States Department of\nEnergy, the University of Rochester and the New York State government. The\nLaser Lab was commissioned to serve as a center for investigations of high-\nenergy physics, specifically those involving the interaction of extremely\nintense laser radiation with matter. Many types of scientific experiments are\nperformed at the facility with a strong emphasis on inertial confinement,\ndirect drive, laser-induced fusion using OMEGA, currently the world's highest-\nenergy ultraviolet laser. The lab shares its building with the Center for\nOptoelectronics and Imaging and the Center for Optics Manufacturing. A new\naddition, the Robert L. Sproull Center for Ultra High Intensity Laser Research,\nwas opened in 2005 and houses the OMEGA EP laser, which was completed in May\n2008. During summer months the lab sponsors a program for high school students\nwhich involves local-area high school juniors in the research being done at the\nlaboratory. Most of the projects are done on current research that is led by\nsenior scientists at the lab.\n","title":"Laboratory%20for%20Laser%20Energetics","headings":["LLE OMEGA laser facility","LLE OMEGA EP laser system","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Brighton,_Monroe_County,_New_York","2: United_States_Department_of_Energy","2: University_of_Rochester","2: National_Ignition_Facility","1: United_States","1: MIT_Plasma_Science_and_Fusion_Center","1: State_University_of_New_York_at_Geneseo","1: University_of_Nevada,_Reno","1: University_of_WisconsinâMadison","1: New_York","1: Laser","1: Radiation","1: Inertial_fusion_energy","1: Nuclear_fusion","1: Ultraviolet","1: Robert_L._Sproull","1: Nonlinear_optics","1: List_of_laser_types","1: Kilojoule","1: Nova_laser","1: Neutrons","1: Fast_ignition"]}
