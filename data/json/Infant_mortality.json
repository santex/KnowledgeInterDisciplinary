National\nstatistics tend to group these two mortality rates together. Globally, ten\nmillion infants and children die each year before their fifth birthday. Ninety-\nnine percent of these deaths occur in developing nations. Infant mortality takes\naway societyâs potential physical, social, and human capital.\n\nGenerally the most common cause worldwide has been dehydration from\ndiarrhea, a preventable disease; however, a variety of programs combating\nthis problem have decreased the rate of children dying from dehydration.\nMany factors contribute to infant mortality such as the motherâs level of\neducation, environmental conditions, and political and medical\ninfrastructure. Improving sanitation, access to clean drinking water,\nimmunization against infectious diseases, and other public health measures\ncould help reduce high rates of infant mortality. The U.S. National\nInstitute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) has made great strides\nin lowering U.S. infant mortality rates. http://www.nichd.nih.gov>\nSince the institute was created the U.S. infant mortality rate has dropped\n70 percent, in part due to their research.\n","linknr":938,"url":"Infant_mortality","recorded":1362373540,"links":53,"instances":["classification_of_humans","medicine","human_geography"],"pdf":["http://www.nationalhealthystart.org/site/assets/docs/Infant%20Mortality%20Low%20Birthweight.pdf","http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v053/53.4king02.pdf","http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v053/53.4king02.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2001/monitoring/fp_monitoring_2001_a1_frep_01_en.pdf","http://www.nber.org/papers/w16133.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/SchadySmitz_080509.pdf"],"categories":["Population","Infancy|Mortality","Demography","Children and death","Public health"],"headings":["Infant mortality rate","Causes","Measuring IMR","Societal infrastructure","Comparing infant mortality rates","Prevention and intervention","See also","Other meanings","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Mort.svg/300px-Mort.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["catchment_area","human_geography"],["race","classification_of_humans"],["chronic","medicine"]],"members":["race","chronic","catchment_area"],"related":["Mortality","Developing_nations","Dehydration","Diarrhea","Sanitation","Immunization","Infectious_diseases","Neonatal","Perinatal_mortality","Infections","Premature_births","Asphyxia","Low_birth_weight","The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Prenatal_care","Sudden_infant_death_syndrome","Cigarette","Malnutrition","Micronutrient","Stunted_growth","Breast_milk","Vitamin_A_deficiency","Stunting","Blindness","Nutrients","Iron_deficiency_anemia","Stillbirth","Brain_damage","Acute_respiratory_infection","Diarrhea","Measles","Malaria","Pneumonia","Bronchitis","Broncholitis","Folic_acid","Anemia","Pollution","Pathogens","Parasitic","Microbial","Water_pollution","Socioeconomic_status","Institutionalized_racism","Physical_quality_of_life_index","World_Health_Organization","UNICEF","Miscarriage","Stillbirth","Perinatal_mortality","Ansley_J._Coale","Catchment_area_(human_geography)","Social_class","Incomes","Correlate","Race_(classification_of_humans)","Socioeconomic","Technology","War","Government_corruption","Poverty","Democracy","Social_movements","Special_interest_groups","Trade","Division_of_labor","Domestic_economy","Sovereignty","Health_policy","Gross_National_Product","Discrimination","Homogeneous","Heterogeneous","Chronic_(medicine)","Underweight","Educational_attainment","Literacy","Pregnancy","Secondary_education","Medical_care","Economic_independence","Save_the_Children_State_of_the_World's_Mothers_report","Save_the_Children","The_World_Factbook","Afghanistan","Niger","Mali","Somalia","Central_African_Republic","Sweden","Singapore","Bermuda","Japan","Monaco","Millennium_Development_Goals","Well_being","Institutions","Physical_capital","Hygiene","Chlorinate","Solar_disinfection","Prenatal_care","HIV/AIDS","Fertility","Family_planning","Contraception","Gainful_employment","Infanticide","Modernization_theory","Human_resources","Physicians","Nurses","List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate","Diarrheal_diseases","Childlessness","Rotavirus","Pneumonia","Pneumococcal_disease","Bathtub_curve","The_Evergreen_State_College"]}
