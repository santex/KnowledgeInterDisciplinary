{"cursor":"78426","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nFAST}} 'Fasting' is primarily the act of willingly abstaining from all food,\ndrink, or both, for a period of time. An 'absolute fast' is normally defined as\nabstinence from all food and liquid for a defined period, usually a single day\n(24 hours), or several days. Other fasts may be only partially restrictive,\nlimiting particular foods or substance. The fast may also be intermittent in\nnature. Fasting practices may preclude sexual intercourse and other activities\nas well as food.\n\nIn a physiological context, fasting may refer to (1) the metabolic status of a\nperson who has not eaten overnight, and (2) to the metabolic state achieved\nafter complete digestion and absorption of a meal. Several metabolic adjustments\noccur during fasting, and some diagnostic tests are used to determine a fasting\nstate. For example, a person is assumed to be fasting after 8â12 hours.\nMetabolic changes toward the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal\n(typically 3â5 hours after a meal); \"post-absorptive state\" is synonymous with\nthis usage, in contrast to the \"post-prandial\" state of ongoing digestion. A\ndiagnostic fast refers to prolonged fasting (from 8â72 hours depending on age)\nconducted under observation for investigation of a problem, usually\nhypoglycemia. Finally, extended fasting has been recommended as therapy for\nvarious conditions by health professionals of most cultures, throughout history,\nfrom ancient to modern.\n","linknr":901,"url":"Fasting","recorded":1362504867,"links":89,"instances":["bible","practice","prophet","spirit","medicine","holiday","china","meal","christianity","christianity","bible"],"pdf":["http://www.morrigan.net/starryplough/apr2005/apr2005.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
