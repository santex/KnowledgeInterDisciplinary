Deception can involve dissimulation, propaganda, and\nsleight of hand, as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. There is\nalso self-deception, as in bad faith.\n\nDeception is a major relational transgression that often leads to feelings of\nbetrayal and distrust between relational partners. Deception violates relational\nrules and is considered to be a negative of expectations. Most people expect\nfriends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the\ntime. If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and\ncommunicating with others would require distraction and misdirection to acquire\nreliable information. A significant amount of deception occurs between romantic\nand relational partners.<ref name=\"Guerrero, Andersen, & Afifi, 2007\">Guerrero,\nL., Anderson, P., Afifi, W. (2007).
