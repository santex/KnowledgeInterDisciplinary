He specializes in progressive house and\nprogressive trance music and is better known for having created the tracks\n\"Loneliness\" and \"Prosac\", working alongside Eniac.\n\nTomcraft began working as a DJ in Munich in 1994, shifting between techno and\nthe emerging progressive trance style. The following year, he released his first\ntrack, \"This Is No House\". He first met Eniac in 1996, and the two immediately\nstarted producing music together, beginning with \"Viva\". The same year yielded\nthe track \"Prosac\", but this did not achieve success until it was re-released in\n2001. For a decade or so, he worked alongside fellow German producer Eniac as an\nexplosive studio team, steadily building hype and acclaim with regular releases\non the countryâs famous Kosmo Recordings amongst others.\n\n2002 was also the year Tomcraft released \"Loneliness\", a progressive vocal track\nthat eventually reached #1 in the UK Singles Chart. {{cite book\n| first= David last= Roberts year= 2006 title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th publisher= Guinness World Records Limited location= London isbn=\n| 1-904994-10-5 page= 561}} Following his\n| breakthrough hit, they parted ways with Eniac following some disagreements,\n| and Tomcraft set about building his reputation in the underground scene\n| further â with the launch of Great Stuff and subsequent signings of such a\n| talents as Lutzenkirchen, Coburn, Oliver Koletzki, The Egg and Ramon Tapia.\n\n2005 saw the launch of Craft Music, a new outlet for his productions with all\nother signed releases treated to a remix by the man himself â with the label\nundergoing a major relaunch in 2010 to bring it back to the forefront of house\nand techno music.\n\nIn the interim, he released several other big club smashes, including Prozac and\nOverdose, with regular releases ensuring his name remained unforgotten and an\nimpressive 4 artist albums released across the space of 6 years showing that he\nwas no mere 12â artist. Having resolved their disagreements, he is now once\nagain working with Eniac on new material, with A Place Called Soul one of their\nfirst reunited efforts and a new artist album scheduled for 2011. âItâs always\nsomething special when we work togetherâ he beams of his colleague, who has\nmoved back from Berlin to Munich so that they can work on new music day in, day\nout. Meanwhile, heâs also been working regularly with English talent Tim Healey\n(formerly known as 'Coburn'), staying with his family in Brighton for a week at\na time and working solidly on new material. His collaborations with vocalists\nover the years included workings with such a stars as Jimmy Pop (Bloodhound\nGang's singer), German soul sensation Xavier Naidoo, the USAâs venerable Tommie\nSunshine and local rapper Sido, his mind being always open to new and disparate\ninfluences and styles and his studio forever expanding with new bits of kit and\nvintage machinery.\n\nNaturally his DJ career exploded upon the mega-success of that single, with\nhighlights over the years including playing to 1.3 million people at Berlinâs\nLove Parade, Japanâs famous Fujirock Festival, major festivals in Brazil, and\nsome of the coolest clubs in Singapore, Tokyo, Los Angeles, SÃ£o Paulo, Rio, Cape\nTown, San Francisco, all over Europe, Poland, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and\nRussia (where he remains a regular fixture). His sound has morphed over the\nyears from trance into electro house and now since 2007 into a balance of those\ninfluences with a progressive house backbone, returning to the melodic sound\nthat he came from originally.\n\nTomcraft has released four albums to date, All I Got (2001), MUC (2003),\nHyperSexyConscious (2006) and For The Queen (2007), all on Kosmo Records.\n\nHis latest album, For The Queen, was a collaboration with Tobias David\nLÃ¼tzenkirchen from their Great Stuff label, and while similar in style with\nprevious Tomcraft releases, it is distinctive in a more narrative way, with less\nof the dance floor dimension of his previous works; he calls it a \"feature\nalbum\" and it is rich with collaborations and two covers.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Tomcraft","recorded":1362539388,"links":20,"instances":["sonique_song","artist","rapper","song","record_producer","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1975 births","Living people","German DJs","German record producers","German house musicians","German trance musicians","People from Munich"],"headings":["Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Tom2.png/220px-Tom2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["loneliness","song"],["eniac","record_producer"],["loneliness","song"],["coburn","band"],["sido","rapper"],["loneliness","song"],["another_world","sonique_song"],["sonique","artist"],["sido","rapper"]],"members":["another_world","sonique","sido","loneliness","eniac","coburn"],"related":["Munich","Germany","Trance_music","Musician","Disc_jockey","Germany","Disc_jockey","Record_producer","Progressive_house","Progressive_trance","Loneliness_(song)","Eniac_(record_producer)","Munich","Techno_music","Loneliness_(song)","UK_Singles_Chart","Lutzenkirchen","Coburn_(band)","Oliver_Koletzki","Ramon_Tapia","Jimmy_Pop","Xavier_Naidoo","Sido_(rapper)","Love_Parade","Fujirock_Festival","Album","Lützenkirchen","Loneliness_(song)","UK_Singles_Chart","Another_World_(Sonique_song)","Sonique_(artist)","Sido_(rapper)","Jimmy_Pop"]}
