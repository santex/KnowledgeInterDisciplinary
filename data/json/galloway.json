{"cursor":"10220","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Galloway' (, or Gallobha, Lowland Scots Gallowa, meaning \"Land of the Foreign\nGaels\") is an area in southwestern Scotland. It is generally agreed that the\nname 'Galloway' derives from the name Gall-Gaidel, and indeed the modern and\nmedieval words for Galloway in Gaelic are Gall-GhÃ idhealaibh and Gallgaidelaib\nrespectively, \"land of the foreign Gaels\". The term is not recorded until the\n11th century.\n\nIt usually refers to the counties of Wigtownshire (or historically West\nGalloway) and Kirkcudbrightshire (or historically East Galloway) in the Dumfries\nand Galloway administration council area of Scotland.\n\nFor a parish map of the counties of Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire, see\nDumfries and Galloway F.H.S. map at http://www.scotlandsfamily.com/parish-map-\nwigtown.htm\n\nGalloway is contained by sea to the west and south, the Galloway Hills to the\nnorth, and the River Nith to the east; the border between Kirkcudbrightshire and\nWigtownshire is marked by the River Cree. The definition has, however,\nfluctuated greatly in size over history.\n\nA hardy breed of black, hornless beef is named Galloway cattle native to the\nregion (and also to the more distinctive 'Belted Galloway' or 'Beltie').\n","linknr":430,"url":"galloway","recorded":1362513100,"links":35,"instances":["cattle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Galloway|","Scotland","Wigtownshire","Dumfries and Galloway"],"headings":["Geography and Landform","Land use","Galloway landmarks on Ptolemy's map","Early Galloway","Middle Ages","Modern history","Galloway in literature","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/NW_Britain_11th_cent.jpg/300px-NW_Britain_11th_cent.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/ScotlandGallowayCounties.png/250px-ScotlandGallowayCounties.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Scotland.southwest.topo.jpg/300px-Scotland.southwest.topo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Galloway.rivers.towns.jpg/300px-Galloway.rivers.towns.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Galloway.ptolemy.names.Ptolemy.map.png/300px-Galloway.ptolemy.names.Ptolemy.map.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Galloway.modern.names.Ptolemy.map.png/300px-Galloway.modern.names.Ptolemy.map.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Torhousekie_Stone_Circle.jpg/300px-Torhousekie_Stone_Circle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Cairn_Holy%2C_Galloway.JPG/300px-Cairn_Holy%2C_Galloway.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["galloway","cattle"]],"members":["galloway"],"related":["Scots_language","Scotland","Gall-Gaidel","Wigtownshire","Kirkcudbrightshire","Dumfries_and_Galloway","Council_area","Galloway_Hills","River_Nith","River_Cree","Beef","Galloway_(cattle)","Belted_Galloway","Water_divide","Urr_Water","Water_of_Ken","River_Dee,_Galloway","Great_Britain","Scottish_Highlands","Galloway_Hills","Horse","Milk","Beef","Timber","Fishery","Hydroelectric","Galloway_Hydro_Electric_Scheme","Electricity_generation","Wind_turbine","Ptolemy","Ptolemy","Pen_Rhionydd","Welsh_Triads","King_Arthur","Brython","Rheged","Loch_Ryan","Stranraer","Dunragit","Ancient_Rome","Novantae","St._Ninian","Whithorn","Wigtownshire","Pilgrimage","Scottish_Reformation","Torhouse","Wigtownshire","Glenluce","Wigtownshire","Angles","Bernicia","Norse–Gaels","Scandinavian_Scotland","Cumbria","Fergus_of_Galloway","Alan,_Lord_of_Galloway","England","David","Battle_of_the_Standard","Alexander_III_of_Scotland","Devorguilla_Balliol","John,_5th_Baron_de_Balliol","John_Balliol","Wars_of_Scottish_Independence","Scottish_Gaelic_language","Balmaclellan","Fief","Archibald_the_Grim","Earl_of_Douglas","Medieval","Galwegian_Gaelic","Scottish_Gaelic","Scottish_Lowlands","Margaret_McMurray","Carrick,_Scotland","Union_of_the_Crowns_1603","Scotland_in_the_Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms","Covenanter","Stranraer","Cairnryan","Walter_Scott","Richard_Hannay","John_Buchan","Whodunit","Dorothy_L._Sayers","Lord_Peter_Wimsey","Kirkcudbright","Gatehouse_of_Fleet"]}
