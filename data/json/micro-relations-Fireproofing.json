{"cursor":"13163","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n based plaster fireproofing being installed.]] fireproofing of cable trays,\n using calcium silicate boards.]] 'Fireproofing', a passive fire protection\n measure, refers to the act of making materials or structures more resistant to\n fire, or to those materials themselves, or the act of applying such materials.\n Applying a certification listed fireproofing system to certain structures\n allows these to have a fire-resistance rating. The term fireproof does not\n necessarily mean that an item cannot ever burn: It relates to measured\n performance under specific conditions of testing and evaluation. Fireproofing\n does not allow treated items to be entirely unaffected by any fire, as\n conventional materials are not immune to the effects of fire at a sufficient\n intensity and/or duration.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Fireproofing","recorded":1362543333,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Passive fire protection"],"headings":["Markets","Applications","History","Alternative fireproofing methods","Fraud","Work staging","Traffic tunnel fireproofing","Fireproof Vaults","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Fireproofing.jpg/250px-Fireproofing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Promat_signum_tray_cladding_1.jpg/220px-Promat_signum_tray_cladding_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Unitherm2.jpg/220px-Unitherm2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Beampenseal.jpg/220px-Beampenseal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plaster","Cable_tray","Calcium_silicate","Passive_fire_protection","Material","Building","Fire","Certification_listing","Fire-resistance_rating","Construction","Ship","Offshore_construction","Aerodynamics","Tunnel","Concrete","Structural_steel","Circuit_integrity","Liquified_petroleum_gas","BLEVE","Oil_refinery","Chemical_plant","Structural_steel","Concrete","Asbestos","Cement","Fabric","Personal_protective_equipment","Endothermic","Gypsum","Concrete","Aerodynamics","Intercontinental_ballistic_missile","Space_shuttle","National_Building_Code_of_Canada","Plaster","Gypsum","Gypsum","Portland_cement","Calcium_aluminate_cements","Construction_aggregate","Vermiculite","Perlite","Polystyrene","Mineral_wool","Ceramic","Certification_listing","Architect","Gypsum","Calcium_silicate","Vermiculite","Perlite","Convection_cooling","U.S._Steel_Tower","Intumescent","Endothermic","Passive_fire_protection","Listing_and_approval_use_and_compliance","United_States","Whistleblower","Gerald_W._Brown","Fire_test","Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission","Product_certification","Firestop","Nuclear_power_plant","Canada","United_States","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Hydrocarbon","Fire-resistance_rating","Fire_sprinkler_system","Active_fire_protection","BLEVE","Concrete","Channel_tunnel","United_Kingdom","France","Endothermic","Hydrate","Fire_protection","Listing_and_approval_use_and_compliance","Microfilm","Flameproofing","Fire","Fire_protection","Flame_retardant","Passive_fire_protection","Compartmentalisation","Fire-resistance_rating","Listing_and_approval_use_and_compliance","Gerald_W._Brown","Plaster","Cable_tray","Product_certification","Circuit_integrity","Firestop","Intumescent","Endothermic","Sodium_silicate","Hydrate","Construction","Channel_tunnel","Liquified_petroleum_gas","BLEVE"]}
