It is\ndivided into Parishes (in the Church of England into benefices and parishes).\n\nAn 'archdiocese' is more significant than a diocese. An archdiocese is presided\nover by an archbishop whose see may have or had importance due to size or\nhistorical significance. The archbishop may have metropolitan authority over\nany other (then 'suffragan') bishops and their dioceses within his\nEcclesiastical Province.\n\nThis structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.\n\nA diocese also may be referred to as a 'bishopric' or [[episcopal see]], though\nstrictly the term episcopal see refers to the domain of ecclesiastical\nauthority officially held by the bishop, and the term bishopric to the post of\nbeing bishop.\n\n:The bishops, Greek: Episkopos, elders or overseers, of the long-established\nchurches claim Apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to\nthe original Twelve Apostles.\n\n:The word diocese is from the Greek term Î´Î¹Î¿Î¯ÎºÎ·ÏÎ¹Ï, meaning
