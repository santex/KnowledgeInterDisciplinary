Mammals get their name from the word \"mammary.\" In humans, the\nmammary glands are situated in the breasts. In ruminants such as cows, goats,\nand deer, the mammary glands are contained in the 'udders'. The mammary glands\nof mammals having more than two breasts, such as dogs and cats, are sometimes\ncalled 'dugs'.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Mammary_gland","recorded":1362570202,"links":59,"instances":["anatomy","medicine","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Breast anatomy","Exocrine system","Glands"],"headings":["Humans","Other mammals","Evolution","Gallery","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Illu_breast_anatomy.jpg/250px-Illu_breast_anatomy.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Dissected_lactating_breast_gray1172.png/250px-Dissected_lactating_breast_gray1172.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Bezerro_mamando_REFON_.jpg/120px-Bezerro_mamando_REFON_.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/White_Cat_Nursing_Four_Kittens_HQ.jpg/120px-White_Cat_Nursing_Four_Kittens_HQ.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Piglets1.jpg/120px-Piglets1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Baby_sheep_feeding.JPG/120px-Baby_sheep_feeding.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Kid_feeding_on_mothers_milk.jpg/120px-Kid_feeding_on_mothers_milk.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Elephant_breastfeading.jpg/120px-Elephant_breastfeading.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Breastfeeding_infant.jpg/80px-Breastfeeding_infant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sinus","anatomy"],["organ","anatomy"],["involution","medicine"]],"members":["sinus","involution","organ"],"related":["Fat","Lactiferous_duct","Lobule","Connective_tissue","Sinus_(anatomy)","Lactiferous_duct","Internal_thoracic_artery","Lateral_thoracic_artery","Internal_thoracic_vein","Axillary_vein","Supraclavicular_nerves","Intercostal_nerves","Pectoral_axillary_lymph_nodes","Organ_(anatomy)","Female_mammals","Milk","Offspring","Human","Breast","Ruminants","Apocrine","Sweat_gland","Sebaceous_gland","Cuboidal_cells","Myoepithelial_cell","Nipple","Oxytocin","Polythelia","Accessory_breast","Extracellular_matrix","Adipocyte","Fibroblast","Basement_membrane","PTHrP","PTHrP","BMP4","Laminin","Collagen","Hormones","Puberty","Estrogen","Testosterone","Terminal_end_buds","Niche_cell","Integrin","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Laminin","Collagen","Matrix_metalloproteinase","Multipotent","Myoepithelial","Integrin","Laminin","Dystroglycan","Cancer","Prolactin","Adipose_tissue","Blood_flow","Gestation","Wnt","Colostrum","Lactation","Progesterone","Tight_junction","Integrin","Involution_(medicine)","Apoptosis","Autophagy","Endothelial_cells","Proteinase","Somatostatin","Tumorigenesis","Breast_cancer","Breasts","Milk_line","Ventral","Virginia_Opossum","Thoracic","Abdominal","Groin","Goat","Sheep","Horse","Guinea_pig","Cattle","Cat","Dog","Mouse","Rat","Pig","Proboscidean","Primates","Dayak_fruit_bat","Male_lactation","Protein","Genetically_modified_organism","Goat","Cow","Glycoprotein","Monoclonal_antibody","Antithrombin","Bacteria","Cell_culture","Apocrine_sweat_glands","Monotremes","Marsupials","Eutherians","Cattle","Cat","Pig","Sheep","Goat","Elephant","Human","Breastfeeding","Mammary_tumor","Gynecomastia","Teat","Udder","Witch's_milk","List_of_specialized_glands_within_the_human_integumentary_system","Keith_L._Moore"]}
