It can be a disabling and painful condition, which can lead to\nsubstantial loss of functioning and mobility if not adequately treated.\n\nThe process involves an inflammatory response of the capsule around the joints\n(synovium) secondary to swelling (hyperplasia) of synovial cells, excess\nsynovial fluid, and the development of fibrous tissue (pannus) in the synovium.\nThe pathology of the disease process often leads to the destruction of articular\ncartilage and ankylosis (fusion) of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also\nproduce diffuse inflammation in the lungs, membrane around the heart\n(pericardium), the membranes of the lung (pleura), and white of the eye\n(sclera), and also nodular lesions, most common in subcutaneous tissue. Although\nthe cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, autoimmunity plays a pivotal role\nin both its chronicity and progression, and RA is considered a systemic\nautoimmune disease. It is a clinical diagnosis made on the basis of symptoms,\nphysical exam, radiographs (X-rays) and labs.\n\nVarious treatments are available. Non-pharmacological treatment includes\nphysical therapy, orthoses, occupational therapy and nutritional therapy but\nthese do not stop the progression of joint destruction. Analgesia (painkillers)\nand anti-inflammatory drugs, including steroids, are used to suppress the\nsymptoms, while disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are required to\ninhibit or halt the underlying immune process and prevent long-term damage. In\nrecent times, the newer group of biologics has increased treatment options. About 1% of the world's population has rheumatoid arthritis,\nwomen three times as often as men. Onset is most frequent between the ages of 40\nand 50, but people of any age can be affected.\n\nThe name is based on the term \"rheumatic fever\", an illness which includes joint\npain and is derived from the Greek word á¿¥ÎµÏÎ¼Î±-rheuma (nom.), á¿¥ÎµÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¿Ï-rheumatos\n(gen.) (\"flow, current\"). The suffix -oid (\"resembling\") gives the translation\nas joint inflammation that resembles rheumatic fever. The first recognized\ndescription of rheumatoid arthritis was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob LandrÃ©-\nBeauvais (1772â1840) of Paris.\n","linknr":1343,"url":"Rheumatoid_arthritis","recorded":1362504371,"links":71,"instances":["medicine","epidemiology","tests","medical","tv_series"],"pdf":["http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/classification/ra/2010_revised_criteria_classification_ra.pdf","http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/classification/ra/2010_revised_criteria_classification_ra.pdf","http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/classification/ra/1987_revised_criteria_classification_ra.pdf","http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/classification/ra/1987_revised_criteria_classification_ra.pdf"],"categories":["Connective
