Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted\nto relieve arthritis pain or fix severe physical joint damage as part of hip\nfracture treatment. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) consists of\nreplacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty\ngenerally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently the most\ncommon orthopaedic operation, though patient satisfaction short and long term\nvaries widely.\n","linknr":580,"url":"Total_Hip_Replacement","recorded":1362540598,"links":27,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/bulletins/docs/b2010_14.pdf"],"categories":["Implants","Pelvis","Prosthetics","Orthopedic surgery"],"headings":["Modern process","Indications","Techniques","Implants","Risks and complications","Alternatives and variations","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Hip_replacement_Image_3684-PH.jpg/230px-Hip_replacement_Image_3684-PH.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Hip_prosthesis.jpg/250px-Hip_prosthesis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Hip-replacement.jpg/220px-Hip-replacement.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Dislocated_hip_replacement.jpg/220px-Dislocated_hip_replacement.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Hip_joint_aseptic_loosening_ar1938-1.png/220px-Hip_joint_aseptic_loosening_ar1938-1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["implant","medicine"],["poly(methyl_methacrylate"]],"members":["implant"],"related":["X-ray","Femur","Human_pelvis","Female","Surgery","Hip","Implant_(medicine)","Joint_replacement","Orthopaedic_surgery","Arthritis","Pain","Hip_fracture_treatment","Acetabulum","Hemiarthroplasty","Ceramic","Polyethylene","John_Charnley","Tribology","Stainless_Steel","Polyethylene","Teflon","Poly(methyl_methacrylate)","Bone_cement","Arthroplasty","Synovial_fluid","Molecular_Weight","Polyethylene","UHMWPE","Ceramic","Sportsperson","Bobby_Labonte","Dale_Jarrett","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Avascular_necrosis","Traumatic_arthritis","Protrusio_acetabuli","Hip_fracture","Bone_tumor","Paget's_disease_of_bone","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis","Physical_therapy","Greater_trochanter","Piriformis_muscle","Abductor_muscle","Gluteus_medius","Gluteus_minimus","Surgical_suture","Tensor_fasciae_latae","Sartorius_muscle","Computer_Assisted_Surgery","HipNav","Acetabulum","Sintering","Morse_taper","Femur","Bone_cement","Morse_taper","Engineering_tolerance","Venous_thrombosis","Deep_vein_thrombosis","Pulmonary_embolism","Anticoagulant","Osteolysis","Inflammation","Cobalt","Chromium","Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Iliopsoas","Physical_therapy","Hip_fracture","Prosthesis","Composite_material","Metal","HDPE","Acetabulum","Hip_resurfacing","Minimally_invasive_hip_resurfacing","Bioengineering","Stem_cell","Femoral_head","Columbia,_South_Carolina","Vitallium","Burma","Ivory","Prostheses","Femur","Burma","Buddhist","Institute_of_Medicine,_Mandalay","Manadalay","Journal_of_Bone_&_Joint_Surgery","Hip_examination","2010_DePuy_Hip_Recall","Femoral_Acetabular_Impingement","Abductor_wedge"]}
