When he entered a game on May 3, 1952, 39-year-old\nrookie Quincy Trouppe, a Negro League veteran, was behind the plate. Together\nthey formed the first black battery in American League history. Both Sam Jones\nand Quincy Trouppe played for the Cleveland Buckeyes in the Negro League\n\nAfter the season, the Tribe traded him to the Chicago Cubs for two players to be\nnamed later, one of who was slugger Ralph Kiner. In , the Cubs traded him to the\nSt. Louis Cardinals in a multi-player deal; prior to the season, he was dealt\nonce again, this time to the San Francisco Giants for Bill White and Ray\nJablonski. He was picked 25th by the expansion Houston Colt .45s in the\nexpansion draft, then traded to the Detroit Tigers for Bob Bruce and Manny\nMontejo. He rejoined the Cardinals for the campaign and played 1964 with the\nBaltimore Orioles. He spent the final three years of his pro career as a relief\npitcher with the Columbus Jets of the International League before retiring at\nthe end of the 1967 season.\n\nDuring his career, Jones was known for his sweeping curveball, in addition to a\nfastball and changeup. Stan Musial once remarked, \"Sam had the best curveball I\never saw... He was quick and fast and that curve was terrific, so big it was\nlike a change of pace. I've seen guys fall down on curves that became strikes.\"\nThe Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching,\nPitchers, and Pitches. Bill James and Rob Neyer. 2004.\n\nDuring his career, Jones led the National League in strikeouts, and walks, three\ntimes: in , 1956, and . On May 12 of the former of these three seasons, he no-\nhit the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 at Wrigley Field, becoming the first African\nAmerican in Major League history to pitch a no-hitter. He achieved this no-\nhitter in the hardest way: after walking Gene Freese, Preston Ward (who was pinch-\nrun for by RomÃ¡n MejÃ­as) and Tom Saffell to begin the ninth inning, he left the\nbases loaded by striking out Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente and Frank Thomas in\nsuccession. His greatest year came with the Giants in 1959, when he led the\nleague in both wins with 21 (tying him with Milwaukee Braves starters Lew\nBurdette and Warren Spahn) and ERA with 2.83. He was named 1959 National League\nPitcher of the Year by [[The Sporting News]], but finished a distant second to\nEarly Wynn of the Chicago White Sox for the Cy Young Award. He was named to the\nNL All-Star team twice, in 1955 and 1959.\n\nWhile his major league won-lost record of 102-101 is not especially impressive,\nJones was a combined 104-66 over 10 minor league seasons. According to various\nsources Jones also had a combined record of either 13-10 or 19-11 over two\nNegro League seasons in 1947 and 1948, and recorded a 10-2 won-lost record in\n1949 for the Rochester Royals of the semipro Southern Minnesota League. These\nwin totals, combined with his record over numerous winters spent playing in\nCaribbean winter leagues, rank Jones among the most successful pitchers in\nprofessional baseball history.\n\nJones died from a recurrence of neck cancer first diagnosed in 1962, in\nMorgantown, West Virginia at the age of 45.\n","linknr":269,"url":"Sam_Jones_(baseball)","recorded":1375076643,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sam_Jones_(baseball)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sam_Jones_(baseball)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sad_Sam_Jones","/wiki/Pitcher","/w/index.php?title=Stewartsville,_Ohio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Morgantown,_West_Virginia","/wiki/Win%E2%80%93loss_record_(pitching)","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Strikeouts","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/1951_in_baseball","/wiki/1952_in_baseball","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/1955_in_baseball","/wiki/1956_in_baseball","/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals","/wiki/1957_in_baseball","/wiki/1958_in_baseball","/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants","/wiki/1959_in_baseball","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/1962_in_baseball","/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals","/wiki/1963_in_baseball","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/1964_in_baseball","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/1955_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/1959_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_(second_game)","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/1951_in_baseball","/wiki/1964_in_baseball","/w/index.php?title=Stewartsville,_Ohio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Rookie","/wiki/Quincy_Trouppe","/wiki/Negro_League","/wiki/African_American","/wiki/Battery_(baseball)","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/1954_in_baseball","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Ralph_Kiner","/wiki/1956_in_baseball","/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals","/wiki/1959_in_baseball","/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants","/wiki/Bill_White_(first_baseman)","/wiki/Ray_Jablonski","/wiki/Houston_Astros","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Bob_Bruce","/wiki/Manny_Montejo","/wiki/1963_in_baseball","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Curveball","/wiki/Fastball","/wiki/Changeup","/wiki/Stan_Musial","#cite_note-1","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/1955_in_baseball","/wiki/1958_in_baseball","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/Wrigley_Field","/wiki/African_American","/wiki/Gene_Freese","/wiki/Preston_Ward","/wiki/Rom%C3%A1n_Mej%C3%ADas","/wiki/Tom_Saffell","/wiki/Dick_Groat","/wiki/Roberto_Clemente","/wiki/Frank_Thomas_(outfielder)","/wiki/Win_(baseball)","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/wiki/Lew_Burdette","/wiki/Warren_Spahn","/wiki/Earned-run_average","/wiki/The_Sporting_News_Pitcher_of_the_Year_Award","/wiki/The_Sporting_News","/wiki/Early_Wynn","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/Cy_Young_Award","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/Morgantown,_West_Virginia","/w/index.php?title=Sam_Jones_(baseball)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_ERA_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_strikeout_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_wins_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_no-hitters","/w/index.php?title=Sam_Jones_(baseball)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Sam_Jones_(baseball)&action=edit&section=3","http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b2f99b7e","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jonessa02.shtml","http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1006590","http://www.thebaseballcube.com/profile.asp?P=Sam-Jones-1","/wiki/Jim_Wilson_(pitcher)","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_no-hitters","/wiki/Carl_Erskine","/wiki/Robin_Roberts_(baseball_player)","/wiki/Jack_Sanford","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_strikeout_champions","/wiki/Jack_Sanford","/wiki/Don_Drysdale","/wiki/Stu_Miller","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_ERA_champions","/wiki/Mike_McCormick_(pitcher)","/wiki/Bob_Friend","/wiki/Warren_Spahn","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_wins_champions","/wiki/Lew_Burdette","/wiki/Warren_Spahn","/wiki/Ernie_Broglio","/wiki/Warren_Spahn","/wiki/Template:San_Francisco_Giants_Opening_Day_starting_pitchers","/wiki/Template_talk:San_Francisco_Giants_Opening_Day_starting_pitchers","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:San_Francisco_Giants_Opening_Day_starting_pitchers&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_San_Francisco_Giants_Opening_Day_starting_pitchers","/wiki/Red_Ames","/wiki/Fred_Anderson_(baseball)","/wiki/Johnny_Antonelli","/wiki/Jesse_Barnes","/wiki/Virgil_Barnes","/wiki/Jim_Barr","/wiki/Larry_Benton","/wiki/Vida_Blue","/wiki/Tom_Bradley_(ba
