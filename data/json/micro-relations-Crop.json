{"cursor":"3473","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n, India.]] A 'crop' is a volunteered or cultivated plant (any plant) whose\nproduce is harvested by man at some point of its growth stage. Plants which have\nnot been cultivated but whose produce are harvested, are not really classified\nas crops. The same goes for plants which have been planted, but are never\nharvested. Flowers are classified as crops because when it has been cultivated,\nits harvesting also include the aesthetic purpose it serves. 'Crops' refer to\nplants that are grown on a large scale for food, clothing, and other human uses.\nThey are non-animal species or varieties grown to be harvested as food,\nlivestock fodder, fuel or for any other economic purpose (for example,Â for\nuse as dyes, medicinal, and cosmetic use).\n\nMajor crops include sugarcane, pumpkin, maize (corn), wheat, rice, cassava,\nsoybeans, hay, potatoes and cotton. While the term\n\"crop\" most commonly refers to plants, it can also include species from other\nbiological kingdoms. For example, mushrooms like shiitake, which are in the\nfungi kingdom, can be referred to as \"crops\". In addition, certain species of\nalgae are also cultivated, although it is also harvested from the wild. In\ncontrast, animal species that are raised by humans are called livestock, except\nthose that are kept as pets. Microbial species, such as bacteria or viruses, are\nreferred to as cultures. Microbes are not typically grown for food, but are\nrather used to alter food. For example, bacteria are used to ferment milk to\nproduce yogurt.\n\nBased on the growing season, the crops grown in India can be classified as\nkharif crop and rabi crops.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Crop","recorded":1362373002,"links":62,"instances":["botany","biology","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crops|"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/New_World_Domesticated_plants.JPG/280px-New_World_Domesticated_plants.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Drying_Crop_in_rural_Punjabi_home.JPG/280px-Drying_Crop_in_rural_Punjabi_home.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg/32px-Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/32px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/France_Loiret_La_Bussiere_Potager_05.jpg/32px-France_Loiret_La_Bussiere_Potager_05.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Foods.jpg/19px-Foods.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/RegaderaMetalica.jpg/100px-RegaderaMetalica.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Corn_01.JPG/16px-Corn_01.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Leaf_1_web.jpg/16px-Leaf_1_web.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Hjul-_eller_k%C3%A4rr%C3%A5rder%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png/40px-Hjul-_eller_k%C3%A4rr%C3%A5rder%2C_Nordisk_familjebok.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variety","botany"],["kingdom","biology"],["fermentation","food"]],"members":["variety","kingdom","fermentation"],"related":["India","Plant","Food","Clothing","Animal","Species","Variety_(botany)","Harvest","Livestock","Fodder","Biofuel","Sugarcane","Pumpkin","Maize","Wheat","Rice","Cassava","Soybean","Hay","Potato","Cotton","Kingdom_(biology)","Mushroom","Shiitake","Fungi","Algae","Human","Pet","Microbial","Bacteria","Virus","Microbiological_culture","Fermentation_(food)","Milk","Yogurt","India","Kharif_crop","Rabi_crops","Agriculture","Break_crop","Bumper_crop","Cash_crop","Catch_crop","Cover_crop","Crop_destruction","Crop_diversity","Crop_residue","Crop_rotation","Crop_weed","Crop_wild_relative","Crop_yield","Crop-lien_system","Energy_crop","Farming","Fiber_crop","Industrial_crop","Inter-cropping","Kharif_crops","Multiple_cropping","Nurse_crop","Permanent_crop","Rabi_crops","Sharecropping","Underutilized_crop"]}
