In\nother animals, the term arm can also be used for analogous structures, such as\none of the paired forelimbs of a four-legged animal or the arms of cephalopods.\nIn anatomical usage, the term arm refers specifically to the segment between the\nshoulder and the elbow, while the segment between the\nelbow and wrist is the forearm. However, in common, literary, and historical\nusage, arm refers to the entire upper limb from shoulder to wrist. This article\nuses the former definition; see upper limb for the wider definition.\n\nIn primates the arm is adapted for precise positioning of the hand and thus\nassist in the hand's manipulative tasks. The ball and socket shoulder joint\nallows for movement of the arms in a wide circular plane, while the structure of\nthe two forearm bones which can rotate around each other allows for additional\nrange of motion at that level.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"arm","recorded":1363384973,"links":[],"instances":["bone"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Upper limb anatomy"],"headings":["Skeleton","Muscles","Nerve and blood supply","Additional images","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["radius","bone"]],"members":["radius"],"related":["Axillary_artery","Axillary_vein","Brachial_plexus","Human_anatomy","Upper_limb","Shoulder_joint","Elbow_joint","Forelimb","Quadrupedalism","Cephalopod_arm","Wrist","Forearm","Upper_limb","Hand","Humerus","Scapula","Shoulder","Glenohumeral_joint","Ulna","Radius_(bone)","Elbow","Hinge_joint","Fascia","Intermuscular_septa","Anterior_compartment_of_the_arm","Posterior_compartment_of_the_arm","Periosteum","Deltoid_muscle","Abductor_muscle","Brachioradialis","Supination","Cubital_fossa","Venepuncture","Blood_pressure","Musculocutaneous_nerve","Brachial_plexus","Coracobrachialis","Brachialis","Biceps_brachii","Anterior_cutaneous_nerve_of_the_forearm","Radial_nerve","Lower_triangular_space","Profunda_brachii","Radial_groove","Lesion","Median_nerve","Brachial_plexus","Pronator_teres","Forearm","Ulnar_nerve","Brachial_plexus","Median_nerve","Fracture","Brachial_artery","Axillary_artery","Brachial_artery","Profunda_brachii","Teres_major","Cubital_fossa","Biceps","Triceps","Median_nerve","Basilic_vein","Venae_comitantes","Median_nerve","Biceps_brachii","Cubital_fossa","Forearm","Lower_triangular_space","Radial_nerve","Humerus","Fracture","Radial_nerve","Haematoma","Anastamosis","Recurrent_radial","Brachial_artery","Elbow-joint","Basilic_vein","Cephalic_vein","Median_cubital_vein","Cubital_fossa","Venepuncture","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Anthropometry_of_the_upper_arm","Humerus_fracture"]}
