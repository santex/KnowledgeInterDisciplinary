McAulay was born 9 December 1863 and attended\nKingswood School in Bath and Caius College, Cambridge, taking his degree in\n1886. He studied quaternions intensively at Cambridge. Departing for\nAustralia, he lectured at Ormond College, University of Melbourne from 1893 to\n1895. He was an advocate of quaternion calculus for modeling physical\nrelations. M.J. Crowe (1967) A History of Vector Analysis, U. Notre Dame\nPress. Chapter 6 details McAulay's four contributions in 1893 and 94 to the\ndebate on vectors and quaternions.\n\nPeter Guthrie Tait praised McAulay's book Utility of Quaternions in Physics\n(1893) in these terms: :Here, at last, we exclaim, is a man who has caught the\nfull spirit of the quaternion system: the real aestus, the awen of the Welsh\nBards, the divinus [[afflatus]] that transports the poet beyond the limits of\nsublunary things! Intuitively recognizing its power, he snatches up the\nmagnificent weapon which Hamilton tenders us all, and at once dashes off to the\njungle on the quest of big game. PG Tait (1893) Nature 28 December\n\nMcAulay took up the position of Professor of Physics in Tasmania from 1896 until\n1929, as which time his son Alexander Leicester McAulay took over the position\nfor the next thirty years.\n\nMcAulay is also remembered for work with hypercomplex numbers, in particular the\nsplit-biquaternions which William Kingdon Clifford had noted. In 1898 McAulay\npublished, through Cambridge University Press, his Octonions: a Development of\nClifford's Biquaternions.\n\nMcAulay died 6 July 1931. His brother Francis Macaulay, who stayed in England,\nalso contributed to ring theory. The University of Tasmania has commemorated the\nMcAulays' contributions in Winter Public Lectures.
