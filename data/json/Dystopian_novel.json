{"cursor":"16547","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'utopia' and its offshoot, the 'dystopia', are 'genres of literature' that\nexplore social and political structures. 'Utopian fiction' is the creation of\nan ideal society, or utopia, as the setting for a novel. 'Dystopian fiction' is\nthe opposite: creation of an utterly horrible or degraded society, or dystopia.\nMany novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions\nhumanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures.\nBoth utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other\nspeculative fiction genres, and arguably are by definition a type of\nspeculative fiction.\n\nMore than 400 utopian works were published prior to the year 1900 in the English\nlanguage alone, with more than a thousand others during the twentieth\ncentury.
