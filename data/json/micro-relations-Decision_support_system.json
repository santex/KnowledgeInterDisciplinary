{"cursor":"21571","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] A 'decision support system' ('DSS') is a computer-based information system\nthat supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve\nthe management, operations, and planning levels of an organization and help to\nmake decisions, which may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in\nadvance. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized, human or a\ncombination of both.\n\nDSSs include knowledge-based systems. A properly designed DSS is an interactive\nsoftware-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful\ninformation from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge,\nor business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.\n\nTypical information that a decision support application might gather and present\nincludes: *inventories of information assets (including legacy and relational\ndata sources, cubes, data warehouses, and data marts), *comparative sales\nfigures between one period and the next, *projected revenue figures based on\nproduct sales assumptions.\n","linknr":323,"url":"Decision_support_system","recorded":1362669307,"links":50,"instances":["computer_science","hypertext","abstract","hypertext"],"pdf":["http://www.aglearn.net/resources/isfm/DSSAT.pdf","http://www.openspace-online.com/OpenSpace-Online_eBook_en.pdf"],"categories":["Information systems","Decision theory","Knowledge engineering"],"headings":["History","Taxonomies","Components","Classification","Applications","Benefits","DSS Characteristics and capabilities","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Decision_Support_System_for_John_Day_Reservoir.jpg/360px-Decision_Support_System_for_John_Day_Reservoir.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Drought_Mitigation_Decision_Support_System.png/360px-Drought_Mitigation_Decision_Support_System.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["zog","hypertext"],["kms","hypertext"],["model","abstract"],["end-user","computer_science"],["morphological_analysis","problem-solving"]],"members":["zog","model","morphological_analysis","kms"],"related":["Information_systems","Decision-making","Expert_system","Data_warehouse","Data_mart","Carnegie_Institute_of_Technology","Executive_information_systems","Group_decision_support_system","Henk_G._Sol","Texas_Instruments","United_Airlines","Airport","O'Hare_International_Airport","Chicago","Denver","Colorado","Data_warehouse","Online_analytical_processing","Management","User_interface","Hypertext","University_of_Vermont","Problem-Oriented_Medical_Information_System","ZOG_(hypertext)","KMS_(Hypertext)","Hypertext","Information_overload","Douglas_Engelbart","Taxonomy","Microsoft_Groove","Time_series","Problem-solving","Computer_Simulation","Dicodess","Open_source","Systems_architecture","Database","Knowledge_base","Model_(abstract)","User_interface","End-user_(computer_science)","Analytica","IThink","Cognition","Artificial_intelligence","Intelligent_agent","Intelligent_support_systems","Decision_engineering","Design","Quality_assurance","Clinical_decision_support_system","Medical_diagnosis","Executive_dashboard","Agriculture","Sustainable_development","USAID","Forest_management","Canadian_National_Railway","Railroad","Derailment","CACI","Clinical_decision_support_system","Decision_engineering","Decision_making_software","Decision_theory","Expert_system","Judgeâ€“advisor_system","Land_Allocation_Decision_Support_System","Morphological_analysis_(problem-solving)","Online_deliberation","Predictive_analytics","Self_service_software","Spatial_Decision_Support_System","Opinion_driven_decision_support_system"]}
