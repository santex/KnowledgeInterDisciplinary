Examples in literature\nmight be Charles Dickens' [[Oliver Twist]] or Sheridan Le Fanu's [[Carmilla]],\nstories which strongly reflect the moral atmosphere of the time. In the case of\nobjects, a military tailcoat, carriage clock or scrollwork on an iron gate might\nbe considered Victoriana if they were made at the time, in the style\ncharacteristic of the Victorian age.\n\nItems such as Stevengraphs were popular collectable items during the revival of\ninterest in Victoriana in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Thorncroft, Antony.
