Lightweight types of backpacks are\nsometimes worn on only one shoulder strap.\n\nBackpacks are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying\nany sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights\nfor long periods of time in the hands. Large backpacks, used to carry loads over\n10 kg (22 lbs), usually offload the largest part (up to about 90%) of\ntheir weight onto padded hip belts, leaving the shoulder straps mainly for\nstabilising the load. This improves the potential to carry heavy loads, as the\nhips are stronger than the shoulders, and also increases agility and balance,\nsince the load rides nearer the wearer's own centre of mass.\n\nIn ancient times, the backpack was used as a means to carry the hunter's larger\ngame and other types of prey and as a way of easier transport for other\nmaterials. In the cases of larger hunts, the hunters would dismember their prey\nand distribute the pieces of the animal around, each one packing the meat into\nmany wrappings and then into bags which they placed on to their backs. The bag\nitself was made up of different animal hide and skin (depending on what sorts of\nanimals were in the area) and sewn together by the intestines of said animals,\nwhich were woven together tightly to make a sturdy thread-like material.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Backpack","recorded":1362563015,"links":53,"instances":["disambiguation","bag","wilderness"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bags","Camping equipment","Domestic implements","Hiking equipment","Luggage"],"headings":["Terminology","Backpack designs","Daily use","Professional use","Backpacks for travel","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Rucksack1.jpg/220px-Rucksack1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Rucksack_Schweizer_Armee_1960er_a.jpg/220px-Rucksack_Schweizer_Armee_1960er_a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rucksack_Schweizer_Armee_1960er_b.jpg/220px-Rucksack_Schweizer_Armee_1960er_b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Reffunbeladen.jpg/220px-Reffunbeladen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/76/1860s_external_frame_packs.jpg/220px-1860s_external_frame_packs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Canon-Deluxe_Backpack-200-EG.jpg/220px-Canon-Deluxe_Backpack-200-EG.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Berghaus_Vulcan.jpg/220px-Berghaus_Vulcan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bag","disambiguation"],["backpacking","urban"],["backpacking","wilderness"],["satchel","bag"]],"members":["bag","satchel","backpacking"],"related":["Bag_(disambiguation)","Shoulder","Handbag","Hand","Hip","Mass","Dialect","German_language","Loanword","United_Kingdom","Saddlebag","Duffel_bag","Buckle","Zipper","Cord_lock","Webbing","Cordage","Ultralight_backpacking","National_Health_Service","Ötzi_the_Iceman","Copper_Age","Snowshoe","Military","Mountaineering","Synthetic_polymers","Plastic","Lowe_Alpine","Lowepro","Student","Bookbag","Laptop","Camera","Messenger_bag","Apple_Inc.","Infantry","Military_surplus","All-purpose_Lightweight_Individual_Carrying_Equipment","Personal_Load_Carrying_Equipment","United_States_Marine_Corps","ILBE","Circle_cotter","MOLLE","ILBE","Luggage","Backpacking_(urban)","Suitcase","Hydration_pack","Skateboard","Backpacking_(wilderness)","Outdoor_recreation","Ultralight_backpacking","Webbing","Canvas","Nylon","Polyester","Ripstop","Cordura","Military_surplus","Ultralight_backpacking","Kayak","Canoe","Rock_climbing","Mountaineering","Cross_country_skiing","Hydration_pack","CamelBak","Paintball","Airsoft","Bindle","Duffel_bag","Fanny_pack","Hydration_pack","Messenger_bag","Papoose","Satchel_(bag)","Shoulder_strap","Sling_bag"]}
