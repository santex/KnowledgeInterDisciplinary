{"cursor":"17982","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\"Divine\" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Divine (disambiguation)]] or\n:[[Divinity (disambiguation)]]\n Juno, Minerva & Venus.]] In religious terms, 'divinity' is the state of things\n that come from a supernatural power or deity, such as God, or spirit beings,\n and are therefore regarded as sacred and holy. Wiktionary: \"divine (comparative more divine, superlative\n most divine)\n1) of or pertaining to a god\n2) eternal, holy, or otherwise supernatural.\n3) of superhuman or surpassing excellence\n4) beautiful, heavenly http://dictionary.refere-\n   nce.com/browse/divine Merriam Webster: http://www.merriam-\n   webster.com/dictionary/divine Such things are regarded as \"divine\" due\n   to their transcendental origins, and/or because their attributes or qualities\n   are superior or supreme relative to things of the Earth. Divine things are regarded as eternal and based in\n   truth, while material things are regarded as ephemeral\n   and based in illusion. Such things that may qualify as \"divine\" are\n   apparitions, visions, prophecies, miracles, and in some views also the soul,\n   or more general things like resurrection, immortality, grace, and salvation.\n   Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by\n   different belief systems.\n\nThe root of the word \"divine\" is literally \"godlike\" (from the Latin deus, cf.\n[[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]], closely related to Greek [[zeus]], [[Daeva|div]] in\nPersian and [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] in Sanskrit), but the use varies\nsignificantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines\nthe major distinctions in the conventional use of the terms.\n\nFor specific related academic terms, see Divinity (academic discipline), or\nDivine (Anglican).\n","linknr":651,"url":"Divinity","recorded":1362483096,"links":25,"instances":["spirituality","mythology","christianity","bible","mythology","academic_discipline","gods","theology","religion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theology","Religious belief and doctrine","Philosophy of religion","Gods","Latin loanwords"],"headings":["Usages","See also","Notes and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Isaac_Oliver_Elizabeth_I_and_the_Three_Goddesses.jpg/250px-Isaac_Oliver_Elizabeth_I_and_the_Three_Goddesses.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/P_religion_world.svg/31px-P_religion_world.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/P_religion_world.svg/31px-P_religion_world.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["juno","mythology"],["venus","mythology"],["transcendence","religion"],["vision","spirituality"],["divinity","academic_discipline"],["samuel","bible"],["transcendence","religion"],["vision","spirituality"],["mandate","theology"],["pantheon","gods"],["born_again","christianity"]],"members":["vision","juno","born_again","samuel","venus","divinity","pantheon","mandate","transcendence"],"related":["Juno_(mythology)","Minerva","Venus_(mythology)","Religious","Supernatural_power","Deity","God","Spirits","Sacred","Holy","Merriam_Webster","Transcendence_(religion)","Earth","Eternity","Truth","Ephemeral","Illusion","Apparition","Vision_(spirituality)","Prophecy","Miracle","Soul","Resurrection","Immortality","Divine_grace","Salvation","Belief_system","Persian_language","Sanskrit","Conventional","Academic","Divinity_(academic_discipline)","Anglican_divine","Deities","Human","Jehovah","Old_Testament","Thunder","Prophets_in_Judaism","Moses","Samuel_(Bible)","Books_of_Samuel","Good_and_evil","Beauty","Justice","Pro-social","Monotheistic","Supernatural","Demons","Devil","Afreet","Pantheistic","Polytheistic","Transcendence_(religion)","Irrational","Monotheistic","Antonyms","Greek_language","Three","Discourse","Singular_God","Definite_article","Proper_name","Miracle","Legend","Poseidon","Storms","Odysseus","Japan","Prayers","Pantheism","Shinto","Ancestral","Household","Blessings","Miracles","Vision_(spirituality)","Intercession_of_saints","Force","Divine_providence","Muslim","Divine_retribution","Evil","Wrongs","Sodom_and_Gomorrah","Great_Flood","Buddhism","Hinduism","Divine_law","Divine_retribution","Punishment","Intentional","Unintentional","Universe","Taoism","Western_mysticism","New_age","Principle","Wellspring_of_life","Early_societies","Egyptian_Pharaohs","Mandate_(theology)","King","Japanese_constitution","World_War_II","Saint","Prophet","Hero","Oracle","Martyr","Saint_Francis_of_Assisi","God","Plenary_indulgence","Achilles","River_Styx","Hercules","Zeus","Taoism","Lao_Tsu","Gautama_Buddha","Muhammad","Christ","Pantheon_(gods)","Controversial","Japan","Sufi","Gnostic","Zen_Buddhist","Essence","Spiritual_practice","Christian_theology","Psalms","Born_again_(Christianity)","Christian_Greek_Scriptures","Douayâ€“Rheims_Bible","King_James_Bible","The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","Spirituality","Light_of_Christ","Holy_Spirit","Pre-existence","Humankind","The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","King_Follett_discourse","Truth","Love","Faith","Immortality","Father","Atonement_in_Christianity","Death","Resurrection","Divine_grace","Soul","Catholic_Concept_of_the_Divine","Christology","Deity","Ho'oponopono","List_of_deities","Theosis"]}
