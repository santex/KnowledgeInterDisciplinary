{"cursor":"8436","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n:This page deals with consideration under American law; an English focused\narticle is available'here'. 'Consideration' is the central concept in the common\nlaw of contracts and is required, in most cases, for a contract to be\nenforceable. Consideration is the price one pays for another's promise. It can\ntake a number of forms: money, property, a promise, the doing of an act, or even\nrefraining from doing an act. In broad terms, if one agrees to do something he\nwas not otherwise legally obligated to do, it may be said that he has given\nconsideration. For example, Jack agrees to sell his car to Jill for $100. Jill's\npayment of $100 (or her promise to do so) is the consideration for Jack's\npromise to give Jill the car.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Consideration_under_American_law","recorded":1362572425,"links":12,"instances":["legal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Contract law","United States law"],"headings":["Elements of consideration","Lack of Consideration","Exceptions to the Consideration Requirement","Contract modification","Theories of Consideration","Purposes of Consideration","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["peppercorn","legal"]],"members":["peppercorn"],"related":["Consideration_under_English_law","Common_law","Contract","Bargaining","Lease","Contract","Pre_Existing_Duty_Rule","Illusory_promise","Lease","Uniform_Commercial_Code","Uniform_Commercial_Code","Uniform_Commercial_Code","Pre_Existing_Duty_Rule","Peppercorn_(legal)","Unconscionable","US_contract_law","English_contract_law","Consideration_in_English_law","AL_Corbin"]}
