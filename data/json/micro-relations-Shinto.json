It is a set of\n practices, to be carried out diligently, to establish a connection between\n present day Japan and its ancient past. John Nelson. A Year in the Life of\n a Shinto Shrine. 1996. pp. 7â8 Shinto practices were first recorded and\n codified in the written historical records of the [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon\n Shoki]] in the 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not\n refer to a unified \"Shinto religion\", but rather to disorganized folklore,\n history, and mythology. Shinto today is a\n term that applies to public shrines suited to various purposes such as war\n memorials, harvest festivals, romance, and historical monuments, as well as\n various sectarian organizations. Practitioners express their diverse beliefs\n through a standard language and practice, adopting a similar style in dress and\n ritual, dating from around the time of the Nara and Heian Periods.\n\nThe word Shinto (\"Way of the Gods\") was adopted from the written Chinese (ç¥é,\n), combining two [[kanji]]: , meaning \"spirit\" or\nkami; and , meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word\n[[dÃ o]]). [[Kami]]\nare defined in English as \"spirits\", \"essences\" or \"deities\", that are\nassociated with many understood formats; in some cases being human-like, in\nothers being animistic, and others being associated with more abstract \"natural\"\nforces in the world (mountains, rivers, lightning, wind, waves, trees, rocks).\nKami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its\ninterrelated complexity.\n\nFact books and statistics typically list some 80 to 90% of Japanese people as\nShintoist. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-\nfactbook/geos/ja.html 'CIA Factbook: Japan'] However, polls suggest that\nmost Japanese consider themselves non-religious and believe that there are\ncurrently only 4 million \"actual\" observers of Shinto in\nJapan. http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html The vast\nmajority of people in Japan who take part in Shinto rituals also practice\nBuddhist rituals. However, Shinto does not actually require professing faith to\nbe a believer or a practitioner thus a person who practices \"any\" manner of\nShinto rituals may be so counted, and as such it is difficult to query for exact\nfigures based on self-identification of belief within\nJapan. http://www.jinjahoncho.or.jp/en/honcho/index.html Another\nproblem is that Shinto is sometimes seen more as a way of life rather than a\nreligion by the Japanese due to its long historical and cultural significance.\nDue to the syncretic nature of Shinto and Buddhism, most \"life\" events are\nhandled by Shinto and \"death\" or \"afterlife\" events are handled by Buddhismâfor\nexample, it is typical in Japan to register or celebrate a birth at a Shinto\nshrine, while funeral arrangements are generally dictated by Buddhist\ntraditionâalthough the division is not exclusive. According to Inoue (2003):\n:\"In modern scholarship, the term is often used with reference to kami worship\n:and related theologies, rituals and practices. In these contexts, âShintoâ\n:takes on the meaning of âJapanâs traditional religionâ, as opposed to foreign\n:religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth.\"
