It is an act of completion of a commercial activity.\n\nThe 'seller' or 'salesperson' â the provider of the goods or services â\ncompletes a sale in response to an acquisition or to an appropriation or to a\nrequest. There follows the passing of title (property or ownership) in the\nitem, and the application and due settlement of a price, the obligation for\nwhich arises due to the seller's requirement to pass ownership. Ideally, a\nseller agrees upon a price at which he willingly parts with ownership of or any\nclaim upon the item. The purchaser, though a party to the sale, does not\nexecute the sale, only the seller does that. To be precise the sale completes\nprior to the payment and gives rise to the obligation of payment. If the seller\ncompletes the first two above stages (consent and passing ownership) of the\nsale prior to settlement of the price, the sale remains valid and gives rise to\nan obligation to pay.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Sales","recorded":1362483583,"links":49,"instances":["economics","accounting","accounting","trade","sales"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sales|","Business","Business process","Business terms","Entrepreneurship"],"headings":["Sales techniques","Sales agents","The relationships between sales and marketing","Sales and marketing alignment and integration","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Ambox_question.svg/40px-Ambox_question.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Vegetable_seller_Porto_Covo_2008-2.jpg/220px-Vegetable_seller_Porto_Covo_2008-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Salesman_-beach_-_bikini-_sun-27Dec2008.jpg/220px-Salesman_-beach_-_bikini-_sun-27Dec2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["appropriation","economics"],["hawker","trade"],["profit","accounting"],["closing","sales"],["sales","accounting"]],"members":["appropriation","sales","profit","hawker","closing"],"related":["Selling","Takeover","Appropriation_(economics)","Pro_forma","Sales_outsourcing","Consultant","Complex_sales","Consignment","Telemarketing","Retail","Door-to-door","Hawker_(trade)","Request_for_proposal","Enterprise_sales","Business-to-business","Business-to-consumer","Electronic_Data_Interchange","Mail-order","Vending_machine","Selling_technique","Consultative_selling","Sales_enablement","Solution_selling","Conceptual_Selling","Strategic_Selling","Transactional_Selling","The_take_away","Manufacturers'_representative","Mediation","Sales_outsourcing","Profit_(accounting)","Justice","Honest","Sales_lead","Vending_machine","Telephone","Fair_Labor_Standards_Act","Closing_(sales)","Telemarketing","Upselling","Salesforce.com","LeadDesk","Marketing","Selling","Marketing","Advertising","Sales_promotion","Publicity","Public_relations","Sales_channels","New_product_development","Twitter","Facebook","Blog","Sales_process_engineering","Customer_service","Top_line","Bottom_line","Down_economy","Customer_service","Business-to-consumer","Business-to-business","Fast_moving_consumer_goods","Manufacturers'_representative","Messaging","Marketing_strategy","Buzzword","Choice_architecture","Customer_service","Demand_chain","Manufacturers'_representative","Point_of_sale","Retailing","Sales_(accounting)","Sales_Effectiveness","Sales_Incentive_Plan","Sales_contest","Sales_process_engineering","Sales_management","Sales_territory","Sales_variance","Selling","Trade","Financial_transaction","Vendor"]}
