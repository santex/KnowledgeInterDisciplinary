{"cursor":"1345","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'TEV protease' is a highly site-specific cysteine protease that is found in\nthe Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV). The optimum recognition site for this enzyme is\nthe sequence Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-(Gly/Ser) (ENLYFQ(G/S)) and cleavage occurs\nbetween the Gln and Gly/Ser residues. Some of the\nadvantages of this enzyme are its high specificity and its high activity rate.\nOne of the main uses of this protein is for removing affinity tags from purified\nproteins. This peptidase belongs to the C4 peptidase family.\n\nThe molecular weight of this enzyme varies between 25 and 27 kDa depending on\nthe specific construct used.\n","linknr":89,"url":"TEV_protease","recorded":1362484499,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://mcl1.ncifcrf.gov/waugh_tech/faq/tev.pdf"],"categories":["EC 3.4.22"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cysteine_protease","Tobacco_etch_virus","Enzyme"]}
