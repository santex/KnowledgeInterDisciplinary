People\nengage in a variety of sexual acts from time to time, and for a wide variety of\nreasons. Sexual activity normally results in sexual arousal and physiological\nchanges in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are\nmore subtle. Sexual activity also includes conduct and activities which are\nintended to arouse the sexual interest of another, such as strategies to find or\nattract partners (mating and display behavior), and personal interactions\nbetween individuals, such as flirting and foreplay.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral and\nbiological aspects, including physiological processes such as the\nreproductive mechanism, the sex drive and pathology; sexual intercourse and\nsexual behavior in all its forms; and personal bonding and shared emotions\nduring sexual activity.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage,\nalthough premarital and extramarital sex are also common. Some sexual activities\nare illegal either universally or in some countries, and some are considered\nagainst the norms of a society. For example, sexual activity with a person below\nsome age of consent and sexual assault in general are criminal offenses in most\njurisdictions.\n",
