Since the advent of the\nfirst commercially available devices in the mid-1980s the method has become\npopular owing to its ease of use, portability of the equipment and its\nrelatively low cost compared to some of the other methods of body composition\nanalysis. It is familiar in the consumer market as a simple instrument for\nestimating body fat.

TBW can be used to estimate fat-free body mass and, by\ndifference with body weight, body fat.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis","recorded":1362485115,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ake-nutrition.at/uploads/media/bia1_Kyle_et_al_01.pdf","http://www.ake-nutrition.at/uploads/media/bia2_Kyle_et_al_01.pdf","http://jap.physiology.org/content/60/4/1327.full.pdf","http://jap.physiology.org/content/60/4/1327.full.pdf"],"categories":["Health sciences","Electrophysiology"],"headings":["Accuracy","Historical background","Phase angle","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electrical_impedance","Total_body_water","Adiposity","Body_fat_meter","Dehydration","Electrical_resistance","Electrical_impedance","Electrical_impedance_tomography"]}
