It holds specific\nmeanings in accounting, where it can refer to accounts on a balance sheet that\nrepresent liabilities and non-cash-based assets used in accrual-based\naccounting. These types of accounts include, among others, accounts payable,\naccounts receivable, goodwill, deferred tax liability and future interest\nexpense.<ref name=\"accrualsipedia\"></ref>\n\nFor example, a company delivers a product to a customer who will pay for it 30\ndays later in the next fiscal year, which starts a week after the delivery. The\ncompany recognizes the proceeds as a revenue in its current income statement\nstill for the fiscal year of the delivery, even though it will get paid in cash\nduring the following accounting period.<ref name=\"accountingipedia\"></ref> The\nproceeds are also an accrued income (asset) on the balance sheet for the\ndelivery fiscal year, but not for the next fiscal year when cash is received.\n\nSimilarly, a salesperson, who sold the product, earned a commission at the\nmoment of sale (or delivery). The company will recognize the commission as an\nexpense in its current income statement, even though the salesperson will\nactually get paid at the end of the following week in the next accounting\nperiod.
