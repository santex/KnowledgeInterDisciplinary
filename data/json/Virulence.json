The pathogenicity of an organism\n- its ability to cause disease - is determined by its virulence factors.

Virulent can describe\neither disease severity or a pathogen's infectivity.

Virulence can be understood in terms of proximate\ncausesâthose specific traits of the pathogen that help make the host illâand\nultimate causesâthe evolutionary pressures that lead to virulent traits\noccurring in a pathogen strain.
