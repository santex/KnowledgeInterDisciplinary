{"cursor":"3119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Indirect self-reference' describes an object referring to itself indirectly.\n\nFor example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as\nan argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of\nthat argument is indirectly referring to itself.\n\nThis example is similar to the Scheme expression \"((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x\nx)))\", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation\nloops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An\nequivalent example can be formulated in lambda-calculus.\n\nIndirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not\nexplicit, as it is in the sentence \"this sentence is false.\" The phrase \"this\nsentence\" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-\nreferential sentence would replace the phrase \"this sentence\" with an\nexpression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the\npronoun \"this.\"\n\nAn example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the quine of a phrase to\nbe the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:\nis a sentence fragment would be: \"is a sentence fragment\" is a sentence fragment\nwhich, incidentally, is a true statement.\n\nNow consider the sentence: \"when quined, makes quite a statement\" when quined,\nmakes quite a statement\n\nThe quotation here, plus the phrase \"when quined,\" indirectly refers to the\nentire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the\nsentence, the phrase \"makes quite a statement,\" can now make a statement about\nthe sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have\nwritten something like \"this sentence makes quite a statement.\"\n\nIt seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when\nthey make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of mathematical\nlogic, there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising,\nin fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the Scheme example above\nuses a quine, and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.\n\nIndirect self-reference was studied in great depth by W. V. Quine (after whom\nthe operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of\nGÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem. Among the paradoxical statements developed by\nQuine is the following:\n\n \"yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation\" yields a false\n statement when preceded by its quotation\n","linknr":95,"url":"Indirect_self-reference","recorded":1363417896,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Self-reference","/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)","/wiki/Lambda-calculus","/wiki/Quine_(computing)","/wiki/Mathematical_logic","/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)","/wiki/Quine_(computing)","/wiki/W._V._Quine","/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)","/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator","/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","/wiki/Quine_(computing)","/wiki/Indirection","/wiki/Self-reference","/wiki/Diagonal_lemma","/wiki/Self-interpreter","/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach","/wiki/Actor_model","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&oldid=542854632","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Self-reference","/wiki/Category:Theoretical_computer_science","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+self-reference&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+self-reference","/wiki/Indirect_self-reference","/wiki/Talk:Indirect_self-reference","#","/wiki/Indirect_self-reference","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Indirect_self-reference","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Indirect_self-reference","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&oldid=542854632","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Indirect_self-reference&id=542854632","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Indirect+self-reference","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Indirect+self-reference&oldid=542854632&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_self-reference&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_self-reference","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["computing","mathematics","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Self-reference","Theoretical
