{"cursor":"10352","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] An 'oil filter' is a filter designed to remove contaminants from engine oil,\ntransmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters are used in\nmany different types of hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in\ninternal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft,\nand various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in\nautomatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil\nfilter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of\noil filters. Aside from these uses, oil production, transport, and recycling\nfacilities also employ filters in the manufacturing process.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Oil_filter","recorded":1362896636,"links":33,"instances":["mechanical","internal_combustion_engine","material","mechanical"],"pdf":["http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/809082-ZaIoEy/native/809082.pdf","http://avt.inel.gov/pdf/oilbypass/oilfilter_qtr4_03.pdf","http://www.documents.dgs.ca.gov/ofa/FAMS/evaloilfilters.pdf","http://avt.inel.gov/pdf/oilbypass/oilbypassfinalreport.pdf","http://www.kewengineering.co.uk/Papers/Filter_Location.pdf","http://www.kewengineering.co.uk/Papers/Filter_Location.pdf"],"categories":["Vehicle parts","Filters|Oil filter"],"headings":["Bypass and full-flow","Valves","Types of oil filter","Filter placement in an oil system","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Kfz-oelfilter-muenze.jpg/220px-Kfz-oelfilter-muenze.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Oil_filter_beneath_engine.JPG/220px-Oil_filter_beneath_engine.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Cartridge_filter.jpg/220px-Cartridge_filter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oil_pump","internal_combustion_engine"],["trash","material"],["bearing","mechanical"],["seal","mechanical"]],"members":["seal","oil_pump","trash","bearing"],"related":["Filtration","Engine_oil","Automatic_transmission_fluid","Hydraulic_fluid","Hydraulic_machinery","Internal-combustion_engine","Automobile","Aircraft","Naval","Automatic_transmission","Power_steering","Gas_turbine","Sieve","Oil_pump_(internal_combustion_engine)","Ernest_Sweetland","George_H._Greenhalgh","Portmanteau","Filter_paper","Trash_(material)","Magnet","Electromagnet","Ferromagnetic","Automatic_transmission","Gravity","Centrifugal_force","Centrifuge","Bearing_(mechanical)","Seal_(mechanical)","Nozzle","Micrometre","Air_filter","Fuel_filter","Impingement_filter","Oil-filter_wrench"]}
