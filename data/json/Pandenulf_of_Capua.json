He was the\nson and successor of Pando, but was removed on his father's death by his uncle\nthe bishop, Landulf II.\n\nOn Landulf's death, he reasserted his claim with the support of a large faction,\nthough he was opposed by Lando III. He took the cities of Teano and Caserta,\nwhile Lando's faction held Caiazzo and Calino. Landenulf had the support of\nGuaifer of Salerno, so Pandenulf tried to get Gaideris of Benevento and the\n[[strategos]] Gregory, then together in Benevento. They went to Nola, but\nPandenulf refused to do homage to Gaideris. The Beneventans and Greeks joined\nthe Salernitans in besieging Capua. The siege dragged on and soon only the\nprince of Benevento was left.\n\nMeanwhile, Pandenulf renewed his fidelity to the papacy, hoping to use Pope John\nVIII as leverage against his adversaries. The Capuans, however, had made\nLandulf, the young son of Lando, bishop in that city, but Pandenulf had him\nexpelled and tried to appoint his own brother Landenulf, though married, bishop.\nThis caused a schism in the Capuan church. Pandenulf sent his brother to Rome\ndemanding that the pope consecrate him. The bishop of Teano and the abbot of\nMontecassino urged John to resist the Capuan count, but John, wishing to retain\nhis loyalty and to satisfy both claimants, consecrated Landulf as bishop of Old\nCapua, now called Santa Maria Capua Vetere, and affirmed Landenful as bishop of\nNew Capua. Eventually, Pandenulf recognised Lando in Caiazzo, but there were\nother claimants to deal with.\n\nAfter Docibilis I of Gaeta broke with the pope over the Saracens, with whom\nDocibilis was allied, John authorised Pandenulf to seize papal possessions\ngoverned by Naples. Pandenulf's troops reduced the Gaetans to control only of\ntheir own peninsula, but Docibils called in the Saracens of Agropoli and retook\nFondi, ravaging the papal territory. Pandenulf was called back by events in\nCapua, however, and John was forced to make a treaty with Docibilis whereby the\nlatter became a papal vassal.\n\nPandenulf found a second ally in the person of Athanasius, duke-bishop of\nNaples. Wanting to keep the Capuans at war, Athanasius gladly entered the\nconflict. He was excommunicated at the time because he was allied with the\nSaracens. He thus transferred his allegiance to the Byzantines and besieged\nCapua. From April 881, he expelled Pandenulf and himself ruled in Capua as a\nvassal of Guaimar I of Salerno.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Pandenulf_of_Capua","recorded":1375082768,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Capua","/wiki/Pando_of_Capua","/wiki/Count_of_Capua","/wiki/Pando_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Lando_III_of_Capua","/wiki/Teano","/wiki/Caserta","/wiki/Caiazzo","/w/index.php?title=Calino&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Guaifer_of_Salerno","/wiki/Gaideris_of_Benevento","/wiki/Strategos","/w/index.php?title=Gregory_of_Bari&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Benevento","/wiki/Nola","/wiki/Papacy","/wiki/Pope_John_VIII","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Bishop_of_Teano","/wiki/Montecassino","/wiki/Santa_Maria_Capua_Vetere","/wiki/Docibilis_I_of_Gaeta","/wiki/Saracens","/wiki/Papal","/wiki/Agropoli","/wiki/Fondi","/wiki/Athanasius_of_Naples","/wiki/Duke_of_Naples","/wiki/Byzantine_Empire","/wiki/Guaimar_I_of_Salerno","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=edit&section=1","http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/erchempert.html","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Pando_of_Capua","/wiki/Count_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Landulf_II_of_Capua","/wiki/Count_of_Capua","/wiki/Lando_III_of_Capua","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&oldid=556659983","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Lombard_people","/wiki/Category:Counts_of_Capua","/wiki/Category:People_excommunicated_by_the_Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Category:9th-century_Italian_people","/wiki/Category:9th-century_rulers_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/wiki/Category:Place_of_birth_unknown","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pandenulf+of+Capua&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pandenulf+of+Capua","/wiki/Pandenulf_of_Capua","/wiki/Talk:Pandenulf_of_Capua","#","/wiki/Pandenulf_of_Capua","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pandenulf_of_Capua","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Pandenulf_of_Capua","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&oldid=556659983","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2498258","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Pandenulf_of_Capua&id=556659983","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Pandenulf+of+Capua","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Pandenulf+of+Capua&oldid=556659983&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Pandenulf_of_Capua&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%81_%D9%85%D9%86_%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A7","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandenulf_de_Capua","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%84_(%D0%BA%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8C_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B8)","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%84_(%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2498258#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.w
