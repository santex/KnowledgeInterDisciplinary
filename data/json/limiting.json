It\ncan also refer to a type of variable-gain audio level compression, in which the\ngain of an amplifier is changed very quickly to prevent the signal from going\nover a certain amplitude.\n\n*Hard limiting (\"clipping\")</i> is a limiting action in which there is **(a)\nover the permitted dynamic range, negligible variation in the expected\ncharacteristic of the output signal, and **(b) a steady-state signal, at the\nmaximum permitted level, for the duration of each period when the output would\notherwise be required to exceed the permitted dynamic range in order to\ncorrespond to the transfer function of the device. *Soft limiting is limiting\nin which the transfer function of a device is a function of its instantaneous\nor integrated output level. The output waveform is therefore distorted, but\nnot clipped.\n","title":"limiting","headings":["See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: Output","1: Clipping","1: Audio_level_compression","1: Dynamic_range","1: Transfer_function","1: Waveform","1: Dynamic_range_compression","1: Limiter"]}
