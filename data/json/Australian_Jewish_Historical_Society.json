The\nfirst president was Percy J. Marks. At the first business meeting of the\nSociety, the then president of the Royal Australian Historical Society K. R.\nCramp expressed the view that the chief object of the Society should be the\nencouragement of individual research. Australian Jewish Historical Society\nJournal, Volume I, Part 1. (1939)\n\nIn 1939, the Society published the first issue of the Australian Jewish\nHistorical Society Journal (initially known as the Australian Jewish Historical\nSociety, Journal and Proceedings).\n\nIn 1949, a Melbourne branch was established, which was informally known as\nAJHS(Vic). This branch grew and eventually incorporated. There is no national\nexecutive, with the Sydney and Melbourne Societies being financially\nindependent. Since 1988, the two Societies have shared the production of the\nJournal, with the June issues being produced by the NSW Society and the November\nissues being produced by the Vic Society. Currently, there are two issues of the\nJournal each year, with occasional Special Publications.\n\nThe table of contents of recent issues of the Journal have been placed online at\n[http://www.ajhs.info/journal www.ajhs.info/journal]. The cumulative index to\nthe Journal, by subject and category, is also available online at\n[http://www.ajhs.info/journal www.ajhs.info/journal/index]. This cumulative\nindex covers all Journal issues, but not special publications, from 1939 to\n2004. In 2007 AJHS (Vic) published a CD which holds in digital form all Journal\nissues published between 1939 and 1953. [http://www.ajhs.info/CD_2007.htm\nwww.ajhs.info/journal/CD_2007.htm]\n\nThe NSW chapter maintains extensive archives as well as a research library in\nMandelbaum House, a College of the University of Sydney. AJHS(Vic) has also\ncollected extensive archives, which were placed on indefinite loan to the State\nLibrary of Victoria in 2004. [http://www.ajhs.info/arc\nArchives, Records, and Libraries of the Australian Jewish Historical\nSociety]\n\nIn addition to the Sydney and Melbourne chapters, there is also a small Canberra-\nbased affiliate and there are members in all states and overseas.\n\nFrom 1977 to 2006, AJHS (Vic) members under the leadership of Beverley Davis\ntranscribed the headstones of over 40,000 Jewish graves in Australia and New\nZealand, as well as Jewish War Graves overseas. This\ncollection of burial data, called The BD-BD, was placed online in June 2008. [http://www.bd-\nbd.info Beverley Davis Burial Database]\n\nIn 2007, the Society under the leadership of AJHS (Vic) president Dr Howard\nFreeman made a notable but unsuccessful attempt to retain intact within\nAustralia the so-called Gurewicz\nArchives. [http://www.ajn.com.au/news/news.asp?pgID=5564 Community gets\nfresh chance to purchase Gurewicz Archive (29 May 2008) ] The Gurewicz Archives was collected by Rabbi Joseph Lipman Gurewicz,\nborn in Vilna in 1885. Rabbi Gurewicz arrived in Australia in 1932, becoming the\nspiritual head of the United Congregations of Carlton. He was an authority in\nHalachic matters. The Archives consists of files of documents covering all\nmatters related to Judaism and reflecting the variety of issues confronting\nMelbourne Jewry in the 1930s to 1950s. The New York purchaser removed much of\nthe holocaust material, rabbinic communications to Lithuania, Palestine,\nmaterial re Dunera, and sold the remainder at auction to the Jewish Museum of\nAustralia in June 2008.
