It has a highly unusual hexagonal design,\ninstead of the usual layout of churches. It lies within the Hamilton Presbytery\nof the Church of Scotland, in which it has the second-largest parish population.\nThe church was founded in 1968 to give a parish church to the new areas of St\nLeonards and Calderwood within the new town of East Kilbride. However, it wasn't\nuntil 1970 that the new church was built on a green-field site. It is one of the\nlargest churches in the Hamilton Presbytery in terms of members and by parish\npopulation. Over its 45-year history, it has had four ministers, the most recent\nleading the congregation from October 2003.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Claremont_Parish_Church","recorded":1375066460,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/East_Kilbride","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","http://www.claremontparishchurch.co.uk/","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/St_Leonards,_East_Kilbride","/wiki/Calderwood,_East_Kilbride","/wiki/East_Kilbride","#Mission_statement","#Ministries","#Worship","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=5","http://www.claremontparishchurch.co.uk/Claremont_Parish_Church/","http://www.ekthirdday.co.uk/main.html/","http://www.freewebs.com/claremontpatchpraise/","https://www.facebook.com/claremontchurch","/wiki/File:Scotstmargretschapel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Scotstmargretschapel.jpg/25px-Scotstmargretschapel.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Scotland-church-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Scotland-church-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scotland-church-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&oldid=563678552","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Scottish_church_stubs","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_coordinates","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claremont+Parish+Church&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claremont+Parish+Church","/wiki/Claremont_Parish_Church","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Claremont_Parish_Church","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Claremont_Parish_Church","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Claremont_Parish_Church","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&oldid=563678552","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Claremont_Parish_Church&id=563678552","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Claremont+Parish+Church","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Claremont+Parish+Church&oldid=563678552&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Claremont_Parish_Church&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont_Parish_Church","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1
