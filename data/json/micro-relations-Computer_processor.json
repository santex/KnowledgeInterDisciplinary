The term has been in use in\nthe computer industry at least since the early 1960s.\nThe form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of\ntheir history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.\n\nIn older computers, CPUs require one or more printed circuit boards. With the\ninvention of the microprocessor, a CPU could be contained within a single\nsilicon chip. The first computers to use microprocessors were personal computers\nand small workstations. Since the 1970s the microprocessor class of CPUs has\nalmost completely overtaken all other CPU implementations, to the extent that\neven mainframe computers use one or more microprocessors. Modern microprocessors\nare large scale integrated circuits in packages typically less than four\ncentimeters square, with hundreds of connecting pins.\n\nA computer can have more than one CPU; this is called multiprocessing. Some\nmicroprocessors can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip; those\nmicroprocessors are called multi-core processors.\n\nTwo typical components of a CPU are the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which\nperforms arithmetic and logical operations, and the control unit (CU), which\nextracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the\nALU when necessary.\n\nNot all computational systems rely on a central processing unit. An array\nprocessor or vector processor has multiple parallel computing elements, with no\none unit considered the \"center\". In the distributed computing model, problems\nare solved by a distributed interconnected set of processors.\n","linknr":722,"url":"Computer_processor","recorded":1362671089,"links":132,"instances":["mathematics","microarchitecture","computer_security","instruction_set","computer_science","integrated_circuit","computer_architecture","computers","computing","computer_science","data_type","brand","computing","microprocessor","computer_architecture","geometric","microarchitecture"],"pdf":["http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/interlisp/400004_1108UsersGuide_Sep88.pdf","http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/interlisp/400004_1108UsersGuide_Sep88.pdf","http://www.virtualtravelog.net/entries/2003-08-TheFirstDraft.pdf","http://www.virtualtravelog.net/entries/2003-08-TheFirstDraft.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/441/amdahl.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/441/amdahl.pdf","http://www.classiccmp.org/bitsavers/pdf/dec/pdp11/1103/EK-LSI11-TM-002.pdf","http://www.classiccmp.org/bitsavers/pdf/dec/pdp11/1103/EK-LSI11-TM-002.pdf","http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf","http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf"],"categories":["Central
