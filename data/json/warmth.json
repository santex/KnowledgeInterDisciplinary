Consequently, heat is transported to\n Earth as electromagnetic radiation. This is the main source of energy for\n life on Earth.]]\n\nIn physics and chemistry, 'heat' is energy transferred from one body to another\nby thermal interactions.<ref>Reif, F. (1965), pp. 67, 73.</ref><ref name=\"Kittel\nand Kroemer 1980\">Kittel, C. Kroemer, H. (1980). Thermal Physics, second\nedition, W.H. Freeman, San Francisco, ISBN 0-7167-1088-9, p. 227.</ref> The\ntransfer of energy can occur in a variety of ways, among them\nconduction,<ref>.</ref> radiation,<ref>Planck. M. (1914). The Theory of Heat\nRadiation, a translation by Masius, M. of the second German edition, P.\nBlakiston's Son & Co., Philadelphia.</ref> and convection. Heat is not a\nproperty of a system or body, but instead is always associated with a process of\nsome kind, and is synonymous with heat flow and heat transfer.\n\nHeat flow from hotter to colder systems occurs spontaneously, and is always\naccompanied by an increase in entropy. In a heat engine, internal energy of\nbodies is harnessed to provide useful work. The second law of thermodynamics\nstates the principle that heat cannot flow directly from cold to hot systems,\nbut with the aid of a heat pump external work can be used to transport internal\nenergy indirectly from a cold to a hot body.\n\nTransfers of energy as heat are macroscopic processes. The origin and properties\nof heat can be understood through the statistical mechanics of microscopic\nconstituents such as molecules and photons. For instance, heat flow can occur\nwhen the rapidly vibrating molecules in a high temperature body transfer some of\ntheir energy (by direct contact, radiation exchange, or other mechanisms) to the\nmore slowly vibrating molecules in a lower temperature body.\n\nThe SI unit of heat is the joule. Heat can be measured by calorimetry,<ref>,\nChapter III.</ref> or determined indirectly by calculations based on other\nquantities, relying for instance on the first law of thermodynamics. In\ncalorimetry, the concepts of [[latent heat]] and of [[sensible heat]] are used.\nLatent heat produces changes of state without temperature change, while sensible\nheat produces temperature change.\n",
