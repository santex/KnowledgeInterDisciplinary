He established the maroon community of San Basilio de Palenque some\ntime in the 16th century. He was betrayed and hanged by the governor of\nCartagena in 1619.\n\nThe former African king escaped from the slave port of Cartagena with ten others\nand founded San Basilio de Palenque, the legendary \"village of the CimarrÃ³ns\".\nIn 1713 it became \"the first free village in the Americas\" when the King of\nSpain gave up sending his troops on futile missions to attack their fortified\nmountain hideaway.\n\nHe is the great-great-great-great-grandfather of the late Afro-Colombian singer,\ncomposer and drummer, Paulino Salgado Valdez (Batata).\n\nAlso known as Domingo Bioho, he used a boat to travel down the Magdalena River\nto escape to freedom. He was recaptured, but escaped again in 1599 into the\nmarshy land southeast of Cartagena. He organized an army that came to dominate\nall of the Montes de Maria. He also formed an intelligence network that\ncollected and used information that would lead to the collapse of the city. He\norganized more escapes of runaway slaves to liberated territory, known as\nsettlement. He was named king of handguns. Benko's name corresponds to a place\neast of the Senegal River.\n\nUnable to defeat the Maroons, on July 18, 1605, the Governor of Cartagena,\nGerÃ³nimo de Suazo y Casasola, offered a peace treaty to Benkos Bioho,\nrecognizing the autonomy of the Palenque Matuna Bioho accepting that entered the\ncity armed and dressed in Spanish, while the arena promised not receive more\nferal or stimulate new leak or to use title of king. Peace will only be\nfinalized in 1612 under the governorship of Diego Fernandez de Velasco. The\ntreaty was violated by the Spanish in 1619 when walking carelessly Bioho was\ncaught by the guard of the wall and caught: he was hanged and quartered on 16\nMarch 1621. Governor Garcia Giron who ordered the execution, arguing that it was\ndangerous bitterly respect Bioho generated in the population and that \"lies and\nenchantment behind it takes all the nations of Guinea is in the city.\"\n\nBy the end of the seventeenth century in the area of Montes de Maria had over\n600 Maroons, under the command of Domingo Padilla, who claimed for himself the\ntitle of captain while his wife Jane adopted that of viceroy, and successfully\nchallenged attempts at sovereignty of the colonial authorities.\n\nHistorian Maria del Carmen Borrego Pla, using two subsets of the Archive of the\nIndies in Spain published a study on runaway blacks in Cartagena in the late\nseventeenth century, bordered on three geographic areas as well: the north in\nthe Sierra Luruaco composed of black Creoles and known by the names of Betancur\nand Matubere; the center in the Montes de Maria, with people longstanding\nMaroon, arranged in four runaway, but only mentioned two of them, San Miguel and\nthe Arenal, the south in the mountains of San Lucas, between the rivers\nMagdalena and Nechi, known as the palisades of Norosi and Cimarron, formed by\nblack Creoles.\n\nHe later called Palenque de San Basilio was a symbol of independence for runaway\nslaves, became the first Free People of America, by Royal decree of the King of\nSpain in the year 1713. There he speaks its own language so far from the Old\nPortuguese, including words from African languages. Africans captured and spoke\nin different languages in the boat dealers, to communicate, learn the Portuguese\nlanguage of their captors. When escape had not yet learned the Castilian and\ncame to the fence to talk in Portuguese.\n\nSan Basilio de Palenque was declared \"Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible\nHeritage of Humanity\" by UNESCO in 2005. http://www.unesco.org/archives/mul-\ntimedia/index.php?s=films_details&id_page=33&id_film=619 At about 50 miles\neast of Cartagena, on hills of strategic value were used as lookout
