Attributes such as colors or line styles can be selected in various\nways. For text, 35 fonts are available.\n\nXfig saves figures in its native text-only \"Fig\" format. Xfig has a facility to\nprint figures to a PostScript printer too. A convenient feature is the PSTEX or\nPDFTEX export format that allows a smooth integration of Xfig-generated images\ninto LaTeX documents.\n\nMost operations in Xfig are performed using the mouse, but some operations may\nalso be performed using keyboard accelerators (shortcuts). The interface is\ndesigned for a three-button mouse, although it is also possible to use a two\nbutton or a one button mouse with appropriate emulation, for example on a\nMacintosh under OS X.\n","linknr":205,"url":"Xfig","recorded":1362371509,"links":22,"instances":["programming_language","operating_system","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Free diagramming software","Free vector graphics editors","X Window programs","Linux vector graphics editors","1985 software"],"headings":["History","Imports","Exports","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Xfig-screenshot.png/250px-Xfig-screenshot.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["solaris","operating_system"],["tk","programming_language"]],"members":["c","solaris","tk"],"related":["C_(programming_language)","Xlib","Linux","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","FreeBSD","Solaris_(operating_system)","Vector_graphics_editor","Free_and_open_source","MIT_License","Free_and_open_source","Vector_graphics_editor","X_Window_System","Unix","Computing_platform","GIF","JPEG","Encapsulated_PostScript","PostScript","Font","PSTEX","PDFTEX","LaTeX","GIF","JPEG","PCX","Portable_Network_Graphics","Portable_pixmap","TIFF","XBM","X_PixMap","Encapsulated_PostScript","PostScript","GIF","JPEG","Portable_Network_Graphics","Portable_pixmap","XBM","X_PixMap","PCX","TIFF",".SLD","PostScript","PDF","HP-GL","Encapsulated_PostScript","SVG","Pic_language","Computer_Graphics_Metafile","MetaFont","MetaPost","Windows_Metafile","Tk_(programming_language)","List_of_vector_graphics_editors","Comparison_of_vector_graphics_editors","Jfig","WinFIG"]}
