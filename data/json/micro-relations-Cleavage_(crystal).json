{"cursor":"4476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" with prominent cleavage.]] 'Cleavage', in mineralogy, is the tendency of\n crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural\n planes. These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations\n of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that\n are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye. *\n Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed.,\n Wiley, ISBN 0-471-80580-7\n","linknr":184,"url":"Cleavage_(crystal)","recorded":1362375325,"links":46,"instances":["geometry","electronics","geometry","crystal_structure","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crystallography","Mineralogy"],"headings":["Types of cleavage","Parting","Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Fluorita_green.jpeg/220px-Fluorita_green.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Biotita1.jpeg/220px-Biotita1.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cube","geometry"],["prism","geometry"],["wafer","electronics"],["zincblende","crystal_structure"],["cleavage","geology"]],"members":["cube","wafer","prism","zincblende","cleavage"],"related":["Mineralogy","Crystallography","Miller_indices","Mica","Graphite","Cube_(geometry)","Table_salt","Halite","Galena","Octahedron","Diamond","Fluorite","Semiconductor","Dodecahedron","Rhombohedron","Calcite","Carbonate_mineral","Prismatic_surface","Prism_(geometry)","Cerussite","Tremolite","Spodumene","Crystal_twinning","Magnetite","Corundum","Pyroxene","Pyroxene","Amphibole","Electronics","Gemstone","Diamond_cutting","Semiconductor","Wafer_(electronics)","Silicon","Diamond","Diamond_cubic","Space_group","Gallium_arsenide","Indium_antimonide","Zincblende_(crystal_structure)","Cleavage_(geology)"]}
