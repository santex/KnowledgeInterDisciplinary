{"cursor":"7610","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'double agent', commonly abbreviated referral of 'double [[secret agent]]', is\na counterintelligence term used to designate an employee of a secret service or\norganization, whose primary aim is to spy on a different target organization,\nbut who in fact is a member of that same target organization themselves.\n\nDouble agentry may be practiced by spies of the target organization who\ninfiltrate the controlling organization, or may result from the turning\n(switching sides) of previously loyal agents of the controlling organization by\nthe target; the threat of execution is the most common method of turning a\ncaptured agent (working for an intelligence service) into a double agent\n(working for a foreign intelligence service) or a double agent into a '[[Double\nagent#Re-doubled agent|re-doubled agent]]'. It is unlike a defector, who is not\nconsidered an agent as agents are in place to function for an intelligence\nservice and defectors are not, but some consider that defectors in place are\nagents until they have defected.\n\nDouble agents are often used to transmit disinformation or to identify other\nagents as part of counter-espionage operations. They are often very trusted by\nthe controlling organization since the target organization will give them true,\nbut useless or even counterproductive, information to pass along.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"re-doubled_agent","recorded":1371065238,"links":[],"instances":["espionage","alias_garbo","spies","spy","espionage","spy","espionage"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Double agents|*","Spies by role","Military command staff occupations"],"headings":["Double agents","Re-doubled agent","Triple agent","Events in which double agents played an important role","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["mole","espionage"],["richard_willis","spy"],["mutt_and_jeff","spies"],["juan_pujol","alias_garbo"],["red_orchestra","espionage"],["april_fool","spy"],["mole","espionage"],["dangle","espionage"]],"members":["dangle","juan_pujol","mutt_and_jeff","april_fool","red_orchestra","richard_willis","mole"],"related":["Counterintelligence","Spy","Defector","Disinformation","Counterintelligence","Mole_(espionage)","Samuel_Morland","Richard_Willis_(spy)","Benedict_Arnold","Mata_Hari","Mathilde_Carré","Roman_Czerniawski","Eddie_Chapman","Abwehr","United_Kingdom","Iron_Cross","Roger_Grosjean","Christiaan_Lindemans","Arthur_Owens","Dusan_Popov","Mutt_and_Jeff_(spies)","Juan_Pujol_(alias_Garbo)","Johann_Wenzel","Red_Orchestra_(espionage)","William_G._Sebold","FBI","Aldrich_Ames","CIA","KGB","Cambridge_Five","John_Cairncross","Bletchley_Park","Anthony_Blunt","Guy_Burgess","MI5","Donald_Duart_Maclean","Kim_Philby","George_Blake","Oleg_Gordievsky","Matei_Pavel_Haiducu","Dmitri_Polyakov","Glavnoye_Razvedyvatel'noye_Upravleniye","Robert_Hanssen","Soviet_Union","Oleg_Kalugin","Prague_Spring","Boris_Yeltsin","Oleg_Penkovskiy","Denis_Donaldson","Sinn_Féin","Kevin_Fulton","Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","Freddie_Scappaticci","Robert_Nairac","April_Fool_(spy)","Saddam_Hussein","Iyman_Faris","FBI","Al-Qaeda","Mikel_Lejarza","ETA","Katrina_Leung","China","Ashraf_Marwan","Vitaly_Yurchenko","Henri_Déricourt","Secret_Intelligence_Service","Special_Operations_Executive","Babington_plot","Operation_Overlord","Stormontgate","Cold_War","Battle_of_Lexington","Vietnam_War","War_on_Terrorism","1973_Yom_Kippur_War","Duquesne_Spy_Ring","List_of_fictional_double_agents","Espionage","Mole_(espionage)","Double_Cross_System","Dangle_(espionage)","Clandestine_HUMINT","Clandestine_HUMINT_operational_techniques","Counterintelligence","Treason","Undercover"]}
