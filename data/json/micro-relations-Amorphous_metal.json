{"cursor":"15627","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'amorphous metal' (also known 'metallic glass' or 'glassy metal') is a solid\nmetallic material, usually an alloy, with a disordered atomic-scale structure.\nMost metals are crystalline in their solid state, which means they have a highly\nordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals are non-crystalline, and have a\nglass-like structure. But unlike common glasses, such as window-glass, which are\ntypically insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity. There\nare several ways in which amorphous metals can be produced, including extremely\nrapid cooling, physical vapor deposition, solid-state reaction, ion irradiation,\nand mechanical alloying. Some scientists only consider amorphous metals\nproduced by rapid cooling from a liquid state to be glasses. However, materials\nscientists commonly consider a glass to be any solid non-crystalline material,\nregardless of how it is produced.\n\nIn the past, small batches of amorphous metals have been produced through a\nvariety of quick-cooling methods. For instance, amorphous metal wires have been\nproduced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk (melt spinning).\nThe rapid cooling, on the order of millions of degrees a second, is too fast for\ncrystals to form and the material is \"locked in\" in a glassy state. More\nrecently a number of alloys with critical cooling rates low enough to allow\nformation of amorphous structure in thick layers (over 1 millimeter) had been\nproduced; these are known as 'bulk metallic glasses' ('BMG'). Liquidmetal sells\na number of titanium-based BMGs, developed in studies originally carried out at\nCaltech. More recently, batches of amorphous steel have been produced that\ndemonstrate strengths much greater than conventional steel alloys.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Amorphous_metal","recorded":1362481753,"links":28,"instances":["electricity","mechanics","metallurgy","casting","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6X1J-4BSCDTG-R-M&_cdi=7244&_user=10&_pii=S1369702104001245&_origin=search&_zone=rslt_list_item&_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2004&_sk=999929996&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkzV&md5=104fc8b85860bed5084ae3b29beeade4&ie=/sdarticle.pdf","http://www.metglas.com/downloads/lit/amor_elec_pow_dist_appl.pdf","http://www.vacuumschmelze.de/dynamic/docroot/medialib/documents/pdf/fipublikationen/AmorphousNano_1996.pdf"],"categories":["Metallurgy","Alloys","Amorphous metals"],"headings":["History","Properties","Applications","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Bulk_Metallic_Glass_Sample.jpg/220px-Bulk_Metallic_Glass_Sample.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["insulator","electricity"],["tesla","unit"],["flux","metallurgy"],["tension","mechanics"],["shrinkage","casting"]],"members":["insulator","tension","flux","shrinkage","tesla"],"related":["Metal","Alloy","Crystal","Atom","Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses","Insulator_(electricity)","Electrical_conductivity","Extremely_rapid_cooling","Physical_vapor_deposition","Solid-state_reaction","Ion_irradiation","Mechanical_alloying","Materials_science","Melt_spinning","Liquidmetal","Caltech","Alloy","Caltech","Pol_Duwez","Mega-","Kelvin","Micrometre","Palladium","Critical_cooling_rate","Melt_spinning","Iron","Nickel","Phosphorus","Boron","Amorphous_metal_transformer","Curie_temperature","Tesla_(unit)","Boron_oxide","Flux_(metallurgy)","Tohoku_University","Caltech","Zirconium","Palladium","Iron","Titanium","Copper","Magnesium","Vitreloy","United_States_Department_of_Energy","NASA","Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","University_of_Virginia","Magnetic","Room_temperature","Alloy","Grain_boundary","Wear","Corrosion","Toughness","Atomic_radius","Supercooled","Boron","Silicon","Phosphorus","Iron","Cobalt","Nickel","Magnetic_susceptibility","Coercivity","Electrical_resistance","Eddy_current","Transformer","Magnetic_core","Dislocations","Vitreloy","Titanium","Ductile","Tension_(mechanics)","Metal_matrix_composite","Injection_molding","Polymers","High_velocity_oxygen_fuel","Elastic_modulus","Bone","Wear_resistance","Shrinkage_(casting)","Biomaterial","Bone","Amorphous_metal_transformer","Electronic_article_surveillance","New_Scientist","Glass-ceramic-to-metal_seals","Materials_science","Bioabsorbable_metallic_glass","Liquidmetal","Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses"]}
