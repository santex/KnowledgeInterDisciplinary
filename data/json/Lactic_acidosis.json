The condition typically occurs when cells\nreceive too little oxygen (hypoxia), for example, during vigorous exercise. In\nthis situation, impaired cellular respiration leads to lower pH levels.\nSimultaneously, cells are forced to metabolize glucose anaerobically, which\nleads to lactate formation. Therefore, elevated lactate is indicative of tissue\nhypoxia, hypoperfusion, and possible damage. Lactic acidosis is characterized by\nlactate levels >5Â mmol/L and serum pH \n","linknr":348,"url":"Lactic_acidosis","recorded":1362503055,"links":26,"instances":["medical","circulatory"],"pdf":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002967.pub4/pdf","http://compphys.bio.uci.edu/bennett/pubs/80.pdf"],"categories":["Acid-base disturbances"],"headings":["Pathophysiology","Symptoms","Classification","Causes","Associated conditions","In animals","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg/230px-Lactic-acid-skeletal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["shock","circulatory"]],"members":["hypoxia","shock"],"related":["Lactic_acid","Acidosis","Lactic_acid","D-lactate","Metabolic_acidosis","Hypoxia_(medical)","Glucose","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Hypoxia_(medical)","Hypoperfusion","Glucose","Carbon_dioxide","Pyruvate","Glycolysis","Mitochondria","Krebs_cycle","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","ATP_hydrolysis","Protons","Hypoxia_(medical)","Lactic_acid","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Protons","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Congenital_disorders","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Liver","Kidney","Phenformin","Antiretroviral","Mitochondrial_toxicity","Arsenic_poisoning","Metabolic_acidosis","Nausea","Vomiting","Hyperventilation","Lethargy","Anxiety","Anemia","Hypotension","Cardiac_dysrhythmia","Tachycardia","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Mitochondrial_encephalomyopathy,_lactic_acidosis,_and_stroke-like_episodes","Diabetes_mellitus_and_deafness","Glucose-6-phosphatase_deficiency","Fructose_bisphosphatase_deficiency","Pyruvate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Pyruvate_carboxylase_deficiency","Phenformin","Metformin","Isoniazid","Nucleoside","Reverse_transcriptase_inhibitors","Potassium_cyanide","Cyanide_poisoning","Hemorrhage","Sepsis","Shock_(circulatory)","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Bowel_ischemia","Cellulitis","Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","Burkitt_lymphoma","Rigor_mortis","Muscles","Adenosine_triphosphate","Vitamin_B1","Reptiles","Glycolysis","PH","Metabolic_acidosis"]}
