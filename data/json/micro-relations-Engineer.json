Engineers design materials, structures and systems while\nconsidering the limitations imposed by practicality, safety and cost. The word engineer is derived from the Latin\nroots ingeniare (\"to contrive, devise\") and ingenium (\"cleverness\"). Oxford\nConcise Dictionary, 1995 \"engineer\". Oxford Dictionaries. April 2010.\nOxford Dictionaries. April 2010. Oxford University Press. 22 October 2011\n\nEngineers are grounded in applied sciences, and their work in research and\ndevelopment is distinct from the basic research focus of scientists. Science is knowledge based on observed facts and tested truths\narranged in an orderly system that can be validated and communicated to other\npeople. Engineering is the creative application of scientific principles used to\nplan, build, direct, guide, manage, or work on systems to maintain and improve\nour daily lives. The work of engineers forms the link between scientific\ndiscoveries and their subsequent applications to human needs and quality of\nlife.\n","linknr":621,"url":"Engineer","recorded":1362552511,"links":90,"instances":["human_resources","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf","http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf","http://www.ospe.on.ca/pdf/Newsletter-Feb-2002.pdf"],"categories":["Engineering occupations","Engineers|*","Science occupations"],"headings":["Roles and expertise","Ethics","Education","Regulation","Perception","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Conference_of_Engineers_at_the_Menai_Straits_Preparatory_to_Floating_one_of_the_Tubes_of_the_Britannia_Bridge_by_John_Lucas.jpg/250px-Conference_of_Engineers_at_the_Menai_Straits_Preparatory_to_Floating_one_of_the_Tubes_of_the_Britannia_Bridge_by_John_Lucas.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-23805-1665%2C_Ingenieure_mit_Konstruktionsplan.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-23805-1665%2C_Ingenieure_mit_Konstruktionsplan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Challenger_explosion.jpg/220px-Challenger_explosion.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Fultonnshc.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["risk_analysis","engineering"],["competence","human_resources"]],"members":["competence","risk_analysis"],"related":["John_Seymour_Lucas","Profession","Applied_science","Engineering_education","Research_and_development","Industry","Business","Scientist","Architect","Project_manager","Profession","Engineering","Scientific_knowledge","Mathematics","Ingenuity","Latin","Applied_science","Research_and_development","Basic_research","Scientist","Engineering_design_process","Engineering_analysis","Time_and_motion_study","Risk_analysis_(engineering)","List_of_engineering_branches","Work_sampling","Information_seeking","Competence_(human_resources)","Engineering_ethics","Engineering_societies","Business_ethics","Iron_Ring","Engineer's_Ring","The_Ritual_of_the_Calling_of_an_Engineer","Order_of_the_Engineer","Educational_accreditation","Washington_Accord","Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology","Professional_Engineer","Post-nominal_letters","European_Engineer","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Petition","Education","Fundamentals_of_Engineering_exam","Professional_Engineer","APEGBC","Continental_Europe","Latin_America","Turkey","Italy","Portugal","Czech_Republic","Greece","United_States_Capitol","Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel","George_Stephenson","Thomas_Telford","Indian_subcontinent","Russia","China","Egypt","Education_in_Egypt","Egyptian_universities","Popular_culture","Nerd","Dilbert","Science_fiction","Management","Engineering","Engineer's_degree","Engineers_Without_Borders","Greatest_Engineering_Achievements","History_of_engineering","List_of_engineering_branches","List_of_engineers","List_of_fictional_scientists_and_engineers","Washington_Accord"]}
