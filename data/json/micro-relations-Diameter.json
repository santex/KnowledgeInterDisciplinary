{"cursor":"6522","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn geometry, the 'diameter' of a circle is any straight line segment that passes\nthrough the center of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle. It can\nbe also defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also\nvalid for the diameter of a sphere. The word \"diameter\" is derived from Greek\nÎ´Î¹Î¬Î¼ÎµÏÏÎ¿Ï (diametros), \"diameter of a circle\", from Î´Î¹Î±- (dia-), \"across,\nthrough\" + Î¼Î­ÏÏÎ¿Î½ (metron),\n\"measure\". [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diameter Online\nEtymology Dictionary]\n\nIn more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In\nthis sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to\nthe line itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same\nlength, this being twice the radius.\n\n: d = 2r.\n\nFor a convex shape in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest\ndistance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to\nits boundary, and the width is defined to be the smallest such distance.\nBoth quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating\ncalipers. {{cite journal\n| author = Toussaint, Godfried T. title = Solving geometric problems with the\n| rotating calipers publisher=Proc.
