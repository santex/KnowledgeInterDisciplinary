{"cursor":"30572","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn philosophy, the theory of 'materialism' holds that the only thing that exists\nis matter or energy; that all things are composed of material and all phenomena\n(including consciousness) are the result of material interactions. In other\nwords, matter is the only substance, and reality is identical with the actually\noccurring states of energy and matter.\n\nTo many philosophers, 'materialism' is synonymous with 'physicalism'. However,\nmaterialists have historically held that everything is made of matter, but\nphysics has shown that gravity, for example, is not made of matter in the\ntraditional sense of \"'an inert, senseless substance, in which extension,\nfigure, and motion do actually subsist'â¦ So it is tempting to use 'physicalism'\nto distance oneself from what seems a historically important but no longer\nscientifically relevant thesis of materialism, and related to this, to emphasize\na connection to physics and the physical sciences.\" Therefore much of the generally philosophical\ndiscussion below on materialism may be relevant to physicalism.\n\nAlso related to materialism are the ideas of methodological naturalism (i.e.\n\"let's at least do science as though physicalism is true\") and metaphysical\nnaturalism (i.e. \"the physical world is all that exists\").\n\nContrasting philosophies include idealism, other forms of monism, dualism, and\npluralism.\n","linknr":1101,"url":"Materialism","recorded":1362483078,"links":107,"instances":["philosophy","philosophy_of_mind","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy_of_mind","philosophy","author","illusion","anthropology","philosopher","religion","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://people.umass.edu/schaffer/papers/Fundamental.pdf"],"categories":["Materialism|","Metaphysical
