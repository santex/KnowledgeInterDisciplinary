{"cursor":"36239","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the former British Empire, the present-day Commonwealth, a 'preparatory\nschool' (usually abbreviated to 'prep school') is an independent school\npreparing children up to the age of eleven or thirteen for entry into fee-\ncharging, secondary independent schools, some of which are known as public\nschools. Most British prep schools are primarily day schools, but many also take\nboarders. In Northern Ireland, preparatory departments are fee-paying schools\nwhich cater for children between the ages of four and eleven. They are usually\npart of a grammar school, to which the majority of pupils will go upon leaving\nthe preparatory department at the age of eleven.\n\nA 'pre-prep' or 'pre-preparatory' school is a school similar to a modern\npreschool or nursery school for two- or three-year-olds to 4, 5 or 6 for girls\nand 6, 7 and 8 for boys.\n\nThis use of the term in the UK is different from United States and\nCanadian usage, where a \"prep school\" is a university-preparatory school\nfor older pupils.\n\nBoys' prep schools are generally for eight- to thirteen-year olds (sometimes 6\nor 7 to 13), when most pupils take the Common Entrance Examination for entry\ninto a secondary independent school. Before the age of seven or eight, the term\n\"pre-prep school\" is used. Thus, most independently educated boys will go to a\npre-prep school from the age of four until eight, then from eight to thirteen to\na prep school, and from thirteen to an independent secondary school.\n\nGirls' private schools in England tend to follow the age ranges of state schools\nmore closely than those for boys. A girls' preparatory school will usually admit\ngirls from the age of four or five, and they will continue to another\nindependent school at eleven, but if the school is co-educational, may stay on\nto 13. However, as more girls now go on to formerly single-sex boys' schools\nwhich have become co-educational, the separation is less clear.\n\nThe Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) is the prep schools'\nheads' association serving the top 500+ independent prep schools in the UK and\nworldwide, with a total of 130,000 pupils.\n","linknr":1242,"url":"Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)","recorded":1363503088,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Independent_school_(UK)","/wiki/Secondary_education","/wiki/Public_school_(UK)","/wiki/Boarding_school","/wiki/Independent_school_(UK)","/wiki/Grammar_school","/wiki/Preschool","/wiki/Nursery_school","/wiki/University-preparatory_school","/wiki/Common_Entrance_Examination","/wiki/Co-educational","/wiki/Incorporated_Association_of_Preparatory_Schools","#List_of_British_Preparatory_schools","#Former_British_prep_schools","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lists#Incomplete_lists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","/wiki/Abberley_Hall_School","/wiki/Worcestershire","/wiki/The_Abbey_School,_Reading","/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Abbotsford_Preparatory_School","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Urmston","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Abercorn_School","/wiki/London","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Aberdour_School","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Gordonstoun","/wiki/Duffus","/wiki/Moray","/wiki/Abingdon_Preparatory_School","/wiki/Frilford","/wiki/Oxfordshire","/wiki/Aldwickbury_School","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/Alleyn_Court_Prep_School","/wiki/Westcliff-on-Sea","/wiki/All_Hallows_Preparatory_School","/wiki/Shepton_Mallet","/w/index.php?title=Aldenham_Prep_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Elstree","/wiki/Aldro","/wiki/Shackleford","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Nairn","/wiki/Inverness-shire","/wiki/Cheshire","/wiki/Amberley_House_School","/wiki/Clifton,_Bristol","/wiki/Amesbury_School","/wiki/Hindhead","/wiki/Haslemere","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Ardvreck_School","/wiki/Crieff","/wiki/Perthshire","/wiki/Arnold_Lodge_School","/wiki/Leamington_Spa","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/Ashbridge_School","/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire","/wiki/Ashdell_Preparatory_School","/w/index.php?title=Sheffield,_Yorkshire&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.ashdellprep.co.uk/","/wiki/Ashfold_School","/wiki/Dorton","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Ashford_School","/wiki/Ashford,_Kent","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Ashdown_House,_East_Sussex","/wiki/East_Sussex","/wiki/Aysgarth_School","/wiki/North_Yorkshire","/wiki/Ballyclare","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/Barrow_Hills_School","/wiki/Witley","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Bancroft%27s_School","/wiki/Woodford_Green","/wiki/Barfield_School","/wiki/Farnham","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Brackley","/wiki/Northants","/wiki/Beaudesert_Park_School","/wiki/Minchinhampton","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki/Bedford_Preparatory_School","/wiki/Bedfordshire","/wiki/Liverpool","/wiki/Beechwood_Park_School","/wiki/Markyate","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/Oswestry_School","/wiki/Oswestry","/wiki/Shropshire","/wiki/Mill_Hill","/wiki/Berkhamsted_School","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/w/index.php?title=Boundary_Oak_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bickley_Park_School&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.bickleyparkschool.co.uk/","/wiki/Bilton_Grange","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Rugby,_Warwickshire","/wiki/Birmingham_Blue_Coat_School","/wiki/Edgbaston,_Birmingham","/wiki/Brentwood_Preparatory_School","/wiki/Worthing","/wiki/West_Sussex","/wiki/Brockhurst_and_Marlston_House_School","/wiki/Hermitage,_Berkshire","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Brooklands_Preparatory_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Broughton_Manor_Preparatory_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-autogenerated1-8","/wiki/Burys_Court_School","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Leigh,_Surrey","http://www.butehouse.org","/wiki/Liverpool","/wiki/Caldicott_School","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Simon_Doggart","/w/index.php?title=Castle_Court_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Wimborne,_Dorset","/w/index.php?title=Caterham_Preparatory_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Caterham","/wiki/Surrey","/w/index.php?title=Chard_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-13","/wiki
