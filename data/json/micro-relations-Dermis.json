Zone B, indicating the\nregion of overlapping projections of epithelium and connective tissue, is the\npapillary dermis. Zone C, indicating the region of dermis that lies immediately\nsubjacent to the interdigitations of epithelium, is the reticular dermis.]] The\n'dermis' is a layer of skin between the epidermis (with which it makes up the\ncutis) and subcutaneous tissues, that consists of connective tissue and cushions\nthe body from stress and strain. It is divided into two layers, the superficial\narea adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker\narea known as the reticular dermis.

The\ndermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane.\nStructural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and\nextrafibrillar matrix (previously called ground substance).

It also contains Mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and\nheat, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic\nvessels and blood vessels. Those blood vessels provide nourishment and waste\nremoval for both dermal and epidermal cells.\n","linknr":591,"url":"Dermis","recorded":1362897740,"links":52,"instances":["biology","anatomy","anatomy","physics","biology","biology","skin"],"pdf":["http://microvet.arizona.edu/Courses/vsc422/secure/VSC422AppledHistologyLabHandout.pdf"],"categories":["Skin anatomy","Routes of administration"],"headings":["Components of the Dermis","Layers","Additional images","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/EpidermisPainted.svg/250px-EpidermisPainted.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Normal_Epidermis_and_Dermis_with_Intradermal_Nevus_10x.JPG/120px-Normal_Epidermis_and_Dermis_with_Intradermal_Nevus_10x.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Skin.png/117px-Skin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/58px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg/58px-Hexaaquatitanium%28III%29-solution.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Inhaler.jpg/58px-Inhaler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Glycerin_suppositories.jpg/58px-Glycerin_suppositories.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/SPF15SunBlock.JPG/58px-SPF15SunBlock.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Injection_Syringe_01.jpg/58px-Injection_Syringe_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg/52px-Nuvola_apps_filetypes_red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","skin"],["cutis","anatomy"],["stress","biology"],["epidermis","skin"],["epidermis","skin"],["epidermis","skin"],["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["matrix","biology"],["elasticity","physics"],["epidermis","skin"],["elasticity","physics"],["elasticity","physics"],["nail","anatomy"],["epidermis","skin"]],"members":["stress","cutis","nail","elasticity","matrix","cell","epidermis"],"related":["Terminologia_Histologica","Epithelium","Connective_tissue","Epithelium","Connective_tissue","Papillary_dermis","Reticular_dermis","Skin","Epidermis_(skin)","Cutis_(anatomy)","Subcutaneous_tissue","Connective_tissue","Body","Stress_(biology)","Epidermis_(skin)","Papillary_dermis","Reticular_dermis","Epidermis_(skin)","Basement_membrane","Collagen","Elastic_fiber","Ground_substance","Mechanoreceptor","Touch","Heat","Hair_follicles","Sweat_glands","Sebaceous_glands","Apocrine_glands","Lymphatic_vessels","Blood_vessels","Blood_vessels","Epidermis_(skin)","Cell_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Fibroblasts","Macrophages","Adipocytes","Cell_(biology)","Matrix_(biology)","Collagen","Strength_of_materials","Elastin","Elasticity_(physics)","Glycosaminoglycans","Areolar_connective_tissue","Epidermis_(skin)","Blood","Capillaries","Meissner's_corpuscles","Connective_tissue","Collagenous","Elasticity_(physics)","Reticular","Protein","Strength_of_materials","Extensibility","Elasticity_(physics)","Roots_of_the_hair","Sebaceous_glands","Sweat_glands","Cutaneous_receptor","Nail_(anatomy)","Blood_vessels","Dermal_papillae","Skin","Epidermis_(skin)","List_of_cutaneous_conditions"]}
