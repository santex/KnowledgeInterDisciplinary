{"cursor":"6927","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cajal bodies' (CBs) are spherical sub-organelles of 0.3-1.0 Âµm in diameter\nfound in the nucleus of proliferative cells like embryonic cells and tumor\ncells, or metabolically active cells like neurons. In contrast to cytoplasmic\norganelles, CBs lack any phospholipid membrane which would separate their\ncontent, largely consisting of proteins and RNA, from the surrounding\nnucleoplasm. They were first reported by Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal in 1903, who\ncalled them nucleolar accessory bodies due to their association with the\nnucleoli in neuronal cells. They were rediscovered by\nelectron microscopists and named coiled bodies, according to their appearance as\ncoiled threads on EM images, and later renamed after their\ndiscoverer. Research on CBs was accelerated after discovery and\ncloning of the marker protein p80/Coilin. CBs have been implicated in\nRNA-related metabolic processes such as snRNPs biogenesis, maturation and\nrecycling, histone mRNA processing and telomere maintenance. CBs assemble RNA\nwhich is used by telomerase to add nucleotides to the ends of\ntelomeres.\n","linknr":253,"url":"Cajal_body","recorded":1362374374,"links":18,"instances":["genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles","Nuclear substructures|S","Cell nucleus","Cell anatomy","Telomeres"],"headings":["History","Localization","CBs and cell cycle","Functions","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Cajal_bodies.jpg/220px-Cajal_bodies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription","cell"],"related":["Cell_nucleus","Cell_(biology)","Embryonic_cell","Tumor_cell","Neuron","Organelle","Nucleoplasm","Santiago_Ramón_y_Cajal","Nucleolus","Electron_microscope","Molecular_cloning","Coilin","SnRNP","Histone","Ångström","Ribonucleoproteins","Protease","RNase","Micrometre","Transcription_(genetics)","Nucleolus","Coilin"]}
