{"cursor":"1557","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'algal mat' is a layer of usually filamentous algae on marine or fresh water\nsoft bottoms. It may be considered one of many types of microbial mats. Algae\nand cyanobacteria are ubiquitous, often forming within the water column and\nsettling to the bottom. In shallow environments, they are often dessiccated and\nrevived with the next introduction of water and sunlight. Stromatolites can\nform in this way (see Shark Bay for a modern example). Any puddle of water can\nstart the process - sunlight initiates the process and photosynthesis soon\ncreates a green layer within the puddle. The puddle can dry up and leave a thin\nlayer of 'algal' mat and even leave mudcracks behind. Cyclicity involves the\nrepeated process of wetting (rain), algal production, and redrying of the new\ndeposit. This results in layer upon layer of algal mats and intervening thin\nlayers of mud.\n\nIn the fossil record, many examples have been uncovered including sediments with\nthe mudcracks preserved and even raindrop impressions preserved. If some animal\nenters the process, even simply a fly, it has a chance of being preserved within\nthe deposited sequence. It may be more likely, however, to find something with a\nmore easily preserved shell, for example a snail.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Algal_mat","recorded":1362372783,"links":22,"instances":["ocean"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Algae"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Floating_Algal_Mats_%287634604112%29.jpg/220px-Floating_Algal_Mats_%287634604112%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Diatoms_through_the_microscope.jpg/140px-Diatoms_through_the_microscope.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Algae_Graphic.svg/30px-Algae_Graphic.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["marine","ocean"]],"members":["marine"],"related":["Algae","Marine_(ocean)","Fresh_water","Microbial_mat","Cyanobacteria","Water_column","Water","Sunlight","Stromatolites","Shark_Bay","Photosynthesis","Mudcrack"]}
