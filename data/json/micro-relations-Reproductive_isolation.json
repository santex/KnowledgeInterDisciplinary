These\nbarriers maintain the integrity of a species over time, reducing or directly\nimpeding gene flow between individuals of different species, allowing the\nconservation of each speciesâ characteristics.

Sinauer, Sunderland.\n\nThe mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been classified in a number of\nways. Zoologist Ernst Mayr classified the mechanisms of reproductive isolation\nin two broad categories: those that act before fertilization (or before mating\nin the case of animals, which are called pre-copulatory) and those that act\nafter. Mayr, E. 1963. Animal species and evolution. Harvard\nUniversity Press, Cambridge. These have also been termed pre-zygotic and\npost-zygotic mechanisms. The different mechanisms of reproductive isolation are\ngenetically controlled and it has been demonstrated experimentally that they can\nevolve in species whose geographic distribution overlaps (sympatric speciation)\nor as the result of adaptive divergence that accompanies allopatric speciation.\n","linknr":812,"url":"Reproductive_isolation","recorded":1362483534,"links":67,"instances":["biology","genetics","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/92/7/2519.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/92/7/2519.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/J34304U409014847.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/J34304U409014847.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/961M60U76M48R041.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/961M60U76M48R041.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/K31883P470070686.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/K31883P470070686.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/A13752227816PP66.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/A13752227816PP66.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/N38612VR74403183.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/N38612VR74403183.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/L3421R018J180520.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/L3421R018J180520.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/124/4/909.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/124/4/909.pdf","http://www.bio.psu.edu/people/faculty/nei/lab/1998-nei-zhang2.pdf","http://www.bio.psu.edu/people/faculty/nei/lab/1998-nei-zhang2.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/97/10/5313.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/97/10/5313.pdf","http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf","http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf","http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf","http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/YH2X8LC80NK9WDX8.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/YH2X8LC80NK9WDX8.pdf","http://evodevo.uoregon.edu/PDF%20files/Shoemaker_et_al(1999).pdf","http://evodevo.uoregon.edu/PDF%20files/Shoemaker_et_al(1999).pdf","http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf","http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf","http://www.open.ac.uk/science/biosci/personalpages/j.silvertown/pdfs/Silvertown%20et%20al.%202005%20Heredity.pdf","http://www.open.ac.uk/science/biosci/personalpages/j.silvertown/pdfs/Silvertown%20et%20al.%202005%20Heredity.pdf","http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf"],"categories":["Reproduction","Pollination","Genetics","Evolutionary
