{"cursor":"4260","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Edmond Warre' C.V.O. (12 February 1837 – 22 January 1920) was an English\nrower and head master of Eton College from 1884 to 1905. )]] Warre\nwas born in London, the son of Henry Warre, of Bindon House, near Wellington. He\nwas educated at Eton, where he was an exact contemporary of Algernon Charles\nSwinburne, and then at Balliol College, Oxford, where he had a distinguished\nuniversity career, taking a double first (1856 and 1859). He was an outstanding\noarsman and at Eton he won the School Pulling for coxed pairs. At Oxford, he\nwent Head of the River with Balliol in 1855 and 1859, won the University Sculls\nand Pairs in 1855-56, the University Fours in 1856 and 1858, and was O.U.B.C.\npresident in 1858. He rowed for Oxford in the tideway Boat Races of 1857 and\n1858. He also won the Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta in 1857 partnering\nArthur Lonsdale. Warre and Lonsdale were runners up in 1858 but Warre won Silver\nGoblets again in 1859 partnering John Arkell. He also rowed at Henley in the\nDiamond Challenge Sculls, Ladies' Challenge Plate, and Grand Challenge Cup\nbetween 1855 and 1859.\n\nIn 1859 Warre was elected a fellow of All Souls. In 1860 he returned to Eton as\nan assistant master and in 1884 was elected Head Master, a position which he\nretained until 1905. He took much interest in sport at Eton, and the high\nstandard of rowing to which the Eton eights attained was due in a large measure\nto his coaching. His 45 years' connexion with Eton thoroughly identified him\nwith its traditions and ideals, and, without being remarkable either as a\nscholar or as a teacher, he wielded a personal influence which has seldom been\nsurpassed.\n\nAfter a period of retirement he was in 1909 appointed as provost of Eton in\nsuccession to James John Hornby, but during the greater part of his provostship\nill health prevented him from taking any very active part in the government of\nthe school. He was an honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria (1885â1901), and\nlater occupied the same office in the households of King Edward VII and King\nGeorge V. He was appointed a member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1901, a\nCompanion of the Order of the Bath in 1905, and a Commander of the Royal\nVictorian Order in 1910.\n\nWarre died at Eton at the age of 82. His son Felix Warre also rowed in the\nUniversity Boat Race and at Henley.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Edmond_Warre","recorded":1375082816,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order","/wiki/Rowing_(sport)","/wiki/List_of_head_masters_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Eton_College","#cite_note-1","/wiki/File:Warre_E_Vanity_Fair_1885-06-20.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Warre_E_Vanity_Fair_1885-06-20.jpg/170px-Warre_E_Vanity_Fair_1885-06-20.jpg","/wiki/File:Warre_E_Vanity_Fair_1885-06-20.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Vanity_Fair_caricatures","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Algernon_Charles_Swinburne","/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Coxed_pair","/wiki/Oxford_University_Boat_Club","/wiki/Tideway","/wiki/Boat_Race","/wiki/Silver_Goblets","/wiki/Henley_Royal_Regatta","/wiki/Arthur_Heywood-Lonsdale","/wiki/John_Arkell","/wiki/Diamond_Challenge_Sculls","/wiki/Ladies%27_Challenge_Plate","/wiki/Grand_Challenge_Cup","/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford","/wiki/List_of_head_masters_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Provost_of_Eton","/wiki/James_John_Hornby","/wiki/Queen_Victoria","/wiki/King_Edward_VII","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order","/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath","/wiki/Felix_Warre","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Oxford_University_Boat_Race_crews","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1840","/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Rowers_of_Vanity_Fair/Warre_E","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Edmond_Warre","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/16px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Edmond_Warre","/wiki/Wikisource","/wiki/James_John_Hornby","/wiki/List_of_headmasters_at_Eton_College","/wiki/Edward_Lyttelton","/wiki/James_John_Hornby","/wiki/Provost_of_Eton","/wiki/M._R._James","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/120776990","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&oldid=541869149","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1837_births","/wiki/Category:1920_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Balliol_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Head_Masters_of_Eton_College","/wiki/Category:Commanders_of_the_Royal_Victorian_Order","/wiki/Category:English_educators","/wiki/Category:School_principals_and_headteachers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_no_article_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmond+Warre&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edmond+Warre","/wiki/Edmond_Warre","/wiki/Talk:Edmond_Warre","#","/wiki/Edmond_Warre","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Warre&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/w
