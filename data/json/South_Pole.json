It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth\nand lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole. Situated on the\ncontinent of Antarctica, it is the site of the United States Amundsen-Scott\nSouth Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently\nstaffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole should not be confused with\nthe South Magnetic Pole, which though geographically nearby, is defined based on\nthe Earth's magnetic field.\n","linknr":872,"url":"South_Pole","recorded":1362560948,"links":127,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2005-2006/2006_01_08.pdf","http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2002-2003/2003_01_05.pdf"],"categories":["Extreme points of Earth","Geography of Antarctica","Polar regions of the Earth"],"headings":["Geography","Exploration","Climate, and day and night","Time","Flora and fauna","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Pole-south.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Geographic_Southpole_crop.jpg/250px-Geographic_Southpole_crop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Ceremonial_South_Pole.jpg/250px-Ceremonial_South_Pole.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Aan_de_Zuidpool_-_p1913-160.jpg/275px-Aan_de_Zuidpool_-_p1913-160.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/SPSM.05.jpg/275px-SPSM.05.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pole_of_Inaccessibility","Earth's_rotation","Earth","North_Pole","Antarctica","United_States","Amundsen-Scott_South_Pole_Station","South_Magnetic_Pole","Axis_of_rotation","North_Pole","Polar_Motion","Geographic_coordinate","Prime_meridian","Antarctica","History_of_Earth","Continental_drift","Bay_of_Whales","Weddell_Sea","New_Year's_Day","Roald_Amundsen","Robert_Falcon_Scott","Amundsen-Scott_South_Pole_Station","Plinth","Antarctic_Treaty","Sovereign_state","Faddey_Bellingshausen","Mikhail_Lazarev","Charles_Wilkes","James_Clark_Ross","Helmer_Hanssen","Sverre_Hassel","Oscar_Wisting","Olav_Bjaaland","Robert_Falcon_Scott","Discovery_Expedition","Ernest_Shackleton","Edward_Adrian_Wilson","Nimrod_Expedition","Norway","Amundsen's_South_Pole_expedition","Polheim","Haakon_VII_of_Norway","Terra_Nova_Expedition","Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition","Sea_ice","Richard_Evelyn_Byrd","Bernt_Balchen","George_J._Dufek","C-47_Skytrain","Amundsen-Scott_South_Pole_Station","International_Geophysical_Year","Edmund_Hillary","Vivian_Fuchs","Commonwealth_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition","Antero_Havola","Albert_P._Crary","Ranulph_Twistleton-Wykeham_Fiennes","Patriot_Hills","Arved_Fuchs","Reinhold_Messner","Hercules_Inlet","Todd_Carmichael","Vostok_Station","Longitude","New_Zealand_Time","Operation_Deep_Freeze","McMurdo_Station","Christchurch","Skua","Microbes","Antarctica","List_of_Antarctic_expeditions","South_Pole_Telescope","North_Pole","Degree_Confluence_Project","National_Film_and_Sound_Archive"]}
