Founded around 1000 AD, and\nestablished a \"kaupstad\" or trading place in 1048 by King Harald III, the city\nwas elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V around 1300.\nPersonal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and\nwith Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a\nfire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Castle during the reign of\nKing Christian IV and renamed 'Christiania' in his honour. It was established as\na municipality ([[formannskapsdistrikt]]) on 1 January 1838. Following a\nspelling reform, it was known as 'Kristiania' from 1877 to 1925, when its\noriginal Norwegian name was restored.\n\nOslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub\nof Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre\nfor maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many\ncompanies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's\nlargest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is\na pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission intercultural\ncities programme.\n\nOslo is considered a global city and ranked \"Beta World City\" in studies\nperformed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in\n2008.<ref></ref> It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among\nEuropean large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi\nMagazine.<ref name=\"fdiintelligence.com\"></ref> For several years, Oslo has been\nlisted as one of the most expensive cities in the world along with such other\nglobal cities as Zurich, Geneva, Copenhagen, Paris, and Tokyo.<ref></ref> In\n2009, however, Oslo regained its status as the world's most expensive\ncity.<ref></ref><ref></ref> A survey conducted by ECA International in 2011\nplaced Oslo 2nd after Tokyo.<ref></ref>\n\nAs of 2010 the metropolitan area of Oslo has a population of 1,442,318, of whom\n912,046<ref name=autogenerated2></ref> live in the contiguous conurbation. The\npopulation currently increases at record rates, making it the fastest growing\ncity in Europe.<ref></ref> This growth stems for the most part from immigration\nand high birth rates among immigrants, but also from intra-national migration.\nThe immigrant population in the city is growing somewhat faster than the\nNorwegian population,<ref></ref> and in the city proper is now more than\n25%.<ref name=\"Immigration\"></ref>\n","title":"oslo","headings":["Urban region","General information","History","Geography","Parks and recreation areas","Cityscape","Politics and
