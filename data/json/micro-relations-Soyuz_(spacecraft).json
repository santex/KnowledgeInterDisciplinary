The Soyuz succeeded the Voskhod spacecraft and was originally built as\npart of the Soviet Manned Lunar programme.\n\nThe Soyuz spacecraft is launched by the Soyuz rocket, the most frequently used\nand most reliable Russian launch vehicle to\ndate. [http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Delta_Mission/SEM8XK57ESD_0.html Soyuz\nlaunch vehicle: The most reliable means of space travel],\nESA [http://eu.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=12839 France and\nRussia agree: Soyuz will launch from Kourou in French Guyana], SpaceRef\nThe Soyuz rocket design is based on the Vostok launcher, which in turn was based\non the 8K74 or R-7A Semyorka, a Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile. Soyuz\nspacecraft are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. \n\nThe first unmanned Soyuz mission was launched November 28, 1966; the first Soyuz\nmission with a crew (Soyuz 1) was launched April 23, 1967, but the cosmonaut on\nboard, Vladimir Komarov, died during the flight's crash-landing. Soyuz 2 was an\nunmanned mission, and Soyuz 3, launched on October 26, 1968, was the first\nsuccessful Soyuz manned mission. The only other fatal mission, Soyuz 11, killed\nthe crew of three also during re-entry due to premature cabin depressurization.\nDespite these early fatalities, Soyuz is presently widely considered the world's\nsafest, most cost-effective human spaceflight system [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9509254/ns/technology_and_science-\nspace/ Russia thriving again on the final frontier], MSNBC as demonstrated\nby its unparalleled length of operational history.\n\nSoyuz spacecraft were used to carry astronauts to and from Salyut and later Mir\nSoviet space stations, and are now used for transport to and from the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). At least one Soyuz spacecraft is docked to\nISS at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Soyuz spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six-person Prospective\nPiloted Transport System.\n","linknr":711,"url":"Soyuz_(spacecraft)","recorded":1362267899,"links":86,"instances":["spacecraft_docking_system","rocket_family","rocket","spacecraft","rocket_family"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1967
