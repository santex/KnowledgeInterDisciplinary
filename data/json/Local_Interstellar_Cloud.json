It is currently unknown if the Sun is embedded\nin the LIC, or in the region where the LIC is interacting with the neighboring\nG-cloud. http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=14203, Into the Interstellar\nVoid, Centauri Dreams The Solar System is thought to have entered the\nLocal Interstellar Cloud at some time between 44,000 and 150,000 years ago and\nis expected to remain within it for another 10,000 to 20,000 years. The cloud\nhas a temperature of about 6,000 K, about the\nsame temperature as the surface of the Sun. However, its specific heat capacity\nis very low as it is not very dense, with 0.3 atoms per cubic centimeter; less\ndense than the average for the interstellar medium in the Milky Way\n(0.5 atoms/cm 3), though six times denser than the gas in the\nLocal Bubble (0.05 atoms/cm 3) which surrounds the local cloud. http://interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/introduction/neighborho-\nod.html, Our Local Galactic Neighborhood, NASA\nIn comparison, Earth's atmosphere at the edge of space has 12 billion atoms per\ncubic centimeter, dropping to 52 million at 150 km.\n\nThe cloud is flowing outwards from the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a stellar\nassociation that is a star-forming region.\n\nThe Local Interstellar Cloud's potential effects on Earth are prevented by the\nsolar wind and the Sun's magnetic field. This\ninteraction with the heliosphere is under study by the Interstellar Boundary\nExplorer (IBEX), a NASA satellite mapping the boundary between the Solar System\nand interstellar space.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Local_Interstellar_Cloud","recorded":1362877218,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orion–Cygnus Arm"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Local_Interstellar_Clouds_with_motion_arrows.jpg/200px-Local_Interstellar_Clouds_with_motion_arrows.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/The_Local_Interstellar_Cloud_and_neighboring_G-cloud_complex.gif/200px-The_Local_Interstellar_Cloud_and_neighboring_G-cloud_complex.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Alpha_Centauri","Light-years","G-cloud_complex","Interstellar_cloud","Parsecs","Earth","Solar_System","G-cloud","Sun","Specific_heat_capacity","Interstellar_medium","Milky_Way","Local_Bubble","Earth's_atmosphere","Kármán_line","Scorpius-Centaurus_Association","Stellar_association","Solar_wind","Stellar_magnetic_field","Heliosphere","Interstellar_Boundary_Explorer","NASA","G-cloud","Gould_Belt","List_of_nearest_stars","Orion–Cygnus_Arm","Perseus_Arm","Ophiucus"]}
