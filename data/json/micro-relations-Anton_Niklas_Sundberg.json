He\nwas known as a controversial person; very outspoken, no stranger to using strong\nlanguage and despising hypocrisy, but he displayed a remarkable sense of wit and\nauthority. At a dinner party he once exclaimed \"Second to chastity, small\nschnapps glasses are the worst I know!\" which became a somewhat familiar\nquotation in Sweden.\n\nSundberg was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1874 and of the Royal Swedish\nAcademy of Sciences from 1877.\n","linknr":3,"url":"Anton_Niklas_Sundberg","recorded":1364239027,"links":["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Niklas_Sundberg","irc://chat.freenode.net/wikipedia","http://www.freenode.net","http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1818 births","1900 deaths","People from Uddevalla Municipality","Archbishops of Uppsala","19th-century Christian archbishops","Members of the Swedish Academy","Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Burial place unknown"],"headings":["References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Uddevalla","Archbishop_of_Uppsala","Uppsala","Clergy","Europe","Swedish_Academy","Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","Svenskt_biografiskt_handlexikon","Uddevalla"]}
