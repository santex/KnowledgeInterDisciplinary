{"cursor":"4331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'polyamide' is a polymer containing monomers of amides joined by peptide\nbonds. They can occur both naturally and artificially, examples being proteins,\nsuch as wool and silk, and can be made artificially through step-growth\npolymerization or solid-phase synthesis, examples being nylons, aramids, and\nsodium poly(aspartate). Polyamides are commonly used in textiles, automotives,\ncarpet and sportswear due to their extreme durability and strength.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Polyamide","recorded":1362505759,"links":35,"instances":["company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polyamides|","Dielectrics","Thermoplastics"],"headings":["Classification","Production from monomers","Antistatic need"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/2-amino-acidsb.png/600px-2-amino-acidsb.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Kelvar_reaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sodium_poly(aspartate"],["rhodia","company"]],"members":["rhodia"],"related":["Polymer","Monomer","Amide","Peptide_bond","Protein","Wool","Silk","Step-growth_polymerization","Solid-phase_synthesis","Nylon","Aramid","Sodium_poly(aspartate)","Aliphatic_compound","Nylon_6","Nylon_6-6","Nylon","DuPont","Rhodia_(company)","Arkema","Polyphthalamide","Hexamethylenediamine","Terephthalic_acid","Evonik","Solvay","Aramide","Paraphenylenediamine","Kevlar","Nomex","Teijin","Homopolymer","Caprolactam","Adipic_acid","Copolymer","Sebacic_acid","Crystallinity","Crystal","Xylylenediamine","Amorphous_solid","Isophthalic_acid","Condensation_reaction","Amino","Carboxylic_acid","Acid_chloride","Water","Hydrogen_chloride","Bifunctional","Amino_acid","Alkyl","Aramid","Carbon_black","Conducting_polymers"]}
