{"cursor":"1835","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'', are sessile and exhibit clumping.]] In zoology, 'sessility' is a\ncharacteristic of some animals, such that they are not able to move about.\nSessile animals are usually permanently attached to a solid substrate of some\nkind, such as a part of a plant, a dead tree trunk, or a rock. For example,\nbarnacles attach themselves to the hull of a ship, but corals lay down their own\nsubstrate.\n\nSessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. Sponges have\na motile larval stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many\njellyfish develop as sessile polyps early in their life cycle. In the case of\nthe cochineal, it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the\ncochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax\nfilaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches\nthe wax filaments and carries the cochineals to a new host.\n\nMany sessile animals, including sponges, corals and hydra, are capable of\nasexual reproduction [[in situ]] by the process of budding.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Sessility_(zoology)","recorded":1362689307,"links":26,"instances":["biology","geology","watercraft","genus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Locomotion (biological)","Zoology"],"headings":["Clumping","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Blue_mussel_clump.jpg/280px-Blue_mussel_clump.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biology"],["rock","geology"],["hull","watercraft"],["hydra","genus"]],"members":["substrate","rock","hull","hydra"],"related":["Zoology","Animal","Substrate_(biology)","Rock_(geology)","Barnacle","Hull_(watercraft)","Coral","Motility","Sponge","Motility","Larval","Jellyfish","Polyp","Cochineal","Coral","Hydra_(genus)","Asexual_reproduction","Budding","Coral_reef","Anthozoa","Ediacara_biota"]}
