However, it can also refer to such events beyond\nthe Earth-Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one\nof its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon\npassing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce\neclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the\nobserver's position.\n","title":"eclipse","headings":["Etymology","Umbra, penumbra and antumbra","Eclipse cycles","Earth-Moon System","Some other planets and Pluto","Eclipsing binaries","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Solar_eclipse","2: Lunar_eclipse","2: Binary_star","2: Eclipse_cycle","2: Cassini–Huygens","2: Gas_giant","2: Jupiter","1: Corona","1: Astronomical_object","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Earth","1: Kilometer","1: Semimajor_axis","1: Refraction","1: Ruddy","1: Orbit_of_the_Moon","1: Ecliptic","1: Eclipse_season","1: Year","1: Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2038#Related_eclipses","1: December_1982_lunar_eclipse#Related_eclipses","1: Novosibirsk,_Russia","1: Magnitude_of_eclipse","1: Occultation","1: Astronomical_transit","1: Apollo_12","1: Space_probe","1: Exposure_time","1: Full_moon","1: Umbra","1: Syria","1: Hubble_Space_Telescope","1: Saturn","1: Uranus","1: Neptune","1: Axial_tilt","1: Galilean_moon","1: Ole_Rømer","1: Speed_of_light","1: Inclination","1: Longitude","1: Greenwich","1: Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini","1: France","1: Mars","1: Transit_of_Phobos_from_Mars","1: Pluto","1: Venus","1: Center_of_mass","1: Variable_star","1: Eclipsing_binary","1: Luminosity","1: Algol","1: Visual_magnitude","1: John_Goodricke","1: Mursili's_eclipse","1: List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century"]}
