{"cursor":"2467","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Bay Meadows Derby' was an American Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-\nold horses of either gender on the Longden Turf Course at Bay Meadows Racetrack.\nBay Meadows was in San Mateo, California where it opened in 1934 and was home to\nthe longest-running stakes event in California: the Bay Meadows Handicap begun\nthe same year as the track itself. (In 1937 and in 1938, Seabiscuit, ridden by\nthe great jockey George Woolf, won the Handicap.)\n\nDuring the Second World War tracks everywhere closed, but not Bay Meadows. The\nlights were on and the horses were racing in the darkest days of the war.\n\nThe Bay Meadows Derby first ran in 1954 on the dirt. That year's winner of\nthe Kentucky Derby won the first Bay Meadows Derby, the California-bred\nDetermine. In 1957, Round Table (horse) won the race, the first of many as a\nthree-year old.\n\nThe Derby, revived in 1978 at one and one/sixteenth mile, is a Grade III grass\nevent set at one and one/eighth mile, and offers a purse of $100,000.\n\nBay Meadows Racetrack closed in 2008. There were ten final race dates run in\nAugust 2008 for the San Mateo County Fair, with the last official race occurring\non August 17, 2008.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Bay_Meadows_Derby","recorded":1362665007,"links":10,"instances":["horse","horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Graded stakes races in the United States","Horse races in the United States","Turf races in the United States","Flat horse races for three-year-olds"],"headings":["Past winners","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["determine","horse"],["round_table","horse"]],"members":["determine","round_table"],"related":["United_States","Thoroughbred","Horse_race","Race_horse","Johnny_Longden","Sod","Bay_Meadows_Racetrack","San_Mateo,_California","California","Bay_Meadows_Handicap","Seabiscuit","Jockey","George_Woolf","Second_World_War","Kentucky_Derby","Determine_(horse)","Round_Table_(horse)","Stakes_race","Bay_Meadows_Racetrack","Kyle_Kaenel","Patrick_Valenzuela","Russell_Baze","Eddie_Delahoussaye"]}
