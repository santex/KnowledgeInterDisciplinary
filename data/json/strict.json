It indicates that the exclusive meaning of\nthe term is to be understood. (More formally, one could say that this is the\nmeaning which implies the other meanings.) The opposite is 'non-strict'. This is\noften implicit but can be put explicitly for clarity. In some contexts the word\n\"proper\" is used as a mathematical synonym for \"strict\".\n","title":"strict","headings":["Use"]},"micro-relation":["1: Mathematics","1: Partially_ordered_set#Strict_and_non-strict_partial_orders","1: Strict_total_order","1: Strict_weak_ordering","1: Proper_subset","1: Subset","1: Proper_class"]}
