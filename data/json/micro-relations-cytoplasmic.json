All of the contents of\nthe cells of prokaryote organisms (such as bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus)\nare contained within the cytoplasm. Within the cells of eukaryote organisms the\ncontents of the cell nucleus are separated from the cytoplasm, and are then\ncalled the nucleoplasm. The cytoplasm is about 70% to 90% water and usually\ncolorless.\n\nIt is within the cytoplasm that most cellular activities occur, such as many\nmetabolic pathways including glycolysis, and processes such as cell division.\nThe inner, granular mass is called the endoplasm and the outer, clear and glassy\nlayer is called the cell cortex or the ectoplasm.\n\nThe part of the cytoplasm that is not held within organelles is called the\ncytosol. The cytosol is a complex mixture of cytoskeleton filaments, dissolved\nmolecules, and water that fills much of the volume of a cell. Due to this\nnetwork of fibres and high concentrations of dissolved macromolecules, such as\nproteins, an effect called macromolecular crowding occurs and the cytosol does\nnot act as an ideal solution. This crowding effect alters how the components of\nthe cytosol interact with each other.\n\nMovement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is thought to be a\nsignaling activity for metabolic processes.
