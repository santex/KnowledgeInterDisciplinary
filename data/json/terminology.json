'Terms' are words and\ncompound words that in specific contexts are given specific meanings, meanings\nthat may deviate from the meaning the same words have in other contexts and in\neveryday language. The discipline Terminology studies among other things how\nsuch terms of art come to be and their interrelationships within a culture.\nTerminology differs from lexicography in studying concepts, conceptual systems,\nand their labels (terms), whereas lexicography study words and their meanings.\n\nTerminology is a discipline which systematically studies the labelling or\ndesignating of [[concept]]s particular to one or more subject fields or domains\nof human activity. It does this through research and analysis of terms in\ncontext for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage.\n\nTerminology can be limited to one or more languages (multilingual terminology,\nbilingual terminology, and so forth) or may have an interdisciplinarity focus on\nthe use of terms in different fields.\n","title":"terminology","headings":["Overview","Types of terminology","Terminology as a discipline","Terminological theories","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Lexicography","2: Translation","2: ISO/TC_37","1: Word","1: Compound_word","1: Interdisciplinarity","1: Database","1: Terminology_database","1: Standardization","1: Social_epistemology","1: Translator","1: Universitat_Pompeu_Fabra","1: Frame-based_terminology","1: Applied_linguistics","1: Concept","1: Controlled_vocabulary","1: Critical_vocabulary","1: Dictionary","1: Glossary","1: Interpreting","1: Jargon","1: LSP_dictionary","1: Meme","1: Ontology","1: Orismology","1: Reference_work","1: SDL_MultiTerm","1: Specialised_lexicography","1: Terminology_standardization","1: Technical_terminology","1: Terminology_planning_policy","1: Terminology_extraction","1: OTTIAQ","1: FAO"]}
