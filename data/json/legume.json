      "text" : " seeds, a popular legume]]\n\nA 'legume' is a plant in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), or the fruit or\nseed of such a plant. Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their food\ngrain seed (e.g. beans and lentils, or generally pulse), for livestock forage\nand silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Legumes are notable in that most\nof them have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in structures called root\nnodules. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils,\nlupins, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts, tamarind, and the woody climbing\nvine wisteria. Legume trees like the Locust trees ([[Gleditsia]], [[Robinia]])\nor the Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus) can be used in permaculture\nfood forests.<ref name=CDI>Cirrus Digital: [http://www.cirrusimage.com/trees.htm\nTree Encyclopedia]</ref>\n\nA legume fruit is a simple dry fruit that develops from a simple carpel and\nusually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name for this type\nof fruit is a 'pod', although the term \"pod\" is also applied to a few other\nfruit types, such as vanilla and radish.\n",
