He is considered the founder of trigonometry<ref></ref> but is most\nfamous for his incidental discovery of precession of the equinoxes.<ref>G J\nToomer's chapter \"Ptolemy and his Greek Predecessors\" in \"Astronomy Before the\nTelescope\", British Museum Press, 1996, p 81</ref>\n\nHipparchus was born in Nicaea, Bithynia (now Iznik, Turkey), and probably died\non the island of Rhodes. He is known to have been a working astronomer at least\nfrom 162 to 127&nbsp;BC.<ref></ref> Hipparchus is considered the greatest\nancient astronomical observer and, by some, the greatest overall astronomer of\nantiquity. He was the first whose quantitative and accurate models for the\nmotion of the Sun and Moon survive. For this he certainly made use of the\nobservations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries\nby the Chaldeans from Babylonia. He developed trigonometry and constructed\ntrigonometric tables, and he solved several problems of spherical trigonometry.\nWith his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry, he may have been the\nfirst to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses. His other reputed\nachievements include the discovery and measurement of Earth's precession, the\ncompilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world, and\npossibly the invention of the astrolabe, also of the armillary sphere, which he\nused during the creation of much of the star catalogue. It would be three\ncenturies before Claudius Ptolemaeus' synthesis of astronomy would supersede the\nwork of Hipparchus; it is heavily dependent on it in many areas. <!-- Image with\nunknown copyright status removed: -->\n",
