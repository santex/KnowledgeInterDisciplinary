{"cursor":"14215","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\n'Diamagnetism' is the property of an object or material that causes it to create\na magnetic field in opposition to an externally applied magnetic field. It is a\nquantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; where it is the only\ncontribution to the magnetism the material is called a diamagnet. Unlike a\nferromagnet, a diamagnet is not a permanent magnet. Its magnetic permeability is\nless than Î¼ 0 (the permeability of free space). In most materials\ndiamagnetism is a weak effect, but a superconductor repels the magnetic field\nentirely, apart from a thin layer at the surface.\n\nDiamagnets were first discovered when Sebald Justinus Brugmans observed in 1778\nthat bismuth and antimony were repelled by magnetic fields. The term\ndiamagnetism was coined by Michael Faraday in September 1845, when he realized\nthat every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to\nan applied magnetic field.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Diamagnetism","recorded":1362555106,"links":54,"instances":["element","properties","electromagnetism","unit"],"pdf":["http://phy.ntnu.edu.tw/~changmc/Teach/SS/SS_note/chap11.pdf","http://phy.ntnu.edu.tw/~changmc/Teach/SS/SS_note/chap11.pdf"],"categories":["Electric and magnetic fields in matter","Magnetic levitation","Magnetism"],"headings":["Diamagnetic materials","Demonstrations of diamagnetism","Theory of diamagnetism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Diamagnetic_graphite_levitation.jpg/220px-Diamagnetic_graphite_levitation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/EXPULSION.png/220px-EXPULSION.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Frog_diamagnetic_levitation.jpg/220px-Frog_diamagnetic_levitation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/d/31da5f4166d0cb96f03a19544bba2cb7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/8/c/78cf2a9ee1a47b856bd34c73f8fb5be0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/7/3/773ae66161272a082b23b0d543bbc501.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/6/5/a65d213142c87225bbecbc9fd95ade90.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/8/128a940e35d0bc149c24becfd4634d3d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/6/eb6dfd6efddf88f0a468fb1860303ab9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/c/2eca475b4fb72f47b47aac42680f5794.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/5/d/75dc7b7c47719644b6b8712e4140d754.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["permeability","electromagnetism"],["mercury","element"],["water","properties"],["mercury","element"],["tesla","unit"]],"members":["mercury","water","permeability","tesla"],"related":["Magnetic_field","Ferromagnet","Permeability_(electromagnetism)","Superconductivity_","Sebald_Justinus_Brugmans","Bismuth","Antimony","Michael_Faraday","Diamagnetic","Paramagnetic","Pyrolytic_carbon","Bismuth","Mercury_(element)","Silver","Diamond","Lead","Graphite","Copper","Water","Ferromagnetism","Paramagnetism","Water_(properties)","Wood","Copper","Core_electrons","Mercury_(element)","Gold","Bismuth","Pascal's_constants","Magnetic_susceptibility","Bismuth","Pyrolytic_carbon","Lorentz_force","Eddy_currents","Superconductors","Meissner_effect","Superconductivity","Supermagnet","Magnetic_levitation","Tesla_(unit)","Earnshaw's_theorem","Pyrolytic_graphite","Rare-earth_magnet","Radboud_University_Nijmegen","Netherlands","Superconducting_magnet","Bohr–van_Leeuwen_theorem","Dielectrics","Electron","Larmor_precession","SI_units","Magnetic_moment","Electrons","Magnetic_moment","Independent_and_identically_distributed","Magnetic_susceptibility","Metals","Lorentz_force","Ferromagnetism","Magnetochemistry","Paramagnetism"]}
