{"cursor":"2068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with [[extracellular space|intercellular]], meaning \"between\ncells\". In cell biology, molecular biology and related fields, the word\n'intracellular' means \"inside the cell\".\n\nIt is used in contrast to extracellular (outside the cell). The cell membrane\n(and, in many organisms, the cell wall) is the barrier between the two, and\nchemical composition of intra- and extracellular milieu can be radically\ndifferent. In most organisms, for example, a Na+/K+ ATPase maintains a high\npotassium level inside cells while keeping sodium low, leading to chemical\nexcitability.\nThis terms also means existing within the cells.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Intracellular","recorded":1362486619,"links":12,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Cell biology","Molecular biology"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cell_biology","Molecular_biology","Cell_(biology)","Extracellular","Cell_membrane","Cell_wall","ATPase","Potassium","Sodium","Excited_state","Cell_(biology)","Cytosol","Extracellular","Microparasite","Intracellular_parasite"]}
