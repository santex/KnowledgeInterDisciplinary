{"cursor":"19005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR)' is a shared\nelectronic health summary set up by the Australian government with\nimplementation overseen by the National Electronic Health Transition Authority\n(NEHTA). The purpose of the PCEHR is to provide a secure electronic summary of\npeopleâs medical history which will eventually include information\nsuch as current medications, adverse drug reactions, allergies and immunisation\nhistory in an easily accessible format. This PCEHR is stored in a network of\nconnected systems with the view to improving the sharing of information amongst\nhealth care providers to improve patient outcomes no matter where in Australia a\npatient presents for treatment. It is currently an opt-in\nsystem with a unique 'individual healthcare identifier (IHI)' being assigned to\nparticipants and the option of masking and limiting information available for\nviewing controlled by the patient or a nominated representative.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrently it is reported that on average, each Australian has 22 health system\ninteractions annually, be that General practitioner(GP) visits, specialists,\nprescriptions etc. All of these interactions are held in individual, separate,\npaper-based records making the entire health picture of an individual difficult\nto ascertain. It is also reported that up to 10% of hospital\nadmissions are due to adverse drug events, 18% are due to medical errors\nrelating to lack of adequate available patient information, and an\nestimated 25% of clinicians time is spent collecting information regarding the\npatient than actually treating them. These facts combined with the\naging Australian population, vast geographic expanse, and ever increasing\npopulation, have necessitated the implementation of the PCEHR in an effort to\nbring the medical record into the 21st century.\n\nImplementation\n\nAs part of the 2010/11 Australian federal budget the Hon. Nicola Roxon (Minister\nfor Health and Aging) announced the PCEHR as a \"key building block of the\nNational Health and Hospitals Network\". The system went live on 1\nJuly 2012\n\n= Software=\n\n== Health Level 7==\n\nHL7 CDA format is used to transfer information between different healthcare\nclinical systems whilst still allowing information to be accessed and viewed\n\n== Vendors==\nThe six GP Desktop Vendor Panel members are :-\n\n*Best Practice Software Pty Ltd *Communicare System *Genie Solutions *iSoft\n*Medtech Global *Zedmed\n\n= Privacy and confidentiality=\n\n= Security=\n\n== National Authentication Service for Health Public Key Infrastructure\n== (NASH PKI)==\n\nNational Authentication Service for Health Public Key Infrastructure is a\ncertificate that authenticates healthcare professionals accessing the eHealth\nrecords system. These certificates can be loaded onto smart cards which are then\nused in combination with the healthcare professionals HPI-I to log on to\npatients who have a PCEHR using the patients IHI. This system also facilitates\nsecure electronic communications with other healthcare provider\norganisations.\n\nThe PKI allows users to know: *who sent the message *the message hasn't been\naltered between sending and receiving it. *the sender can't dispute they created\nand sent the message *that only the person the message is directed to can open\nit\n\nThese benefits allow users to securely and confidently relay patient information\nto trustworthy sources.\n\nFor the PKI to work there must be a 'Chain of Trust' on your computer. This\nChain of Trust is composed of three certificates, namely:\n# Medicare Australia Root CA Medicare Australia Organisation CA Medicare\n# Australia Organisation CA2\n\nThe PKI Certificates are based on the Australian Gatekeeper framework and met\nthe International Organisation for Standardization(IOS) Health Informatics-\nPublic Key Infrastructure technical specification (ISO/TS 17090)\n\n== Secure Message Delivery (SMD)==\n\nThe Secure Message Delivery (SMD) Australian Technical Specification(ATS 5822-\n2010) published by Standards Australia defines a set of interfaces and\nassociated application behaviour suitable for clinical messaging over the\ninternet. The SMD will allow healthcare providers to exchange messages with\nother healthcare providers who are also SMD-compliant, not only saving time but\nalso allowing a more secure form of transmission than current practice norms\ni.e. e-mail, fax and postal.\n\nAlthough any party who has the technical knowledge and skill can carry out the\ninstallation and configuring a SMD, it is typically one of the following: *SMD\nproduct supplier *Secure messaging service provider *Endpoint Location Service\noperator *Systems integrator\n\nATS 5822-2010 âAustralian Technical Specification for E-health Secure Message\nDelivery (SMD)\n\n= Costs=\n\nIt was budgeted to cost $466.7m but had surpassed this to $766m before the\nactual launch date with the final figure still to be calculated.\n\nIn contrast a recent study published by Deloitte  projected the PCEHR\nto save approximately $11.5 billion over the 2010 to 2025 period. This comprises\nof approximately $9.5 billion in net direct benefits to the Australian\nGovernment and $2.0 billion in net direct benefits to the private\nsector.\n\n= Take-up=\n\nAs of February 17, 2013, 1233 healthcare organisations had registered for the\nPCEHR with NEHTA CEO Peter Fleming estimating 98% of GP-specific software was\nPCEHR compatible.\n\nAt the 7 month mark 56,761 patients had registered with the 12 month target at\n500,000 patients. This target figure was still considered achievable according\nto the DoHA deputy secretary Rosemary Huxtable who had released this information\nto a Senate Estimates committee. \n\nLegality\n\nOn the 16th of August 2012 the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, the then Minister for\nHealth announced the Personnally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act 2012\n(PCEHR) \n\nPatients can read in full everything that is added to their eHealth record. They\nmay choose to include additional information in their own local clinical\ninformation system that is not included in the eHealth record. In any event,\npatients have a right under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to access the personal\ninformation that healthcare professionals hold about them.\n\nHealthcare Identifiers Act 2010\n\nHealthcare Identifiers Regulations 2010\n\n= PCEHR Jurisdictional Advisory Committee (PCEHR JAC)=\n\nThe PCEHR Act established the PCEHR Jurisdictional Advisory Committee (PCEHR\nJAC) to advise the System Operator on matters relating to the interests of the\nCommonwealth, States and Territories in the PCEHR system. The PCEHR JAC meets at\nleast four times per year, or more frequently as agreed between the System\nOperator and the Chair. The PCEHR JAC comprises of nine members, a member to\nrepresent the Commonwealth and a member to represent each State and\nTerritory.\n\n= PCEHR Independent Advisory Council (PCEHR IAC)=\n\nThe PCEHR Independent Advisory Council (PCEHR IAC) was established under the\nPCEHR Act to advise on the operation and participation in the PCEHR system,\nclinical, privacy and security matters relating to PCEHR system operations. The\nPCEHR IAC meets at least four times per year.\n","linknr":241,"url":"Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record","recorded":1372154245,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/National_Electronic_Health_Transition_Authority","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Medications","/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction","/wiki/Allergies","/wiki/Immunisation","/wiki/Health_care_providers","/wiki/Australia","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Opt-in","#Rationale","#Implementation","#Software","#Health_Level_7","#Vendors","#Privacy_and_confidentiality","#Security","#National_Authentication_Service_for_Health_Public_Key_Infrastructure_.28NASH_PKI.29","#Secure_Message_Delivery_.28SMD.29","#Costs","#Take-up","#Legality","#PCEHR_Jurisdictional_Advisory_Committee_.28PCEHR_JAC.29","#PCEHR_Independent_Advisory_Council_.28PCEHR_IAC.29","#Registration","#Identity_Verification_Code_.28IVC.29","#Healthcare_Identifiers_Service_.28HI_Service.29","#Individual_healthcare_identifier_.28IHI.29","#Health_Provider_Identifier-Individual.28HPI-I.29","#Health_Provider_Identifier-Organisation.28HPI-O.29","#Incentives","#eHealth_Practice_Incentives_Program_.28ePIP.29","#Endpoint_Location_Service_.28ELS.29","#System_Operator","#Patent_Issues","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/General_practitioner","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Nicola_Roxon","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/HL7","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=8","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/wiki/International_Organisation_for_Standardization","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=10","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=11","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=12","#cite_note-20","/wiki/Privacy_Act_1988","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=13","#cite_note-22","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=14","#cite_note-23","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services_(Australia)","/wiki/Medicare_(Australia)","#cite_note-24","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=16","#cite_note-25","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=17","#cite_note-26","#cite_note-27","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=18","#cite_note-28","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=19","#cite_note-29","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=20","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=21","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=22","#cite_note-30","#cite_note-31","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=23","/w/index.php?title=Personally_Controlled_Electronic_Health_Record&action=edit&section=24","#cite_note-32","/w/index.php?title=Persona
