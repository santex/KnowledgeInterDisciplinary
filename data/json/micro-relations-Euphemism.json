{"cursor":"62457","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'euphemism' is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one\nthat may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/Euphemism Euphemism] Webster's Online Dictionary.\nSome euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive, and\noften misleading terms for things the user wishes to dissimulate or downplay.\nEuphemisms are used for dissimulation, to refer to taboo topics (such as\ndisability, sex, excretion, and death) in a polite way, and to mask profanity.\nThe opposite of euphemism roughly equates to dysphemism.\n\nEuphemisms may be used to avoid words considered rude, while conveying their\nmeaning: \"Kiss my you-know-what!\" instead of the more vulgar, \"Kiss my\nass/arse\"; the expletive sugar to substitute shit. Some euphemisms are so\ncommonly used as to be standard usage: \"pass away\" for \"die\". Over the centuries\neuphemisms have been introduced for \"latrine\", and themselves replaced as they\ncame to be considered unacceptable; \"toilet\", once itself a euphemism, is often\neuphemised as \"bathroom\", \"restroom\", etc. Euphemisms are used to downplay and\nconceal unpalatable facts, as \"collateral damage\" for \"civilian casualties\" in a\nmilitary context, and \"redacted\" for \"censored\".\n","linknr":1001,"url":"Euphemism","recorded":1362898386,"links":88,"instances":["figure_of_speech","web_series","social_sciences","common_law","expletive","linguistics","insult","mythology","linguist","government","psychology","public_relations","employment","politics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euphemisms|","Censorship","Figures
