{"cursor":"20193","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Darwinism' originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species\nor of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance when Charles Darwin\npublished [[On the Origin of Species]], including concepts which predated\nDarwin's theories, but subsequently referred to specific concepts of natural\nselection, the Weismann barrier or in genetics the central dogma of molecular\nbiology. Though it usually refers strictly to\nbiological evolution, the term has been misused by creationists to refer to the\norigin of life and has even been applied to concepts of cosmic evolution which\nhave no connection to Darwin's work.\n\nThe meaning of \"Darwinism\" has changed over time, and varies depending on its\ncontext. In the United States, the term \"Darwinism\" is\noften used by creationists as a pejorative term in reference to beliefs such as\natheistic naturalism, but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative\nconnotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing\nwith evolution, and in particular, evolution by natural selection.\n\nThe term was coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in April 1860, and was used to describe evolutionary concepts in\ngeneral, including earlier concepts such as Spencerism. Many of the proponents\nof Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the\nsignificance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was\nlater called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of August Weismann gained few\nsupporters in the late 19th century. During this period, which has been called\n\"the eclipse of Darwinism\", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary\nmechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern\nevolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s, incorporating natural\nselection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in\nan updated form.\n\nWhile the term has remained in use amongst scientific authors when referring to\nmodern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued that it is an\ninappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory. For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of Gregor\nMendel, and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding\nof heredity. He naturally had no inkling of yet more recent developments and,\nlike Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift for example.\n","linknr":383,"url":"Darwinism","recorded":1362483138,"links":63,"instances":["biology","book","editor","making_excuses","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://biology.ucf.edu/~clp/Courses/seminar/papers/07-Scott-scientists_confront-cs_lite.pdf","http://biology.ucf.edu/~clp/Courses/seminar/papers/07-Scott-scientists_confront-cs_lite.pdf","http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/stovesantidarwinism.pdf"],"categories":["Biology theories","History of evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Conceptions of Darwinism","19th-century usage","Other uses","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Charles_Darwin_by_Julia_Margaret_Cameron_2.jpg/220px-Charles_Darwin_by_Julia_Margaret_Cameron_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_%281871%29.jpg/220px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_%281871%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["naturalism","philosophy"],["competition","biology"],["rationalization","making_excuses"],["john_rennie","editor"],["darwinism","book"]],"members":["competition","darwinism","john_rennie","rationalization","naturalism"],"related":["Transmutation_of_species","Evolution","Charles_Darwin","Natural_selection","Weismann_barrier","Genetics","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Creationism","Abiogenesis","Physical_cosmology","Creationism","Pejorative","Metaphysical_naturalism","Thomas_Henry_Huxley","Herbert_Spencer","Natural_selection","Lamarckism","Neo-Darwinism","August_Weismann","The_eclipse_of_Darwinism","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Population_genetics","Gregor_Mendel","Genetics","Gregor_Mendel","Heredity","Genetic_drift","Monkey","Evolution","Erasmus_Darwin","Charles_Darwin","Thomas_Henry_Huxley","Naturalism_(philosophy)","Theology","Gradualism","Natural_selection","Nicolaus_Copernicus","Peter_Kropotkin","Biology","Sociology","Competition_(biology)","Rationalization_(making_excuses)","Survival_of_the_fittest","Herbert_Spencer","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Publication_of_Darwin's_theory","Social_Darwinism","Philanthropy","Francis_Galton","Eugenics","Ernst_Haeckel","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Creationism","Intelligent_design_movement","Evolution","Philosophical_naturalism","Atheism","Phillip_E._Johnson","Asa_Gray","Natural_selection","Dogma","Belief","Ben_Stein","John_Rennie_(editor)","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Genetic_drift","Gene_flow","History_of_evolutionary_thought","Lamarckism","Modern_synthesis","Richard_Dawkins","David_Stove","Ad_hoc","Darwinism_(book)","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Neo-Darwinism","Neural_Darwinism","Social_Darwinism","Darwin_Awards","Pangenesis","Universal_Darwinism","Nikolai_Danilevsky","Runivers.ru","DjVu"]}
