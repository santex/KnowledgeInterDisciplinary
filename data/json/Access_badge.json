Entry points may be doors, turnstiles, parking\ngates or other barriers.\n\nAccess badges use various technologies to identify the holder of the badge to an\naccess control system. The most common technologies are magnetic stripe,\nproximity, barcode, smart cards and various biometric devices. The magnetic\nstrip ID card was invented by Forrest Parry in 1960.\n[http://www.suu.edu/alumni/magazine/fall04/pdf/news.pdf Southern Utah University\nin View, Fall 2004, Alumni Awards, pages 3-4]\n\nThe access badge contains a number that is read by a card reader. The number is\nsent to an access control system, a computer system that makes access control\ndecisions based on information about the credential. If the credential is\nincluded in an access control list, the access control system unlocks the\ncontrolled access point. The transaction is stored in the system for later\nretrieval; reports may be generated that reveal who entered what controlled\naccess point at what time.\n\nThe Wiegand effect was used in early access cards. This method was abandoned in\nfavor of other proximity technologies. The new technologies retained the Wiegand\nupstream data so that the new readers were compatible with old systems. Readers\nare still called Wiegand but no longer use the Wiegand effect. A Wiegand reader\nradiates a 1\" to 5\" electrical field around itself. Cards use a simple LC\ncircuit. When a card is presented to the reader, the reader's electrical field\nexcites a coil in the card. The coil charges a capacitor and in turn powers an\nintegrated circuit. The integrated circuit outputs the card number to the coil\nwhich transmits it to the reader. The transmission of the card number happens in\nthe clearâit is not encrypted. With basic understanding of radio technology and\nof card formats, Wiegand proximity cards can be hacked.\n\nA common proximity format is 26 bit Wiegand. This format uses a facility code\nalso called a site code. The facility code is unique number common to all of the\ncards in a particular set. The idea is an organization has their own facility\ncode and then numbered cards incrementing from 1. Another organization has a\ndifferent facility code and their card set also increments from 1. Thus\ndifferent organizations can have card sets with the same card numbers but since\nthe facility codes differ, the cards only work at one organization. This idea\nworked fine for a while but there is no governing body controlling card numbers,\ndifferent manufacturers can supply cards with identical facility codes and\nidentical card numbers to different organizations. Thus there is a problem of\nduplicate cards. To counteract this problem some manufacturers have created\nformats beyond 26 bit Wiegand that they control and issue to an organization.\n\nIn the 26 bit Wiegand format bit 1 is an even parity bit. Bits 2-9 are a\nfacility code. Bits 10-25 are the card number. Bit 26 is an odd parity bit.\nOther formats have a similar structure of leading facility code followed by card\nnumber and including parity bits for error checking.\n\nSmart cards can be used to counteract the problems of transmitting card numbers\nin the clear and control of the card numbers by manufacturers. Smart cards can\nbe encoded by organizations with unique numbers and the communication between\ncard and reader can be encrypted.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Access_badge","recorded":1372154589,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:ExampleCAC.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/ExampleCAC.jpg","/wiki/File:ExampleCAC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense","/wiki/Credential","/wiki/Access_control","/wiki/Door","/wiki/Turnstile","/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card","/wiki/Proximity_card","/wiki/Barcode","/wiki/Smart_card","/wiki/Biometric","/wiki/Forrest_Parry","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Card_reader","/wiki/Computer_system","/wiki/Wiegand_effect","/wiki/LC_circuit","/wiki/Capacitor","/wiki/Integrated_circuit","/wiki/Smart_cards","/wiki/Encrypted","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Access_control","/wiki/Biometrics","/wiki/Card_printer","/wiki/Common_Access_Card","/wiki/Computer_security","/wiki/Credential","/wiki/Door_security","/wiki/Electronic_lock","/wiki/Fortification","/wiki/ID_Card","/wiki/IP_video_surveillance","/wiki/Key_(lock)#Keycard","/wiki/Locksmithing","/wiki/Lock_picking","/wiki/Logical_security","/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card","/wiki/Optical_turnstile","/wiki/Photo_identification","/wiki/Physical_Security_Professional","/wiki/Proximity_card","/wiki/Security","/wiki/Security_engineering","/wiki/Security_lighting","/wiki/Security_policy","/wiki/Smart_card","/wiki/Swipe_card","/wiki/Wiegand_effect","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.suu.edu/alumni/magazine/fall04/pdf/news.pdf","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&oldid=550772350","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Access+badge&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Access+badge","/wiki/Access_badge","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Access_badge&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Access_badge","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Access_badge","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Access_badge","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&oldid=550772350","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Access_badge&id=550772350","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Access+badge","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Access+badge&oldid=550772350&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Access_badge&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adgangskort","//nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adgangskort","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1054723#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_badge","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"
