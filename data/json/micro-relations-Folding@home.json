The project uses the idle processing resources of\nthousands of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the\nsoftware on their systems. Its primary purpose is to determine the mechanisms of\nprotein folding, which is the process by which proteins reach their final three-\ndimensional structure, and to examine the causes of protein misfolding. This is\nof significant academic interest with major implications for medical research\ninto Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and many forms of cancer, among\nother diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to predict a\nprotein's final structure and determine how other molecules may interact with\nit, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and\noperated by the Pande laboratory at Stanford University, under the direction of\nVijay Pande, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research\nlaboratories across the world.\n\nThe project has pioneered the use of GPUs, PlayStation 3s, and Message\nPassing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors) for distributed\ncomputing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation\nmethodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computational\napproaches. As part of the client-\nserver network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a\nsimulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's\ndatabase servers where the units are compiled into an overall simulation.\nVolunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which\nmakes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term\ninvolvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed of\napproximately 12 petaFLOPS: greater than all projects running on the BOINC\ndistributed computing platform. The project was also the world's most powerful\nmolecular dynamics simulator until mid-2011. This performance from its large-\nscale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally expensive\natomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than\npreviously achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, the Pande lab has\nproduced 109 scientific research papers as a direct result of\nFolding@home. Results from the project's simulations agree\nfavorably with experiments.\n","linknr":1949,"url":"Folding@home","recorded":1362560626,"links":59,"instances":["gene","software","computing","cpu","biology","distributed_computing","software","brand","computing","biology","influenza","microprocessor","biochemistry","mathematics","protein","computer_software","biology","computing","computer_science","software","computer","money"],"pdf":["http://sansan.phy.ncu.edu.tw/~hclee/ref/SnowNature2002.pdf","http://sansan.phy.ncu.edu.tw/~hclee/ref/SnowNature2002.pdf","http://cs-alb-pc3.massey.ac.nz/notes/59735/seminars/06235808.pdf","http://cs-alb-pc3.massey.ac.nz/notes/59735/seminars/06235808.pdf","http://biochem218.stanford.edu/Projects%202010/Ito%202010.pdf","http://biochem218.stanford.edu/Projects%202010/Ito%202010.pdf","http://www.hicomb.org/papers/HICOMB2009-13.pdf","http://www.hicomb.org/papers/HICOMB2009-13.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/FoldingFAQ.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/FoldingFAQ.pdf"],"categories":["2000
