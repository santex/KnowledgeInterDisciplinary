He is played by Carel Struycken.\n\nThe Giant appears to FBI agent Dale Cooper in visions, first right after Cooper\nhas been shot in his hotel room. The Giant provides Cooper with clues about the\nmurder of Laura Palmer and actually confirms the identity of the murderer during\na vision in the Roadhouse. Later on, he also warns Cooper that his love-interest\nAnnie Blackburn should not enter the Miss Twin Peaks pageant (her winning the\ncontest is a key element leading to Cooper's entering the Black Lodge and\nsubsequently his downfall).\n\nThe giant apparently inhabits an elderly Room Service Waiter of the Great\nNorthern Hotel (played by Hank Worden). Also, the\nGiant wears a similar outfit to the Waiter (who in himself is a ghostly semi-\nconscious entity who almost never appears in a crowd or within the guests rooms\nof the Great Northern). In the final episode, when Cooper has entered the Black\nLodge, both the Waiter and the Giant appear and the latter confirms their\nidentity, stating: \"One and the same\"\n\nThough the Giant's actions seem to be benevolent, he seems to be part of the\nevil Black Lodge, as he appears alongside of the Man from Another Place in the\nLodge's waiting room. However, some have opined that the waiting room actually\nis a neutral location between the Black and the White Lodge. In his first\nappearance, the Giant refused Cooper's question of his whereabouts.\n","linknr":179,"url":"The_Giant_(Twin_Peaks)","recorded":1362677009,"links":18,"instances":["album","musician","twin_peaks"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Twin Peaks characters","Fictional giants","Fictional characters introduced in 1990"],"headings":["Cultural references","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Twinpeaksonearmedgiant.jpg/250px-Twinpeaksonearmedgiant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/TV_char_icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["white_lodge","twin_peaks"],["substrata","album"],["biosphere","musician"]],"members":["substrata","biosphere","white_lodge"],"related":["Fictional_character","David_Lynch","Mark_Frost","Carel_Struycken","FBI","Dale_Cooper","Laura_Palmer","Annie_Blackburn","Black_Lodge","Hank_Worden","Black_Lodge","Man_from_Another_Place","White_Lodge_(Twin_Peaks)","Doom_metal","Swallow_the_Sun","Ghosts_of_Loss","DJ_Shadow","Substrata_(album)","Biosphere_(musician)","The_Simpsons","Lisa's_Sax","Homer_Simpson"]}
