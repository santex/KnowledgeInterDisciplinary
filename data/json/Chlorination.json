Water which has been treated with chlorine is effective in preventing the\nspread of waterborne disease.\n\nThe chlorination of public drinking supplies was originally met with resistance,\nas people were concerned about the health effects of the practice. The use of\nchlorine has greatly reduced the prevalence of waterborne disease as it is\neffective against almost all bacteria and viruses, as well as amoeba.\n\nChlorination is also used to sanitize the water in swimming pools and as a\ndisinfection stage in sewage treatment.\n\n'Shock chlorination' is a process used in many swimming pools, water wells,\nsprings, and other water sources to reduce the bacterial and algal residue in\nthe water. Shock chlorination is performed by mixing a large amount of sodium\nhypochlorite, which can be in the form of a powder or a liquid such as chlorine\nbleach, into the water. Water that is being shock chlorinated should not be swum\nin or drunk until the sodium hypochlorite count in the water goes down to three\nppm or less.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Chlorination","recorded":1362372138,"links":22,"instances":["hydrosphere","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/gdwq0506.pdf","http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol52/volume52.pdf","http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/LT_rpts/tr392.pdf","http://www.enceechlor.com/download/Drinking%20Water%20Chlorination%20-%20A%20Review%20of%20Disinfection%20Practices.pdf"],"categories":["Water treatment","Chlorine","Scottish inventions"],"headings":["History","Chemistry in water","Drawbacks","Alternatives","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","hydrosphere"],["dissociation","chemistry"]],"members":["spring","dissociation"],"related":["Chlorine","Water","Water_purification","Drinking_water","Disease","Health_effects","Bacteria","Virus","Amoeba","Swimming_pool","Sewage_treatment","Water_well","Spring_(hydrosphere)","Bacteria","Algae","Sodium_hypochlorite","Parts_per_million","Moritz_Traube","Calcium_hypochlorite","Maidstone","Chlorine_dioxide","Slow_sand_filter","Lincoln,_England","Rockaway_River","Jersey_City,_New_Jersey","Calcium_hypochlorite","George_W._Fuller","Carl_Rogers_Darnall","Army_Medical_School","Army_Medical_Department","Calcium_hypochlorite","PH","Hypochlorous_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Hypochlorite","Organic_compound","Disinfection_byproduct","Trihalomethane","Haloacetic_acid","Carcinogenicity","World_Health_Organization","Aesthetics","Taste","SwimSpray,_LLC","Chlorine_dioxide","Bromine","Iodine","United_States","Chlorine","Chloramine","Disinfection","Chloramine","Chloramination","Disinfection","Drinking_water","Safe_Drinking_Water_Act","Water_fluoridation","Water_industry","Water_pollution","Water_filters","Water_supply_network","Water_treatment","Sodium_hypochlorite","Symclosene","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer","NIH"]}
