Swanson and biochemist Dr. Herbert W. Boyer. After a meeting in 1976,\nthe two decided to start the first biotechnology company, Genentech.\"  It\nis considered to have founded the biotechnology industry. Boyer is\nconsidered to be a pioneer in the field of recombinant DNA technology. In 1973,\nBoyer and his colleague Stanley Norman Cohen demonstrated that restriction\nenzymes could be used as \"scissors\" to cut DNA fragments of interest from one\nsource, to be ligated into a similarly cut plasmid vector. While Cohen returned\nto the laboratory in academia, Swanson contacted\nBoyer \"In January 1976, 28-year-old venture capitalist Robert Swanson\nentered the picture. A successful cold-call at Boyer's lab led to a couple of\nbeers â and an agreement to start a pharmaceutical company. Investing $500 each,\nthey capitalized a new business, Genentech, to seek practical uses for Boyer and\nCohen's engineered proteins. Swanson raised money for staff and labs...\"\nto found the company. Boyer worked with Arthur\nRiggs and Keiichi Itakura from the Beckman Research Institute, and the group\nbecame the first to successfully express a human gene in bacteria when they\nproduced the hormone somatostatin in 1977. David Goeddel and Dennis Kleid were\nthen added to the group, and contributed to its success with synthetic human\ninsulin in 1978.\n\nAs of February 2011, Genentech employed more than 11,000 people. The\nSwiss global health-care company F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG now completely owns\nGenentech after completing its purchase on March 26, 2009 for approximately\n$46.8 billion.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Genentech","recorded":1362504278,"links":31,"instances":["anatomy","film","drug","geneticist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genentech","South San Francisco, California","Companies based in San Mateo County, California","Biotechnology companies of the United States","Pharmaceutical companies of the United States","Hoffmann-La Roche","Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area"],"headings":["Research","Facilities","Disputes","Products timeline","Awards and recognitions","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Genentech.svg/210px-Genentech.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Genentechheadquarters.jpg/220px-Genentechheadquarters.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/SF_From_Marin_Highlands3.jpg/32px-SF_From_Marin_Highlands3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["boniva","drug"],["arthur_riggs","geneticist"],["colon","anatomy"],["something_ventured","film"]],"members":["colon","something_ventured","boniva","arthur_riggs"],"related":["Hoffmann–La_Roche","South_San_Francisco,_California","Biotechnology","Avastin","Herceptin","Rituxan","Tarceva","Xeloda","Tocilizumab","Lucentis","Xolair","Activase","Boniva_(drug)","Cathflo_Activase","Nutropin","TNKase","CellCept","Peginterferon_alfa-2a","Pulmozyme","Tamiflu","Valcyte","Anaprox","Cytovene","EC-Naprosyn","Erivedge","Fuzeon","Invirase","Klonopin","Kytril","Naprosyn","Rocephin","Roferon-A","Romazicon","Valium","Xenical","Zenapax","Hoffmann-La_Roche","Biotechnology","Corporation","Robert_A._Swanson","Herbert_Boyer","Biotechnology","Recombinant_DNA","Stanley_Norman_Cohen","Restriction_enzyme","DNA","Plasmid_vector","Arthur_Riggs_(geneticist)","Keiichi_Itakura","Beckman_Research_Institute","Gene_expression","Gene","Bacteria","Hormone","Somatostatin","David_Goeddel","Insulin","Hoffmann-La_Roche","Oncology","Immunology","Microbiology","Medical_Imaging","South_San_Francisco,_California","Vacaville,_California","Oceanside,_California","Hillsboro,_Oregon","Lonza_Group","Ranibizumab","University_of_California,_San_Francisco","Insulin","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Eli_Lilly_and_Company","Humulin","Protropin","Growth_hormone","Growth_hormone_deficiency","Activase","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Myocardial_infarction","Actimmune","Interferon","Chronic_granulomatous_disease","Intermune","Nutropin","Growth_hormone","Kidney_transplant","Pulmozyme","Cystic_fibrosis","DNAse","Rituximab","Non-Hodgkins_lymphomas","Trastuzumab","Metastatic_breast_cancer","TNKase","Thrombolysis","Myocardial_infarction","Omalizumab","Asthma","Efalizumab","T_cell","Psoriasis","Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy","Bevacizumab","Monoclonal_antibody","Colon_(anatomy)","Rectum","Non-small_cell_lung_cancer","Glioblastoma_multiforme","Renal_cell_carcinoma","Erlotinib","Ranibizumab","Actemra","Erivedge","Basal-cell_carcinoma","Hedgehog_signaling_pathway","Pertuzumab","Docetaxel","DR6","Amyloid_precursor_protein","Alzheimer's_disease","Fortune_Magazine","Business_Ethics_Magazine","Glassdoor.com","Arthur_D._Levinson","Something_Ventured_(film)"]}
