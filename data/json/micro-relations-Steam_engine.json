Re-\n erected on the A38(M) in Birmingham, UK]] A 'steam engine' is a heat engine\n that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid.\n\nUsing boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back about 2,000 years,\nbut early devices were not practical. Since the late 1700s steam engines have\nbecome a major source of mechanical power. The first applications were removing\nwater from mines. In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced\ncontinuous rotative motion. These 10hp engines enabled a wide range of\nmanufacturing machinery to be powered. The engines could be sited anywhere that\nwater and coal or wood fuel could be obtained. Within a century,in 1883, engines\nthat could provide 10,000 hp were feasible. Steam engines could also be applied\nto vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives which are\ncommonly just called steam engines outside America. The stationary steam engine\nwas an important component of the Industrial Revolution, overcoming the\nlimitations imposed by shortage of sites suitable for water mill and allowing\nfactories to locate where water power was unavailable.\n\nToday steam turbines generate about 90% of the electric power in the United\nStates using a variety of heat sources. {{cite book\n|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use |last= Wiser\n|first= Wendell H. |year= 2000 |publisher= BirkhÃ¤user |isbn= 978-0-387-98744-6\n|page= 190 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=elec-\ntrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=boo-\nk_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false }}\n\nSteam engines are external combustion engines, where the\nworking fluid is separate from the combustion products. Non-combustion heat\nsources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used.\nThe ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the\nRankine cycle. In the cycle water is heated into steam in a boiler until it\nreaches a high pressure. When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical\nwork is done. The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into\nthe boiler.\n\nIn general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either the integrated steam\nplants (including boilers etc.) such as railway steam locomotives and portable\nengines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam\nengine and stationary steam engine. Specialized devices such as steam hammers\nand steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler.\n\n from Stott Park Bobbin Mill, Cumbria, England]]\n\n in Germany.This class of engine was built in 1942 â 1950 and operated\n commercially until 1988.]]
