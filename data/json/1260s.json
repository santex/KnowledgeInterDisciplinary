{"cursor":"21657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe '1260s' is the decade starting January 1, 1260 and ending December 31, 1269.\n\nIn Asia, Kublai Khan was proclaimed the supreme leader of the Mongol Empire,\nalthough his title was only partially recognized. After defeating his younger\nbrother Ariq BÃ¶ke, he moved his capital to Beijing; while he fought the southern\nChinese Song Dynasty, the empire saw its first significant military defeats\n— first in Palestine at the hands of the Mamluks of Egypt, and later in\nthe Caucasus. The Mamluks, led by their new sultan Baibars, quickly became a\nregional power in the Middle East by capturing a number of crusader states and\nrepulsing Mongol attacks. The Empire of Nicaea succeeded in capturing\nConstantinople and the rest of the Latin Empire, thus re-establishing the\nByzantine Empire.\n\nIn Europe, political strife and territorial disputes led to widespread warfare\naround the continent. England witnessed the Second Barons' War, a civil war\nfought over the aristocracy's disillusionment with King Henry III's attempts to\nmaintain an absolute monarchy. The pope of the Catholic Church, aligned against\nthe Hohenstaufen dynasty of the Holy Roman Emperor, succeeded in eliminating the\nline when the last male heir, Conradin, was killed by papal ally Charles I of\nSicily, a Frenchman. Meanwhile, King Otakar II of Bohemia became the most\npowerful prince in Europe, expanding his territories through both warfare and\ninheritance. In other developments, both Iceland and Greenland accepted the\noverlordship of Norway, but Scotland was able to repulse a Norse invasion and\nbroker a favorable peace settlement. In Spain, the Reconquista continued as\nseveral important cities were recaptured from the Moors. Political reforms were\ninstituted in the election procedures of the pope and the doges of Venice, and\nthe parliaments of Ireland and England met for the first time.\n\nSeveral important cultural achievements were made in the decade, including\npublication of Roger Bacon's important scientific work Opus Majus and Thomas\nAquinas' [[Summa contra Gentiles]]. Masterpieces of architecture and sculpture\nwere completed at cathedrals around Europe, including the Cathedral of\nChartres and Nicola Pisano's pulpits for the Duomo di Siena and Pisa's\nBaptistery. In religion, the Sukhothai kingdom in Thailand adopted Buddhism as\nits official religion. In Europe anti-Semitism intensified, as several\nauthorities promulgated laws requiring Jews to wear identifying yellow badges,\nJews were massacred in England, and the Talmud was attacked and censored by\nthe Catholic Church.\n","linknr":635,"url":"1260s","recorded":1362571986,"links":75,"instances":["1268","duchy","catholicism","title"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1260s|"],"headings":["War
