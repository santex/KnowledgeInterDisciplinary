It has a radioactive decay half-life of about eight\ndays. It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and treatment\nprocedures, and natural gas production. It also plays a major role as a\nradioactive isotope present in nuclear fission products, and was a significant\ncontributor to the health hazards from open-air atomic bomb testing in the\n1950s, and from the Chernobyl disaster, as well as being a large fraction of the\ncontamination hazard in the first weeks in the Fukushima nuclear crisis. This is\nbecause I-131 is a major uranium, plutonium fission product, comprising nearly\n3% of the total products of fission (by weight). See fission product yield for a\ncomparison with other radioactive fission products. I-131 is also a major\nfission product of uranium-233, produced from thorium.\n\nDue to its mode of beta decay, iodine-131 is notable for causing mutation and\ndeath in cells that it penetrates, and other cells up to several millimeters\naway. For this reason, high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous\nthan low doses, since they tend to kill thyroid tissues that would otherwise\nbecome cancerous as a result of the radiation. For example, children treated\nwith moderate dose of I-131 for thyroid adenomas had a detectable increase in\nthyroid cancer, but children treated with a much higher dose did not. Likewise,\nmost studies of very-high-dose I-131 for treatment of Graves disease have failed\nto find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in\nthyroid cancer risk with I-131 absorption at moderate doses.<ref\nname=\"Rivkees\"></ref> Thus, iodine-131 is increasingly less employed in small\ndoses in medical use (especially in children), but increasingly is used only in\nlarge and maximal treatment doses, as a way of killing targeted tissues. This is\nknown as \"therapeutic use.\"\n\nIodine-131 can be \"seen\" by nuclear medicine imaging techniques (i.e., gamma\ncameras) whenever it is given for therapeutic use, since about 10% of its energy\nand radiation dose is via gamma radiation. However, since the other 90% of\nradiation (beta radiation) causes tissue damage without contributing to any\nability to see or \"image\" the isotope, other less-damaging radioisotopes of\niodine are preferred in situations when only nuclear imaging is required. The\nisotope I-131 is still occasionally used for purely diagnostic (i.e., imaging)\nwork, due to its low expense compared to other iodine radioisotopes. Very small\nmedical imaging doses of I-131 have not shown any increase in thyroid cancer.\nThe low-cost availability of I-131, in turn, is due to the relative ease of\ncreating I-131 by neutron bombardment of natural tellurium in a nuclear reactor,\nthen separating I-131 out by various simple methods (i.e., heating to drive off\nthe volatile iodine). By contrast, other iodine radioisotopes are usually\ncreated by far more expensive techniques, starting with reactor radiation of\nexpensive capsules of pressurized xenon gas.\n\nIodine-131 is also one of the most commonly used gamma-emitting radioactive\nindustrial tracer. Radioactive tracer isotopes are injected with hydraulic\nfracturing fluid to determine the injection profile and location of fractures\ncreated by hydraulic fracturing.<ref name=\"Reis_iodine\" />\n\nMuch smaller incidental doses of iodine-131 than those used in medical\ntherapeutic procedures, are thought to be the major cause of increased thyroid\ncancers after accidental nuclear contamination.<ref\nname=\"Simon\"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Hanford\nThyroid Disease Study|year=2002|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/hanford/h-\ntdsweb/pdf/htdsreport.pdf|author=Centre for Disease Control|accessdate=17 June\n2012|quote=no associations between Hanford’s iodine-131 releases and thyroid\ndisease were observed. [The findings] show that if there is an increased risk of\nthyroid disease from exposure to Hanford’s iodine-131, it is probably too small\nto observe using the best epidemiologic methods available}}\n[http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/hanford/htdsweb/pdf/htds_aag.pdf Executive\nsummary]</ref> These cancers happen from residual tissue radiation damage caused\nby the I-131, and usually appear years after exposure, long after the I-131 has\ndecayed.<ref name=\"Simon\"/>\n",
