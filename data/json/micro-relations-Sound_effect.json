In motion picture and television production, a sound effect is a sound\nrecorded and presented to make a specific storytelling or creative point without\nthe use of dialogue or music. The term often refers to a process applied to a\nrecording, without necessarily referring to the recording itself. In\nprofessional motion picture and television production, dialogue, music, and\nsound effects recordings are treated as separate elements. Dialogue and music\nrecordings are never referred to as sound effects, even though the processes\napplied to them, such as reverberation or flanging effects, often are called\n\"sound effects\".\n","linknr":256,"url":"Sound_effect","recorded":1362478812,"links":34,"instances":["effect","audio_effect","audio","music","signal","entertainer","filmmaking","filmmaking","1937_film","music","film","composer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Special effects","Sound production","Film techniques","Sound effects|*"],"headings":["History","Film","Video games","Music","Recording","Processing effects","Aesthetics","Techniques","See also","References","External links","",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Various_hard_sound_effects_devices.JPG/220px-Various_hard_sound_effects_devices.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sound_editor","filmmaking"],["foley","filmmaking"],["foley","filmmaking"],["snow_white_and_the_seven_dwarfs","1937_film"],["john_barry","composer"],["moonraker","film"],["sampling","music"],["sound_editor","filmmaking"],["sound_editor","filmmaking"],["sound_editor","filmmaking"],["equalization","audio"],["phaser","effect"],["sound_editor","filmmaking"],["analog","signal"],["delay","audio_effect"],["distortion","music"],["madonna","entertainer"]],"members":["phaser","delay","equalization","sampling","analog","madonna","sound_editor","foley","snow_white_and_the_seven_dwarfs","distortion","moonraker","john_barry"],"related":["Sound","Video_game","Film","Television","Dialogue","Music","Reverberation","Flanging","BBC","Walla","Foley_artist","Science_fiction","Sound_editor_(filmmaking)","Foley_(filmmaking)","Foley_(filmmaking)","Foley_artists","Video_game","Sound_synthesis","3D_audio_effect","Toy_Symphony","Richard_Wagner","Das_Rheingold","Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)","Klaus_Doldinger","Das_Boot","John_Barry_(composer)","Moonraker_(film)","Sputnik_1","Digital_synthesizer","Sampling_(music)","Sound_editor_(filmmaking)","Foley_artist","Foley_editor","Sound_effects_editor","Sound_effects_recordist","Cannon","Historical_re-enactors","Digital_Audio_Tape","Hard_disk","Nagra","Cannon","Musket","Jon_Johnson","Charles_Maynes","Pig","Microphone","Wind_screen","Stereophonic_sound","Sound_designer","Audio_engineer","Multitrack_recording","Sound_editor_(filmmaking)","Sound_designer","Computer","Non-linear_editing_system","Sound_editor_(filmmaking)","Sound_designer","Equalization_(audio)","Reverberation","Phaser_(effect)","Sound_editor_(filmmaking)","Special_effects","Foley_artist","Digital","Analog_(signal)","Delay_(audio_effect)","Spring_reverb","Reverberation","Reverberation","Digital_signal_processing","Tachometer","Audio_filter","All-pass_filter","C-3PO","Star_Wars","Flanging","Attenuation","Low-pass_filter","High-pass_filter","Band-pass_filter","Band-stop_filter","Distortion_(music)","Absolute_value","Pitch_correction","Cher","Madonna_(entertainer)","Ring_modulator","Doctor_Who","Dalek","Audio_data_compression","Jimmy_Page","Led_Zeppelin","Whole_Lotta_Love","Audio_signal_processing","Digital_audio_editor","Effects_unit","Sound_card"]}
