It was a key Cold War event that began on October 4, 1957 when the\nSoviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first artificial Earth satellite.\n\nThe launch of Sputnik I and the failure of its first two Project Vanguard launch\nattempts rattled the American public; President Dwight D. Eisenhower referred to\nit as the âSputnik Crisisâ. Although Sputnik was itself harmless, its orbiting\ngreatly accentuated the continual threat the United States had perceived from\nthe Soviet Union since the Cold War began after World War II. The same rocket\nthat launched Sputnik could send a nuclear warhead anywhere in the world in a\nmatter of minutes, breaching the oceanic moat that had successfully protected\nthe continental United States from attack during both World Wars. The Soviets\nhad demonstrated this capability on August 21 with a successful 6,000 km test\nflight of the R-7 booster; TASS announced it five days later and the event was\nwidely reported in Aviation Week and other media.\n\nLess than a year after the Sputnik launch, Congress passed the National Defense\nEducation Act (NDEA). The act was a four-year program that poured billions of\ndollars into the U.S. education system. In 1953 the government spent $153\nmillion, and colleges took $10 million of that funding; however, by 1960 the\ncombined funding grew almost sixfold because of the NDEA.\n\nAfter the initial public shock, the Space Race began, leading to the first\nhuman launched into space, Project Apollo and the first humans to land on the\nMoon in 1969.\n","linknr":411,"url":"Sputnik_crisis","recorded":1362267793,"links":37,"instances":["ussr"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cold War","Soviet Union–United States relations"],"headings":["US response","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Sputnik-stamp-ussr.jpg/150px-Sputnik-stamp-ussr.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tass","ussr"]],"members":["tass"],"related":["Sputnik_program","Cold_War","Soviet_Union","Project_Vanguard","Dwight_D._Eisenhower","Cold_War","World_War_II","Moat","R-7_Semyorka","TASS_(USSR)","Aviation_Week","National_Defense_Education_Act","Space_Race","Vostok_1","Apollo_program","Apollo_11","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","Donald_B._Gillies","Project_Vanguard","Explorer_program","Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency","NASA","Engineer","National_Science_Foundation","UGM-27_Polaris","Project_management","Project","John_F._Kennedy","Missile_gap","Minuteman_missile","ICBM"]}
