It ended when metal tools\nbecame widespread (in the Copper Age or Bronze Age; or, in some geographical\nregions, in the Iron Age). The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and\ncultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic\ncrops and of domesticated animals. Some archaeologists have long advocated\nreplacing \"Neolithic\" with a more descriptive term, such as \"Early Village\nCommunities\", but this has not gained wide acceptance.\n\nThe beginning of the Neolithic culture is considered to be in the Levant\n(Jericho, modern-day West Bank) about 10,200â8,800 BC. It developed directly\nfrom the Epipaleolithic Natufian culture in the region, whose people pioneered\nthe use of wild cereals, which then evolved into true farming. The Natufian\nperiod was between 12,000 and 10,200 BC, and the so-called \"proto-neolithic\" is\nnow included in the PPNA between 10,200 and 8,800 BC. As the Natufians had\nbecome dependent on wild cereals in their diet, and a sedentary way of life had\nbegun among them, the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas are\nthought to have forced people to develop farming. By 10,200â8,800 BC, farming\ncommunities arose in the Levant and spread to Asia Minor, North Africa and North\nMesopotamia. Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants,\nboth wild and domesticated, which included einkorn wheat, millet and spelt, and\nthe keeping of dogs, sheep and goats. By about 6,900â6,400 BC, it included\ndomesticated cattle and pigs, the establishment of permanently or seasonally\ninhabited settlements, and the use of pottery. The potter's wheel was a\nlater refinement that revolutionized the pottery industry.\n\nNot all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared\neverywhere in the same order: the earliest farming societies in the Near East\ndid not use pottery. In other parts of the world, such as Africa, South Asia and\nSoutheast Asia, independent domestication events led to their own regionally-\ndistinctive Neolithic cultures that arose completely independent of those in\nEurope and Southwest Asia. Early Japanese societies used pottery before\ndeveloping agriculture.\n\nUnlike the Paleolithic, when more than one human species existed, only one\nhuman species ([[Homo sapiens sapiens]]) reached the Neolithic. Homo\nfloresiensis may have survived right up to the very dawn of the Neolithic,\nabout 12,200 years ago.\n\nThe term Neolithic derives from the Greek Î½ÎµÎ¿Î»Î¹Î¸Î¹ÎºÏÏ, neolithikos, from Î½Î­Î¿Ï\nneos, \"new\" + Î»Î¯Î¸Î¿Ï lithos, \"stone\", literally meaning \"New Stone Age.\" The\nterm was invented by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-\nage system.\n","linknr":1058,"url":"Neolithic","recorded":1362480848,"links":112,"instances":["disambiguation","plough","archaeological_site","south_korea","region","polity","mesoamerica","pakistan","north_america","nutrition","lake","textiles","anthropology"],"pdf":["http://www.usj.edu.lb/mpl/pdf/1.pdf"],"categories":["Neolithic|","Holocene"],"headings":["Periods
