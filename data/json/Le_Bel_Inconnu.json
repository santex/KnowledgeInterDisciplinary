His nickname differs depending on the version and language; he is known\nin English as Libeaus Desconus. He is the title character in Le Bel Inconnu, a\npoem composed by Renaut de Beaujeu sometime between the mid-1180s and\n1230, Colby, Alice M. The Lips of the Serpent in the \"Bel Inconnu\". Madrid:\nPlayor. 1977 and in the (destroyed) thirteenth century manuscript,\nGliglois. It is uncertain, however, if the Gliglois of the medieval manuscript\nrefers to Gawain's son or some other character in the \"Fair Unknown\"\ncycle. Review author: Nitze, W. A. Gliglois.

Gingalain is the son\nof Sir Gawain by Blanchemal, a fay that Gawain meets in the forest. Blanchemal\nkeeps Gingalain's identity a secret from him and never tells him about his\nlineage. He realises his desire to be a knight after finding the body of a\nknight in the forest Broadus, Edmund Kemper. The Red Cross Knight and\nLybeaus Desconus.

Colby-Hall, Alice M.\nFrustration and Fulfillment: The Double Ending of the Bel Inconnu. Yale French\nStudies. 1984 Le Bel Inconnu asks for the quest and accompanies the\nprincess's lady-in-waiting and messenger, HÃ©lie, to the besieged city. He\nrescues the princess and out of gratitude, she offers herself to him in\nmarriage. Prior to his rescue mission, Gingalain faces several adventures. The\nmost significant of them is his defeat of Malgier le Gris (\"Malgier the Grey\"),\nan unwanted suitor who wishes to wed Pucelle aux Blanches Mains (the \"Maid of\nthe White Hands\"), mistress of Ile d'Or, and in certain versions, a fae or\nenchantress. The mistress however, does not wish to wed le Gris and is grateful\nwhen Gingalain rescues her from him. In gratitude (and eventually out of love),\nshe offers her saviour marriage along with her lands. They plan to marry but Le\nBel Inconnu leaves before they do in haste to complete his obligation to the\nWelsh princess. He later returns to pay a visit to Pucelle to apologise for his\nabrupt departure during his initial visit.\n\nKing Arthur holds a tournament with the intent to lure Gingalain back to\ncourtâand to steer his decision of marriage more towards the newly crowned Queen\nof Wales. In joining the tournament, Gingalain would have to forfeit his love\nfor Pucelle and never see her again. He decides to join the tournament\nregardless of the sacrifices he would have to make. Pucelle altruistically\noffers to aid him with her powers; she transports him out of her castle with a\nhorse, a squire, and armour to be able to join the tournament. Sturm, Sara.\nThe \"Bel Inconnu's\" Enchantress and the Intent of Renaut de Beaujeu. The French\nReview. 1971 Gingalain eventually marries the queen (de Beaujeu emphasises\nthat the marriage fulfils more social than emotional purposes) and later\ndiscovers that Gawain is his father.\n\nGingalain appears in Thomas Malory's [[Le Morte d'Arthur]], in which he is\nkilled along with his brothers Sir Florence and Sir Lovell when Mordred and\nAgravain expose Guinevere's affair with Lancelot. The Fair Unknown motif was\nvery popular in medieval romance; Gingalain's story is clearly related to (if\nnot the direct source of) the tales of Sir Gareth, Percival, and especially La\nCote Mal Taile.
