Later, hero\n(male) and heroine (female) came to refer to characters who, in the face of\ndanger and adversity or from a position of weakness, display courage and the\nwill for self sacrificeâthat is, heroismâfor some greater good of all humanity.\nThis definition originally referred to martial courage or excellence but\nextended to more general moral excellence.\n\nStories of heroism may serve as moral examples. In classical antiquity, hero\ncults that venerated deified heroes such as Heracles, Perseus, and Achilles\nplayed an important role in Ancient Greek religion. Politicians, ancient and\nmodern, have employed hero worship for their own apotheosis (i.e., cult of\npersonality). Stories of the anti-hero also play a major role in Greek\nmythology. The anti-hero is someone whose qualities are the last expected from a\nperson in certain situations. The favorite type of anti-hero is a characterless\nindividual. âHero.â Bloomsbury Guide to Human Thought. London: Bloomsbury\nPublishing LTD, 1993. Credo Reference.
