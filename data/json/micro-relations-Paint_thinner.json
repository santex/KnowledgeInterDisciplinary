Commercially, solvents labeled \"Paint Thinner\" are usually mineral\nspirits having a flash point at about 40Â°C (104Â°F), the same as some popular\nbrands of charcoal starter.\n\nSolvents used as paint thinners include:\n* Mineral spirits (US) / White spirit (UK)\n* Acetone\n* Mineral turpentine (turps)\n* True turpentine\n* Naphtha\n* Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)\n* Dimethylformamide (DMF)\n* 2-Butoxyethanol, or any of the other glycol ethers\n\nOther solvents sometimes used in the production of paint thinners include: -\n[http://www.decorativewoodwork.com/pdfs/MSDS/DT5910_Thinner_Medium.pdf THINNER\n219 MSDS]\n* Ethylbenzene\n* Xylene\n* n-butyl acetate\n* Butan-1-ol\n\nWhile painting or making the paint of proper consistency by addition of thinner\nliquid there is an exposure to the vapours. ACGIH has established threshold\nlimit values (TLVs) for most of these compounds. TLV is defined as the maximum\nconcentration in air which can be breathed by a normal person (i.e., excluding\nchildren, pregnant women, etc.) in the course of 40 hours work (in US work\nconditions) per week, day after day through their work life without long-term\nill effects. Normally in undeveloped world workers work with much higher\nexposure to these chemicals with consequent damage to their health.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Paint_thinner","recorded":1362561065,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.decorativewoodwork.com/pdfs/MSDS/DT5910_Thinner_Medium.pdf"],"categories":["Inhalants"],"headings":["Personal use","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Solvent","Oil_paint","White_spirit","Flash_point","Mineral_spirits","White_spirit","Acetone","Mineral_turpentine","Turpentine","Naphtha","Methyl_ethyl_ketone","Dimethylformamide","2-Butoxyethanol","Glycol_ethers","Ethylbenzene","Xylene","N-butyl_acetate","Butan-1-ol","American_Conference_of_Governmental_Industrial_Hygienists","Threshold_limit_value"]}
