{"cursor":"85732","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'tire' (or 'tyre') is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel's rim to\nprotect it and enable better vehicle performance. Most tires, such as those for\nautomobiles and bicycles, provide traction between the vehicle and the road\nwhile providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock.\n\nThe fundamental materials of modern pneumatic tires are synthetic rubber,\nnatural rubber, fabric and wire, along with carbon black and other chemical\ncompounds. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while\nthe body provides containment for a quantity of compressed air. Before rubber\nwas developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that\nfitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were\nsolid (not pneumatic). Today, the majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable\nstructures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in\nrubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion.\nPneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including cars, bicycles,\nmotorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft. Metal tires are still used on\nlocomotives and railcars, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still\nused in various non-automotive applications, such as some casters, carts,\nlawnmowers, and wheelbarrows.\n","linknr":1005,"url":"Tire","recorded":1362898021,"links":90,"instances":["engineering","us_television_show","construction","tire","rubber","tires","wheel","automotive","recreation"],"pdf":["http://www.osha.gov/Publications/wheel/wheel-chart-booklet.pdf","http://www.osha.gov/Publications/wheel/wheel-chart-booklet.pdf","http://www.ardeacon.com/pdf/Assessment_Environmental_Toxicity_Report.pdf","http://www.ardeacon.com/pdf/Assessment_Environmental_Toxicity_Report.pdf","http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Rubber%20mulch.pdf","http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Rubber%20mulch.pdf"],"categories":["Scottish
