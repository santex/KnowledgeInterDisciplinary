This\ntechnique also increased \"working period\" making the glass easier to manipulate.\n\nTechnically, the term crystal is not applied to glass, as glass, by definition,\nlacks a crystalline structure. The use of the term lead crystal remains popular\nfor historical and commercial reasons. It is retained from the Venetian word\ncristallo to describe the rock crystal imitated by Murano glassmakers. This\nnaming convention has been maintained to the present day to describe decorative\nhollow-ware. {{cite book |editor= Tait, Hugh| title = Five\nThousand Years of Glass|year = 2004\n| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press (orig. British Museum Press)|isbn\n| = 978-0-8122-1888-6}}\n\nDue to the potential health risks of lead that it contains, true lead crystal\nglassware is rare nowadays. One material that is commonly used to manufacture\nglassware and referred to as \"crystal\" is lead-free 'crystal glass'. In lead-\nfree crystal glass, barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed\ninstead of lead oxide. Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead\ncrystal, but it is lighter and it has less dispersive power. In the\nEuropean Union, labeling of \"crystal\" products is regulated by Council Directive\n69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition\nand properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of\nlead oxide may be referred to as \"lead crystal\". Products with less lead oxide,\nor glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be\nlabeled \"crystallin\" or \"crystal glass\".\n","linknr":506,"url":"Lead_glass","recorded":1362481750,"links":38,"instances":["glass","company","chemistry","optics","optics","optics","corporation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass compositions","Lead compounds"],"headings":["Properties","History","Lead glazes","Lead crystal","Safety","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Swarovski_flacon.JPG/220px-Swarovski_flacon.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Crystbeads.jpg/220px-Crystbeads.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lead(ii_oxide"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"],["dispersion","optics"],["prism","optics"],["lens","optics"],["lead(ii_oxide"],["tin(ii_oxide"],["lead(ii_oxide"],["dispersion","optics"],["prism","optics"],["baccarat","company"],["steuben","glass"],["preciosa","corporation"],["steuben","glass"]],"members":["steuben","baccarat","heavy_metal","lens","prism","dispersion","preciosa"],"related":["Flacon","Glass","Lead","Calcium","Potash","Butterworth-Heinemann","Lead(II)_oxide","Flint_glass","Silica","HarperCollins","Crystal_structure","Venetian_language","Quartz","Murano","University_of_Pennsylvania_Press","British_Museum","Barium_oxide","Zinc_oxide","Potassium_oxide","Lead_oxide","Refractive_index","Viscosity","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Atomic_number","Atomic_mass","Refractive_index","Dispersion_(optics)","Visible_spectrum","Prism_(optics)","Lens_(optics)","Focal_length","Achromatic_lens","Viscosity","Enamelling","Soda-lime_glass","Oscillate","Tin","Copper","Antimony","Ceramic_glaze","Glass_solder","Gamma_radiation","X-ray","Radiation_shielding","Cathode_ray_tube","Ionic_radius","Direct_current","Light_fixture","Ceramic_glaze","Vitreous_enamel","Refractive_index","Radiation_shielding","Electrical_resistance","Glass_solder","Frit","Galena","Smelting","Calcination","Litharge","Middle_Ages","Cupellation","Mesopotamia","Nippur","Assurbanipal","Nimrud","Han_Dynasty","Silk_Road","Natron","Early_modern_Europe","Tessera","Stained_glass","Gemstone","Theophilus_Presbyter","Heraclius","San_Marco","Antonio_Neri","Christopher_Merrett","George_Ravenscroft","Flint_glass","Henley-on-Thames","Waterford","Anglo-Irish","Art_Deco","Ceramic_glaze","Near_East","Galena","Red_lead","White_lead","Lead(II)_oxide","Iznik_pottery","Tin(II)_oxide","Surface_tension","Thermal_expansion","Lead(II)_oxide","Index_of_refraction","Specular_reflection","Total_internal_reflection","Dispersion_(optics)","Prism_(optics)","Fresnel_equations","Baccarat_(company)","France","Dartington_Crystal","England","Luminarc","France","Royal_Brierley","England","Royal_Leerdam_Crystal","Netherlands","Ajka_crystal","Hungary","Steuben_(glass)","United_States","Waterford_Crystal","Ireland","Mikasa_&_Company","Japan","Liuligongfang","Taiwan","Swarovski","Austria","Preciosa_(corporation)","Czech_Republic","Gout","Fortified_wine","Whisky","Lead_poisoning","North_Carolina_State_University","Port_wine","Decanter","U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency","Steuben_(glass)","Waterford_Crystal","Edinburgh_Crystal","Swarovski","List_of_indices_of_refraction","Lead","Hot_cell","Val_Saint_Lambert"]}
