These somatic cells are diploid containing two copies of each\nchromosome, whereas the germ cells are haploid as they only contain one copy\nof each chromosome. Although under normal circumstances all somatic cells\ncontain identical DNA, they develop a variety of tissue-specific\ncharacteristics. This process is called differentiation, through epigenetic\nand regulatory alterations. The grouping of like cells and tissues creates the\nfoundation for organs.\n\nSomatic mutations are changes to the genetics of a multicellular organism which\nare not passed on to its offspring through the germline. Many cancers are\nsomatic mutations.\n\nSomatic is also defined as relating to the wall of the body cavity, particularly\nas distinguished from the head, limbs or viscera.\n\nIt is also used in the term somatic nervous system which is the portion of the\nvertebrate nervous system which regulates voluntary movements of the body.\n",
