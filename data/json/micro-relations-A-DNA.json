{"cursor":"4038","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'A-DNA' is one of the many possible double helical structures of DNA. A-DNA is\nthought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along\nwith B-DNA and Z-DNA. It is a right-handed double helix fairly similar to the\nmore common and well-known B-DNA form, but with a shorter more compact helical\nstructure. It appears likely that it occurs only in dehydrated samples of DNA,\nsuch as those used in crystallographic experiments, and possibly is also assumed\nby DNA-RNA hybrid helices and by regions of double-stranded RNA.\n","linknr":194,"url":"A-DNA","recorded":1362508212,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["Structure","Comparison Geometries of the Most Common DNA Forms","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/A-DNA_orbit_animated_small.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/A-DNA%2C_B-DNA_and_Z-DNA.png/220px-A-DNA%2C_B-DNA_and_Z-DNA.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/B%26Z%26A_DNA_formula.jpg/250px-B%26Z%26A_DNA_formula.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DNA","B-DNA","Z-DNA","B-DNA","Oregon_State_University","Mechanical_properties_of_DNA","DNA","B-DNA","Z-DNA","C-DNA"]}
