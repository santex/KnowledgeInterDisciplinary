There are many formulations of concrete, which provide varied\nproperties, and concrete is the most used man-made product in the world.\n\nConcrete is widely used for making architectural structures, foundations,\nbrick/block walls, pavements, bridges/overpasses, motorways/roads, runways,\nparking structures, dams, pools/reservoirs, pipes, footings for gates, fences\nand poles and even boats.\n\nFamous concrete structures include the Burj Khalifa (world's tallest building),\nHoover Dam, the Panama Canal and the Roman Pantheon.\n\nConcrete technology was known by the Ancient Romans and was widely used\nwithin the Roman Empireâthe Colosseum is largely built of concrete and the\nconcrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest. After the Empire\npassed, use of concrete became scarce until the technology was re-pioneered\nin the mid-18th century.\n","linknr":1075,"url":"Concrete","recorded":1362476916,"links":137,"instances":["deformation","abu_dhabi","properties","himachal_pradesh","engineering","physical","structure","physics","architecture","chemistry","mechanical","masonry"],"pdf":["http://www.romanconcrete.com/Article1Secrets.pdf","http://www.romanconcrete.com/Article1Secrets.pdf","http://www.conductive-concrete.unomaha.edu/publications/papers/f101m32.pdf","http://www.conductive-concrete.unomaha.edu/publications/papers/f101m32.pdf","http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf","http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf","http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf","http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf","http://www.iasks.org/sites/default/files/swes20100102039043.pdf","http://www.iasks.org/sites/default/files/swes20100102039043.pdf","http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf","http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf","http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf","http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf","http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf","http://www.silicafume.org/pdf/reprints-whyhpc.pdf","http://www.silicafume.org/pdf/reprints-whyhpc.pdf","http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf","http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf","http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf","http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf","http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf","http://www.msnucleus.org/membership/html/jh/earth/sedimentary/jhsedmentary.pdf","http://www.leighton.com.au/verve/_resources/AlHabtoorIssue24.pdf","http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf"],"categories":["Concrete|","Building
