It is a colourless solid.\nIt was once used as sedative and hypnotic drug. It remains a useful chemical\nreagent and precursor. It is derived from chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde) by the\naddition of one equivalent of water.\n\nIt was discovered through the chlorination of ethanol in 1832 by Justus von\nLiebig in GieÃen. {{cite journal\n | title = Ueber die Zersetzung des Alkohols durch Chlor author = Justus Liebig\n | journal = Annalen der Pharmacie volume = 1 issue = 1 pages = 31â32 year =\n | 1832 url = doi = 10.1002/jlac.18320010109}} {{cite journal title =\n | Ueber die Verbindungen, welche durch die Einwirkung des Chlors auf Alkohol,\n | Aether, Ã¶lbildendes Gas und Essiggeist entstehen author = Justus Liebig\n | journal = Annalen der Pharmacie volume = 1 issue = 2 pages = 182â230 year =\n | 1832 url = doi = 10.1002/jlac.18320010203}} Its sedative properties\n | were first published in 1869 and subsequently, because of its easy\n | synthesis, its use was widespread. {{cite book author = Liebreich, Oskar\n | title = Das Chloralhydrat : ein neues Hypnoticum und Anaestheticum und\n | dessen Anwendung in der Medicin ; eine Arzneimittel-Untersuchung year = 1869\n | publisher = MÃ¼ller\n |location= Berlin}} It was widely used recreationally and misprescribed\n in the late 19th century. Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and alcohol,\n readily forming concentrated solutions. A solution of chloral hydrate in\n alcohol called \"knockout drops\" was used to prepare a Mickey\n Finn. http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/chloral_hydrate.html More\n reputable uses of chloral hydrate include its use as a clearing agent for\n chitin and fibers and as a key ingredient in Hoyer's mounting medium, which is\n used to prepare permanent or semipermanent microscope slides of small\n organisms, histological sections, and chromosome squashes. Because of its\n status as a regulated substance, chloral hydrate can be difficult to obtain. To\n cope with procurement problems, Rutgers scientists have developed a substitute\n for chloral hydrate for use in microscopy, known as Visikol http://visikol-\n .com http://otc.rutgers.edu/tech/agriculture-and-plant-\n technologies.php\n\nIt is, together with chloroform, a minor side-product of the chlorination of\nwater when organic residues are present in the water, though concentrations\nrarely exceed 5 micrograms per litre (Âµg/L).\n\nChloral hydrate has not been approved by the FDA in the United States or the EMA\nin the European Union for any medical indication and is on the list of\nunapproved drugs that is still prescribed by clinicians.
