Bloomberg makes up one third of the $16 billion global financial data\nmarket, with estimated revenue of $7.6 billion in 2011.\nBloomberg L.P. was founded by Michael R. Bloomberg with the help of Thomas\nSecunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar in 1981 and a 30% ownership\ninvestment by Merrill Lynch. The company provides financial software\ntools such as analytics and equity trading platform, data services and news to\nfinancial companies and organizations around the world through the Bloomberg\nTerminal (via its Bloomberg Professional Service), its core money-\ngenerating product. Many customers use only a small fraction of the machine's\n30,146 functions. Bloomberg L.P. has grown to include a global news\nservice, including television, radio, the Internet and printed publications.\n\nIts current headquarters are located at the Bloomberg Tower, in Midtown\nManhattan, New York City. The building is also known as One Beacon Court for the\nlighted rectangular beacon that caps the tower and the paved courtyard at the\nground level.\n\nBloomberg L.P. was formed as a Delaware Limited Partnership in 1981 and has been\nin business since 1983. Michael Bloomberg owns 88% of the partnership.\nBloomberg's core business is leasing terminals to subscribers. It also runs\nBloomberg Television, a financial television network, and the business radio\nstation WBBR in New York City. There are currently over 300,000 Bloomberg\nTerminal subscribers worldwide. Its competitors include SNL Financial,\nInteractive Data Corporation, Thomson Reuters, S&P Capital IQ, Dow Jones\nNewswires, FactSet, Dealogic, and smaller companies such as New York Financial\nPress. In late 1996 Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30\npercent stake in his company for $200 million valuing the company at\n$2 billion. In July 2008, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its 20% stake in the firm\nback to Bloomberg, for a reported $4.43 billion, valuing the firm at\napproximately $22.5 billion.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Bloomberg_L.P.","recorded":1362897376,"links":41,"instances":["magazine","bloomberg","business_rank","number"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1981 establishments in the United States","Bloomberg L.P.|","Companies based in Manhattan","Companies established in 1981","Financial news agencies","Financial data vendors","Media companies based in New York City","Multinational companies based in New York City","News agencies based in the United States","Privately held companies based in New York City"],"headings":["History, services and products","Corporate governance","Litigation against Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Bloomberg_logo.svg/200px-Bloomberg_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Bloomberg_in_London.jpg/235px-Bloomberg_in_London.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_New_York_City.svg/32px-Flag_of_New_York_City.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["duncan_macmillan","bloomberg"],["1000000000","number"],["duncan_macmillan","bloomberg"],["partner","business_rank"],["vanity_fair","magazine"]],"members":["vanity_fair","duncan_macmillan","partner","1000000000"],"related":["Limited_partnership","Mass_media","Broadcasting","Publishing","Radio","Michael_R._Bloomberg","Thomas_Secunda","Duncan_MacMillan_(Bloomberg)","Charles_Zegar","Bloomberg_Tower","Midtown_Manhattan","New_York_City","USA","Peter_Grauer","Dan_Doctoroff","1000000000_(number)","Multinational_corporation","Mass_media","New_York_City","Michael_R._Bloomberg","Thomas_Secunda","Duncan_MacMillan_(Bloomberg)","Merrill_Lynch","Bloomberg_Terminal","Printing","Bloomberg_Tower","Midtown_Manhattan","One_Beacon_Court","Delaware","Limited_Partnership","Michael_Bloomberg","Bloomberg_Television","Television_network","WBBR","SNL_Financial","Interactive_Data_Corporation","Thomson_Reuters","S&P_Capital_IQ","Dow_Jones_Newswires","FactSet","Dealogic","New_York_Financial_Press","Salomon_Brothers","Michael_Bloomberg","Partner_(business_rank)","Merrill_Lynch","Bloomberg_Television","Mark_J._Green","Mike_Bloomberg","Daniel_Doctoroff","Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission","Class-action_lawsuit","Maternity_leave","Investigative_journalism","Vanity_Fair_(magazine)","BusinessWeek","McGraw-Hill","The_New_York_Times","Gerson_Lehrman_Group","Bureau_of_National_Affairs","Renewable_energy","Peter_Grauer","Daniel_Doctoroff","Thomas_Secunda","Arthur_Levitt","Jane_Bryant_Quinn","Late-2000s_financial_crisis","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit","U.S._Supreme_Court","A._M._Best","Bloomberg_Markets","Bloomberg_Terminal","Dominion_Bond_Rating_Service","Fitch_Ratings","Markit_Group","Morningstar,_Inc.","Moody's","Nationally_Recognized_Statistical_Rating_Organization","Standard_&_Poor's"]}
