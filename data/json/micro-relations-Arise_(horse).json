He was sired by the 1936 Santa Anita Derby winner,\nHe Did, a son of the 1928 Preakness Stakes winner, Victorian. Out of the dam\nCoralie B., his damsire Apprehension was a grandson of English Triple Crown\nchampion, Rock Sand.\n\nArise was purchased by Harry Addison, Sr. and Mrs. Jack Addison of Toronto,\nOntario from breeder R. M. Wood in 1946. They entrusted the colt's race\nconditioning to future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer, Jim Bentley.\nIn 1948 the two-year-old Arise was sent south to race in New York State where he\nwon twice and was notably second in the Youthful Stakes, a race that at the time\nwas one of the most important of the year for juveniles. As a three-year-old in\n1949, Arise earned wins in important both Canada and the United States. At\nToronto's Thorncliffe Park Raceway he set a track record for six furlongs and at\nLong Branch Racetrack he won the Canadian Championship Stakes. Racing in the\nUnited States, at New York's Saratoga Race Course Arise captured the Travers\nStakes, marking the first-ever win in that prestigious race by a Canadian-owned\nhorse. In the Jerome Handicap, he finished second by a nose to Capot. At age\nfour, Arise continue to perform with the best. At Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens,\nNew York he won the Excelsior Handicap and the Fall Highweight Handicap plus the\nAmerican Legion Handicap at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nSent back to the track at age six, Arise won the 1951 Monmouth Handicap, the\nQuestionnaire Handicap and defeated Piet in winning the Carter Handicap.\n\nRetired from racing, in 1953 Arise was sent to stand at stud at Kentucky's\nrenowned Claiborne Farm. His time as a stallion was limited as he produced only\na few offspring in 1954 and 1955, non of which met with racing success.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Arise_(horse)","recorded":1362689090,"links":10,"instances":["horse","horse","horse","animal","color"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1946 racehorse births","Thoroughbred racehorses","Racehorses bred in Kentucky","Racehorses trained in the United States","Canadian racehorses","American racehorses"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["victorian","horse"],["stallion","horse"],["brown","color"],["victorian","horse"],["piet","horse"],["stud","animal"]],"members":["victorian","stallion","piet","stud","brown"],"related":["He_Did","Victorian_(horse)","Stallion_(horse)","United_States","Brown_(color)","James_C._Bentley","Canadian_International_Stakes","Travers_Stakes","Fall_Highweight_Handicap","Excelsior_Handicap","Carter_Handicap","Philip_H._Iselin_Stakes","Canadian_Horse_Racing_Hall_of_Fame","Hamburg_Place","Kentucky","Canada","Canadian_Horse_Racing_Hall_of_Fame","Thoroughbred","Horse_racing","Santa_Anita_Derby","He_Did","Preakness_Stakes","Victorian_(horse)","Rock_Sand","Toronto","Ontario","James_C._Bentley","New_York","Youthful_Stakes","Toronto","Long_Branch_Racetrack","Canadian_International_Stakes","Saratoga_Race_Course","Travers_Stakes","Jerome_Handicap","Capot","Aqueduct_Racetrack","Queens","New_York","Excelsior_Handicap","Fall_Highweight_Handicap","American_Legion_Handicap","Philip_H._Iselin_Stakes","Questionnaire_Handicap","Piet_(horse)","Carter_Handicap","Stud_(animal)","Kentucky","Claiborne_Farm"]}
