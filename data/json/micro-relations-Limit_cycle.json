{"cursor":"2679","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] In mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a 'limit cycle' on a plane\nor a two-dimensional manifold  is a closed trajectory in phase space having the property that\nat least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity\nor as time approaches negative infinity. Such behavior is exhibited in some\nnonlinear systems. In the case where all the neighbouring trajectories approach\nthe limit cycle as time approaches infinity, it is called a [[stable\nmanifold|stable]] or attractive limit cycle (Ï-limit cycle). If instead all\nneighbouring trajectories approach it as time approaches negative infinity, it\nis an unstable or non-attractive limit cycle (Î±-limit cycle).\n\nStable limit cycles imply self-sustained oscillations. Any small perturbation\nfrom the closed trajectory would cause the system to return to the limit cycle,\nmaking the system stick to the limit cycle.\n\n]] As seen in the figure, trajectories for various initial states of this system\nconverge to the limit cycle. Hence, this system exhibits self-sustained\noscillations.\n\nThe number of limit cycles of a polynomial differential equation is the main\nobject of the second part of Hilbert's sixteenth problem. Bendixson's theorem\nand the PoincarÃ©âBendixson theorem predict the absence or existence,\nrespectively, of limit cycles of two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Limit_cycle","recorded":1362689208,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Limit sets"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Limit_cycle_Poincare_map.svg/250px-Limit_cycle_Poincare_map.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png/250px-VanDerPolPhaseSpace.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Dynamical_systems","Two-dimensional_manifold","Trajectory","Phase_space","Nonlinear_systems","Oscillations","Hilbert's_sixteenth_problem","Bendixson–Dulac_theorem","Poincaré–Bendixson_theorem","Periodic_point","Stable_manifold","Hyperbolic_set"]}
