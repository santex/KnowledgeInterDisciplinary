{"cursor":"9028","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'greeting card' is an illustrated, folded card featuring an expression of\nfriendship or other sentiment. Although greeting cards are usually given on\nspecial occasions such as birthdays, Christmas or other holidays, they are also\nsent to convey thanks or express other feeling. Greeting cards, usually packaged\nwith an envelope, come in a variety of styles. There are both mass-produced as\nwell as handmade versions that are distributed by hundreds of companies large\nand small. While typically inexpensive, more elaborate cards with die-cuts or\nglued-on decorations may be more expensive.\n\nHallmark Cards and American Greetings are the largest producers of greeting\ncards in the world. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that one billion\npounds are spent on greeting cards every year, with the average person sending\n55 cards per year.\n\nIn western countries and increasingly in other societies, many people\ntraditionally mail seasonally themed cards to their friends and relatives in\nDecember. Many service businesses also send cards to their customers in this\nseason, usually with a universally acceptable non-religious message such as\n\"happy holidays\" or \"seasons's greetings\".\n\nThe Greeting Card Association is an international trade organization\nrepresenting the interests of greeting card and stationery manufacturers. John\nBeeder, former president of the Greeting Card Association, says greeting cards\nare effective tools to communicate important feelings to people you care about:\n\"Anyone feels great when they receive an unexpected card in the mail. For me,\nthereâs nothing like a greeting card to send a special message. Iâm proud to be\na part of an industry that not only keeps people connected, but uses both\nimagery and the power of words to help us express our emotions.â\n","linknr":186,"url":"Greeting_card","recorded":1362579141,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Greeting cards|","Postcards"],"headings":["Types of greeting cards","History","Postcards","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Greetingcardsretaildisplay.jpg/275px-Greetingcardsretaildisplay.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Greetingscards.jpg/275px-Greetingscards.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Greeting-cards.png/275px-Greeting-cards.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Hubble_-_greetings_card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Birthday","Christmas","Holiday","Envelope","Hallmark_Cards","American_Greetings","United_Kingdom","Greeting_Card_Association","Trade","Card_stock","Gold_leaf","Ribbon","Glitter","Holiday_greetings","Christmas","Hanukkah","Baby_shower","Moonpig","Happy_Birthday_To_You","Adobe_Flash","Facebook","China","Ancient_Egypt","Papyrus","British_Museum","Postage_stamp","Christmas_card","Sir_Henry_Cole","John_Calcott_Horsley","Marcus_Ward_&_Co","Kate_Greenaway","Walter_Crane","Lithography","Studio_cards","Recycled_Paper_Greetings","Hallmark_Cards","Craig_Shergold","Chain_mail","Postcard","Mail","Birth_announcement","Cardboard_engineering","Cardmaking","Christmas_card","E-card","Love_Coupon","Postcard","Valentine's_Day"]}
