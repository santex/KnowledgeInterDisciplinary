This liquidâliquid phase transition would be a\nfirst order, discontinuous transition between low and high density liquids\n(labelled 1 and 2). This is analogous to polymorphism of crystalline materials,\nwhere different stable crystalline states (solid 1, 2 in diagram) of the same\nsubstance can exist (e.g. diamond and graphite are two polymorphs of carbon).\nLike the ordinary liquidâgas transition, the liquidâliquid transition is\nexpected to end in a critical point. At temperatures beyond these critical\npoints there is a continuous range of fluid states, i.e. the distinction between\nliquids and gasses is lost. If crystallisation is avoided the liquidâliquid\ntransition can be extended into the metastable supercooled liquid regime.]]\n\n, which exhibits the ordinary liquidâgas critical point. The red line is a\ndouble well type potential, which is proposed for polyamorphous systems. The grey line, is a representative of the soft core square\nwell potentials, which in atomisitc simulations exhibit liquidâliquid\ntransitions and a second critical point. The numbers 1 and\n2 correspond to the 1st and second minima in the potentials.]]\n\n'Polyamorphism' is the ability of a substance to exist in several different\namorphous modifications. It is analogous to the polymorphism of crystalline\nmaterials. Many amorphous substances can exist with different amorphous\ncharacteristics (e.g. polymers). However, polyamorphism requires two distinct\namorphous states with a clear, discontinuous (first-order) phase transition\nbetween them. When such a transition occurs between two stable liquid states, a\npolyamorphic transition may also be referred to as a 'liquidâliquid phase\ntransition'.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Polyamorphism","recorded":1362481778,"links":14,"instances":["thermodynamics","materials_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phase transitions","Phases of matter","Amorphous solids"],"headings":["Overview","Liquid–liquid transitions","Examples of polyamorphism","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Liquid-liquid.gif/300px-Liquid-liquid.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Liq-liq-potential2.svg/300px-Liq-liq-potential2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","materials_science"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"]],"members":["critical_point","polymorphism"],"related":["Phase_transition","Discontinuous","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Supercooled_liquid","Amorphous","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Crystal","Phase_transition","Long-range_order","Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses","Density","Amorphous_ice","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)","Molecular_modelling","Amorphous_ice","Liquid_nitrogen","Phase_transition","Yttria","Alumina","Silicon_dioxide","Germanium_dioxide","Triphenyl_phosphite","Glass","Liquid","Amorphous_solid","Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses","Polymorphism","Pair_distribution_function"]}
