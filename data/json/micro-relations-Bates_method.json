Eye-\ncare physician William Horatio Bates (1860â1931) attributed nearly all sight\nproblems to habitual strain of the eyes, and felt that glasses were harmful and\nnever necessary. Bates self-published a as well as a (and earlier collaborated\nwith Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to\nhelping people relax such strain, and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His\ntechniques centered around visualization and movement. He placed particular\nemphasis on imagining black letters and marks, and the movement of such. He also\nfelt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate eyestrain.\n\nAlthough many of Bates' patients and followers of his methods have reported of\nsuccessful results (most famously from author Aldous Huxley),\nhis methods have garnered much opposition from mainstream optometry. Bates was\ndisbarred from the American Optometric Association because his techniques had\nnot been shown objectively to improve eyesight. Despite\nthis, some behavioral optometrists and visual therapists continue to employ\nmethods developed by Bates.\n\nBates' main physiological proposition â that the eyeball changes shape to\nmaintain focus â has consistently been contradicted by observation. In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates,\nâMost of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by\npractically all visual scientists.â Marg concluded that\nthe Bates method owed its popularity largely to \"flashes of clear vision\"\nexperienced by many who followed it. Such occurrences have\nsince been determined to most likely be a contact lens-like effect of moisture\non the eye.\n\nBoth critics and proponents of the Bates method caution against overexposing the\neyes to sunlight, driving without the legally required correction, or completely\nneglecting conventional eye care.\n","linknr":630,"url":"Bates_method","recorded":1362551677,"links":49,"instances":["author","physician","eye","science","anatomy","optics","psychology"],"pdf":["http://brain.berkeley.edu/pub/1952%20April%20Flashes%20of%20Clear%20Vision.pdf","http://brain.berkeley.edu/pub/1952%20April%20Flashes%20of%20Clear%20Vision.pdf","http://www.cmj.slma.lk/cmj4904/cmj4904.pdf","http://www.cmj.slma.lk/cmj4904/cmj4904.pdf","http://www.visiontherapy.net/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf","http://www.visiontherapy.net/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf","http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/pdfhandler.00006324-199711000-00020.pdf","http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/pdfhandler.00006324-199711000-00020.pdf","http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10(S1)pS65.pdf","http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10(S1)pS65.pdf","http://www.pesudovs.com/konrad/Docs/Brennan.pdf","http://www.pesudovs.com/konrad/Docs/Brennan.pdf","http://ukpmc.ac.uk/backend/ptpmcrender.cgi?accid=PMC2282772&blobtype=pdf","http://ukpmc.ac.uk/backend/ptpmcrender.cgi?accid=PMC2282772&blobtype=pdf","http://www.oepf.org/jbo/journals/5-5%20Orfield.pdf","http://www.oepf.org/jbo/journals/5-5%20Orfield.pdf"],"categories":["Manipulative
