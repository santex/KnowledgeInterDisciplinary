He represents the male part of the religion's duotheistic\ntheological system, the other part being the female Triple Goddess or other\nMother Goddess http://www.druidry.org/library/gods-goddesses/horned-god-\nunofficial-autobiography from the library of the Order of Bards, Ovates &\nDruids . In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness,\nsexuality, hunting and the life cycle. Whilst\ndepictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either horns or antlers\nupon his head, often depicted as being theriocephalic, in this way emphasizing\n\"the union of the divine and the animal\", the latter of which includes\nhumanity.\n\nThe term Horned God itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th century\nsyncretic term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with\npseudohistorical origins Michael D. Bailey Witchcraft Historiography\n(review) in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp.\n81-85 who, according to Margaret Murray's 1921 [[The Witch-Cult in Western\nEurope]], was the deity worshipped by a pan-European witchcraft-based cult, and\nwas demonized into the form of the Devil by the Mediaeval Church.\n\nThe Horned God has been explored within several psychological theories, and\nhas become a recurrent theme in fantasy literature.
