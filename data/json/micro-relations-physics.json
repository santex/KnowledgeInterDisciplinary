However, the term 'universe' may also be used in\nslightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or\nthe philosophical world.\n\nPhysics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through\nits inclusion of astronomy. The earliest civilizations dating back to beyond\n3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley\nCivilization, all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of\nthe motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. Over the last two millennia,\nphysics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, certain branches\nof mathematics, and biology, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th\ncentury, the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own\nright. Francis Bacon's 1620 [[Novum Organum]] was critical in the\ndevelopment of scientific method. Physics intersects with many\ninterdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry,\nand the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics\noften explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening new\navenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.\n\nPhysics also makes significant contributions through advances in new\ntechnologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs. For example, advances in\nthe understanding of electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the\ndevelopment of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day\nsociety, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear\nweapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization;\nand advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"physics","recorded":1363582112,"links":[],"instances":["philosophy","philosophy","physics","science","matter","physics","science","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts
