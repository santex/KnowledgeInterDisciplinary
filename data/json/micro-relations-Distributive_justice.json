{"cursor":"6687","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Distributive justice' concerns the nature of a socially just allocation of\ngoods in a society. A society in which incidental inequalities in outcome do not\narise would be considered a society guided by the principles of distributive\njustice. The concept includes the available quantities of goods, the process by\nwhich goods are to be distributed, and the resulting allocation of the goods to\nthe members of the society.\n\nOften contrasted with just process, which is concerned with the administration\nof law, distributive justice concentrates on outcomes. A prominent contemporary\ntheorist of distributive justice is the philosopher John Rawls. This subject has\nbeen given considerable attention in philosophy and social sciences.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Distributive_justice","recorded":1362570281,"links":24,"instances":["economics_and_accounting","economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Justice","Social ethics","Philosophical concepts"],"headings":["Distributive justice in organizations","Distributive justice and wealth","Distributive justice in policy positions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics_and_accounting"],["distribution","economics"],["justice","economics"]],"members":["good","justice","distribution"],"related":["Social_justice","Good_(economics_and_accounting)","Procedural_justice","Philosopher","John_Rawls","Organizational_justice","Organizational_citizenship_behavior","Consequentialist","Human_rights","South_Africa","Retributive_justice","Restorative_justice","Interactional_justice","Redistributive_justice","Injustice","Utilitarianism","Consequentialism","Extended_sympathy","Constitutional_economics","Distribution_(economics)","Justice_(economics)","Rule_of_law","Rule_According_to_Higher_Law","Teaching_for_social_justice","Edmund_S._Phelps","Ascension_Health","Beyond_Intractability","Allyn_&_Bacon","Plenum","The_Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
