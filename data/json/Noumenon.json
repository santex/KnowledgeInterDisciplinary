In Ancient philosophy, the noumenal realm was equated\nwith the world of ideas known to the philosophical mind, in contrast to the\nphenomenal realm, which was equated with the world of sensory reality, known to\nthe uneducated mind. [http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~dmycoff/plato.html\n\"Platonist frames of thought draw a dividing line between two realms. One realm,\nthe inferior of the two, is the material, physical world of sense experience. It\nis the \"phenomenal\" world, the world of objects, of the body, of immediate\nperception. The other, superior realm is the world of the immaterial, the\nspiritual, the world of realities not accessible to the body's senses, the world\nknown by intellect or spiritual sense, the \"noumenal\" world.\"] Much of\nmodern philosophy has generally been skeptical of the possibility of knowledge\nindependent of the senses, and Immanuel Kant gave this point of view its\nclassical version, saying that the noumenal world may exist, but it is\ncompletely unknowable to humans. In Kantian philosophy the unknowable noumenon\nis often linked to the unknowable \"thing per se\" (Ding an sich), although how to\ncharacterize the nature of the relationship is a question yet open to some\ncontroversy.\n","linknr":550,"url":"Noumenon","recorded":1362676159,"links":41,"instances":["philosophy","philosophy","novel","philosophy","kant"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epistemology","Metaphysics","Enlightenment philosophy","Kantianism"],"headings":["Etymology","Usage in reference to pre-Kantian philosophy","Kant's usage","Criticisms of Kant's noumenon","References in Popular Culture","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phenomena","philosophy"],["object","philosophy"],["phenomena","philosophy"],["category","kant"],["indeterminacy","philosophy"],["bend_sinister","novel"]],"members":["indeterminacy","object","bend_sinister","phenomena","category"],"related":["Senses","Phenomena_(philosophy)","Object_(philosophy)","The_senses","Ancient_philosophy","Theory_of_Forms","Empirical_evidence","Immanuel_Kant","Greek_language","Participle","Nous","Platonic_form","Etymology","Greek_language","Phenomena_(philosophy)","Category_(Kant)","Categories_of_understanding","Exist","Critique_of_Pure_Reason","Teodor_Oizerman","Schopenhauer's_criticism_of_the_Kantian_philosophy","Plato","George_Berkeley","Omnipotence","Immaterialism","Schopenhauer","Kant","Criticism_of_the_Kantian_Philosophy","Noumena","Phenomena","Sextus_Empiricus","Eleatics","Plato","Dialectic","Megarics","Scholastics","Nominalism","Philosophical_realism","Aristotle","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Interaction","Causal_chain","Properties","Indeterminacy_(Philosophy)","Karl_Popper","Falsifiability","Tao_Lin","Vladimir_Nabokov","Bend_Sinister_(novel)","Anatta","Haecceity","Hypokeimenon","Schopenhauer's_criticism_of_the_Kantian_philosophy","Transcendental_idealism","Unobservables","Paul_Carus"]}
