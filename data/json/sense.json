The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are\noverlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience,\ncognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The\nnervous system has a specific sensory system or organ, dedicated to each sense.\n\nHumans have a multitude of senses. Sight (ophthalmoception), hearing\n(audioception), taste (gustaoception), smell (olfacoception or olfacception),\nand touch (tactioception) are the five traditionally recognized. While the\nability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by the traditional senses\nexists, including temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense\n(proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), and various\ninternal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and\ncarbon dioxide concentrations in the blood), only a small number of these can\nsafely be classified as separate senses in and of themselves. What constitutes a\nsense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what\nexactly a sense is.\n\nAnimals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of\ncapability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak\nsense of smell, while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five\nsenses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very\ndifferent ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way\nthat humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic\nfields, and detect water pressure and currents.\n","title":"sense","headings":["Definition","Traditional senses","Other senses","Non-human senses","Culture","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Perception","2: Sensory_system","2: Magnetic_field","2: Ayatana","2: Inner_ear","2: Skin","2: Bees","2: Human_echolocation","2: Bird","2: Haidinger's_brush","2: Entoptic_phenomenon","1: Physiological","1: Organism","1: Neuroscience","1: Cognitive_psychology","1: Cognitive_science","1: Philosophy_of_perception","1: Nervous_system","1: Electrical_field","1: Water_pressure","1: Thermoception","1: Magnetoception","1: Nociception","1: Equilibrioception","1: Proprioception","1: Electroreception","1: Polarized_light","1: Buddhist_philosophy","1: The_Walters_Art_Museum","1: Light","1: Photoreceptor_cell","1: Retina","1: Action_potential","1: Rod_cell","1: Cone_cell","1: Stereopsis","1: Visual_cortex","1: Real_image","1: Blindness","1: Infarct","1: Blindsight","1: Sound","1: Hertz","1: Deafness","1: Seismic_communication","1: Taste","1: Sweet","1: Sour","1: Saltiness","1: Umami","1: Free_fatty_acids","1: Olfactory_system","1: Olfactory_receptor_neuron","1: Human_nose","1: Anosmia","1: Pheromone","1: Hair_follicle","1: Tongue","1: Throat","1: Mucous_membrane","1: Pressure","1: Itch","1: Anesthesia","1: Paresthesia","1: Numbness","1: Angular_momentum","1: Linear_acceleration","1: Gravity","1: Vestibular_nerve","1: Osseous_ampullae","1: Semicircular_canal","1: Saccule","1: Otolith","1: Calcium_carbonate","1: Heat_flow","1: Pit_vipers","1: Homeostasis","1: POAH","1: Parietal_lobe","1: Pain","1: Anterior_cingulate_gyrus","1: Psychologist","1: Neuroscientist","1: Time","1: Cerebral_cortex","1: Cerebellum","1: Basal_ganglia","1: Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","1: Circadian_rhythm","1: Ultradian","1: Pulmonary_stretch_receptors","1: Respiratory_rate","1: Peripheral_chemoreceptors","1: Suffocation","1: Chemoreceptor_trigger_zone","1: Medulla_oblongata","1: Blood","1: Drug","1: Hormone","1: Vomiting_center","1: Cutaneous_receptor","1: Blushing","1: Gastrointestinal_tract","1: Esophagus","1: Swallowing","1: Vomiting","1: Acid_reflux","1: Pharynx","1: Gag_reflex","1: Urinary_bladder","1: Rectum","1: Sharks","1: Insect","1: Salamander","1: Reptile","1: Vomeronasal_organ","1: Pheromones","1: Snake","1: Monitor_lizard","1: Flehmen","1: Human_vestigiality","1: Flies","1: Butterflies","1: Catfish","1: Cats","1: Tapetum_lucidum","1: Crotalinae","1: Pythonidae","1: Boidae","1: Infrared","1: Common_vampire_bat","1: Birds","1: Tetrachromats","1: Ultraviolet","1: Dragonflies","1: Statocyst","1: Bat","1: Cetacea","1: Sonar","1: Animal_echolocation","1: Electric_field","1: Shark","1: Dolphin","1: Monotreme","1: Platypus","1: Whisker","1: Body_modification","1: Bee","1: Magnetotactic_bacteria","1: Gas_bladder","1: Weather_fish","1: Lateral_line","1: Vortex","1: Hair_cell","1: Electroception","1: Cuttlefish","1: Venus_fly_trap","1: William_Shakespeare","1: Katha_Upanishad","1: Chariot","1: Allegory","1: Dutch_Golden_Age_painting","1: Flemish_Baroque_painter","1: Gérard_de_Lairesse","1: Convex_mirror","1: Cupid","1: Tamil_Literature","1: Tholkappiyam","1: Apperception","1: Attention","1: Āyatana","1: Basic_taste","1: Chemesthesis","1: Communication","1: Empiricism","1: Extrasensory_perception","1: Hypersensitivity","1: Supertaster","1: Tetrachromat","1: Illusion","1: Auditory_illusion","1: Optical_illusion","1: Touch_illusion","1: Multimodal_integration","1: Phantom_limb","1: Remote_sensing","1: Ṣaḍāyatana","1: Buddhism","1: Sensation_and_perception_psychology","1: Sense_of_time","1: Sensorium","1: Sensory_Processing_Disorder","1: Sixth_sense","1: Synesthesia","1: Ideasthesia","1: Howard_Hughes_Medical_Institute","1: Nobel_Prize","1: Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","1: Richard_Axel","1: Linda_Buck"]}
