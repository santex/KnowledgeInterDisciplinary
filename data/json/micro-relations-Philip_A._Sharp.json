He shared the 1993 Nobel\nPrize in Physiology or Medicine with Richard J. Roberts for \"the discovery that\ngenes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns, and that the\nsplicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways,\nyielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence\".\n","linknr":941,"url":"Philip_A._Sharp","recorded":1362374416,"links":43,"instances":["kentucky"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1944 births","Living people","American geneticists","American Nobel laureates","California Institute of Technology faculty","Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization","Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty","National Medal of Science laureates","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","People from Pendleton County, Kentucky","University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign alumni","The Scripps Research Institute","Union College (Kentucky) alumni","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research"],"headings":["Biography","Honors","Private life","Awards And Nominations","Selected publications","See also","References and external links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Phillip_A_Sharp_NIH.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Phillip_A_Sharp.jpg/300px-Phillip_A_Sharp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["union_college","kentucky"],["union_college","kentucky"]],"members":["union_college"],"related":["Falmouth,_Kentucky","United_States","Biologist","Union_College_(Kentucky)","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","Caltech","Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory","MIT","Andrew_Fire","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","National_Medal_of_Science","United_States_of_America","Geneticist","Molecular_biology","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Richard_J._Roberts","Gene","Eukaryote","Intron","Messenger_RNA","Protein","Falmouth,_Kentucky","Union_College_(Kentucky)","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","California_Institute_of_Technology","Plasmid","Gene_expression","Cold_Spring_Harbor_Laboratory","James_Dewey_Watson","MIT","Salvador_Luria","Koch_Institute_for_Integrative_Cancer_Research","McGovern_Institute_for_Brain_Research","Institute_Professor","Biogen_Idec","Alnylam_Pharmaceuticals","Magen_Biosciences","Xconomy","The_Scripps_Research_Institute","National_Medal_of_Science","Louisa_Gross_Horwitz_Prize","Columbia_University","Thomas_R._Cech","Benjamin_Franklin_Medal_for_Distinguished_Achievement_in_the_Sciences","American_Philosophical_Society","Pendleton_County,_Kentucky","USA_Science_and_Engineering_Festival","USA_Science_and_Engineering_Festival","MIT150","MIT","Foreign_Member_of_the_Royal_Society","History_of_RNA_biology","List_of_RNA_biologists","MIT_Biology_Department","United_States","Falmouth,_Kentucky"]}
