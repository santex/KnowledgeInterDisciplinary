OCI special agents employ customary federal\nlaw enforcement methods and techniques in the investigation of suspected\ncriminal violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Anti-\nTampering Act, and other related federal statutes. OCI investigations\nconcentrate on significant violations of these laws, with a priority on conduct\nthat may present a danger to the public health. OCI is a relatively small\nagency, employing approximately 180 Special Agents.\n\nThe FDA regulates approximately 25 cents of every dollar spent annually by\nAmerican consumers. FDA is responsible for regulating products to ensure the\nsafety of foods, drugs, biological products, medical devices, cosmetics, radiation-\nemitting devices, and more. As the law enforcement arm of FDA, the Office of\nCriminal Investigations conducts and coordinates criminal investigations\nregarding possible violations of the laws which regulate these products.\n\nPursuant to its investigative mission, OCI maintains liaison and cooperative\ninvestigative efforts with various federal, state, local, and international law\nenforcement agencies. OCI is designated by the Commissioner as the Agencyâs\npoint of contact with the U.S. intelligence community as it relates to the\nAgency's counter-terrorism mission. OCI has representation at the Interpol U.S.\nNational Central Bureau in Washington, DC.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Office_of_Criminal_Investigations","recorded":1362688777,"links":24,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Federal law enforcement agencies of the United States","Food and Drug Administration"],"headings":["History","Mission","Jurisdiction","Violations","Special Agents","Case activity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/FDA-OCI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/FDA_inspection.jpg/220px-FDA_inspection.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Nuvola_apps_agent.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_agent.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["medicare","united_states"]],"members":["medicare"],"related":["United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","Phillips_Foods,_Inc._and_Seafood_Restaurants","Counterfeit_drug","Fraud","Serostim","Clinical_investigator","Food_Contamination/Poisoning","OxyContin","Illegal_drug_distribution","Medicaid","Medicare_(United_States)","Surgical_device","Flu_vaccine","List_of_United_States_federal_law_enforcement_agencies"]}
