The goal\nis to find all functional elements in the human genome, one of the most critical\nprojects by NHGRI after it completed the successful Human Genome Project. All\ndata generated in the course of the project will be released rapidly into public\ndatabases.\n\nOn 5 September 2012, initial results of the project were released in a\ncoordinated set of 30 papers published in the journals [[Nature\n(journal)|Nature]] (6 publications), [[Genome Biology]] (18 papers), and\n[[Genome Research]] (6 papers). These publications combine\nto show that approximately 20% of noncoding DNA in the human genome is\nfunctional while an additional 60% is transcribed with no known function. Much of this functional non-coding DNA is\ninvolved in the regulation of the expression of coding genes. Furthermore the expression of each coding gene is\ncontrolled by multiple regulatory sites located both near and distant from the\ngene. These results demonstrate that gene regulation is far more complex than\npreviously believed.\n\nGenome-wide association studies have determined that approximately 90% of single-\nletter differences in sequences that are associated with various diseases fall\noutside of protein coding regions. Previously it was not clear how these\nsequence differences could influence disease however new gene regulatory sites\ndiscovered by the ENCODE project in many cases provide an explanation.\n","linknr":343,"url":"ENCODE","recorded":1362560204,"links":27,"instances":["journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics or genomics research institutions","Biological databases"],"headings":["Background","Pilot phase","Production phase","modENCODE project","FactorBook","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/ENCODE_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/EncodeSample.png/220px-EncodeSample.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","journal"]],"members":["nature"],"related":["University_of_California_Santa_Cruz","USA","National_Human_Genome_Research_Institute","Human_genome","Human_Genome_Project","Noncoding_DNA","Gene_regulation","Gene_expression","Gene","Genome-wide_association_studies","Single-nucleotide_polymorphisms","Human_genome","Human_Genome_Project","1000_Genomes_Project","Exome","Regulome","Genes","Chromatin_immunoprecipitation","Quantitative_PCR","Gene_regulation","Chromatin_immunoprecipitation","DNase_I","RNA-seq","DNA_methylation","Coding_region","Exome","Model_organism","National_Institutes_of_Health","Transcription_factor","GENCODE","SIMAP","Functional_genomics","National_Human_Genome_Research_Institute","Wellcome_Trust_Sanger_Institute","Nature_(journal)"]}
