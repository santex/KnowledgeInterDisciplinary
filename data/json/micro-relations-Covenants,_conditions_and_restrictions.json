In real property law, the term real\ncovenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A \"covenant running\nwith the land\", also called a covenant appurtenant, imposes duties or\nrestrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. In contrast, the\ncovenant in gross imposes duties or restrictions on a particular owner. Covenant. (2008). West's Encyclopedia of American Law,\nedition 2. Retrieved August 7, 2009, from http://legal-\ndictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Covenant.\n\nCovenants for title are covenants which come with a deed or title to the\nproperty, in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the\ngrantee.\n\nUnder the common law a covenant was distinguished from an ordinary contract by\nthe presence of a seal. Because the presence of a seal indicated an unusual\nsolemnity in the promises made in a covenant, the common law would enforce a\ncovenant even in the absence of consideration. A covenant is also used to\ndescribe a contract or a legally binding promise. taken from\nhttp://www.confusedaboutlaw.co.uk/wordlist_c.html\n","linknr":342,"url":"Covenants,_conditions_and_restrictions","recorded":1362477392,"links":27,"instances":["law","device","land","property"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Property law"],"headings":["Covenants related to land","Other forms of covenants","See also","Notes and sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["title","property"],["seal","device"],["waste","law"],["subdivision","land"]],"members":["waste","seal","subdivision","title"],"related":["Contract","Real_property","Real_covenant","Covenant_running_with_the_land","Deed","Title_(property)","Common_law","Seal_(device)","Consideration","Inheritance","Statute_of_frauds","Actual_notice","Constructive_notice","Landlord","Leasehold_estate","Easements","Privity_of_estate","Privity_of_estate","Estate_in_land","Waste_(law)","Jim_Crow_laws","Tulk_v_Moxhay","Restrictive_covenants","Deed","Homeowners_association","Condominium_association","Zoning","Plebiscite","Urban_planning","Real_property","White_people","Restrictive_covenants","Real_estate_development","Subdivision_(land)","Title_deed","Forest_Hills_Gardens","New_York","Working_class","Social_segregation","Asian-Americans","Jews","Catholics","Pennsylvania","Black_People","Mongols","Hungarians","Mexican_people","Greeks","Armenians","Austrians","Italians","Russians","Poles","Slavs","Romanians","Chicago","Baltimore","Detroit","Los_Angeles","Urbanisation","World_War_I","Race_riots","US_Supreme_Court","Buchanan_v._Warley","Zoning","Residential_segregation","National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Coloured_People","Racial_segregation","Due_Process","Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Hansberry_v._Lee","Technicality","Legal_precedent","Shelley_v._Kraemer","Title_insurance","Forest_Hills_Gardens","Jackson_Heights","Washington_Park_Subdivision","Palos_Verdes","Caucasian_race","Guilford,_Baltimore","Canada","Westdale,_Ontario","South_Africa","Natal_Province","Apartheid","Zimbabwe","Quiet_possession","Equitable_servitude","Easement","Restrictive_covenant"]}
