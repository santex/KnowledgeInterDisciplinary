The antibody or other molecule binds multiple particles and joins\n# them, creating a large complex. An example occurs when people are given blood\n# transfusions of the wrong blood group. The coalescing of small particles that\n# are suspended in a solution; these larger masses are then (usually)\n# precipitated. An allergic reaction type occurrence where cells become more\n# compacted together to prevent foreign materials entering them. This is usually\n# the result of an antigen in the vicinity of the cells.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Agglutination_(biology)","recorded":1362481290,"links":32,"instances":["mos"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunologic tests","Hematology"],"headings":["Agglutination in hematology","Agglutination in microbiology","History of discoveries","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Bedside_card.jpg/300px-Bedside_card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mannan_oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements","mos"]],"members":["mannan_oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements"],"related":["Latin_language","Red_blood_cell","Hemagglutinin","Cross-matching","Blood_donor","Blood_type","Leukoagglutination","White_blood_cell","Phytohaemagglutinin","Max_von_Gruber","Typhoid_fever","Widal_test","Karl_Landsteiner","Blood_transfusion","Serology","Macrophage","Immune_System","Blocking_antibody","Mannan_Oligosaccharide_based_nutritional_supplements_(MOS)"]}
