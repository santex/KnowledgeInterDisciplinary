Anaerobic acrylic sealants generally referred to as\n impregnants are the most desirable as they are required to cure in the absence\n of air, unlike surface sealants that require air as part of the cure mechanism\n that changes state to become solid, once applied, and is used to prevent the\n penetration of air, gas, noise, dust, fire, smoke or liquid from one location\n through a barrier into another. Typically, sealants are used to close small\n openings that are difficult to shut with other materials, such as concrete,\n drywall, etc. Desirable properties of sealants include insolubility, corrosion\n resistance, and adhesion. Uses of sealants vary widely and sealants are used in\n many industries, for example, construction, automotive and aerospace\n industries.\n\nThe main difference between adhesives and sealants is that sealants typically\nhave lower strength and higher elongation than do adhesives. Since the main\nobjective of a sealant is to seal assemblies and joints, sealants need to have\nsufficient adhesion to the substrates and resistance to environmental conditions\nto remain bonded over the required life of the assembly. When sealants are used\nbetween substrates having different thermal coefficients of expansion or\ndiffering elongation under stress, they need to have adequate flexibility and\nelongation. Sealants generally contain inert filler material and are usually\nformulated with an elastomer to give the required flexibility and elongation.\nThey usually have a paste consistency to allow filling of gaps between\nsubstrates. Low shrinkage after application is often required. Many adhesive\ntechnologies can be formulated into sealants.\n\nSealants fall between higher-strength adhesives at one end and extremely low-\nstrength putties and caulks at the other. Putties and caulks serve only one\nfunction â i.e., to take up space and fill voids. Sealants, on the other hand,\ndespite not having great strength, do convey a number of properties. They seal\nthe substrate at the glue line; they are particularly effective in keeping\nmoisture in or out of the components in which they are used. They provide\nthermal and acoustical insulation and may serve as fire barriers; sometimes\nthey contain electrical properties. They may also be used for smoothing or\nfilleting. In short, sealants are often called upon to perform several of these\nfunctions at once.\n\nNo matter what the application, a corking sealant has three basic functions.\n\n#It fills a gap between two or more substrates. #It forms a barrier through the\nphysical properties of the sealant itself and by adhesion to the substrate. #It\nmaintains sealing properties for the expected lifetime, service conditions and\nenvironments.\n\nThe sealant performs these functions by way of correct formulation to achieve\nspecific application and performance properties. Unlike adhesives, however,\nthere are not many functional alternatives to the sealing process. Soldering or\nwelding can perhaps be used as a sealant in certain instances, depending on the\nsubstrates and the relative movement that the substrates will see in service.\nHowever, the simplicity and reliability offered by organic elastomers usually\nmake them the clear choice for performing these functions.\n\nSilicone is an example of a sealant.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Sealant","recorded":1374861392,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sealand_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit","/wiki/File:Self_level_silicone.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Self_level_silicone.jpg/220px-Self_level_silicone.jpg","/wiki/File:Self_level_silicone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Silicone","/wiki/Firestop","/wiki/System","/wiki/Pipe_(material)","/wiki/Fire-resistance_rating","/wiki/Concrete","/wiki/Air","/wiki/Gas","/wiki/Noise","/wiki/Dust","/wiki/Fire","/wiki/Smoke","/wiki/Concrete","/wiki/Drywall","/wiki/Corrosion","/wiki/Adhesion","/wiki/Construction","/wiki/Adhesive","/wiki/Elastomer","/wiki/Soldering","/wiki/Welding","/wiki/Silicone","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Acrylic_resin","/wiki/Sealcoat","/wiki/Dental_sealant","/wiki/Fibrin_glue","/wiki/Firestop","/wiki/Waterproofing","/wiki/Paint_sealant","/wiki/Polysulfide","/wiki/Polyurethane","/wiki/Seam_sealant","/wiki/Silicone_rubber","/wiki/WKT_(sealant)","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Caulking","/wiki/Coating","/wiki/Stone_sealer","/wiki/Varnish","/wiki/Waterproofing","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit&section=3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sealant&oldid=562154481","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Seals_(mechanical)","/wiki/Category:Materials","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_with_a_reason_field_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_March_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sealant&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sealant","/wiki/Sealant","/wiki/Talk:Sealant","#","/wiki/Sealant","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Sealant","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Sealant","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&oldid=562154481","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1427914","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Sealant&id=562154481","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Sealant","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Sealant&oldid=562154481&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Sealant&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichtstoff","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellador","//fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B2%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA","//sv.wiki
