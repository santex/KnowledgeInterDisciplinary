{"cursor":"12978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n was a legendary carpet that could allegedly be used to transport persons who\n were on it instantaneously or swiftly to their destination.]] 'Folklore' (or\n 'lore') consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular\n beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions\n of a culture, subculture, or group. It is also the set of practices through\n which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes\n called folkloristics, and people who study folklore are sometimes referred to\n as \"folklorists\". The word \"folklore\" was first used by the English antiquarian\n William Thoms in a letter published in the London journal [[Athenaeum\n (magazine)|The Athenaeum]] in 1846. Georges, Robert A., Michael Owens\n Jones, \"Folkloristics: An Introduction,\" Indiana University Press, 1995.\n In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. Stith Thompson\n made a major attempt to index the motifs of both folklore and mythology,\n providing an outline into which new motifs can be placed, and scholars can keep\n track of all older motifs.\n\nFolklore can be divided into four areas of study: artifact (such as voodoo\ndolls), describable and transmissible entity (oral tradition), culture, and\nbehavior (rituals). These areas do not stand alone, however, as often a\nparticular item or element may fit into more than one of these\nareas.
