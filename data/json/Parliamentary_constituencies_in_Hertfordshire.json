{"cursor":"27864","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in relation to England]]\n\nThe county of Hertfordshire in England is divided into eleven Parliamentary\nconstituencies. Each of the eleven elects a Member of Parliament (MP) to\nrepresent it at the United Kingdom (UK) Parliament in Westminster. As of the\n2010 general election, all of Hertfordshire's eleven MPs are Conservatives.\nThe county currently has two urban borough constituencies (BC) â Broxbourne\nand Watford â while the other nine are classed as more rural county\nconstituencies (CC).\n\nHertfordshire has been represented in Parliament since 1290. The number of MPs\nand the geographic areas they have represented have changed considerably, with\nsome of the bigger changes occurring in 1832, 1885, 1974, 1983 and 1997. Since\nthe last constituency elections in 2005, some boundaries have been altered\nslightly. The present ones are based upon recommendations made by the Boundary\nCommission for England, and came into legal effect with the passing of the\nParliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007.\n","linknr":429,"url":"Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire","recorded":1375081192,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:EnglandHertfordshire.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/EnglandHertfordshire.svg/220px-EnglandHertfordshire.svg.png","/wiki/File:EnglandHertfordshire.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/Metropolitan_and_non-metropolitan_counties_of_England","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_constituencies","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Westminster_Palace","/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election","/wiki/Hertfordshire","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Borough_constituencies","/wiki/Broxbourne_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Watford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/County_constituencies","/wiki/Boundary_Commission_for_England","#Parliamentary_history_of_Hertfordshire","#Timeline","#Constituencies_represented_by_multiple_MPs","#2010_constituencies","#Results","#Changes_for_the_2010_general_election","#See_also","#Footnotes","#References","/w/index.php?title=Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/History_of_Hertfordshire","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:Arthur_James_Balfour00.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Arthur_James_Balfour00.jpg/220px-Arthur_James_Balfour00.jpg","/wiki/File:Arthur_James_Balfour00.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Arthur_Balfour","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","#cite_note-demon-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Knights_of_the_Shire","/wiki/St_Albans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hertford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-demon-1","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/Redistribution_of_Seats_Act_1885","/wiki/Watford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hitchin_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-4","/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom#First_wave","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Universal_suffrage","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918","/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1928","#cite_note-8","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1955","/wiki/East_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974","/wiki/Boundary_Commission_for_England","#cite_note-2010change-9","/w/index.php?title=Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_former_United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_constituencies","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","/wiki/Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-demon-1","/wiki/Hertford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-demon-1","#cite_note-map1885-10","/wiki/St_Albans_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-albans-11","#cite_note-demon-1","#cite_note-map1885-10","/wiki/Watford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-map1885-10","/wiki/Hitchin_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-map1885-10","/wiki/Hemel_Hempstead_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-12","/wiki/South_West_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","/wiki/East_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Hertford_and_Stevenage_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/South_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Welwyn_Hatfield_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/North_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/West_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Broxbourne_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hertford_and_Stortford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hertsmere_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Hitchin_and_Harpenden_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Stevenage_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/North_East_Hertfordshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Hertfordshire&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:2nd_V_Me
