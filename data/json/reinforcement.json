Reinforcement is an important\npart of operant or instrumental conditioning. A reinforcer is the stimulus that\nstrengthens the behavior, in contrast to punishment that weakens the behavior.\nThe effect of reinforcement may be measured as an increase in the frequency of\nits expression (e.g., pulling a lever more frequently), duration (e.g., pulling\na lever for longer periods of time), magnitude (e.g., pulling a lever with\ngreater force), or decrease in latency (e.g., pulling a lever more quickly\nfollowing the onset of an environmental event).\n\nAlthough in many cases a reinforcing stimulus is a rewarding stimulus which is\n\"valued\" or \"liked\" by the individual (e.g., money received from a slot machine,\nthe taste of the treat, the euphoria produced by an addictive drug), this is not\na requirement. Indeed, reinforcement does not even require an individual to\nconsciously perceive an effect elicited by the stimulus.<ref>Winkielman P.,\nBerridge KC, and Wilbarger JL. (2005). Unconscious affective reactions to masked\nhappy verses angry faces influence consumption behavior and judgement value.\nPers Soc Psychol Bull: 31, 121–35.</ref> Furthermore, stimuli that are\n\"rewarding\" or \"liked\" are not always reinforcing: if an individual eats at\nMcDonald's (response) and likes the taste of the food (stimulus), but believes\nit is bad for their health, they may not eat it again and thus it was not\nreinforcing in that condition. Thus, reinforcement can only be assumed if there\nis a causal link (positive or negative) between the stimulus and the enhancement\nof behavior.\n\nIn most cases reinforcement refers to an enhancement of behavior but this term\nmay also refer to an enhancement of memory. One example of this effect is called\npost-training reinforcement where a stimulus (e.g. food) given shortly after a\ntraining session enhances the learning.<ref>Mondadori C, Waser PG, and Huston\nJP. (2005). Time-dependent effects of post-trial reinforcement, punishment or\nECS on passive avoidance learning. Physiol Behav: 18, 1103–9. PMID 928533</ref>\nThis stimulus can also be an emotional one. A good example is that many people\ncan explain in detail where they were when they found out the World Trade Center\nwas attacked.<ref>White NM. (2011). Reward: What is it?
