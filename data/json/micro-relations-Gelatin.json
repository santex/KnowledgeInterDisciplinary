It is commonly used as a gelling agent\nin food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances\ncontaining gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous.\nGelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a\nfoodstuff. It is found in most gummy candies as well as other products such as\nmarshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some ice cream, dip and yogurt. Household\ngelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be\nadded to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.\n\nGelatin is classed as a food in its own right and not subject to the food\nadditives legislation in Europe. Gelatin has its own E number: 441.
