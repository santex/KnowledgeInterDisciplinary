Males\nare usually larger than females and have longer tails. Males play no part in\nrearing the young. Pheasants typically eat seeds and some insects.\n\nThe best-known is the Common Pheasant, which is widespread throughout the\nworld in introduced feral populations and in farm operations. Various other\npheasant species are popular in aviaries, such as the Golden Pheasant\n(Chrysolophus pictus).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pheasant","recorded":1372152271,"links":[],"instances":["anatomy","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phasianidae"],"headings":["Species in taxonomic order","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["subfamily","biology"],["family","biology"],["order","biology"],["wattle","anatomy"]],"members":["wattle","order","subfamily","family"],"related":["Common_Pheasant","Animal","Chordate","Bird","Galliformes","Phasianidae","Thomas_Horsfield","Phasianinae","Thomas_Horsfield","Subfamily_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Phasianidae","Order_(biology)","Galliformes","Sexual_dimorphism","Colour","Wattle_(anatomy)","Tail","Common_Pheasant","Golden_Pheasant","Blood_Pheasant","Koklass_Pheasant","Kalij_Pheasant","Silver_Pheasant","Imperial_Pheasant","Edward's_Pheasant","Vietnamese_Pheasant","Swinhoe's_Pheasant","Hoogerwerf's_Pheasant","Salvadori's_Pheasant","Crestless_Fireback","Crested_Fireback","Siamese_Fireback","Bulwer's_Pheasant","White-eared_Pheasant","Tibetan_Eared_Pheasant","Brown_Eared_Pheasant","Blue_Eared_Pheasant","Cheer_Pheasant","Reeve's_Pheasant","Elliot's_Pheasant","Mrs._Hume's_Pheasant","Mikado_Pheasant","Copper_Pheasant","Green_Pheasant","Common_Pheasant","Golden_Pheasant","Lady_Amherst's_Pheasant","Bronze-tailed_Peacock-Pheasant","Mountain_Peacock-Pheasant","Germain's_Peacock-Pheasant","Grey_Peacock-Pheasant","Hainan_Peacock-Pheasant","Malayan_Peacock-Pheasant","Bornean_Peacock-Pheasant","Palawan_Peacock-Pheasant","Crested_Argus","Great_Argus","Double-banded_Argus","Allan_Octavian_Hume","Charles_Henry_Tilson_Marshall","Frank_Finn","Vieilott's_Crested_Fireback","Black-backed_Kalij","White-crested_Kalij","Nepal_Kalij","Black-breasted_Kalij","Lineated_Kalij","Anderson's_Silver_Pheasant","Crawfurd's_Silver_Pheasant","Crawfurd's_Kalij","Cuvier's_Kalij","Oates's_Kalij","Whitehead's_Silver_Pheasant","Swinhoe's_Kalij","William_Beebe","New_York_Zoological_Society","Harry_N._Abrams,_Inc."]}
