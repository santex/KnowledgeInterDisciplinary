The\nscope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation\nand modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as,\nand to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes\nprocedural elements.\n\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational\nmodel, as described in his influential 1970 paper \"A Relational Model of Data\nfor Large Shared Data Banks\". Despite\nnot adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most\nwidely used database language.\n\nSQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in\n1986, and of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been enhanced several times\nwith added features. But code is not completely portable among different\ndatabase systems, which can lead to vendor lock-in. The different makers do not\nperfectly follow the standard, they add extensions, and the standard is\nsometimes ambiguous.\n","linknr":1224,"url":"SQL","recorded":1362505111,"links":96,"instances":["computing","sql","database","data_language_specification","software","database","sql","computing","database","sql","sql","sql","file_format","programming_language","sql","java","sql","sql","sql","sql","sql","sql","programming_language","sql","mathematics","sql","programming_language","programming_language","sql","programming_language","sql","database","database_server","sql"],"pdf":["http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/chamberlin/sequel-1974.pdf","http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/chamberlin/sequel-1974.pdf","http://lbd.udc.es/jornadas2011/actas/PROLE/PROLE/S5/13_article.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
