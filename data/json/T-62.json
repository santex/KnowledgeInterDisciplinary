Its\n115 mm gun was the first smoothbore tank gun in use.\n\nThe T-62 was produced between 1961 and 1975. It became a standard tank in the\nSoviet arsenal, partly replacing the T-55, although that tank continued to be\nmanufactured in the Soviet Union and elsewhere after T-62 production was halted.\nThe T-62 was later replaced in front-line service by the T-72.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"T-62","recorded":1371249388,"links":[],"instances":["tank_gun","fighting_vehicle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Main battle tanks of Iran","Main battle tanks of Iraq","Cold War tanks of the Soviet Union","Main battle tanks of Russia","Main battle tanks of the Soviet Union","Main battle tanks of the Cold War"],"headings":["Development history","Design","Production history","Service history","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["d-54","tank_gun"],["technical","fighting_vehicle"],["peshmerga#the_second_kurdish-iraqi_war","1974-1975"],["war_in_abkhazia","1992–1993"],["war_in_afghanistan","2001–present"]],"members":["war_in_afghanistan","war_in_abkhazia","technical"],"related":["Museum_of_the_Great_Patriotic_War_in_Kiev","Main_battle_tank","Uralvagonzavod","USSR","Czechoslovakia","North_Korea","Torsion_bar","U-5TS","PKT","Coaxial","DShK","Soviet_Union","Main_battle_tank","T-54/55","Smoothbore","T-72","Centurion_tank","M48_Patton","Armor-piercing_shot_and_shell","High_explosive_anti-tank_warhead","Smoothbore","Kinetic_energy_penetrator","Nizhny_Tagil","D-54_(tank_gun)","Artiemejev","Bore_evacuator","M60_Patton","Leopard_1","Military_intelligence","U-5TS","Kinetic_energy_penetrator","Leopard_1","Torsion_bar_suspension","Tank_desant","Blunt_force_injuries","Warsaw_Pact","T-64","Infantry_Combat_Vehicle","Malyshev_Factory","Kharkiv","Ch'ŏnma-ho","NATO_reporting_name","DShK","Glacis","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","Explosive_reactive_armour","ATGM","Armored_recovery_vehicle","T-54","DShK","Vitosha_2012_fire","GIAT","AMX_40","Tiran-6","Reactive_armour","DShK","125mm_2A46","Opposing_force","T-55","Sino–Soviet_border_conflict","People's_Liberation_Army","RPG-2","Type_69","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","T-80","T-72","T-64","T-90","Chechnya","Kabul","Bulgaria","Yom_Kippur_war","M60_Patton","Centurion_tank","Libya","Libyan-Chadian_War","Technical_(fighting_vehicle)","Toyota","Tank_destroyer","MILAN","Recoilless_rifle","MPLA","UNITA","Angolan_Civil_War","Battle_of_Cuito_Cuanavale","Ethiopian_Army","Free_Syrian_Army","Soviet_War_in_Afghanistan","Khuzestan","Iran-Iraq_War","Lebanese_Forces","Lebanese_Forces","Yemeni_Socialist_Party","Sino-Soviet_split","Sino-Soviet_border_conflict","Western_Sahara_War","Yom_Kippur_war","Ethiopian_Civil_War","Angolan_Civil_War","Chadian-Libyan_conflict","Toyota_War","Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan","Iran–Iraq_War","Lebanese_Civil_War","Georgian_Civil_War","1991–1992_South_Ossetia_War","War_in_Abkhazia_(1992–1993)","Gulf_War","Civil_war_in_Tajikistan","First_Chechen_War","Second_Chechen_War","War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–present)","Iraq_War","2003_invasion_of_Iraq","2008_South_Ossetia_War","Libyan_civil_war","Syrian_civil_war","List_of_tanks","List_of_Soviet_tanks","Leopard_1","M60_Patton"]}
