{"cursor":"11363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Taxidermy' (from the Greek for arrangement of skin ) is the art of\npreparing, stuffing, and mounting the skins of animals (especially vertebrates)\nfor display (e.g. as hunting trophies) or for other sources of study. Taxidermy\ncan be done on all vertebrate species of animals, including mammals, birds,\nfish, reptiles, and amphibians.\n\nA person who practices taxidermy is called a 'taxidermist'. Taxidermists may\npractice professionally for museums or as businesses catering to hunters and\nfishermen, or as amateurs, such as hobbyists, hunters, and fishermen. To\npractice taxidermy, one should be very familiar with anatomy, sculpture, and\npainting, as well as tanning.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Taxidermy","recorded":1362480654,"links":49,"instances":["taxidermist","fish","mythology"],"pdf":["http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/ref_files/1193254263.pdf"],"categories":["Arts and crafts","Death customs","Taxidermy|","Animal death"],"headings":["History","Methods","Rogue taxidermy","Anthropomorphic taxidermy","In literature","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Wilmer_W._Tanner_with_museum-cleaned.jpg/350px-Wilmer_W._Tanner_with_museum-cleaned.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/The_Bear_061_Cropped.jpg/220px-The_Bear_061_Cropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Striated_Thornbill_stuffed.jpg/220px-Striated_Thornbill_stuffed.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Dentex_angolensis.JPG/242px-Dentex_angolensis.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Albertus_Seba_-_Hydra.jpg/220px-Albertus_Seba_-_Hydra.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Scagryn0013.jpg/220px-Scagryn0013.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/Potter%27sRabbitSchool.jpg/220px-Potter%27sRabbitSchool.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bass","fish"],["chimera","mythology"],["edward_hart","taxidermist"]],"members":["edward_hart","bass","chimera"],"related":["Greek_language","Animal","Trophy_hunting","Mammal","Bird","Fish","Reptile","Amphibian","Museum","Hobbyist","Hunter","Fishermen","Anatomy","Sculpture","Painting","Tanning","Victorian_era","Tanning","Louis_Dufresne","Mus√©um_national_d'Histoire_naturelle","Carl_Akeley","Polyurethane","Eye","Freeze_dry","Dermestidae","Trout","Bass_(fish)","Catch_and_release","Carl_Linnaeus","Copenhagen","Jackalope","Skvader","Extinct","Dragon","Chimera_(mythology)","Griffin","Unicorn","Fiji_mermaid","Sideshow","Dime_museum","Platypus","Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","George_Shaw","Minneapolis","Stuttgart","Germany","Great_Exhibition","Walter_Potter","Edward_Hart_(taxidermist)","R_K_Narayan","The_Man-Eater_of_Malgudi","Taxidermist","Malgudi"]}
