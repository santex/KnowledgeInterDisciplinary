{"cursor":"5051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'exosphere' ( \"outside, external, beyond\", \"sphere\") is a thin, atmosphere-\nlike volume surrounding a planetary body where molecules are gravitationally\nbound to that body, but where the density is too low for them to behave as a gas\nby colliding with each other. In the case of bodies with substantial\natmospheres, such as the Earth's atmosphere, the exosphere is the uppermost\nlayer, where the atmosphere thins out and merges with interplanetary space. It\nis located directly above the Thermosphere.\n\nSeveral moons, such as Earth's moon and the Galilean satellites, have exospheres\nwithout a denser atmosphere underneath. Here molecules are ejected from surface\nrocks and follow independent parabolic trajectories until they collide with the\nsurface. Authors differ as to whether such moons are considered to have\natmospheres or not. Smaller bodies such as asteroids, in which the molecules\nemitted from the surface escape to space, are not considered to have exospheres.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Exosphere","recorded":1362371877,"links":61,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Atmosphere","Atmosphere of Earth"],"headings":["Earth's exosphere","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/EarthAtmosphereBig.jpg/80px-EarthAtmosphereBig.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/b/2db95e8e1a9267b7a1188556b2013b33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/9/d4998b25b2b713f6b2c275c56fbe53ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/e/e1e1d3d40573127e9ee0480caf1283d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/a/7ea1387c97171c2b0b3306ec1dc6d58e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/3/ee3e9042432e57b155ba3fc5eb6df1fe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/9/6/4960e1096d3a7f65a513dbe8e37ddf2a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/9/cd9fc2d73ab070dbc91d6f63f6c34b6f.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Molecule","Particle_collision","Atmosphere_of_Earth","Thermosphere","Parabolic_trajectory","Hydrogen","Helium","Carbon_dioxide","Atomic_oxygen","Outer_space","Barometric_formula","Free_molecular_flow","Mean_free_path","Scale_height","Ideal_gas","Gas_constant","Knudsen_number","Orbit","Gravity","Earth","Radiation_pressure","Hydrogen","Geocorona","Interplanetary"]}
