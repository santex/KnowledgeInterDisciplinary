      "text" : "\n\n\nThe 'electromagnetic force' is one of the four fundamental interactions in\nnature, the other three being the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and\ngravitation. This force is described by electromagnetic fields, and has\ninnumerable physical instances including the interaction of electrically charged\nparticles and the interaction of uncharged magnetic force fields with electrical\nconductors.\n\nThe word electromagnetism is a compound form of two Greek terms, ἢλεκτρον,\nēlektron, \"amber\", and μαγνήτης, magnētēs, \"magnet\". The science of\nelectromagnetic phenomena is defined in terms of the electromagnetic force,\nsometimes called the Lorentz force, which includes both electricity and\nmagnetism as elements of one phenomenon.\n\nThe electromagnetic force is the interaction responsible for almost all the\nphenomena encountered in daily life, with the exception of gravity. Ordinary\nmatter takes its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual\nmolecules in matter. Electrons are bound by electromagnetic wave mechanics into\norbitals around atomic nuclei to form atoms, which are the building blocks of\nmolecules. This governs the processes involved in chemistry, which arise from\ninteractions between the electrons of neighboring atoms, which are in turn\ndetermined by the interaction between electromagnetic force and the momentum of\nthe electrons.\n\nThere are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field. In\nclassical electrodynamics, electric fields are described as electric potential\nand electric current in Ohm's law, magnetic fields are associated with\nelectromagnetic induction and magnetism, and Maxwell's equations describe how\nelectric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by\ncharges and currents.\n\nThe theoretical implications of electromagnetism, in particular the\nestablishment of the speed of light based on properties of the \"medium\" of\npropagation (permeability and permittivity), led to the development of special\nrelativity by Albert Einstein in 1905.\n",
