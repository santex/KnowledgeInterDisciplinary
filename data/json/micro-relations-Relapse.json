{"cursor":"28528","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'relapse' or 'recidivism' is a recurrence of a past (typically medical)\ncondition. For example, MS or malaria often exhibit peaks of activity and\nsometimes long periods of dormancy.\n\n'Relapse', in relation to drug misuse, is resuming the use of a drug or a\nchemical substance after one or more periods of abstinence. The term is a\nlandmark feature of both substance dependence and substance abuse, which are\nlearned behaviors, and is maintained by neuronal adaptations that mediate\nlearning and processing of various motivational stimuli. An important aspect of drug use is the\npropensity for repeated use and dependence, tendencies that are influenced by\nthe nature of the drug itself and thus vary from substance to substance. Those\nsubstances that are cleared from the body most quickly, those with the highest\npharmacological efficacy, and those that induce the highest tolerance elicit the\nmost severe tendencies in users. Drug dependence can lead to increased tolerance\nto the substance in question, cravings, and withdrawal if the drug use\nceases.\n","linknr":533,"url":"Relapse","recorded":1362553919,"links":39,"instances":["psychological","mood","psychology","medicine","chemistry","journal","psychology","us","biochemistry","psychology","biology","withdrawal","medicine","medicine","us"],"pdf":["http://www.bhrm.org/guidelines/CBT-Kadden.pdf","http://www.bhrm.org/guidelines/CBT-Kadden.pdf"],"categories":["Behavioral
