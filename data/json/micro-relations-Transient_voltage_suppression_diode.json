It is a clamping device,\n suppressing all overvoltages above its breakdown voltage. Like all clamping\n devices, it automatically resets when the overvoltage goes away, but\n absorbs much more of the transient energy internally than a similarly rated\n crowbar device.\n\nA transient-voltage-suppression diode may be either unidirectional or\nbidirectional. A unidirectional device operates as a rectifier in the forward\ndirection like any other avalanche diode, but is made and tested to handle very\nlarge peak currents. The popular 1.5KE series allows 1500 W of peak power, for a\nshort time.\n\nA bidirectional transient-voltage-suppression diode can be represented by two\nmutually opposing avalanche diodes in series with one another and connected in\nparallel with the circuit to be protected. While this representation is\nschematically accurate, physically the devices are now manufactured as a single\ncomponent.\n\nA transient-voltage-suppression diode can respond to over-voltages faster than\nother common over-voltage protection components such as varistors or gas\ndischarge tubes. The actual clamping occurs in roughly one picosecond, but in a\npractical circuit the inductance of the wires leading to the device imposes a\nhigher limit. This makes transient-voltage-suppression diodes useful for\nprotection against very fast and often damaging voltage transients. These fast\nover-voltage transients are present on all distribution networks and can be\ncaused by either internal or external events, such as lightning or motor arcing.\n\nTransient-voltage suppressors will fail if they are subjected to voltages or\nconditions beyond those that the particular product was designed to accommodate.\nThere are three key modes in which the TVS will fail: short, open, and degraded\ndevice.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Transient_voltage_suppression_diode","recorded":1362903053,"links":30,"instances":["circuit","circuit"],"pdf":["http://powerelectronics.com/mag/601PET24.pdf","http://powerelectronics.com/mag/601PET24.pdf","http://www.vishay.com/docs/88440/failurem.pdf","http://www.vishay.com/docs/88440/failurem.pdf","http://www.littelfuse.com/data/en/Application_Notes/an9768.pdf","http://www.littelfuse.com/data/en/Application_Training/TVS_Diode_Applications_Training.pdf","http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/APPLICATION_NOTE/CD00004007.pdf","http://www.st.com/internet/com/TECHNICAL_RESOURCES/TECHNICAL_LITERATURE/APPLICATION_NOTE/CD00005042.pdf"],"categories":["Diodes"],"headings":["Characterization","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Transient_voltage_suppression_diode_symbol.svg/110px-Transient_voltage_suppression_diode_symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Transils-01.jpeg/220px-Transils-01.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clamp","circuit"],["crowbar","circuit"]],"members":["crowbar","clamp"],"related":["Electronic_component","Electronics","Voltage_spike","Avalanche_breakdown","Clamp_(circuit)","Crowbar_(circuit)","Rectifier","Avalanche_diode","Avalanche_diode","Varistor","Gas_discharge_tube","Picosecond","Inductance","Ampere","Capacitor","Heat_sink","Transient_voltage_suppressor","Trisil","Varistor"]}
