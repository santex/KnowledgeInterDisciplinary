{"cursor":"28468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'loanword' (or 'loan word') is a word borrowed from a donor language and\nincorporated into a recipient language. By contrast, a calque or loan\ntranslation is a related concept where the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] or\n[[idiom]] is borrowed rather than the lexical item itself. The word loanword is\nitself a calque of the German\nLehnwort, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=loan Online Etymology\nDictionary] while calque is a loanword from French. The terms borrow and\nloanword, although traditional, conflict with the ordinary meaning of those\nwords because nothing is returned to the donor languages. \"Linguistic\n'borrowing' is really nothing but imitation.\" Shakespeare however anticipates\nthis situation in Hamlet, Act I, scene 3: Neither a borrower nor a lender be\n...\" However, note that this metaphor is not isolated to the concept\nofloanwords, but also found in the idiom \"to borrow an idea.\" An additional\nissue with the termloanwordis that it implies that the loaning is limited to one\nsingle word as opposed to phrases such asdÃ©jÃ  vu,an English loanword from\nFrench. While this phrase may be used as one lexical item by English speakers,\nthat is to say, an English speaker would not say onlydÃ©jÃ to convey the meaning\nassociated with the full termdÃ©jÃ  vu, in the donor language (French), speakers\nwould be aware of the phrase consisting of two words. For\nsimplicity,adopt/adoptionoradapt/adaptionare used by many linguists, either in\nparallel to, or in preference to, these words. Some researchers also use the\ntermlexical borrowing.
