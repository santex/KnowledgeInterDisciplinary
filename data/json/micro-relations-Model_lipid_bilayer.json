{"cursor":"27985","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'model lipid bilayer' is any bilayer assembled in vitro, as opposed to the\nbilayer of natural cell membranes or covering various sub-cellular structures\nlike the nucleus. A model bilayer can be made with either synthetic or natural\nlipids. The simplest model systems contain only a single pure synthetic lipid.\nMore physiologically relevant model bilayers can be made with mixtures of\nseveral synthetic or natural lipids.\n\nThere are many different types of model bilayers, each having experimental\nadvantages and disadvantages. The first system developed was the black lipid\nmembrane or âpaintedâ bilayer, which allows simple electrical characterization\nof bilayers but is short-lived and can be difficult to work with. Supported\nbilayers are anchored to a solid substrate, increasing stability and allowing\nthe use of characterization tools not possible in bulk solution. These\nadvantages come at the cost of unwanted substrate interactions which can\ndenature membrane proteins.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Model_lipid_bilayer","recorded":1362509958,"links":16,"instances":["wave_propagation","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Membrane biology"],"headings":["Black lipid membranes (BLM)","Supported lipid bilayers (SLB)","Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (t-BLM)","Vesicles","Micelles, bicelles and nanodiscs","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Black_lipid_membrane.svg/350px-Black_lipid_membrane.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Supported_bilayer.svg/290px-Supported_bilayer.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Mixed_lipid_corral.jpg/300px-Mixed_lipid_corral.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/T-BLM.png/500px-T-BLM.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Lipid_vesicles.svg/240px-Lipid_vesicles.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interference","wave_propagation"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["interference","denaturation"],"related":["In_vitro","Cell_membrane","Cell_nucleus","Lipid_bilayer_characterization","Membrane_proteins","Teflon","Organic_solvent","Partition_coefficient","Decane","Squalene","Biophysical_Journal","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Voltage-gated_ion_channel","Ion_channels","Detergent","Chloroform","Long-term_experiment","Atomic_force_microscopy","Lipid_bilayer_phase_behavior","Lipid_bilayer_mechanics","Quartz_crystal_microbalance","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Evanescent_wave","Total_internal_reflection_fluorescence_microscopy","Surface_plasmon_resonance","Near_field_scanning_optical_microscopy","Microfluidics","Synapse","Zwitterion","Silica","Fluorescence_recovery_after_photobleaching","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Hydrogel","Self_assembled_monolayer","X-ray_diffraction","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Förster_resonance_energy_transfer","Lipid_bilayer_fusion","Lipid_rafts","Detergent","Micelles","Membrane_proteins","Amphipathic","Bicelles","NMR","Nanodisc","Nanometer"]}
