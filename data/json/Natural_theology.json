{"cursor":"17755","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Natural theology' is a branch of theology based on reason and ordinary\nexperience. Thus it is distinguished from [[revealed theology]] (or revealed\nreligion) which is based on scripture and religious experiences of various\nkinds; and also from [[transcendental theology]], theology from [[A priori and a\nposteriori|a priori]] reasoning.\n\nMarcus Terentius Varro (116â27 BC) in his (lost) Antiquitates rerum humanarum\net divinarum established a distinction of three kinds of theology: civil\n(political) (theologia civilis), natural (physical) (theologia naturalis) and\nmythical (theologia mythica). The theologians of civil theology are \"the\npeople\", asking how the gods relate to daily life and the state (imperial\ncult). The theologians of natural theology are the philosophers, asking for the\nnature of the gods, and the theologians of mythical theology are the poets,\ncrafting mythology. The terminology entered Stoic tradition and is used by\nAugustine of Hippo.\n\nNatural theology, thus, is that part of the philosophy of religion dealing with\ndescribing the nature of the gods, or, in monotheism, arguing for or against\nattributes or non-attributes of God, and especially the existence of God, purely\nphilosophically, that is, without recourse to any special or supposedly\nsupernatural revelation. 'Physico-theology' is the term for a theology based on\nthe constitution of the natural world, especially derived from perceived\nelements of \"design\", which gave rise to the argument from design for the\nexistence of God, beginning with the \"fifth way\" [http://www.thatreligious-\nstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/God/five_ways2.php Thomas\nAquinas' Five Ways (Part 2): Contingency, Goodness, Design] of the [[Summa\nTheologica]] by Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274).\n","linknr":590,"url":"Natural_theology","recorded":1362483128,"links":34,"instances":["entomologist","chemist","dialogue","clergyman","ancient_rome","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theology","Religion and science","Philosophy of religion"],"headings":["Key proponents","The Bridgewater Treatises","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["imperial_cult","ancient_rome"],["timaeus","dialogue"],["john_kidd","chemist"],["william_kirby","entomologist"],["thomas_hill","clergyman"],["morphology","biology"],["john_kidd","chemist"],["william_kirby","entomologist"]],"members":["william_kirby","john_kidd","timaeus","thomas_hill","imperial_cult","morphology"],"related":["Theology","Reason","Experience","Scripture","Religious_experiences","Marcus_Terentius_Varro","Political_theology","Mythical_theology","Imperial_cult_(Ancient_Rome)","Philosophy","Poet","Mythology","Stoicism","Augustine_of_Hippo","Philosophy_of_religion","Gods","Monotheism","Attributes_of_God","Negative_theology","Existence_of_God","Revelation","Argument_from_design","Thomas_Aquinas","Zarathushtra","Gathas","Plato","Timaeus_(dialogue)","Aristotle","Unmoved_mover","Scholastics","Mu'tazili","Islam","Islamic_theology","Scholasticism","Teleological_argument","Early_Islamic_philosophy","Al-Kindi","Averroes","Averroism","Avicenna","Avicennism","Islamic_philosophy","Cosmological_argument","Ontological_argument","Thomas_Aquinas","Summa_Theologica","Summa_Contra_Gentiles","Cosmological_argument","Teleological_argument","Ontological_argument","Thomas_Barlow,_Bishop_of_Lincoln","Charles_II_of_England","John_Ray","English_people","Natural_history","Plants","Animal","William_Derham","Thomas_Malthus","Revelation","William_Paley","Teleological_argument","Watchmaker_analogy","David_Hume","Thomas_Paine","Deism","The_Age_of_Reason","Abolitionist","Horace_Mann","Political_economy","Moral_philosophy","Edward_Hitchcock","Gifford_Lectures","Adam_Gifford","Theology","Science","Miraculous","Teleological_arguments","William_Paley","Transmutation_of_species","William_Paley","Francis_Henry_Egerton,_8th_Earl_of_Bridgewater","Thomas_Chalmers","John_Kidd_(chemist)","William_Whewell","Charles_Bell","Peter_Mark_Roget","William_Buckland","William_Kirby_(entomologist)","William_Prout","Charles_Babbage","Charles_Babbage","Thomas_Hill_(clergyman)","Edgar_Allan_Poe","Edgar_Allan_Poe","Robert_Knox","Morphology_(biology)","Idealism","Deism","Epicureanism","Existence_of_God","Teleological_argument","Intelligent_design","Natural_history","Natural_magic","Theistic_evolution","Robert_T._Pennock","Michael_Ruse","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Catholic_Encyclopedia","David_Hume","Thomas_Chalmers","John_Kidd_(chemist)","William_Whewell","Charles_Bell","Peter_Mark_Roget","William_Buckland","William_Kirby_(entomologist)","William_Prout"]}
