{"cursor":"8827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Refugee [[roulette]]' refers to arbitrariness in the process of refugee status\ndeterminations or, as it is called in the United States, asylum adjudication.\nRecent research suggests that at least in the United States and Canada, the\noutcome of asylum determinations depends in large part on the identity of the\nparticular adjudicator to whom an application is randomly assigned, and that the\nresulting disparities in rates of granting asylum are problematic.

The authors argue that their findings reveal\nan unacceptable level of disparities in grant rates, noting that the asylum\nadjudicators studied heard large numbers of cases from the same country in the\nsame location over the same period of time. The study concludes with\nrecommendations for reforming the immigration adjudication system. In a 2008\nstudy of immigration court decision-making between 1994 and 2007, the United\nStates Government Accountability Office found that \"the likelihood of being\ngranted asylum varied considerably across and within the [immigration courts\nstudied].\" Government Accountability Office,\n[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08940.pdf U.S. Asylum System: Significant\nVariation Existed in Asylum Outcomes across Immigration Courts and Judges]\n(2008)\n\nThe findings of the original \"Refugee Roulette\" study were reported as the lead\nstory on the front page of the New York Times on May 31, 2007.
