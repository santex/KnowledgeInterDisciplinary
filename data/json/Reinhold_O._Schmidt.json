{"cursor":"5750","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Reinhold Schmidt' (1897â1974) was a 1957 UFO\n\"contactee\" in an era that began with George Adamski in 1953. Schmidt was born\nand grew up in Nebraska, where he worked for most of his adult life as a\nreputable grain buyer and dealer. He became a contactee after telling of his\nexperience on November 5, 1957 detailed in his book\n[http://galactic.to/RUNE/reinhold.html Edge of Tomorrow], when while driving\nthrough a rural area near Kearney, Nebraska, he noticed a large, cigar-shaped\nobject resting in a field. He was soon escorted inside the space ship, which\nturned out to be crewed by completely human-looking space aliens, four male and\ntwo female, who apparently spoke perfect German and claimed to be from the\nplanet Saturn. \"The Saturnians\" also claimed to be interested in the recently\nlaunched Russian sputniks, and the satellite-launching plans of the US.\n\nLater Schmidt brought local police to view the \"landing site,\" where they found\ndeep imprints and some \"mysterious green residue\". Like George Adamski and\nothers, Schmidt also claims subsequent visits to the extraterrestrial space ship\nand many friendly conversations with its learned crew. Schmidt noticed they\ndrank MJB brand coffee, and also carried in their cigar-shaped craft an ordinary\nterrestrial MG sports car, which they used for running errands and buying\ngroceries. (A schematic drawing of the ship's interior in Schmidt's later\nbooklet depicts a Volkswagen Beetle, not an MG sports car.) Unlike most space\nships the Saturnian ship had large propellers at both ends. Eventually Schmidt\ngot the ride up to earth orbit, and tour of the Mother Ship, that almost all\n1950s contactees report.\n\nSchmidt had joined up with Wayne Sulo Aho and John Otto on their lecture circuit\nacross the US, within two months of his reported \"first contact.\" Unlike the\nmajority of contactees, Schmidt did not seem interested in forming a religious\ncult, although the Saturnians had the usual Space-Brotherly religious message\nand revealed that they had been around to help Jesus, a Venusian, in his mission\nto earth. Schmidt relocated to Bakersfield, California, where he continued to\npresent lectures for the next few years, recounting his other-worldly\nexperiences and later sought out elderly women who had been in his audiences and\nwhose addresses he had obtained. He told them that in his rides in the space\nship he had observed the location of valuable mineral deposits, including a\nunique form of quartz crystal which could cure cancer. Having exhausted his\nfunds in purchasing the site, he now needed quick cash to begin mining the\ncrystals and demonstrating their healing properties. Most of the ladies he\napproached quickly came up with several thousand dollars a piece to aid his \"space-\ndirected\" mission. He collected sums approaching $30,000 before his arrest and\nconviction on charges of grand theft. Little is known about his later career,\nexcept that after his release from prison, he returned to Nebraska.\n\nIn 1963, before his legal troubles began, he self-published a booklet, My\nContact With the Spacepeople. He also promoted the making of a short, low-budget\nfilm which dramatizes his supposed visits to the Saturnian space ship. The film,\nEdge of Tomorrow, begins with Schmidt being interviewed by an actor resembling\nLong John Nebel. In flashback we see his visit to the space ship and his chats\nwith the Saturnians, including the ship's captain, \"Mr. X,\" and two very\nfetching Space Girls dressed much like Carol and Tonga of [[Space Patrol (1950\nTV series)|Space Patrol]]. Schmidt's booklet was retitled Edge of Tomorrow to\nmatch the film, illustrated with stills from the film, and was clearly intended\nto be sold to audience members before or after showings of the film. The booklet\nis still in print. According to the booklet, while in the space cigar Schmidt\nhad looked at some notebooks which contained prophecies for our earth covering\nthe period 1958 to 1998, \"the end of the present Earth Cycle.\" No details are\ngiven and Schmidt did not launch a new career as prophet. Schmidt had clearly\nalso just been reading George Hunt Williamson's Secret Places of the Lion\n(1958), because he recounts how \"Mr. X\" once took him to the Great Pyramid, and\nto a secret underground chamber where he got a look at the small flying saucer\nJesus had used to come to Earth from his native Venus 2000 years ago and later\nused to return to Venus. \"Mr. X\" himself had brought the saucer back to store in\nthe Pyramid.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Reinhold_O._Schmidt","recorded":1372158746,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reinhold_O._Schmidt&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reinhold_O._Schmidt&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Contactee","/wiki/George_Adamski","/wiki/Contactee","http://galactic.to/RUNE/reinhold.html","/wiki/Kearney,_Nebraska","/wiki/Space_Brothers","/wiki/Saturn","/wiki/Sputnik","/wiki/George_Adamski","/wiki/MG_(car)","/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle","/wiki/Saturn","/wiki/Wayne_Sulo_Aho","/wiki/Bakersfield,_California","/wiki/California","/wiki/Long_John_Nebel","/wiki/Space_Patrol_(1950_TV_series)","/wiki/George_Hunt_Williamson","/wiki/Jesus","/wiki/Venus","/w/index.php?title=Reinhold_O._Schmidt&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1576072657","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0938294946","/w/index.php?title=Reinhold_O._Schmidt&action=edit&section=2","http://galactic.to/rune/reinhold.html","https://webspace.utexas.edu/cokerwr/www/index.html/sbrothers.shtml","/wiki/Template:UFOs","/wiki/Template_talk:UFOs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UFOs&action=edit","/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object","/wiki/Ufology","/wiki/Index_of_ufology_articles","/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings","/wiki/List_of_alleged_aircraft-UFO_incidents_and_near_misses","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_outer_space","/wiki/Ezekiel%27s_Wheel","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bonilla_Observation","/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident","/wiki/Hopeh_Incident","/wiki/Battle_of_Los_Angeles","/wiki/Chengdu_UFO_incident","/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold_UFO_sighting","/wiki/Maury_Island_incident","/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident","/wiki/Aztec,_New_Mexico,_UFO_incident","/wiki/Mantell_UFO_incident","/wiki/Laredo,_Texas_UFO_crash","/wiki/Chiles-Whitted_UFO_encounter","/wiki/Gorman_dogfight","/wiki/Mariana_UFO_incident","/wiki/McMinnville_UFO_photographs","/wiki/Lubbock_Lights","/wiki/Carson_Sink_UFO_incident","/wiki/Nash-Fortenberry_UFO_sighting","/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident","/wiki/Ellsworth_UFO_sighting","/wiki/Kelly%E2%80%93Hopkinsville_encounter","/wiki/Lakenheath-Bentwaters_incident","/wiki/Burning_on_Fort_Itaipu_Sentinels","/wiki/Antonio_Vilas_Boas","/wiki/Levelland_UFO_Case","/wiki/Milton_Torres_1957_UFO_Encounter","/wiki/The_Trindade_Island%27s_UFO","/wiki/Betty_and_Barney_Hill_abduction","/wiki/Lonnie_Zamora_incident","/wiki/Exeter_incident","/wiki/Kecksburg_UFO_incident","/wiki/Portage_County_UFO_chase","/wiki/Westall_UFO","/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident","/wiki/Pascagoula_Abduction","/wiki/Coyame_UFO_incident","/wiki/Charlie_Redstar","/wiki/Allagash_Abductions","/wiki/1976_Tehran_UFO_incident","/wiki/Petrozavodsk_phenomenon","/wiki/1978_UFO_sightings_in_New_Jersey","/wiki/Valentich_disappearance","/wiki/Robert_Taylor_incident","/wiki/Val_Johnson_incident","/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident","/wiki/Trans-en-Provence_Case","/wiki/Japan_Air_Lines_flight_1628_incident","/wiki/Belgian_UFO_wave","/wiki/Meng_Zhaoguo_incident","/wiki/Varginha_UFO_incident","/wiki/Phoenix_Lights","/wiki/Bonsall_UFO","/wiki/2004_Mexican_UFO_incident","/wiki/Tinley_Park_Lights","/wiki/2006_O%27Hare_International_Airport_UFO_sighting","/wiki/2007_Alderney_UFO_sighting","/wiki/Dudley_Dorito","/wiki/Stephenville,_Texas#UFO_sightings","/wiki/2008_Turkey_UFO_sightings","/wiki/Wales_UFO_sightings","/wiki/2009_Norwegian_spiral_anomaly","/wiki/Harbour_Mille_incident","/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington_UFO_sighting","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Argentina","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Australia","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Belarus","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Belgium","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Brazil","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Canada","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_China","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_France","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Indonesia","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Iran","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Iraq","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Italy","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Mexico","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_New_Zealand","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Norway","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_the_Philippines","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Portugal","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Russia","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_South_Africa","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Spain","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_the_Canary_Islands","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_Sweden","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_the_United_States","/wiki
