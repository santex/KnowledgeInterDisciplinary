While diverse in the\namount of variation available in the dance, b-boying consists of four kinds of\nmovement: toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes. B-boying is typically\ndanced to hip-hop and especially breakbeats, although modern trends allow for\nmuch wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.\n\nA practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, or breaker. Although the\nterm \"breakdance\" is frequently used to refer to the dance, \"b-boying\" and\n\"breaking\" are the original terms.
