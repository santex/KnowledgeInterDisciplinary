{"cursor":"71522","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, Arjuna at Kurukshetra, 18â19th century painting.]]\n\nThe 'Mahabharata' or 'MahÄbhÄrata' (, {{IAST|MahÄbhÄratam}}, ) is one of the two\nmajor Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the [[Ramayana]].\n\nBesides its epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava\nand the Pandava princes, the Mahabharata contains much philosophical and\ndevotional material, such as a discussion of the four \"goals of life\" or\n[[purusharthas]] (12.161). Among the principal works and stories that are a part\nof the Mahabharata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, an abbreviated\nversion of the Ramayana, and the Rishyasringa, often considered as works in\ntheir own right.\n\nTraditionally, the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to Vyasa. There\nhave been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional\nlayers. The oldest preserved parts of the text are not thought to be much older\nthan around 400 BCE, though the origins of the epic probably fall between the\n8th and 9th centuries BCE. Brockington (1998, p. 26)\nThe text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th\ncentury). Van Buitenen; The Mahabharata â 1; The Book of the Beginning.\nIntroduction (Authorship and Date) The title may be translated as \"the\ngreat tale of the BhÄrata dynasty\". According to the Mahabharata itself, the\ntale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply\nBhÄrata. bhÄrata means the progeny of [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]], the\nlegendary king who is claimed to have founded the [[BhÄratavarsha]]\nkingdom.\n\nThe Mahabharata is the longest Sanskrit epic. Its longest version\nconsists of over 100,000 [[shloka]] or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each\nshloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total,\nthe Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the [[Iliad]] and the\n[[Odyssey]] combined, or about four times the length of the\nRamayana. Spodek, Howard.

Johnson has compared the importance of the\nMahabharata to world civilization to that of the Bible, the works of\nShakespeare, the works of Homer, Greek drama, or the Qur'an.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Mahābhārata","recorded":1372152473,"links":[],"instances":["hinduism","character","kingdom","1965_film","mahabharata","comics","1989_film","india","people","goddess","jainism","1980_film","practice"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mahabharata|","Kurukshetra","Epic
