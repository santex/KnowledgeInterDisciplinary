{"cursor":"2292","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'store-within-a-store' is an agreement in which a retailer rents a part of\nthe retail space to be used by a different company to run another,\nindependent store.\n\nThis agreement is popular among filling stations and supermarkets. Many\nbookstores partner with coffee shops because customers often desire a place to\nsit and enjoy a drink while they browse. Companies employing this technique\ninclude BP/Amoco Sheetz, Exxon Mobil and Hollywood Video with its Game Crazy video-\ngame boutiques.\n\nOften the store-within-a-store is a owned by a manufacturer, operating an outlet\nwithin a retail companys's store. For example, the American department store\nBloomingdale's has had such arrangements with Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, DKNY\nand Kenneth Cole. Neiman Marcus, another American department store, has had them\nwith Armani and Gucci.\n\nA study by business-school academics found that the arrangement works, because\nthe retailer offers prime locations for which it can charge high rents, the\nmanufacturer makes a higher profit than it would through a wholesale model,and\nthe consumer gets a lower price and better service. The operator of the store-within-a-\nstore can provide these benefits because it receives all profits, instead of\nhaving to share then with the retailer, as it would in the traditional split\nbetween manufacturer and retailer activities. The study also found that the\narrangement works best for relatively non-substitutable goods, like cosmetics\nand brand fashions.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Store-within-a-store","recorded":1362575669,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business models","Retailing"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/CashRegister.svg/25px-CashRegister.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Retailer","Filling_station","Supermarket","BP","Amoco","Sheetz","Exxon_Mobil","Hollywood_Video","Game_Crazy","Video_game","Department_store","Bloomingdale's","Polo_Ralph_Lauren","Calvin_Klein","DKNY","Kenneth_Cole_Productions","Neiman_Marcus","Armani","Gucci","Business_school","Academic","Cosmetics","Gastaurant"]}
