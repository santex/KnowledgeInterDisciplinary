His father was cellist in The Royal Chapel and\nwas educated by The Royal Danish Academy of Music. His mother was the sister of\ncomposers Roger Henrichsen and Edgar Henrichsen and Kai Aage was thus cousin to\njazz pianist BÃ¸rge Roger-Henrichsen. Bruun began to play cello at the age of\njust 6, and in 1917 studied music in Leipzig. He was also involved in the\npractical music scene: in 1925 as co-founder of Student Musikforeningen where he\ndirected a couple of years, 1926-1927 as conductor of the Student Sangforeningen\nand later, 1930-1931 as conductor of the Academic Orchestra. In addition, he\nworked as a music critic and assistant to Music History Museum.\n\nIn 1927 he had, however, been employed by DR, Denmarks national broadcasting\nstation as the program secretary, and thus began a 30-year association with a\nmedium where his abilities as a music facilitator came to full expression\nthrough numerous lectures and broadcasts. In 1949, he was deputy head of the its\nmusic department and he worked a dozen years as a music consultant.\n\nIn 1969 published his principal Danish music history but he had previously\nwritten other musical works. Notably The Life and Works(1928),Three Composers\n(about Haydn, Kuhlau, Carl Nielsen - 1932),Basic Concepts of Music(1942),Music\nDictionary(1943), Chamber music from Haydn to the young

romantic pieces as\nwell as some analysis of chamber music from the 18th century.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Kai_Aage_Bruun","recorded":1374520624,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Denmark","/wiki/Royal_Danish_Orchestra","/wiki/The_Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Music","/wiki/Roger_Henrichsen","/wiki/Edgar_Henrichsen","/w/index.php?title=B%C3%B8rge_Roger-Henrichsen&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Leipzig","/w/index.php?title=Student_Musikforeningen&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Student_Sangforeningen&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Academic_Orchestra&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Music_History_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/DR_(broadcaster)","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/66138711","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/MusicalnotesDenmark.svg/35px-MusicalnotesDenmark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Denmark-composer-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Denmark-composer-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Denmark-composer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&oldid=563971701","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Danish_composers","/wiki/Category:Danish_music_critics","/wiki/Category:Music_writers","/wiki/Category:1899_births","/wiki/Category:1971_deaths","/wiki/Category:Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Music_alumni","/wiki/Category:Danish_composer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kai+Aage+Bruun&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kai+Aage+Bruun","/wiki/Kai_Aage_Bruun","/wiki/Talk:Kai_Aage_Bruun","#","/wiki/Kai_Aage_Bruun","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Kai_Aage_Bruun","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Kai_Aage_Bruun","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&oldid=563971701","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6347348","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Kai_Aage_Bruun&id=563971701","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Kai+Aage+Bruun","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Kai+Aage+Bruun&oldid=563971701&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Kai_Aage_Bruun&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Aage_Bruun","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6347348#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wik
