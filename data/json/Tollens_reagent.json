It is usually\nammoniacal silver nitrate, but can also be other mixtures, as long as aqueous\ndiamminesilver(I) complex is present. It was named after its discoverer,\nBernhard Tollens.\n\nA positive test with Tollens' reagent results in elemental silver\nprecipitating out of solution, occasionally onto the inner surface of the\nreaction vessel, producing a characteristic and memorable \"silver mirror\" on\nthe inner vessel surface.\n\nAldehydes will be positive in Tollen's test and a mirror-like material will\nbe formed.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Tollens'_reagent","recorded":1362672229,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Silver compounds","Oxidizing agents","Coordination compounds","Chemical tests","Analytical reagents"],"headings":["Laboratory preparation","Analytical uses","In silver mirroring","Safety","Tollensâ€™ test for pentoses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Tollens.JPG/400px-Tollens.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Diamminesilver%28I%29-3D-balls.png/200px-Diamminesilver%28I%29-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complex","chemistry"],["tin(ii_chloride"]],"members":["complex"],"related":["Aldehyde","Ketone","Aqueous_solution","Complex_(chemistry)","Bernhard_Tollens","Sodium_hydroxide","Silver_nitrate","Silver_oxide","Sodium_nitrate","Ammonia","Carbonyl_group","Organic_molecule","2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine","Brady's_reagent","Ketone","Aldehyde","Alpha-hydroxy_ketone","Oxidizing_agent","Carboxylate","Alkyl","Alkyne","Metal_acetylide","Fehling's_reagent","Formic_acid","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Anatomic_pathology","Histological_techniques","Silver_stain","Melanin","Argentaffin","Lipofuscin","Tin(II)_chloride","Silver_nitride","Furfural","Phloroglucinol","Brady's_reagent","Benedict's_reagent","Fehling's_solution","Walden_reductor"]}
