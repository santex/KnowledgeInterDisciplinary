{"cursor":"36982","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Corrosion' is the gradual destruction of material, usually metals, by chemical\nreaction with its environment. In the most common use of the word, this means\nelectrochemical oxidation of metals in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen.\nRusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of\nelectrochemical corrosion. This type of damage typically produces oxide(s) or\nsalt(s) of the original metal. Corrosion can also occur in materials other than\nmetals, such as ceramics or polymers, although in this context, the term\ndegradation is more common. Corrosion degrades the useful properties of\nmaterials and structures including strength, appearance and permeability to\nliquids and gases.\n\nMany structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air, but the\nprocess can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion\ncan be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a\nwide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a\ndiffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result,\nmethods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface, such as passivation and\nchromate conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However,\nsome corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.\n\nes have accelerated the corrosion of this abandoned mining
