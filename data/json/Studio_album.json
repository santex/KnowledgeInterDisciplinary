{"cursor":"3138","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'studio album' is an album of audio recordings made up of tracks recorded in\nthe controlled environment of a recording studio. A studio album contains newly\nwritten and recorded or previously unreleased or remixed material,\ndistinguishing itself from a compilation or reissue album of previously recorded\nmaterial, or live recording made at a performance venue. A studio album is\nusually planned and scheduled in advance, and may take anywhere from a few days\nto more than a year to complete. Some studio albums may include one or more\ncovers, occasionally as live tracks within the studio album. Studio albums may\nalso feature guest performers or session musicians that would not usually\nperform live with the artist. A studio album may also be released or rereleased\nyears after it has been recorded, or even posthumously, containing material\nrecorded before the death of the artist.\n\nWith modern recording technology, musicians can be recorded in separate rooms or\nat separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each\npart recorded as a separate track. With a theoretically infinite number of\ntracks available with many modern computer and hard disk based recording systems\n(the only limit being processing power and size of the recording medium), one\nsong can consist of hundreds of recorded tracks, employing dozens of overdubs\nand complex layering of instruments. This allows studio albums to be\nconsiderably more complex than live albums, and can potentially be compiled of\n'perfect' takes of the same part.\n\nAlthough studio albums can be recorded using large multitrack systems with many\noverdubs and different takes of the same instrument, many albums are still\nrecorded live by the musician(s), in order to reproduce the feel and energy of a\nlive performance. Often basic parts such as drums and rhythm guitar will be\nrecorded live, then overdubs such as solos and vocals recorded later. Studio\nalbums are often recorded, mixed and mastered at different facilities, often due\nto touring restrictions and time constraints of the artist or financial\nconsiderations.\n\nA studio album will often consist of songs which will be played in a different\norder live, or in some cases rarely or never played at all after the album or\nits accompanying tour. Concept albums and rock operas, such as those by Pink\nFloyd are often played in their entirety live, usually in the same order as the\nalbum and featuring the same instrumentation, particularly in the album's\naccompanying tour. Studio albums often do not include singles released at the\nsame time, although many modern albums include accompanying singles (the single\noften being an album track, rather than the album and single being separate).\n","linknr":419,"url":"Studio_album","recorded":1362676317,"links":44,"instances":["music","recorded_music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Album types"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["audio_mixing","recorded_music"],["single","music"]],"members":["single","audio_mixing"],"related":["Album","Audio_recording","Recording_studio","Compilation_album","Live_album","Cover_version","History_of_sound_recording","Headphones","Multitrack_recording","Digital_audio_workstation","Hard_disk_recorder","Live_album","Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)","Audio_mastering","Pink_Floyd","Single_(music)"]}
