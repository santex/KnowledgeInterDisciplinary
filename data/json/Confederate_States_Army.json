On February 28,\n1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer\narmy and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state\nforces and volunteers to the President of the Confederate States of America. On\nMarch 1, 1861, Provisional Confederate President Jefferson Davis, on behalf of\nthe Confederate States government, assumed control of the military situation at\nCharleston, South Carolina where state militia were threatening to seize Fort\nSumter from the small United States Army garrison. On March 6 and 9, 1861, the\nProvisional Confederate Congress passed additional military legislation and\nestablished a more permanent Confederate States Army.\n\nThe Confederacy's government was effectively dissolved with the last meeting of\nthe Confederate cabinet on May 5, 1865 and with the capture of President\nJefferson Davis by Union forces on May 10, 1865. The main Confederate armies,\nthe Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee and the remnants of\nthe Army of Tennessee and various other units under General Joseph E. Johnston,\nhad already surrendered on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12) and April 18,\n1865 (officially April 26). Confederate forces at Mobile, Alabama and Columbus,\nGeorgia also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865 and April 16, 1865,\nrespectively. Union and Confederate units fought a battle at Columbus, Georgia\nbefore the April 16, 1865 surrender and a small final battle at Palmito Ranch,\nTexas on May 12, 1865. In areas more distant from the main theaters of\noperations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under Lieutenant\nGeneral Richard Taylor, in Arkansas under Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson, in\nLouisiana and Texas under General E. Kirby Smith and in Indian Territory under\nBrigadier General Stand Watie surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26,\n1865 (officially June 2, 1865) and June 28, 1865, respectively.\n\nIncomplete and destroyed records make an accurate count of the number of\nindividuals who served in the Confederate Army impossible. All but extremely\nimprobable estimates of this number range between 600,000 and 1,500,000 men. The\nbetter estimates of the actual number of individual Confederates soldiers seem\nto be between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number\nof slaves who were impressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as\nconstruction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons. Records of the\nnumber of individuals who served in the Union Army are more extensive, but still\nare not entirely reliable. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers\nwith whom the Confederates had to contend range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000,\nwith a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 appearing to be most likely\naccurate. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments in\nthat army but this number apparently includes many re-enlistments. Since these\nfigures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served\nin each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the\narmies at any given date. The numbers of Union and Confederate soldiers do not\ninclude men who served in Union or Confederate naval forces.\n\nAlthough most Civil War soldiers were volunteers, both sides ultimately resorted\nto conscription. Exact figures again are unavailable but estimates of the\npercentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees have often been about\ndouble the 6 percent of Union soldiers who were conscripts. Some historians have\nsuggested that the threat of conscription may have had a greater effect on\nraising volunteers than it did in providing large numbers of reliable soldiers.\n\nConfederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on\nthe number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths\nof Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in\nbattle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in\nUnion prison camps. One estimate of Confederate wounded, which is considered\nincomplete, is 194,026. In comparison, the best estimates of the number of\ndeaths of Union soldiers are 110,100 killed or mortally wounded in battle,\n224,580 deaths from disease and 30,192 deaths in Confederate prison camps,\nalthough these figures also are subject to some dispute. The best conjecture for\nUnion Army wounded is 275,175.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Confederate_States_Army","recorded":1362478034,"links":0,"instances":["csa","general","united_states","general","csa","tribe","united_states","chicago","rank","csa","military_unit","rank","tennessee_politician","1862","csa","1865","creek","confederate_army","general","american_civil_war","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Confederate
