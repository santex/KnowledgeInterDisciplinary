They are physically and chemically well-characterized enzymes.\nSubtilisins typically have molecular weights of about 20,000 to 45,000 dalton.\nThey can be obtained from soil bacteria, for example, [[Bacillus\namyloliquefaciens]]. Subtilisins are secreted in large amounts from many\nBacillus species.\n\nSubtilisins are widely used in commercial products, for example, in\nlaundry Spar Washing Detergent contents http://www.5010358128009.detergent-\ninfo.com/ and dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, food\nprocessing, http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/biology/enztech/proteases.html skin\ncare ointments, http://www.xenna.com/product_callex.html contact lens\ncleaners, and for research purposes in synthetic organic chemistry.\n\nThe structure of subtilisin has been determined by X-ray crystallography. It is\na 275-residue globular protein with several alpha-helices, and a large beta-\nsheet. It is structurally unrelated to the chymotrypsin-clan of serine\nproteases, but uses the same type of catalytic triad in the active site. This\nmakes it a classic example of convergent evolution.\n\nIn molecular biology using B. subtilis as a model organism, the gene encoding\nsubtilisin (aprE) is often the second gene of choice after amyE for integrating\nreporter constructs into, due to its dispensability.\n","linknr":281,"url":"Subtilisin","recorded":1362484506,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes"],"headings":["Charge-relay Site of Subtilisin","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/1st2.png/220px-1st2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["residue","chemistry"]],"members":["residue"],"related":["X-ray_crystallography","Protease","Proteolysis","Enzyme","Subtilase","Serine_protease","Nucleophilic","Peptide","Residue_(chemistry)","Active_site","Organic_chemistry","X-ray_crystallography","Globular_protein","Alpha-helix","Beta-sheet","Chymotrypsin","Catalytic_triad","Active_site","Convergent_evolution","Imidazole","PH","Tertiary_structure","Nucleophile","Peptide_bond"]}
