It is this sheet that one typically lies on.\n\nIn many areas of the world, a second flat bed sheet is laid on top of the sheet\ncovering the mattress. This is known as a \"top sheet\" and when a top sheet is\nused, the sheet covering the mattress is known as a \"bottom sheet\". One sleeps\nbetween the two bed sheets. Blankets, comforters, and other bed covers are then\nplaced on top of the second bed sheet.\n\nThe term bed sheet was first used in the 15th century.\n","linknr":406,"url":"Bed_sheet","recorded":1362669039,"links":48,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bedding","Linens"],"headings":["Varieties","Materials","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Prze%C5%9Bcierad%C5%82o.jpg/220px-Prze%C5%9Bcierad%C5%82o.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Changing_Garfield%27s_Bedclothes.jpg/220px-Changing_Garfield%27s_Bedclothes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Bedsheet_attachments.JPG/220px-Bedsheet_attachments.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Correctional_Activities_at_Central_Jail_Faisalabad%2C_Pakistan_in_2010_-_Convict_weaver_busy_in_weaving_a_Hospital_Bed_Sheet_on_a_traditional_manual_loom.jpg/220px-Correctional_Activities_at_Central_Jail_Faisalabad%2C_Pakistan_in_2010_-_Convict_weaver_busy_in_weaving_a_Hospital_Bed_Sheet_on_a_traditional_manual_loom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Rectangle","Cloth","Mattress","Mattress","Blanket","Comforter","Elastomer","Thread_count","Cotton","Linen","Satin","Silk","Rayon","Bamboo_fibre","Cotton","Polyester","Nonwoven","Polypropylene","Faisalabad","Pakistan","Overlock","Seam","Mattress","Seam","Mattress","Selvedge","Bed-making","Monogram","Bed","Bed_size","Bedding"]}
