Along with Robert Oppenheimer, he is referred to as \"the father of\nthe atomic bomb\".<ref name=\"obit\"/> He held several patents related to the use\nof nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work\non induced radioactivity and the discovery of transuranic elements. Throughout\nhis life Fermi was widely regarded as one of the very few physicists who\nexcelled both theoretically and experimentally.<ref></ref>\n\nFermi's first major contribution was to statistical mechanics. After Wolfgang\nPauli announced his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in\nwhich he applied the principle to an ideal gas, employing a statistical\nformulation now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. Today, particles that obey the\nexclusion principle are called \"Fermions\". Later Pauli postulated the existence\nof an invisible particle with no charge that was emitted at the same time an\nelectron was emitted during beta decay in order to satisfy the law of\nconservation of energy. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that\nincorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi named the \"neutrino\". His\ntheory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction and still later as the theory\nof the weak interaction, described one of the four forces of nature. Through\nexperiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered neutrons, Fermi\ndiscovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones, and\ndeveloped a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi\nage equation. He bombarded thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, and concluded\nthat he had created new elements, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, but\nthe new elements were subsequently revealed to be fission products.\n\nFermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected his\nJewish wife Laura, and emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the\nManhattan Project during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and\nbuilt the Chicago Pile-1, and initiated the first artificial self-sustaining\nnuclear chain reaction when it went critical on 2 December 1942. He was on hand\nwhen the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, went critical in 1943,\nand the B Reactor at the Hanford Site went critical in 1944. At Los Alamos he\nheaded F Division, where he worked on the thermonuclear \"Super\". He was present\nat the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, where he used one of his Fermi method\nexperiments to estimate the bomb's yield.\n\nAfter the war, Fermi served on the influential General Advisory Committee of the\nAtomic Energy Commission, a scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer\nwhich advised the commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the\ndetonation of RDS-1 in August 1949, the first Soviet fission bomb, he wrote a\nstrongly worded report for the committee, opposing the development of a hydrogen\nbomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who\ntestified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954\nthat resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Fermi did important\nwork in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he\nspeculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic\nfields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named\nafter Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the\nEnrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium.\n","title":"Enrico%20Fermi","headings":["Early life","''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in Pisa","Professor in
