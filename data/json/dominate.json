It followed the\nperiod known as the Principate. In the Eastern half of the Empire, and\nespecially from the time of Justinian I, the system of the Dominate evolved into\nautocratic absolutism.<ref></ref>\n\nThe term is derived from the Latin 'dominus', which translates English lord or\nmaster. This form of address - already used by slaves to address their masters -\nwas used for emperors from the Julio-Claudian (first) dynasty on, but\ninconsistently - Tiberius in particular is said to have reviled it as\nsycophancy. It became common under Diocletian, who is therefore a logical choice\nas the first ruler of the \"early\" dominate. Historian David Potter describes the\ntransformation of government under Diocletian when describing the shifts in\nimagery the Emperor used to display his power (in this case the building of a\nhuge new palace at Sirmium):\n\n<blockquote>The style of Government so memorably described by Marcus, whereby\nthe emperor sought to show himself as a model of correct aristocratic\ndeportment, had given way to a style in which the emperor was seen to be\ndistinct from all other mortals. His house could no longer be a grander version\nof houses that other people might live in: it, like him, had to be\ndifferent.</blockquote>\n","title":"dominate","headings":["Transition from the Principate","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Crisis_of_the_Third_Century","2: Principate","2: Diocletian","1: Despotism","1: Roman_Empire","1: Western_Roman_Empire","1: Justinian_I","1: Autocracy","1: Absolute_monarchy","1: Latin","1: Julio-Claudian","1: Tiberius","1: Sirmium","1: Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic","1: Constitution_of_the_Roman_Empire","1: Roman_Republic","1: Roman_Senate","1: Roman_consul","1: Roman_emperor","1: Consortium_imperii","1: Tetrarchy","1: Princeps#Roman_Emperor","1: Potentate","1: Egypt","1: Persian_Empire","1: Toga_praetexta","1: Dalmatia","1: Diocletian's_Palace","1: Constable","1: Divus","1: Oriental_despotism","1: Proskynesis","1: Constantine_I","1: Theodosius_I","1: Constantinople","1: Orthodox_Church","1: Majesty"]}
