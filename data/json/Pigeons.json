They are stout-bodied birds with short necks, and have short,\nslender bills with fleshy ceres. Doves feed on seeds, fruits, and plants. This\nfamily occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the Indomalaya and\nAustralasia ecozones.\n\nIn general, the terms \"dove\" and \"pigeon\" are used somewhat interchangeably. In\nornithological practice, \"dove\" tends to be used for smaller species and\n\"pigeon\" for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied, and\nhistorically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation\nbetween the terms. The species most commonly referred to as \"pigeon\" is the\nFeral Rock Pigeon, common in many cities.\n\nDoves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests from sticks and other debris,\nwhich may be placed in trees, on ledges, or on the ground, depending on species.\nThey lay one or two eggs, and both parents care for the young, which leave the\nnest after seven to 28 days. Unlike most birds, both sexes\nof doves and pigeons produce \"crop milk\" to feed to their young, secreted by a\nsloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop. Young doves and\npigeons are called \"squabs\".\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Pigeons","recorded":1372152404,"links":[],"instances":["united_states","anatomy","bird","world_war_i","france","islam"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bird families","Columbidae","Game birds","National symbols of Cyprus","National symbols of Fiji","National symbols of Guinea","National symbols of Tonga","Peace symbols"],"headings":["Taxonomy and systematics","Description","Distribution and habitat","Behaviour and ecology","Status and conservation","Relationship with humans","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["crop","anatomy"],["turkey","bird"],["croix_de_guerre_1914–1918","france"],["lost_battalion","world_war_i"],["77th_infantry_division","united_states"],["hijra","islam"]],"members":["77th_infantry_division","crop","turkey","lost_battalion","hijra"],"related":["Early_Miocene","Feral_Pigeon","Animal","Chordate","Vertebrate","Bird","Johann_Karl_Wilhelm_Illiger","Didunculinae","Gourinae","Otidiphabinae","Ptilinopinae","Treroninae","Pigeons_and_Doves","Clade","Species","Cere","Seed","Fruit","Indomalaya","Australasia_ecozone","Common_name","Feral_Pigeon","Crop_milk","Crop_(anatomy)","Sandgrouse","Pteroclidiformes","Monotypic","Osteology","DNA_sequence","Dodo","Subfamily","Raphinae","DNA_sequence","Long_branch_attraction","Rodrigues_Solitaire","Nicobar_Pigeon","Raphinae","Fossil_record","Early_Miocene","France","Sandgrouse","Ptilinopus","New_Zealand","Florida","Cladistic","Crowned_Pigeon","New_Guinea","Turkey_(bird)","House_Sparrow","Arboreal","Marquesan_Imperial_Pigeon","Dwarf_Fruit_Dove","Plumage","Seed_predation","Sexual_dimorphism","Gall_bladder","Bile","Four_humours","Aristotle","Thomas_Browne","Sahara_Desert","Antarctica","Arctic","Polynesia","Chatham_Islands","Pacific","Mauritius","Seychelles","Réunion","Indian_Ocean","Azores","Atlantic_Ocean","Eared_Dove","South_America","Colombia","Tierra_Del_Fuego","Eurasian_Collared_Dove","Great_Britain","Europe","Middle_East","India","Pakistan","China","Laughing_Dove","Africa","Endemism","Whistling_Dove","Kadavu_Island","Fiji","Caroline_Ground-dove","Chuuk_Lagoon","Pohnpei","Caroline_Islands","Grenada_Dove","Grenada","Caribbean","Black-banded_Fruit_Dove","Arnhem_Land","Australia","Somali_Pigeon","Somalia","Moreno's_Ground_Dove","Salta","San_Miguel_de_Tucumán","Argentina","Rock_Dove","Great_Britain","Ireland","Arabia","Central_Asia","Himalayas","Mongolia","North_America","Southeast_Asia","Japan","New_Zealand","Introduced_species","Gallicolumba","Quail-dove","Atoll_Fruit_Dove","White-crowned_Pigeon","Orange_Dove","Ruddy_Ground_Dove","Rock_Dove","Extinct_in_the_wild","Threatened","Extinction","Dodo","Passenger_Pigeon","Earth","Alexander_Wilson","United_States","Island_tameness","Introduced_species","Extinct_in_the_wild","Socorro_Dove","Socorro_Island","Feral_cat","Negros_Fruit_Dove","Polynesian_Ground_Dove","Critically_endangered","Pacific_Ocean","Conservation_biology","Tempeh","Tofu","Sundanese_cuisine","Indonesia","Ancient_Rome","Medieval_Europe","Jewish_cuisine","Arab_cuisine","French_cuisine","Tanakh","Kosher","Asian_cuisine","Chinese_cuisine","Indonesian_cuisine","Common_Wood_Pigeon","Game_bird","Rock_Pigeon","Passenger_Pigeon","Mrs_Beeton's_Book_of_Household_Management","Pigeon_pie","United_States_Army_Pigeon_Service","Dickin_Medal","Cher_Ami","Homing_pigeon","World_War_I","Croix_de_guerre_1914–1918_(France)","Oak_leaf_cluster","Verdun","Lost_Battalion_(World_War_I)","77th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)","Meuse-Argonne_offensive","Taxidermy","National_Museum_of_American_History","Smithsonian_Institution","Rock_Pigeon","Homing_pigeon","Racing_homer","Birmingham_Roller","Carrier_Pigeon","Release_Dove","Hebrew_Bible","Book_of_Genesis","Noah","Song_of_Songs","Jonah","Jesus","Gospel_of_Luke","Holy_Spirit","Jesus","Baptism_of_Jesus","Sign_of_the_Dove","Gospel_of_Matthew","Peace_dove","Muhammad","Hijra_(Islam)","Chaldean_mythology","Utnapishtim","Raven","List_of_doves_and_pigeons","Gamasoidosis","War_pigeon","Peace_dove","Pigeon_control","Doves_as_symbols","Earth's__magnetic_field","Grove_Press"]}
