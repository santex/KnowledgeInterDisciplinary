{"cursor":"16292","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In materials science, 'polymorphism' is the ability of a solid material to exist\nin more than one form or crystal structure. Polymorphism can potentially be\nfound in any crystalline material including polymers, minerals, and metals, and\nis related to allotropy, which refers to chemical elements. The complete\nmorphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such\nas crystal habit, amorphous fraction or crystallographic defects. Polymorphism\nis relevant to the fields of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, pigments,\ndyestuffs, foods, and explosives.\n\nWhen polymorphism exists as a result of difference in crystal packing, it is\ncalled 'packing polymorphism'. Polymorphism can also result from the existence\nof different conformers of the same molecule in 'conformational polymorphism'.\nIn 'pseudopolymorphism' the different crystal types are the result of hydration\nor solvation. This is more correctly referred to as 'solvomorphism' as different\nsolvates have different chemical formulae. An example of an organic polymorph is\nglycine, which is able to form monoclinic and hexagonal crystals. Silica is\nknown to form many polymorphs, the most important of which are; Î±-quartz, Î²-\nquartz, tridymite, cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite. A classical example is\nthe minerals calcite and aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate.\n\nAn analogous phenomenon for amorphous materials is polyamorphism, when a\nsubstance can take on several different amorphous modifications.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Polymorphism_(materials_science)","recorded":1362486054,"links":37,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://acaschool.iit.edu/lectures04/JLiangXtal.pdf"],"categories":["Materials science"],"headings":["Background","Reasons","Ostwald's rule","Polymorphism in pharmaceuticals","Interesting occurrences of polymorphs","Polytypism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","suspension"],"related":["Materials_science","Crystal","Polymer","Mineral","Metal","Allotropy","Chemical_elements","Crystal_habit","Amorphous_solid","Crystallographic_defect","Pharmaceutical","Agrochemical","Pigment","Dyestuff","Food","Explosive","Conformer","Mineral_hydration","Solvation","Glycine","Monoclinic","Hexagonal","Silica","Quartz","Quartz","Tridymite","Cristobalite","Coesite","Stishovite","Calcite","Aragonite","Calcium_carbonate","Amorphous","Polyamorphism","Thermodynamics","Friedrich_Wöhler","Justus_von_Liebig","Benzamide","Angew._Chem._Int._Ed.","Orthorhombic","Monoclinic","Monoclinic","Metastable","Stable","Melting_points","Drug","X-ray","Diffraction","Crystallisation","Solvent","Solubility","Temperature","Crystallisation","Maleic_acid","Chemical_Communications","Co-crystal","Caffeine","Chloroform","Monoclinic","Space_group","Hydrogen_bond","Carboxylic_acid","Molecular_dipole_moment","1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene","2,4,6-trinitrotoluene","Trisindane","Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition","Wilhelm_Ostwald","Dolomite","Phosphorus","Allotrope","Active_ingredient","Medication","Regulation","Patent","GlaxoSmithKline","Zantac","Medicine","Solvation","Ritonavir","Cefdinir","Astellas","Abbott_Laboratories","Suspension_(chemistry)","Anhydrous","Hydrate","Infrared_spectroscopy","XRPD","Pyridinium","Acetylsalicylic_acid","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition","Levetiracetam","Acetonitrile","Kelvin","Dimer_(chemistry)","Acetyl","Methyl","Carbonyl","Hydrogen_bond","Carboxylic_acid","Paracetamol","Carbamazepine","Dielectric_constant","Alcohol","Chloroamphenicol","Walter_McCrone","Paroxetine","Close-packed","Polymorphs_of_silicon_carbide_","Density","Gibbs_free_energy","Wurtzite","Face-centered_cubic","Sphalerite","Zinc_blende","PDF","Illinois_Institute_of_Technology"]}
