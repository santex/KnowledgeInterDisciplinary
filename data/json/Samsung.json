It comprises numerous subsidiaries\nand affiliated businesses, most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is\nthe largest South Korean [[chaebol]].\n\nSamsung was founded by Lee Byung-chull in 1938 as a trading company. Over the\nnext three decades the group diversified into areas including food processing,\ntextiles, insurance, securities and retail. Samsung entered the electronics\nindustry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in\nthe mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's\ndeath in 1987, Samsung was separated into four business groups - Samsung Group,\nShinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group. Since the 1990s Samsung has\nincreasingly globalised its activities, and electronics, particularly mobile\nphones and semiconductors, has become its most important source of income.\n\nNotable Samsung industrial subsidiaries include Samsung Electronics (the world's\nlargest information technology company measured by 2012 revenues), http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565617-bangladesh-has-\ndysfunctional-politics-and-stunted-private-sector-yet-it-has-been-\nsurprisingly Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's second-largest\nshipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues), and Samsung Engineering and\nSamsung C&T (respectively the world's 35th- and 72nd-largest construction\ncompanies). Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance\n(the world's 14th-largest life insurance company), Samsung Everland\n(operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea),\nSamsung Techwin (a surveillance, aeronautics, optoelectronics, automations and\nweapons technology company) and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 19th-largest\nadvertising agency measured by 2010 revenues).\n\nSamsung has a powerful influence on South Korea's economic development,\npolitics, media and culture, and has been a major driving force behind the\n\"Miracle on the Han River\".
