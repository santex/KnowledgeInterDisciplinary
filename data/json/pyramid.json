that is, its outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a\nsingle point at the top. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral,\nor any polygon shape, meaning that a pyramid has at least three outer triangular\nsurfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with\nsquare base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.\n\nA pyramid's design, with the majority of the weight closer to the\nground,<ref>Centre of volume is one quarter of the way up – see [[Centre of\nmass]]</ref> and with the pyramidion on top means that less material higher up\non the pyramid will be pushing down from above. This distribution of weight\nallowed early civilizations to create stable monumental structures.\n\nPyramids have been built by civilizations in many parts of the world. For\nthousands of years, the largest structures on Earth were pyramids—first the Red\nPyramid in the Dashur Necropolis and then the Great Pyramid of Khufu, both of\nEgypt, the latter the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still\nremaining. Khufu's Pyramid is built mainly of limestone (with large red granite\nblocks used in some interior chambers), and is considered an architectural\nmasterpiece. It contains around 1,300,000 blocks ranging in weight from to and\nis built on a square base with sides measuring about 230&nbsp;m (755&nbsp;ft),\ncovering 13 acres. Its four sides face the four cardinal points precisely and it\nhas an angle of 52 degrees. The original height of the Pyramid was 146.5&nbsp;m\n(488&nbsp;ft), but today it is only 137&nbsp;m (455&nbsp;ft) high, the 9&nbsp;m\n(33&nbsp;ft) that is missing is due to the theft of the fine quality white Tura\nlimestone covering, or casing stones, for construction in Cairo. It is still the\ntallest pyramid. The largest pyramid by volume is the Great Pyramid of Cholula,\nin the Mexican state of Puebla.\n","title":"pyramid","headings":["Ancient monuments","Modern pyramids","Gallery","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Egypt","4: Mexico","3: Great_Pyramid_of_Giza","3: Memphis,_Tennessee","3: Stockport","3: Kazan","3: Russia","2: Teotihuacan","2: Tenerife","2: Pyramidion","2: Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World","2: Limestone","2: Great_Pyramid_of_Cholula","2: Puebla","2: Sumer","2: Djoser","2: Cairo","2: Valley_of_the_Kings","2: Nubian_pyramids","2: Pyramids_of_Güímar","2: Platform_mound","2: Central_Java","2: Step_pyramid","2: Las_Vegas_Strip","2: Astana","2: Paris","2: Pyramid_Arena","2: Slovak_Radio_Building","2: Bratislava","2: Slovakia","2: Summum_Pyramid","2: Salt_Lake_City","2: Utah","2: Pune","2: Karlsruhe_Pyramid","2: Hanoi_Museum","1: Giza_Necropolis","1: Spain","1: Algeria","1: Numidia","1: Nonbuilding_structure","1: Polygon","1: Square_pyramid","1: List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world","1: Red_Pyramid","1: Dashur_Necropolis","1: Khufu","1: Tura,_Egypt","1: Mesopotamia","1: Babylon","1: Elam","1: Akkadian_Empire","1: Assyria","1: Ubaid_period","1: Millennium","1: Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Sumer#Early_Dynastic_period","1: Brick","1: Astrology","1: Herodotus","1: Religions_of_the_Ancient_Near_East","1: Egyptian_pyramids","1: Electrum","1: Third_Dynasty","1: Imhotep","1: Mastaba","1: Ancient_Egyptian","1: Lincoln_Cathedral","1: Abydos,_Egypt","1: Ahmose_I","1: Eighteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt","1: New_Kingdom","1: Third_dynasty_of_Egypt","1: Sneferu","1: Deir_el-Medina","1: Napata","1: Meroë","1: Igbo_people","1: Wadjet","1: Argos","1: Pyramid_of_Hellinikon","1: Pottery","1: Black_Athena","1: Mary_Lefkowitz","1: Güímar","1: Canary_Islands","1: Agricultural","1: Qin_Shi_Huang","1: Xi'an","1: Han_Dynasty","1: Frustum","1: Chichen_Itza","1: Mesoamerica","1: Mesoamerican_pyramids","1: Pyramid_of_the_Sun","1: Cuicuilco","1: Mexico_City","1: Xitle","1: Guachimontones","1: Jalisco","1: Human_sacrifice","1: Great_Pyramid_of_Tenochtitlan","1: Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","1: North_America","1: Monks_Mound","1: Cahokia","1: Tribal_chief","1: Temple","1: Mortuary","1: Charnel_house","1: Earth_lodge","1: Troyville_culture","1: Coles_Creek_culture","1: Plaquemine_culture","1: Mississippian_culture","1: Pyramid_of_Cestius","1: Porta_San_Paolo","1: French_pyramids","1: Falicon","1: Oviedo","1: Granite","1: South_India","1: Chola_Empire","1: Brihadisvara_Temple","1: Thanjavur","1: Gangaikonda_Cholapuram","1: Airavatesvara_Temple","1: Darasuram","1: Srirangam","1: UNESCO","1: World_Heritage_Site","1: Menhir","1: Austronesian_people","1: Megalithic","1: Indonesia","1: Gunung_Padang","1: West_Java","1: Ancestors","1: Borobudur","1: Prambanan","1: Majapahit","1: Candi_Sukuh","1: Caral","1: Túcume","1: Long_Beach,_California","1: San_Francisco","1: Louvre_Pyramid","1: France","1: Louvre","1: I._M._Pei","1: Luxor_Hotel","1: Tennessee","1: Memphis,_Egypt","1: Memphis,_Egypt#Toponymy","1: University_of_Memphis","1: Basketball","1: National_Basketball_Association","1: Memphis_Grizzlies","1: Walter_Pyramid","1: Volleyball","1: California_State_University,_Long_Beach","1: California","1: United_States","1: Transamerica_Pyramid","1: William_Pereira","1: Ryugyong_Hotel","1: Pyongyang","1: Northern_Korea","1: Summum","1: Palace_of_Peace_and_Reconciliation","1: Kazakhstan","1: Moody_Gardens","1: Galveston","1: Texas","1: England","1: Office_block","1: Mersey","1: Ames_Monument","1: Wyoming","1: Union_Pacific_Railroad","1: Ballandean_Pyramid","1: Queensland","1: Folly","1: Karlsruhe","1: Prague","1: Muttart_Conservatory","1: Edmonton","1: Alberta","1: India","1: Steelcase","1: Grand_Rapids,_Michigan","1: Sunway_Pyramid","1: Selangor","1: Malaysia","1: Jean-Jules_Soucy","1: La_Baie,_Quebec","1: Expocentre","1: Moscow","1: Marco-city","1: Vitebsk","1: Belarus","1: Time_pyramid","1: Wemding","1: Germany","1: Shimizu_Mega-City_Pyramid","1: Quintino_Sella","1: Oropa","1: Khafra","1: Shaohao_Tomb","1: Qufu","1: China","1: United_Kingdom","1: Hanoi","1: Vietnam","1: New_Orleans","1: Bursa,_Turkey","1: Turkey","1: Bosnian_pyramid","1: List_of_megalithic_sites","1: Pyramid_power","1: Tomb","1: Triadic_pyramid","1: Ziggurat"]}
