The term \"get rich quick\" has been used to describe shady\ninvestments since at least the early 1900s.

Get rich quick schemes\noften assert that wealth can be obtained by working at home. Legal and quasi-\nlegal get-rich-quick schemes are frequently advertised on infomercials and in\nmagazines and newspapers. Illegal schemes or scams are often advertised through\nspam or cold calling. Some forms of advertising for these schemes market books\nor compact discs about getting rich quick rather than asking participants to\ninvest directly in a concrete scheme.\n\nIt is clearly possible to get rich quickly if one is prepared to accept very\nhigh levels of risk â€” this is the premise of the gambling industry.\nHowever, gambling offers the near-certainty of completely losing the original\nstake over the long term, even if it offers regular wins along the way. Economic\ntheory states that risk-free opportunities for profit are not stable, because\nthey will quickly be exploited by arbitrageurs.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Get-rich-quick_scheme","recorded":1362540537,"links":15,"instances":["electronic","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Finance fraud"],"headings":["Illegal get-rich-quick schemes","Online get-rich-quick schemes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["return","finance"],["spam","electronic"]],"members":["spam","return"],"related":["Return_(finance)","Investment","Risk","Wealth","Infomercial","Scams","Spam_(electronic)","Cold_calling","Compact_disc","Gambling","Arbitrage","Pyramid_scheme","Matrix_scheme","Ponzi_scheme","Advance_fee_fraud","CD","Ponzi","Google","Investment","Foreign_exchange_fraud","Make_Money_Fast","Confidence_trick","Ripoff","There_ain't_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch","Land_banking"]}
