{"cursor":"6032","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Poloxamers' are nonionic triblock copolymers composed of a central hydrophobic\nchain of polyoxypropylene (poly(propylene oxide)) flanked by two hydrophilic\nchains of polyoxyethylene (poly(ethylene oxide)). The word \"poloxamer\" was\ncoined by the inventor, Irving Schmolka, who received the patent for these\nmaterials in 1973. Poloxamers are also known by the trade names\n'Synperonics', 'Pluronics'  and 'Kolliphor'.\n\nBecause the lengths of the polymer blocks can be customized, many different\npoloxamers exist that have slightly different properties. For the generic term\n\"poloxamer\", these copolymers are commonly named with the letter \"P\" (for\npoloxamer) followed by three digits, the first two digits x 100 give the\napproximate molecular mass of the polyoxypropylene core, and the last digit x 10\ngives the percentage polyoxyethylene content (e.g., P407 = Poloxamer with a\npolyoxypropylene molecular mass of 4,000 g/mol and a 70% polyoxyethylene\ncontent) . For the Pluronic tradename, coding of these copolymers starts with a\nletter to define its physical form at room temperature (L = liquid, P = paste, F\n= flake (solid)) followed by two or three digits, The first digit (two digits in\na three-digit number) in the numerical designation, multiplied by 300, indicates\nthe approximate molecular weight of the hydrophobe; and the last digit x 10\ngives the percentage polyoxyethylene content (e.g., L61 = Pluronic with a\npolyoxypropylene molecular mass of 1,800 g/mol and a 10% polyoxyethylene\ncontent). In the example given, poloxamer 181 (P181) = Pluronic L61.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Poloxamer","recorded":1362512202,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-ionic surfactants","Polymers"],"headings":["Uses of poloxamers","Biological Effect Of Poloxamers","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Copolymers","Hydrophobic","Polypropylene_glycol","Hydrophilic","Polyethylene_glycol","Poloxamer_407","Polyoxyethylene","Amphiphilic","Surfactant","Hydrophobic","Miscibility","Micelle"]}
