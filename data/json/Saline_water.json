{"cursor":"2805","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Saline water' is a general term for water that contains a significant\nconcentration of dissolved salts (NaCl). The concentration is usually expressed\nin parts per million (ppm) of salt.\n\nWater that is saline contains significant amounts (referred to as\n\"concentrations\") of dissolved salts. In this case, the concentration is the\namount (by weight) of salt in water, as expressed in \"parts per million\" (ppm).\nIf water has a concentration of 10,000 ppm of dissolved salts, then one percent\n(10,000 divided by 1,000,000) of the weight of the water comes from dissolved\nsalts. The salinity concentration level used by United States Geological Survey\nclassifies saline water in three categories. Slightly saline water contains\naround 1,000 to 3,000 ppm. Moderately saline water contains roughly 3,000 to\n10,000 ppm. Highly saline water has around 10,000 to 35,000 ppm of salt.\nSeawater has a salinity of roughly 35,000 ppm, equivalent to 35 g/L.\n\nSome industries make use of saline water, such as mining and thermoelectric-\npower.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Saline_water","recorded":1362688852,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf"],"categories":["Liquid water"],"headings":["Use in the United States","Properties","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Icon_river_tributary_R.svg/30px-Icon_river_tributary_R.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Water","Solvation","Salt","Sodium_chloride","Parts_per_million","United_States_Geological_Survey","Seawater","Salinity","United_States","California","Florida","Maryland","Thermal_conductivity","Salinometer"]}
