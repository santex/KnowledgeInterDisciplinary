He is best known for his book [[The Decline of the West]] (Der\nUntergang des Abendlandes), published in 1918 and 1922, where he proposed a new\ntheory, according to which the lifespan of civilizations is limited and\nultimately they decay. In 1920 Spengler produced [[Preussentum und\nSozialismus|Prussiandom and Socialism]] (PreuÃentum und Sozialismus), which\nargued for an organic, nationalist version of socialism and authoritarianism. He\nwrote extensively throughout World War I and the interwar period, and supported\nGerman hegemony in Europe. Some National Socialists (such as Goebbels) held\nSpengler as an intellectual precursor but he was ostracised after 1933 for his\npessimism about Germany's and Europe's future, his refusal to support Nazi ideas\nof racial superiority, and his critical work [[The Hour of Decision (book)|The\nHour of Decision]].\n","linknr":608,"url":"Oswald_Spengler","recorded":1362480940,"links":70,"instances":["magazine","school"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1880 births","1936 deaths","20th-century German people","20th-century philosophers","20th-century historians","People from Blankenburg (Harz)","People from Brunswick","German philosophers","Theorists on Western civilization","Philosophers of technology","German historians","Cultural historians","Supersessionism","Antisemitism in Germany","Philosophers of history"],"headings":["Biography","Publication of ''The Decline of the West''","Aftermath","Final years","Influence","Spengler's works","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R06610%2C_Oswald_Spengler.jpg/180px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-R06610%2C_Oswald_Spengler.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Oswald_Spengler_signature.PNG/128px-Oswald_Spengler_signature.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png/180px-Plato%2C_Confucius%2C_Avicenna.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/10px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg/70px-DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg/26px-DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gymnasium","school"],["american_renaissance","magazine"],["american_renaissance","magazine"]],"members":["american_renaissance","gymnasium"],"related":["Western_philosophy","Blankenburg_am_Harz","Munich","Philosophy_of_history","Germans","Historian","Philosopher","Mathematics","Science","Art","Spengler's_civilization_model","Civilization","Interwar_period","Hegemony","National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party","Goebbels","Ostracism","Pessimism","Blankenburg_am_Harz","Duchy_of_Brunswick","German_Empire","Harz_mountains","Petite_bourgeoisie","Mining","Post_office","Bureaucrat","Migraine","Anxiety","Halle,_Saxony-Anhalt","Gymnasium_(school)","Greek_language","Latin","Natural_science","Poetry","Drama","Goethe","Nietzsche","University_of_Munich","Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","University_of_Halle","Literature","Fine_art","Doctoral_thesis","Heraclitus","Academia","Ph.D.","Nervous_breakdown","Saarbrücken","Düsseldorf","Hamburg","History_of_Germany","Munich","Agadir_Crisis","Otto_Seeck","World_War_I","Treaty_of_Versailles","Economic_depression","Hyperinflation","University_of_Göttingen","Thomas_Mann","Schopenhauer","Max_Weber","Karl_Popper","Eduard_Meyer","Mysticism","Positivism","Neo-Kantianism","Harry_Graf_Kessler","Nietzsche","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Social_cycle_theory","Ernst_Cassirer","Arnold_J._Toynbee","Socialism","Marxism","Inflation","Reichswehr","Hans_von_Seeckt","Leadership","Technology","Industrialism","Hitler","Paul_von_Hindenburg","Heldentenor","Hero","Alfred_Rosenberg","Joseph_Goebbels","National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party","Nazism","Liberalism","Anti-Semitism","Ludwig_van_Beethoven","Molière","Shakespeare","Turkey","Iran","Hindu","Harz_mountains","Reich","Myocardial_infarction","VE_Day","G._K._Chesterton","Arnold_J._Toynbee","Herman_Kahn","Beat_Generation","William_S._Burroughs","Jack_Kerouac","Allen_Ginsberg","Georg_Henrik_von_Wright","Francis_Parker_Yockey","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Northrop_Frye","Robertson_Davies","Magnus_Eisengrim","Middle_Ages","Samuel_P._Huntington","Clash_of_civilizations","James_Blish","Charles_Lindbergh","Paleoconservative","Samuel_T._Francis","American_Renaissance_(magazine)","American_Renaissance_(magazine)","Henry_Miller","John_dos_Passos","H.P._Lovecraft","F._Scott_Fitzgerald","Malcolm_Lowry","Oskar_Kokoschka","Wilhelm_Furtwängler","Fritz_Lang","Malcolm_X","David_P._Goldman","Manitoba","Gabrielle_Roy","Spengler's_civilization_model","Intermediate_Region","Arnold_J._Toynbee","Fernand_Braudel","Carroll_Quigley","Blankenburg_am_Harz","Munich"]}
