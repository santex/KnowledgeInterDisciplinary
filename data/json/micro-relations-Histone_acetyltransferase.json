DNA is wrapped around histones, and by\ntransferring an acetyl group to the histones, genes can be turned on and off.\nHistone acetylation increases gene expression.\n\nIn general, histone acetylation is linked to transcriptional activation and\nassociated with euchromatin. When it was first discovered, it was thought that\nacetylation of lysine neutralizes the positive charge normally present, thus\nreducing affinity between histone and (negatively charged) DNA, which renders\nDNA more accessible to transcription factors. Research has emerged, since, to\nshow that lysine acetylation and other posttranslational modifications of\nhistones generate binding sites for specific proteinâprotein interaction\ndomains, such as the acetyllysine-binding bromodomain. Histone\nacetyltransferases can also acetylate non-histone proteins, such as\ntranscription factors and nuclear receptors to facilitate gene expression.\n","linknr":929,"url":"Histone_acetyltransferase","recorded":1362481212,"links":24,"instances":["genetics","gene","coactivator","hiv"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transferases","EC 2.3.1","Epigenetics"],"headings":["HAT families","Overall structure","Catalytic mechanisms","Substrate binding and specificity","Regulation of HAT activity","Interaction with HDACs","Biological role","Clinical significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Relative_sizes_and_locations_of_important_domains_for_representative_HATs.png/220px-Relative_sizes_and_locations_of_important_domains_for_representative_HATs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Crystal_structure_of_Tetrahymena_Gcn5_with_bound_coenzyme_A_and_histone_H3_peptide.png/220px-Crystal_structure_of_Tetrahymena_Gcn5_with_bound_coenzyme_A_and_histone_H3_peptide.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Catalytic_mechanisms_of_GNAT_and_MYST_family_HATs..png/220px-Catalytic_mechanisms_of_GNAT_and_MYST_family_HATs..png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/HAT_transcription.png/220px-HAT_transcription.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mediator","coactivator"],["activator","genetics"],["tat","hiv"],["myb","gene"]],"members":["activator","myb","mediator","tat"],"related":["Enzyme","Acetylation","Lysine","Amino_acid","Histone","Acetyl_group","Coenzyme_A","DNA_transcription","Euchromatin","Acetylation","Electric_charge","Transcription_factors","Posttranslational_modification","Bromodomain","Cell_nucleus","Histone_acetylation_and_deacetylation","Bromodomain","P300-CBP_coactivator_family","TAF1","Cytoplasm","Nucleosome","Histone_deacetylase","Chromatin","HAT1","PCAF","ELP3","ITGA2B","Activating_transcription_factor_2","Histone_H2B","Histone_H3","Histone_H4","Acetyl-CoA","RNA_polymerase_II_holoenzyme","MYST3","KAT5","KAT5","MYST1","MYST4","MYST2","Zinc_finger","Chromodomain","Histone_H2A","Oncogene","Dosage_compensation","Origin_recognition_complex","CLOCK","Animal","RNA_polymerase_III","GTF3C1","GTF3C2","GTF3C4","Fungus","Transcription_factor_II_D","ARNTL","Nuclear_receptor_coactivator_1","Nuclear_receptor_coactivator_3","Nuclear_receptor_coactivator_2","Mediator_(coactivator)","Beta_sheet","Alpha_helix","Methyllysine","Vise","Ternary_complex","Ping-pong_mechanism","ASF1_like_histone_chaperone","Telomere","Activator_(genetics)","General_transcription_factor","Polyamine","Protein_kinase","High-mobility_group","HMGN2","HMGA1","P53","MyoD","E2F","Tat_(HIV)","Transcription_factor_II_E","Transcription_factor_II_F","CIITA","NF-κB","TAL1","NeuroD","Ccaat-enhancer-binding_proteins","IRF2","IRF7","YY1","KLF13","EVI1","ETV1","Androgen_receptor","C-myc","GATA2","Retinoblastoma_protein","Ku70","Adenovirus_early_region_1A","HMGB1","HMGN1","MYB_(gene)","GATA1","KLF1","TCF/LEF_family","KLF5","FOXO1","MEF2C","SRY","GATA4","Hepatocyte_nuclear_factors","HMGB2","STAT3","Estrogen_receptor_alpha","GATA3","P73","Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_7","Importin_α","Hepatitis_D","Beta-catenin","NRIP1","Proliferating_cell_nuclear_antigen","Flap_structure-specific_endonuclease_1","Thymine-DNA_glycosylase","Werner_syndrome_ATP-dependent_helicase","STAT6","RUNX1","CREB","C-jun","NFE2","Sterol_regulatory_element-binding_protein","Sp3_transcription_factor","BCL6","Hepatocyte_nuclear_factors","FOXO4","Genome","Histone_methylation","Chromatin","DNA","Cell_nucleus","DNA_replication","DNA_repair","Transcription","Euchromatin","Heterochromatin","Histone","Nucleosome","Acetyl","Lysine","Post-translational_modification","Histone_code","Bromodomain","Epigenetic","Huntington’s_disease","Huntingtin","Neurodegeneration","Chromatin_remodeling","Apoptosis","Garcinia_indica","Mangosteen","HeLa","Non-homologous_end_joining","Radiosensitizer","Histone-modifying_enzymes","Histone_deacetylase","Histone_methyltransferase","RNA_polymerase_control_by_chromatin_structure","Acetyltransferase"]}
