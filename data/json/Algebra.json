See algebra (ring theory) and algebra over a field.\n* With a qualifier, there is the same distinction ** Without article, it means a\n  part of algebra, like linear algebra, elementary algebra, which is the part of\n  algebra that is taught in elementary courses of mathematics, or abstract\n  algebra, which is the part of algebra that is devoted to the study of the\n  algebraic structures for themselves. ** With an article, it means an abstract\n  structure, like a Lie algebra or an associative algebra. ** Frequently both\n  meanings exist for the same qualifier, like in the sentence: [[Commutative\n  algebra]] is the study of [[commutative ring]]s, that all are [[algebra (ring\n  theory)|commutative algebra]]s over the integers.\n* Sometimes \"algebra\" is also used to denote the operations and methods related\n  to algebra in the study of a structure that does not belong to algebra. For\n  example algebra of [[infinite series]] may denotes the methods for computing\n  with series without using the notions of infinite summation, limits and\n  convergence. \n\nThe adjective \"'algebraic'\" usually means relation to algebra, as in \"algebraic\nstructure\". For historical reasons, it may also mean relation with the roots of\npolynomial equations, like in algebraic number, algebraic extension or algebraic\nexpression.\n","recorded":1362123844,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"573","instances":["structure","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematician","gerolamo_cardano","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometric","mathematics","mathematician","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","ring_theory","mathematics","galois_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebra|","Article
