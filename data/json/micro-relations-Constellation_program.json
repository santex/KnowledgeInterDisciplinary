{"cursor":"55210","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Constellation Program' (abbreviated 'CxP') was a human spaceflight program\nwithin NASA, the space agency of the United States. The stated goals of the\nprogram were to gain significant experience in operating away from Earth's\nenvironment, develop technologies needed for opening the space frontier, and\nconducting fundamental science.\n\nConstellation began in response to the goals laid out in the Vision for Space\nExploration under NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. It had already begun\ndevelopment, under several proposals. After Sean O'Keefe's\nretirement, his replacement Michael D. Griffin ordered a complete review, termed\nthe Exploration Systems Architecture Study, which reshaped how NASA would pursue\nthe goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration. With the NASA\nAuthorization Act of 2005 formalizing the findings of the Exploration Systems\nArchitecture Study, work began on this revised Constellation Program to send\nastronauts first to the International Space Station, then to the Moon, and\nafterward to Mars and other destinations beyond.\n\nSubsequent to the findings of the Augustine Committee that the Constellation\nProgram could not be executed without very substantial increases in funding, on\nFebruary 1, 2010, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to cancel the\nprogram, effective with the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget, but later announced changes to the proposal in a major space\npolicy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010. Obama signed the\nNASA Authorization Act of 2010 on October 11 which brought the program to\nan end despite promises to fully fund space flight during his Presidential\ncampaign in 2008, but Constellation contracts remain in place until\nCongress acts to overturn the previous mandate. Testimony of Charles Bolden\nbefore the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, April 11, 2011 [http://www.space.com/9712-nasa-stuck-limbo-congress-\ntakes.html \"NASA Stuck in Limbo as New Congress Takes Over\"]. Space.com, January\n7, 2011. The program has been replaced by the U.S. National Space Policy\nof the Barack Obama administration. NASA announced that it had selected the\ndesign of the Space Launch System in September 2011.\n","linknr":936,"url":"Constellation_program","recorded":1362267923,"links":87,"instances":["nasa","rocket_stage","constellation_program","nasa","spacecraft"],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/trs.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/420990main_FY_201_%20Budget_Overview_1_Feb_2010.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/140649main_ESAS_full.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/140649main_ESAS_full.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/230922main_1stStage_FS.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/230922main_1stStage_FS.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080036820_2008036005.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09844.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09844.pdf","http://archive.gao.gov/f0302/096542.pdf","http://archive.gao.gov/f0302/096542.pdf","http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/1994.01.pdf","http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/1994.01.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/i_bds02.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/377875main_081109%20Human%20Rated%20Delta%20IV.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/377875main_081109%20Human%20Rated%20Delta%20IV.pdf"],"categories":["Exploration
