{"cursor":"9994","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of an immunostained section of a brain tumour. GFAP immunostain.]]\n 'Immunostaining' is a general term in biochemistry that applies to any use of\n an antibody-based method to detect a specific protein in a sample. The term\n immunostaining was originally used to refer to the immunohistochemical staining\n of tissue sections, as first described by Albert Coons in 1941. Now however, immunostaining encompasses a broad\n range of techniques used in histology, cell biology, and molecular biology that\n utilise antibody-based staining methods.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Immunostaining","recorded":1362481351,"links":16,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunology","Flow cytometry","Protein methods"],"headings":["Immunostaining techniques","Methodological overview","Applications of Immunostaining","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Anaplastic_astrocytoma_-_gfap_-_very_high_mag.jpg/350px-Anaplastic_astrocytoma_-_gfap_-_very_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["tissue","cell"],"related":["Glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein","Biochemistry","Antibody","Protein","Immunohistochemical_staining","Albert_Coons","Histology","Cell_biology","Molecular_biology","Tissue_(biology)","Immunocytochemistry","Cell_(biology)","Fluorescence","Dye","Enzyme","Peroxidase","Alkaline_phosphatase","Microscopy","Radioactive_decay","Chemical_element","Autoradiograph","Formaldehyde","Paraffin_wax","Liquid_nitrogen","Vibratome","Scientific_control","Protein_purification","Gel_electrophoresis","Chemical_synthesis","Artificial_membrane","Peroxidase","Chemiluminescence","Molecular_mass","Blood_plasma","Blood_serum","Electron_microscope","Transmission_electron_microscopy","Antibody","Protein","Epitope","Enzyme","Fluorophore","Biotin","Streptavidin","Electron_microscope","Atom","Horseradish","Peroxidase","Alkaline_phosphatase","Chemiluminescence","Fluorescence","Histopathology","Blocking_solution","Immunostaining_protocol","List_of_histologic_stains_that_aid_in_diagnosis_of_cutaneous_conditions","Cutaneous_conditions_with_immunofluorescence_findings"]}
