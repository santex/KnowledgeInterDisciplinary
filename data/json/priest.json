      "text" : "{{Multiple issues\n | refimprove=May 2011 original research=September 2011 primarysources=May 2011\n}}\n\nA 'priest' is a person authorised to perform the sacred rituals of a religion,\nespecially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or multiple deities. They\nalso have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular,\nrites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or\nposition is the 'priesthood', a term which also may apply to such persons\ncollectively.\n\nPriests and priestesses have existed since the earliest of times and in the\nsimplest societies. They exist in all or some branches of Judaism, Christianity,\nShintoism, Hinduism and many other religions. They are generally regarded as\nhaving positive contact with the deity or deities of the religion to which they\nsubscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals\nof the religion. Priests are leaders to whom other believers will often turn for\nadvice on spiritual matters.\n\nIn many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling\nout any other career. In other cases it is a part-time role. For example in the\nearly history of Iceland the chieftains were titled [[goði]], a word meaning\n\"priest\". As seen in the saga of Hrafnkell Freysgoði, however, being a priest\nconsisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the Norse gods and\ngoddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.\n\nIn some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human\nchoice. In Judaism the priesthood is inherited in familial lines.\n",
