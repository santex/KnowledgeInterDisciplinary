The field\nof study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology. A morpheme is not\nidentical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a\nmorpheme may, or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is a\nfreestanding unit of meaning. Every word comprises one or more morphemes.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Morpheme","recorded":1362565566,"links":80,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Units of linguistic morphology"],"headings":["Classification of morphemes","Morphological analysis","Changing definitions of morpheme","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["root","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["marker","linguistics"],["alternation","linguistics"]],"members":["marker","alternation","derivation","root","morphology"],"related":["Root_(linguistics)","Allomorph","Linguistics","Semantics","Morphology_(linguistics)","Word","Free_morpheme","Bound_morpheme","Free_morpheme","Lexeme","Bound_morpheme","Root_(linguistics)","Affix","Prefix","Suffix","Cranberry_morpheme","Derivation_(linguistics)","Part_of_speech","Noun","Inflection","Verb","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_number","Allomorph","Pronunciation","Marker_(linguistics)","Regular_noun","Grammatical_number","Natural_language_processing","Japanese_language","Chinese_language","Part-of-speech_tagging","Generative_grammar","Syntax","Lexical_functional_grammar","Distributed_morphology","Radical_Minimalism","Nanosyntax","Nanosyntax","Event_semantics","Denotation","Null_morpheme","Spell-out","Alternation_(linguistics)","Hybrid_word","Morphological_parsing","Theoretical_linguistics","Word_stem","Floating_tone","Greek_morphemes","Morphophonology"]}
