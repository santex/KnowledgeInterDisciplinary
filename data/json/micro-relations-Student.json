In\n some nations, the English term (or its cognate in another language) is reserved\n for those who attend university, while a schoolchild under the age of eighteen\n is called a 'pupil' in English (or an equivalent in other languages), although\n in the United States a person enrolled in grades Kâ12 is often called a\n student. In its widest use, student is used for anyone who is learning.\n","linknr":414,"url":"Student","recorded":1362666503,"links":92,"instances":["scottish","education","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Students|"],"headings":["International variations","Mature students","Student pranks","Other terms","Idiomatic use","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Math_lecture_at_TKK.JPG/220px-Math_lecture_at_TKK.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Village_school_in_Northern_Bahr_el_Ghazal%2C_Sudan.jpg/170px-Village_school_in_Northern_Bahr_el_Ghazal%2C_Sudan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Nh-students.JPG/220px-Nh-students.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Students_in_Hanoi%2C_Vietnam.jpg/220px-Students_in_Hanoi%2C_Vietnam.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/MiamiClassroom.jpg/220px-MiamiClassroom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/23px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/18px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Wikiversity-logo-en.svg/25px-Wikiversity-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/25px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/21px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/24px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg/25px-Wikibooks-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Wikivoyage-logo.svg/25px-Wikivoyage-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["k–12","education"],["higher","scottish"],["state","united_states"]],"members":["higher","state"],"related":["Linear_algebra","University","K–12_(education)","Learning","Singapore","Bachelor's_Degree","Australia","Kindergarten","New_South_Wales","South_Australia","Western_Australia","Queensland","Technical_and_further_education","New_Zealand","Classe_préparatoire_aux_grandes_écoles","Abitur","Republic_of_Ireland","Junior_Certificate","Irish_Leaving_Certificate","Trinity_College_Dublin","Sophomore","Orientation_week","Liceo_classico","Liceo_scientifico","United_Kingdom","American_English","Wales","Scotland","Higher_(Scottish)","Advanced_Highers","University_of_St_Andrews","Kindergarten","Sixth_form_college","Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","Kindergarten","Pre-kindergarten","Education_in_Ontario","Ontario_Academic_Credit","Education_in_Quebec","College_education_in_Quebec","United_States","Kindergarten","Preschool","High_school","Freshman","College","University","High_school","Folk_etymology","Wise_fool","Sophism","College","University","High_school","Super_senior","College","Master’s_degree","Doctorate","Vocational_school","Tertiary_education","Course_of_study","Postgraduate","Middle_Ages","Traffic_cone","Mascot","Grade_retention","Primary_school","Secondary_school","Sixth-form","United_States_military_academies","Freshman","Sophomore","Literal_and_figurative_language","Album","Politician","Sportsperson","Professional_sports_team","Junior_senator","State_(United_States)","Dormitory","Student_activism","School_bullying","Bullying_in_academia","Bullying_in_teaching","Freshman_15","International_student","Student_orientation","School_counselor","Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States","Study_skills","Tutor","Studentification","University_student_retention"]}
