Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms).\nThe number of ordered elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the\nsequence. Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear\nmultiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a\nsequence can be defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally\nordered set, such as the natural numbers.\n\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and\n'Y' last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2,\n3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid\nsequence. Sequences can be [[finite set|finite]], as in this example, or\n[[Infinite set|infinite]], such as the sequence of all even positive integers\n(2, 4, 6,...). Finite sequences are sometimes known as strings or words and\ninfinite sequences as streams. The empty sequence&nbsp;(&nbsp;) is included in\nmost notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.\n. It is, however, bounded.]]\n","title":"Sequence","headings":["Examples and notation","Definition and basic properties","Limits and convergence","Series","Use in other fields of mathematics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Natural_numbers","4: Limit_of_a_sequence","4: Real_analysis","3: Countable","3: Prime_numbers","2: Mathematics","2: Totally_ordered","2: Integer","2: Real_numbers","2: Complex_analysis","2: Topological_space","2: Group_ring","2: Cauchy_product","2: Metric_spaces","2: Vector_space","2: Function_space","2: Order_topology#Ordinal-indexed_sequences","1: Even_and_odd_numbers","1: Positive_and_negative_numbers","1: Differential_equations","1: Divisor","1: Number_theory","1: Fibonacci_numbers","1: Ban_number","1: Rational_numbers","1: Complex_numbers","1: Decimal","1: Pi","1: Index_set","1: Infinity","1: Odd_number","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Well-defined","1: Fibonacci_sequence","1: Exact_sequence","1: Subset","1: Topology","1: Uncountable","1: Directed_set","1: N-tuple","1: Integers","1: Monotonic_function","1: Coprime","1: Lagged_Fibonacci_generator","1: Complex_plane","1: Squeeze_Theorem","1: Product_space","1: Limit_ordinal","1: Automata_theory","1: Finite_state_machine","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Natural_number","1: Logarithm","1: Large_enough","1: Complex_number","1: Numerical_digit","1: Finite_set","1: Theoretical_computer_science","1: Bit","1: Cantor_space","1: Formal_language","1: Shortlex_order","1: Complexity_class","1: Positional_number_system","1: Linear_subspace","1: Free_monoid","1: Monoid","1: Free_semigroup","1: ±1-sequence","1: Arithmetic_progression","1: Cauchy_sequence","1: Farey_sequence","1: Fibonacci_number","1: Geometric_progression","1: Look-and-say_sequence","1: Thue–Morse_sequence","1: Tuple","1: Set_theory","1: On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences","1: Permutation","1: Recurrence_relation","1: Sequence_space"]}
