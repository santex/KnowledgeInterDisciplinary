This process is one aspect of homeostasis: a dynamic state of\nstability between an animal's internal environment and its external environment\n(the study of such processes in zoology has been called ecophysiology or\nphysiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature\nand it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia\noccurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant\ntemperatures of approximately , and any prolonged exposure (longer than a few\nhours) at this temperature and up to around death is almost inevitable. Humans\nmay also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is\nsustained above for six hours. http://www.sciencedaily.com/-\nreleases/2010/05/100504155413.htm http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552.full Published online before\nprint May 3, 2010, PNAS May 25, 2010 vol. 107 no. 21 9552-9555 The\nopposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is\nknown as hypothermia.\n\nWhereas an organism that thermoregulates is one that keeps its core body\ntemperature within certain limits, a 'thermoconformer' is subject to changes\nin body temperature according to changes in the temperature outside of its\nbody at a certain temperature. It was not until the introduction of\nthermometers that any exact data on the temperature of animals could be\nobtained. It was then found that local differences were present, since heat\nproduction and heat loss vary considerably in different parts of the body,\nalthough the circulation of the blood tends to bring about a mean temperature\nof the internal parts. Hence it is important to identify the parts of the body\nthat most closely reflect the temperature of the internal organs. Also, for\nsuch results to be comparable, the measurements must be conducted under\ncomparable conditions. The rectum has traditionally been considered to reflect\nmost accurately the temperature of internal parts, or in some cases of sex or\nspecies, the vagina, uterus or bladder.\n\nOccasionally the temperature of the urine as it leaves the urethra may be of\nuse. More often the temperature is taken in the mouth, axilla, ear or groin.\n\nSome animals undergo one of various forms of dormancy where the thermoregulation\nprocess temporarily allows the body temperature to drop, thereby conserving\nenergy. Examples include hibernating bears and torpor in bats.\n","linknr":678,"url":"Thermoregulation","recorded":1362901026,"links":65,"instances":["landform","surgeon","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.me.berkeley.edu/ME212/lec6/i_Plants_Thermoregulation.pdf","http://www.me.berkeley.edu/ME212/lec6/i_Plants_Thermoregulation.pdf","http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe3/MG/publis/thermo.pdf","http://www.edb.ups-tlse.fr/equipe3/MG/publis/thermo.pdf","http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2004/600.pdf","http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2004/600.pdf","http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/33/3/225.pdf","http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/reprint/33/3/225.pdf","http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/78/5/603.full.pdf"],"categories":["Human
