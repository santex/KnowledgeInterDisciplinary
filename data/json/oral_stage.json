      "text" : "\n: An infant feeding at his mother’s breast.]]\nIn Freudian psychoanalysis, the term 'oral stage' denotes the first psychosexual\ndevelopment stage where in the mouth of the infant is his or her primary\nerogenous zone. Spanning the life period from birth to the age of 21 months, the\noral stage is the first of the five Freudian psychosexual development stages:\n(i) the Oral, (ii) the Anal, (iii) the Phallic, (iv) the Latent, and (v) the\nGenital. Moreover, because it is the infant’s first human relationship —\nbiological (nutritive) and psychological (emotional) — its duration depends upon\nthe child-rearing mores of the mother’s society. Sociologically, the duration of\ninfantile nursing is determined normatively, because the oral stage is\nespecially important in societies that consider the stomach to be the seat of\nthe emotions, as among some African and south-west Pacific Ocean societies that\nperceive the oral stage as medicinal.<ref>Mother Food for Breastfeeding Mothers,\nby Hilary Jacobson</ref>\n",
