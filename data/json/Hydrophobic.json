Aryeh Ben-Na'im\nHydrophobic Interaction Plenum Press, New York, ISBN 0-306-40222-X\n\nHydrophobic molecules tend to be non-polar and, thus, prefer other neutral\nmolecules and non-polar solvents. Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster\ntogether, forming micelles. Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high\ncontact angle.\n\nExamples of hydrophobic molecules include the alkanes, oils, fats, and greasy\nsubstances in general. Hydrophobic materials are used for oil removal from\nwater, the management of oil spills, and chemical separation processes to remove\nnon-polar substances from polar compounds.\n\nHydrophobic is often used interchangeably with lipophilic, \"fat-loving.\"\nHowever, the two terms are not synonymous. While hydrophobic substances are\nusually lipophilic, there are exceptionsâsuch as the silicones and\nfluorocarbons.\n","linknr":578,"url":"Hydrophobic","recorded":1362511892,"links":61,"instances":["chemistry","matter","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://facstaff.unca.edu/jschmelt/oilwater.pdf","http://facstaff.unca.edu/jschmelt/oilwater.pdf","http://members.ziggo.nl/scslai/lotus.pdf","http://members.ziggo.nl/scslai/lotus.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical properties","Intermolecular forces","Underwater diving physics"],"headings":["Chemical background","Superhydrophobicity","Research and development","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/150_deg_water_contact_angle.png/220px-150_deg_water_contact_angle.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Dew_2.jpg/220px-Dew_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Drops_I.jpg/220px-Drops_I.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/DropConnectionAngel.jpg/220px-DropConnectionAngel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Contact_angle.svg/400px-Contact_angle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Microstruct_superhydrophobic.png/400px-Microstruct_superhydrophobic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/b/dab027bdaf55d3189aa31670edaf7eb2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/d/e/6de16eda8d470ad492f7cb2d38e494bb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/4/d5427947c3badca1c18252ff27911224.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/0/f/30f0569737c98c20eef60bde268cfea6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/3/fc347f75d7f9889827a3fd1b54f96431.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/a/b8a423e5801cfe8490e1f885ec562f4e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/a/70a39150ef65c0708d72be4d48b3b43f.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["dimer","chemistry"],["phase","matter"],["suspension","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","phase","suspension"],"related":["Plant_cuticle","Superhydrophobic","Chemistry","Attic_Greek","Molecule","Water","Non-polar","Solvent","Micelles","Contact_angle","Molecules","Alkanes","Oil","Fat","Lipophilic","Silicones","Fluorocarbon","Entropy","Hydrogen_bond","Accessible_surface_area","Phase_(matter)","Contact_angle","Lotus_effect","Goniometer","Nanotechnology","Superhydrophobic","Dimer_(chemistry)","Cassie's_law","Phase_(matter)","Lotus_effect","Bionics","Nanotechnology","Nanopin_film","Vanadium_pentoxide","Superhydrophilicity","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Suspension_(chemistry)","Inkjet_printer","Nanometer","Electron-hole_pair","Hydrophilicity","Silica","Titanium_dioxide","Sol-gel","Polyethylene","Amphiphile","Froth_flotation","Hydrophobic_effect","Hydrophobicity_scales"]}
