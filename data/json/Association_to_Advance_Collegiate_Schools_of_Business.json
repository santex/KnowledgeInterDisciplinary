The first\naccreditations took place in 1919. The current mission is to advance\nquality management education worldwide through accreditation, thought\nleadership, and value-added services. [http://www.aacsb.edu/ AACSB\nHomepage] It is regarded as the benchmark for business school quality\namong the academic community. In 1991, the AACSB adopted new\naccreditation standards that were more flexible.\n\nFor many years, only North American business schools were accredited by AACSB\n(at that time, AACSB stood for 'American Association of Collegiate Schools of\nBusiness'). It was an early supporter of internationalizing business\neducation. The first school outside North America to be accredited\nwas the top French business school ESSEC, in 1997. In 2009, AACSB opened its\nfirst regional headquarters in\nSingapore.
