He was born in Goindval, Punjab, India, the youngest son of Guru Ram Das\nSahib Ji and Bibi Bhani Ji, the daughter of Guru Amar Das Sahib Ji.\nHe became Guru Ji of the Sikhs on 1 September 1581 after the death of His Father\nGuru Ram Das Sahib Ji. Guru Arjan Dev Ji died in Lahore, Punjab, (now in\nPakistan). Before His death, He passed the light of Guruship to His Son Guru Har\nGobind Sahib Ji as the next Guru Ji of the Sikhs.\n\nGuru Arjun Dev Ji lived as the Guru Ji of Sikhism for a quarter of a century and\naccomplished much during his service to humanity. Guru Arjun completed the\nconstruction of '[[Amritsar]]' and founded other cities such as '[[Taran\nTaran]]' and '[[Kartarpur, India|Kartarpur]]'. He constructed a Baoli at Lahore.\n'The most important work of Guru Arjun Dev Ji was the compilation of [[Adi\nGranth]].' He collected all the work of the 'first four Gurus' and dictated it\nin the form of verses in 1604. It is, perhaps, the only script which still\nexists in the form first published (a hand-written manuscript) by the Guru. The\nintegrity of the original writings within the Adi Granth is especially\nnoted.\n\nGuru Arjun organised the '[[Masand]]' system, a group of representatives who\ntaught and spread the teachings of the Gurus and also received the\n'[[Dasvand]]', partial offering of a Sikh's income (in money, goods or service)\nthat Sikhs paid to support the building of Gurdwara Sahib, the Guru ka Langars\n(shared communal kitchens) originally intended to share with sense of love,\nrespect and equality, still an important element today in any Gurdwara. The\nLangars were open to any visitors and were designed from the start to stress the\nidea of equality and a casteless society. The land that Amritsar is built upon\nis believed to be a jagir (estates gifted to individuals under the Mughal system\nwhich included one or more villages and often a portion of the crops produced on\nthe land) given as a gift by the '[[Emperor Akbar]]', who was impressed by the\npractice, after sharing a meal in the Guru's communal kitchen, seated on the\nfloor among commoners.\n","linknr":375,"url":"Arjan_Dev","recorded":1362899275,"links":37,"instances":["sikhism","pakistan"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Indian spiritual writers","Sikh gurus","Sikh martyrs","1563 births","1606 deaths","Punjabi people","1563 in India"],"headings":["Life","Martyrdom","Criticism","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Khanda.png/24px-Khanda.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Guru_Arjan_Dev.jpg/220px-Guru_Arjan_Dev.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Khanda.png/24px-Khanda.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["punjab","india"],["punjab","pakistan"],["langar","sikhism"]],"members":["langar","punjab"],"related":["Sikhism","Punjab,_India","India","Lahore","Pakistan","Guru_Ram_Das","Guru_Hargobind","Sikh","Ten_Sikh_Gurus","Goindval","Punjab_(India)","India","Guru_Ram_Das","Lahore","Punjab_(Pakistan)","Pakistan","Guru_Hargobind","Sikhism","Lahore","Gurdwara","Langar_(Sikhism)","Sikh_Gurus","Guru_Nanak","Guru_Nanak","Adi_Granth","Saints","Holy","Nanak","Jahangir","Lahore","Khusrau","Jahangir","Akbar","Khusrau_Mirza","Lahore","Khusrau_Mirza","Mughal_Emperor","Jahangir","Sikh","Mughal_Empire","Punjab,_India","Lahore","Pakistan"]}
