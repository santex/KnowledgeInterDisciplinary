{"cursor":"36538","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'innate immune system', also known as 'non-specific immune system' and first\nline of defense, comprises the cells and mechanisms that\ndefend the host from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner. This\nmeans that the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in\na generic way, but unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-\nlasting or protective immunity to the host. Innate\nimmune systems provide immediate defense against infection, and are found in all\nclasses of plant and animal life.\n\nThe innate immune system is thought to constitute an evolutionarily older\ndefense strategy, and is the dominant immune system found in plants, fungi,\ninsects, and in primitive multicellular organisms. .\n\nThe major functions of the vertebrate innate immune system include: *Recruiting\nimmune cells to sites of infection, through the production of chemical factors,\nincluding specialized chemical mediators, called cytokines. *Activation of the\ncomplement cascade to identify bacteria, activate cells and to promote clearance\nof dead cells or antibody complexes. *The identification and removal of foreign\nsubstances present in organs, tissues, the blood and lymph, by specialised white\nblood cells. *Activation of the adaptive immune system through a process known\nas antigen presentation. *Acting as a physical and chemical barrier to\ninfectious agents.\n","linknr":712,"url":"Innate_immune_system","recorded":1362512659,"links":40,"instances":["biology","medical","medical"],"pdf":["http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/2/136.pdf","http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/2/136.pdf","http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~soma/biosec/readings/sharkimmu-sciam-Nov1996.pdf","http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf","http://www.yeacrops.com/Crop%20Protection%20Article.pdf"],"categories":["Immune
