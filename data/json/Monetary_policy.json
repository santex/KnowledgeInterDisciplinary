{"cursor":"49676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n\n}}\n\n\n'Monetary policy' is the process by which the monetary authority of a country\ncontrol the supply of money, often targeting a rate of interest for the purpose\nof promoting economic growth and stability. The official goals usually\ninclude relatively stable prices and low unemployment. Monetary theory provides\ninsight into how to craft optimal monetary policy. It is referred to as either\nbeing expansionary or contractionary, where an expansionary policy increases the\ntotal supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual, and contractionary\npolicy expands the money supply more slowly than usual or even shrinks it.\nExpansionary policy is traditionally used to try to combat unemployment in a\nrecession by lowering interest rates in the hope that easy credit will entice\nbusinesses into expanding. Contractionary policy is intended to slow inflation\nin order to avoid the resulting distortions and deterioration of asset values.\n\nMonetary policy differs from fiscal policy, which refers to taxation, government\nspending, and associated borrowing.\n","linknr":617,"url":"Monetary_policy","recorded":1362901257,"links":78,"instances":["finance","finance","currency","finance","economics","economics","government","finance","economics","finance","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/ForderComment1December2004.pdf","http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/ForderComment1December2004.pdf","http://michael.bordo.googlepages.com/TheHistoryofMonetaryPolicy.pdf","http://www.hilbertcorporation.com.ar/amonetaryandfiscaleconomicstability.pdf","http://www.hilbertcorporation.com.ar/amonetaryandfiscaleconomicstability.pdf","http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/07/05/Nelson.pdf","http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/07/05/Nelson.pdf","http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202l.pdf","http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202l.pdf"],"categories":["Monetary
