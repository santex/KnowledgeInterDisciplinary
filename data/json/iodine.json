      "text" : "\n\n'Iodine' is a chemical element with symbol 'I' and atomic number 53. The name is\nfrom Greek ioeidēs, meaning violet or purple, due to the color of elemental\niodine vapor.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary, s.v.\n[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=iodine iodine]. Retrieved 2012-02-\n07.</ref>\n\nIodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition, and industrially in\nthe production of acetic acid and certain polymers. Iodine's relatively high\natomic number, low toxicity, and ease of attachment to organic compounds have\nmade it a part of many X-ray contrast materials in modern medicine. Iodine has\nonly one stable isotope. A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in\nmedical applications.\n\nIodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly water-soluble iodide ion,\nI<sup>−</sup>, which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools. Like the other\nhalogens, free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I<sub>2</sub>, and\nthen only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free\noxygen. In the universe and on Earth, iodine's high atomic number makes it a\nrelatively rare element. However, its presence in ocean water has given it a\nrole in biology. It is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in\nbiological functions (only tungsten, employed in enzymes by a few species of\nbacteria, is heavier). Iodine's rarity in many soils, due to initial low\nabundance as a crust-element, and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater,\nhas led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human\npopulations. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the\nleading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities.<ref name=\"mcneil\"></ref>\n\nIodine is required by higher animals, which use it to synthesize thyroid\nhormones, which contain the element. Because of this function, radioisotopes of\niodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine.\nIf inhaled, the radioisotope iodine-131, which has a high fission product yield,\nconcentrates in the thyroid, but is easily remedied with non-radioactive\npotassium iodide treatment.\n",
