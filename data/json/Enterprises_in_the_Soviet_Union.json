An enterprise was the general equivalent of the legal entity\nof \"company\" prominent outside of the Eastern-bloc economies. Enterprises and\nproduction units engaged in economic activities that are generally undertaken by\nbusiness-enterprises in capitalist systems.\n\nAn enterprise often included production units, or associations of production\nunits called \"Production associations\", organized around the production and\ndistribution of a single sector or product.
