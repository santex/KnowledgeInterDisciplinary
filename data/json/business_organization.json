      "text" : "\n\n\n'Companies law' (or the law of 'business associations') is the field of law\nconcerning companies and other business organizations. This includes\ncorporations, partnerships and other associations which usually carry on some\nform of economic or charitable activity. The most prominent kind of company,\nusually referred to as a \"corporation\", is a \"juristic person\", i.e. it has\nseparate legal personality, and those who invest money into the business have\nlimited liability for any losses the company makes, governed by corporate law.\nThe largest companies are usually publicly listed on stock exchanges around the\nworld. Even single individuals, also known as sole traders may incorporate\nthemselves and limit their liability in order to carry on a business. All\ndifferent forms of companies depend on the particular law of the particular\ncountry in which they reside.\n\nThe law of business organizations originally derived from the common law of\nEngland, but has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law\ncountries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:\n\n*Corporation *Limited company *Unlimited company *Limited liability partnership\n*Limited partnership *Not-for-profit corporation *Company limited by guarantee\n*Partnership *Sole Proprietorship\n\nThe proprietary limited company is a statutory business form in several\ncountries, including Australia.\n\nMany countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although\nthere are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the Limited-liability company\n(LLC) and the limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) in the United States.\n\nOther types of business organizations, such as cooperatives, credit unions and\npublicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel,\nsupersede, or even replace the profit maximization mandate of business\ncorporations.\n\nFor a country-by-country listing of officially recognized forms of business\norganization, see Types of business entity.\n\nThere are various types of company that can be formed in different\njurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:\n\n*a [[company limited by guarantee]]. Commonly used where companies are formed\nfor non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee\nthe payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into\ninsolvent liquidation, but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to\nthe company . *a company limited by guarantee with a share capital. A hybrid\nentity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes,\nbut the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a\nreturn. *a [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]. The\nmost common form of company used for business ventures. *an [[Unlimited\nCompany|unlimited company]] either with or without a share capital. This is a\nhybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but\nwhere the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should\nthe company ever go into formal liquidation.\n\nThere are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business\norganizations which may be formed in various countries and jurisdictions\nthroughout the world.\n",
