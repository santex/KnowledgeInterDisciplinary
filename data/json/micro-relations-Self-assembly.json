When the constitutive components are molecules, the process is termed\nmolecular self-assembly.\n\nSelf-assembly can be classified as either static or dynamic. In static self-\nassembly, the ordered state forms as a system approaches equilibrium, reducing\nits free energy. However in dynamic self-assembly, patterns of pre-existing\ncomponents organized by specific local interactions are not commonly described\nas \"self-assembled\" by scientists in the associated disciplines. These\nstructures are better described as \"self-organized\".\n","linknr":238,"url":"Self-assembly","recorded":1362506238,"links":20,"instances":["crystal_lattice","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nanotechnology","Cell biology","Systems theory","Self-organization"],"headings":["Self-assembly in chemistry and materials science","Self-assembly at the macroscopic scale","Consistent concepts of self-organization and self-assembly","See also","References","External links and further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Selfassembly_Organic_Semiconductor_Trixler_LMU.jpg/250px-Selfassembly_Organic_Semiconductor_Trixler_LMU.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/DNA_nanostructures.png/250px-DNA_nanostructures.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/6/8/668e7e3a5982543cca7b1cd3284c386a.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","chemistry"],["order","crystal_lattice"],["precursor","chemistry"]],"members":["order","precursor","precipitation"],"related":["Organic_semiconductor","Quinacridone","Graphite","Molecular_self-assembly","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Self-organization","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Order_(crystal_lattice)","Chemical_reaction","Van_der_Waals_force","Capillary_action","Pi-pi_interaction","Hydrogen_bond","Ionic_bond","Metallic_bond","Solubility","Mesoscopic","Crystal","Colloid","Lipid_bilayer","Phase-separated_polymer","Self-assembled_monolayer","Chemical_synthesis","Gibbs_free_energy","Superlattice","Polymethylmethacrylate","Precursor_(chemistry)","Block_copolymers","Maghemite","Waveguides","Self-organization","Crystal_engineering","Autopoiesis","Langmuirâ€“Blodgett_film","Nanotechnology","Pick-and-place_machine"]}
