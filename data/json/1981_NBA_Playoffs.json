{"cursor":"19545","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The '1981 [[NBA Playoffs]]' was the postseason tournament which followed\nNational Basketball Association's 1980-81 season. The tournament concluded with\nthe Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference\nchampion Houston Rockets 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Cedric Maxwell was\nnamed NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThe playoffs are notable for being the second time to date that a team with a\nlosing record advanced to the NBA Finals (the Minneapolis Lakers did it first in\n1959 with a 33â39 record), as the Rockets won their first Western Conference\nTitle despite having a 40-42 record (the other Western Conference Finalist, the\nKings, was also 40-42).\n\nThe Kings' playoff series victories over the Blazers and Suns were their last\nin Kansas City. Their last playoff series in Kansas City was a 3-game sweep in\nthe first round in 1984 by the Lakers. They moved to Sacramento after the\n1984â85 season and didn't win a playoff series representing northern California\nuntil 2001.\n\nThe Pacers became the last former ABA team to make their playoff debut, but were\nquickly swept by the 76ers 2-0.\n\nThis is the last year to date that an NBA playoff game was played in March.\n\nThe Celtics replicated their 1968 comeback by beating the Sixers in 7 after\ntrailing 3-1. This is the only time a team came back from a 3-1 series deficit\nto win against the same team twice.\n","linknr":265,"url":"1981_NBA_Playoffs","recorded":1375078620,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/1980%E2%80%9381_NBA_season","/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/1981_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell","/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/NBA_Finals","/wiki/1959_NBA_Playoffs","#Bracket","#Western_Conference","#Eastern_Conference","#NBA_Finals","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/Kansas_City_Kings","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Kansas_City_Kings","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Kansas_City_Kings","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/Indiana_Pacers","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/1970_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","#cite_note-1","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Darryl_Dawkins","/wiki/Larry_Bird","/wiki/Julius_Erving","/wiki/Robert_Parish","/wiki/Caldwell_Jones","/wiki/Nate_Archibald","/wiki/Maurice_Cheeks","/wiki/Bobby_Jones_(basketball,_born_1951)","/wiki/Gerald_Henderson","/wiki/Andrew_Toney","/wiki/M.L._Carr","/wiki/Hal_Greer","/wiki/John_Havlicek","/wiki/Lionel_Hollins","/wiki/1976_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Curtis_Perry","/wiki/Gar_Heard","/wiki/Kevin_McHale_(basketball)","/wiki/List_of_NBA_game_sevens","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/1981_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Houston_Rockets","/wiki/Larry_Bird","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/w/index.php?title=1981_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=5","http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1981.html","/wiki/Template:NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Template_talk:NBA_Playoffs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals","/wiki/NBA_Finals","/wiki/NBA_60_Greatest_Playoff_Moments","/wiki/List_of_NBA_game_sevens","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_streaks","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts","/wiki/WNBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1947_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1948_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1949_BAA_Playoffs","/wiki/1950_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1951_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1952_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1953_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1954_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1955_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1956_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1957_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1958_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1959_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1960_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1961_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1962_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1963_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1964_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1965_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1966_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1967_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1968_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1969_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1970_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1971_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1972_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1973_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1974_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1975_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1976_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1977_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1978_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1979_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1980_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1982_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1983_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1984_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1985_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1986_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1987_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1988_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1989_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1990_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1991_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1992_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1993_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1994_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1995_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1996_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1997_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1998_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1999_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2000_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2001_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2002_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2003_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2004_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2005_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2006_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2007_NBA_Playoffs","/
