{"cursor":"22775","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'heir apparent' or 'heiress apparent' is a person who is first in line of\nsuccession and cannot be displaced from inheriting, except by a change in the\nrules of succession.\n\nAn [[heir presumptive|heir presumptive or heiress presumptive]], by contrast, is\nsomeone who is first in line to inherit a title but whose claim can be displaced\nat any time (in legal terms, is \"subject to divestiture\") upon the occurrence of\none or more events or sets of events for which the system of inheritance allows,\nsuch as the birth of a more eligible heir.\n\nToday these terms most commonly describe heirs to hereditary titles,\nparticularly monarchies. They are also used metaphorically to indicate an\n\"anointed\" successor to any position of power, e.g., a political or\ncorporate leader.\n\nThe phrase is only occasionally found used as a title, where it usually is\ncapitalized (\"Heir Apparent\"). Most monarchies give (or gave) the heir apparent\nthe title of Crown Prince or a more specific title, such as Prince of Orange in\nthe Netherlands, Prince of Asturias in Spain, or Prince of Wales in the United\nKingdom. See crown prince for more examples.\n\nThis article primarily describes the term heir apparent in a hereditary system\nregulated by laws of primogenitureâas opposed to cases where a monarch has a say\nin naming the heir.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Heir_apparent","recorded":1362669197,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monarchy","Inheritance","Heirs apparent"],"headings":["Heir
