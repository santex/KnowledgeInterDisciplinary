It makes up the 63rd and 64th episodes and first aired on\nMay 20, 1993.\n\nThis two-part episode aired at an earlier time, 8:00 PM, to make room for the\ntwo-hour finale of [[Cheers]], whose timeslot would be claimed by Seinfeld at\nthe start of the new fall season. Approximately 32 million watched this episode\n(both parts) when it initially aired, and the show became a major ratings grab\nfor its next five seasons. Airing before the final episode of [[Cheers]], it\ndrew its highest ratings ever (to be later surpassed by The Finale).\n","linknr":192,"url":"The_Pilot_(Seinfeld)","recorded":1362576261,"links":17,"instances":["cheers","character","seinfeld"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Seinfeld (season 4) episodes","1993 television episodes"],"headings":["Plot","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["one_for_the_road","cheers"],["the_finale","seinfeld"],["jerry_seinfeld","character"]],"members":["one_for_the_road","jerry_seinfeld","the_finale"],"related":["The_Seinfeld_Chronicles","Larry_David","Tom_Cherones","Bob_Balaban","Anne_Twomey","Gina_Hecht","Peter_Crombie","Jeremy_Piven","Larry_Hankin","Kevin_Page","Mariska_Hargitay","Laura_Waterbury","Elena_Wohl","Bruce_Jarchow","Al_Ruscio","Richard_Gant","List_of_Seinfeld_episodes","One_for_the_Road_(Cheers)","The_Finale_(Seinfeld)","Jerry_Seinfeld_(character)","George_Costanza","Television_pilot","NBC","Elaine_Benes","Cancerous","Cosmo_Kramer","Larry_Hankin","Mugged","Constipation","Buxom","Elaine_Benes","Greenpeace","Enema","\"Crazy\"_Joe_Davola","Sic_semper_tyrannis"]}
