The label was generally applied\nto senior members of the government who were nevertheless outside Thatcher's\ninner circle and who expressed opposition to her strict monetarist policies\ndesigned to tackle inflation and her cuts to public spending.\n\nIn retaliation to being labelled as \"wet\", Thatcher's opponents within the party\nbegan referring to her supporters as the \"'dries'\".\n\nPolicies which came to be labelled as \"dry\" ones included foremostly reducing\npublic spending, cutting taxes, lowering interest rates, tightly controlling the\nmoney supply, and reducing the regulatory power of the state â€“ all\npolicies which were closely associated with Thatcher.\n\nThe term \"wet\" was originally applied to supporters of Thatcher's predecessor as\nparty leader, Edward Heath (who was Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974), as well as Heath's associates such as Jim Prior and\nPeter Walker. It came into common use after being used by Thatcherites as a way\nto label opponents of her policies. Post-Thatcher, the term has commonly been\nused as a disparaging term for liberal or left-wing ideas.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Wets_&_Dries","recorded":1362485447,"links":12,"instances":["england","uk"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of the Conservative Party (UK)","Political terminology","Margaret Thatcher","Conservative Party (UK) factions","Conservative Party (UK) terms"],"headings":["Origin of the term","Notable wets","Notable drys","Outside the United Kingdom","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Margaret_Thatcher.png/220px-Margaret_Thatcher.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/28px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conservative_party","uk"],["public_school","england"]],"members":["public_school","conservative_party"],"related":["Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","Conservative_Party_(UK)","United_Kingdom","Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","Margaret_Thatcher","Monetarism","Public_spending","Edward_Heath","Jim_Prior","Peter_Walker,_Baron_Walker_of_Worcester","Thatcherism","Public_school_(England)","Anthony_Barber","John_Biffen","Peter_Carington,_6th_Baron_Carrington","Ken_Clarke","Norman_St_John-Stevas,_Baron_St_John_of_Fawsley","Ian_Gilmour","Edward_Heath","Alan_Haselhurst","Michael_Heseltine","Douglas_Hurd","Anthony_Meyer","Jim_Prior","Francis_Pym","Nicholas_Scott","Sir_George_Young,_6th_Baronet","Peter_Walker,_Baron_Walker_of_Worcester","Leon_Brittan","Rhodes_Boyson","Ian_Gow","Michael_Howard","Geoffrey_Howe","Nigel_Lawson","Nicholas_Ridley","Norman_Tebbit","Canada","Red_Tories","One_Nation_Conservatism"]}
