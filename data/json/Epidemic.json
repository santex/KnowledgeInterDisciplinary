Epidemiologists often consider the term\noutbreak to be synonymous to epidemic, but the general public typically\nperceives outbreaks to be more local and less serious than pandemics.\n\nEpidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by a change in the ecology\nof the host population (e.g. increased stress or increase in the density of a\nvector species), a genetic change in the parasite population or the introduction\nof a new parasite to a host population (by movement of parasites or hosts).\nGenerally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to a parasite population is\nsuddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the\ntransmission threshold is exceeded. \"epidemic\".

Web. 17 September 2012.\n\nAn epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other\ncountries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be\ntermed a pandemic. The\ndeclaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline\nrate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are\ndefined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this\nbaseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be\nclassified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the\ncommon cold) would not.\n","linknr":275,"url":"Epidemic","recorded":1362505830,"links":84,"instances":["medicine","epidemiology","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf","http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf","http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar02jan-1.pdf","http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar02jan-1.pdf","http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/6/pdfs/v12-n6.pdf","http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/6/pdfs/v12-n6.pdf"],"categories":["Epidemiology","Epidemics|*","Pandemics|*","Biological hazards"],"headings":["Causes","Types","Transmission","Etymology","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["baseline","medicine"],["incidence","epidemiology"],["endemic","epidemiology"]],"members":["baseline","endemic","incidence"],"related":["Epidemiology","Disease","Outbreak","Synonymous","Pandemic","Baseline_(medicine)","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Influenza","Disease","Common_cold","Infectious_agent","Virulence","Contagious_disease","West_Nile_fever","Obesity_epidemic","Zoonotic","Homer","Hippocrates","Endemism","Thucydides","Plague_of_Athens","Pandemic","Biosecurity","Bugchasing_and_giftgiving","Epidemic_model","Overpopulation","Endemic_(epidemiology)","Syndemic","Epi_Info","European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control","OpenEpi"]}
