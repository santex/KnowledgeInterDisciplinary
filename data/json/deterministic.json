Some forms of determinism can be\ntested empirically with ideas stemming from physics and the philosophy of\nphysics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise\ncalled nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with free will.<ref\nname=Franklin>For example, see </ref>\n\nDeterminism often is taken to mean simply causal determinism, which in physics\nis the idea known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that events within a\ngiven paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state (of an object\nor event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be\ndistinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.\n\nOther debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some\nmaintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others\nidentifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse). There are\nnumerous historical debates involving many philosophical positions and varieties\nof determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will,\ntechnically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and\nincompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).\n\nDeterminism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by\nreasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect\nprediction be practically possible – merely predictable in theory.\n","title":"Determinism","headings":["Varieties","Connections","History","Modern perspectives","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Free_will","4: Quantum_mechanics","4: Predestination","4: Albert_Einstein","4: Chaos_theory","3: Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics","3: Theological_determinism","3: Omniscience","3: Materialism","2: Indeterminism","2: Compatibilistic","2: Leucippus","2: Biological_determinism","2: Fatalism","2: God","2: Randomness","2: J._J._C._Smart","2: Stephen_Hawking","2: Classical_mechanics","2: Uncertainty_principle","2: Many_worlds_interpretation","2: Genetic_determinism","2: Behaviorism","2: Social_determinism","2: Environmental_determinism","2: Technological_determinism","2: Hard_determinism","2: Standard_argument_against_free_will","2: Mind-body_problem","2: Niels_Bohr","2: Daniel_Dennett","2: Emergence","2: Neuroscience_of_free_will","2: Wave_function","2: Photon","1: Metaphysical","1: Empirically","1: Philosophy_of_physics","1: Paradigm","1: Causality","1: Multiverse","1: Incompatibilistic","1: Prediction","1: Causa_sui","1: Historical_determinism","1: Path_dependence","1: Nomological_determinism","1: Thought_experiment","1: Laplace's_demon","1: Laplace","1: Physical_determinism","1: Necessitarianism","1: Metaphysics","1: Predeterminism","1: Chain_of_prior_occurrences","1: Fate","1: Law","1: Monotheism","1: Deity","1: Destiny","1: Creator_deity","1: Law_of_excluded_middle","1: Time","1: Problem_of_future_contingents","1: Hermann_Minkowski","1: RietdijkâPutnam_argument","1: Quantum_indeterminacy","1: Quantum_decoherence","1: Expected_value","1: Cognition","1: Nature-nurture_debate","1: Single_cause_fallacy","1: Heritability","1: John_B._Watson","1: B._F._Skinner","1: Cultural_determinism","1: Thomas_Griffith_Taylor","1: Psychological_determinism","1: Psychological_egoism","1: Linguistic_determinism","1: SapirâWhorf_hypothesis","1: Economic_determinism","1: Dialectical_materialism","1: Karl_Marx","1: Harold_Innis","1: Marshall_McLuhan","1: Compatibilism","1: Incompatibilist","1: Hard_incompatibilism","1: Evidence_of_absence","1: Self-efficacy","1: Mind","1: Idealism","1: Interactionist_dualism","1: Dualism","1: Epiphenomenalism","1: Occasionalism","1: Dichotomy","1: Ethics","1: Marcus_Aurelius","1: Omar_KhayyÃ¡m","1: Thomas_Hobbes","1: Baruch_Spinoza","1: Gottfried_Leibniz","1: David_Hume","1: Baron_d'Holbach","1: Pierre-Simon_Laplace","1: Arthur_Schopenhauer","1: William_James","1: Friedrich_Nietzsche","1: Ralph_Waldo_Emerson","1: John_Searle","1: Ted_Honderich","1: Probabilistic","1: B.F._Skinner","1: Philosophical_Taoism","1: Wu_wei","1: Karma","1: Karma_in_Hinduism","1: Heraclitus","1: Stoics","1: Susanne_Bobzien","1: Alexander_of_Aphrodisias","1: Argument_from_free_will","1: Epictetus","1: Middle_Platonist","1: Michael_Frede","1: Moses_Maimonides","1: Newtonian_physics","1: Speed_of_light","1: Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Classical_Pantheism","1: Edwin_Hubble","1: Redshift","1: Big_Bang","1: Theists","1: Deists","1: Cosmogony","1: Nervous_system","1: Cognitive_science","1: Evolutionary_psychology","1: Parameter","1: Ontology","1: Chess","1: John_Horton_Conway","1: Conway's_Game_of_Life","1: Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb","1: Ludic_fallacy","1: Mathematical_models","1: Differential_equations","1: Stochastic","1: Sensitive_dependence_on_initial_conditions","1: Numerical_instability","1: Accuracy_and_precision","1: Phenomenon","1: Approximation","1: Certainty","1: Problem_of_induction","1: Butterfly_effect","1: Predict","1: Aaron_D._O'Connell","1: Scientific_method","1: Logic","1: Empiricism","1: Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle","1: Statistical_mechanics","1: Quantum_mechanics#Applications","1: Transistors","1: Lasers","1: Double-slit_experiment","1: Weak_measurement","1: Max_Born","1: Hidden_variable_theory","1: Bell_test_experiments","1: Bohm_interpretation","1: SchrÃ¶dinger's_cat","1: BohrâEinstein_debates","1: Determinism#Varieties","1: Supernova","1: Radioactivity","1: Uranium-238","1: Alpha_particle","1: Testable","1: Half_life","1: SchrÃ¶dinger_equation","1: Derivative","1: Quantum_state","1: Three-body_problem","1: Gravity","1: Integrability_conditions_for_differential_systems","1: Faddeev_Equations","1: Universal_wavefunction","1: Galaxy","1: Cosmic_inflation","1: Primordial_fluctuations","1: Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos","1: Amor_fati","1: Block_time","1: Calvinism","1: Digital_physics","1: False_necessity","1: Fractal","1: Game_theory","1: Ilya_Prigogine","1: Interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics","1: Open_theism","1: Philosophical_interpretation_of_classical_physics","1: Radical_behaviorism","1: Wheeler-Feynman_absorber_theory","1: John_Earman","1: George_Francis_Rayner_Ellis","1: Albert_Messiah"]}
