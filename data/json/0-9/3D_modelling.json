{"cursor":"16043","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn 3D computer graphics, '3D modeling' is the process of developing a\nmathematical representation of any three-dimensional 'surface' of object (either\ninanimate or living) via specialized software. The product is called a '3D\nmodel'. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called\n[[3D rendering]] or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The\nmodel can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.\n\nModels may be created automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of\npreparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts\nsuch as sculpting.\n","linknr":303,"url":"3D_modelling","recorded":1362374829,"links":34,"instances":["computer_graphics","geometry","geometry","3d_avatar_web_portal","software","mathematics","computer_scientist","software","geometry","graphics","software","linear_algebra","software","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["3D computer graphics|","3D imaging|Computer graphics","Visual effects","Video game design"],"headings":["Models","Using homogeneous coordinates","Modeling process","Compared to 2D methods","3D model market","3D printing","Human models","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Glasses_800_edit.png/220px-Glasses_800_edit.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Utah_teapot_simple_2.png/220px-Utah_teapot_simple_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/d/f/fdf0a1a858dab4105bfd8952db64e98b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/f/3/1f3744e8a4b96cee0e64dac9e77a6f61.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/4/7a43416114f0e9b4f4bd59d54b74042a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/8/b/e8b85c5037e873e9b15d9a29136ccc19.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/d/4/ad403a75683f5ec0f469f1b6f8a1cd3d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Polygon_face.jpg/220px-Polygon_face.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/3D_Plus_3DBuilding.jpg/250px-3D_Plus_3DBuilding.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point","geometry"],["sprite","computer_graphics"],["martin_newell","computer_scientist"],["ray_tracing","graphics"],["cone","geometry"],["square","geometry"],["projection","linear_algebra"],["vector","geometric"],["vector","geometric"],["matrix","mathematics"],["maya","software"],["blender","software"],["modo","software"],["solidthinking","software"],["point","geometry"],["sprite","computer_graphics"],["evolver","3d_avatar_web_portal"]],"members":["sprite","square","cone","evolver","blender","matrix","martin_newell","modo","point","ray_tracing","maya","projection","solidthinking","vector"],"related":["3D_computer_graphics","Three-dimensional_space","3d_computer_graphics_software","Computer","Simulation","3D_printing","Plastic_arts","Sculpting","Point_(geometry)","Algorithm","Procedural_modeling","3D_scanner","3D_computer_graphics","Personal_computer","Computer_game","Sprite_(computer_graphics)","Film","Video_game_industry","Video_game","Software_Architectural_Model","Earth_science","Martin_Newell_(computer_scientist)","Ray_tracing_(graphics)","Constructive_solid_geometry","Boundary_representation","Surface","Manifold","Polygon_mesh","Subdivision_surfaces","Volume_rendering","Level_set","Fluids","Sphere","Circumference","Tessellation","Cone_(geometry)","Square_(geometry)","Scanline_rendering","Vector","Diameter","Area","Volume","If_and_only_if","Affine_transformation","Diagonalizable_matrix","Projection_(linear_algebra)","Projective_geometry","Computer_graphics","Homogeneous_coordinates","Vector_(geometric)","Vector_(geometric)","Projective_transformation","Matrix_(mathematics)","Polygonal_modeling","Nonuniform_rational_B-spline","Geometric_primitives","Subdivision_surface","Voxel","Dynamic_tesselation","Constructive_solid_geometry","Implicit_surface","Subdivision_surface","Cinema_4D","Form-Z","Maya_(software)","3DS_Max","Blender_(software)","Lightwave","Modo_(software)","SolidThinking_(software)","POV-Ray","TrueSpace","Realsoft_3D","Particle_system","Coordinate","Point_(geometry)","Polygon","Texture_splat","Sprite_(computer_graphics)","Shading","Photorealistic","Graphic_art_software","Raster_graphics","TurboSquid","DAZ_3D","Lands'_End","Poser","3CT","List_of_3D_modeling_software","List_of_common_3D_test_models","3D_computer_graphics_software","3D_scanner","Additive_Manufacturing_File_Format","Cloth_modeling","Computer_facial_animation","Digimation","Digital_geometry","Edge_loop","Evolver_(3D_Avatar_Web_Portal)","Geologic_modelling","Industrial_CT_scanning","Open_CASCADE","Polygon_mesh","Polygonal_modeling","SIGGRAPH","Stanford_Bunny","Triangle_mesh","Utah_teapot","Voxel","Marching_cubes"]}
