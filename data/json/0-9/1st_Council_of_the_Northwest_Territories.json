Prior to 1876,\nmembers were appointed to the Temporary North-West Council.\n\nThe first members of the new council were appointed under the Northwest\nTerritories Act. An elected member could join the council if an area of had 1000\npeople, and an electoral district could be set up. This created a patchwork of\nrepresented and unrepresented areas, and there was no official or independent\nboundaries commission. The first district was Lorne in 1881.\n\nWhen the first council formed under the new appointed government in 1876, the\ncouncil consisted of the lieutenant governor, the chairman (speaker), and two\nappointed members. Because a quorum could not be maintained, the council had to\nbe adjourned if one member went to the washroom. In 1888 during the first\nelection, the council was 22 members and three appointed legal adviser members.\n","linknr":215,"url":"1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories","recorded":1375080189,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:EarlyNWTcouncillogo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/EarlyNWTcouncillogo.jpg/250px-EarlyNWTcouncillogo.jpg","/wiki/Unicameral","/wiki/Northwest_Territories_election,_1885","/wiki/Fort_Livingstone,_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Battleford,_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Temporary_North-West_Council","/wiki/Lieutenant_governor_of_the_North-West_Territories","#By-election_dates_and_summaries","#March_23.2C_1881_Lorne_by-election_.231","#May_29.2C_1883_Edmonton_by-election","#June_5.2C_1883_Lorne_by-election_.232","#August_13.2C_1883_Moose_Jaw.2C_Regina.2C_Qu.27Appelle_sub-election","#August_31.2C_1883_Broadview_by-election","#June_28.2C_1884_Calgary.2C_Moose_Mountain_by-election","#July_8.2C_1886_Moose_Mountain_by-election_.232","#July_14.2C_1886_Calgary.2C_by-election_.232","#October_14.2C_1886_Qu.27Appelle_by-election_.232","#May_24.2C_1887_Qu.27Appelle_by-election_.233","#September_5.2C_1887_Macleod_by-election","#Legislative_session_dates","#Elected_members_of_the_1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories","#Appointed_members_of_the_1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Northwest_Territories_election,_1885","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=13","/w/index.php?title=1st_Council_of_the_Northwest_Territories&action=edit&section=14","/wiki/Broadview_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/w/index.php?title=John_Claude_Hamilton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Broadview_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/w/index.php?title=Charles_Marshallsay&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Calgary_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/James_Davidson_Geddes","/wiki/Calgary_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/John_D._Lauder","/wiki/Calgary_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Hugh_Cayley","/wiki/Edmonton_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Frank_Oliver_(politician)","/wiki/Edmonton_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Herbert_Charles_Wilson","/wiki/Lorne_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Lawrence_Clarke","/wiki/Lorne_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Day_Hort_MacDowall","/wiki/Lorne_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Owen_Hughes_(politician)","/wiki/Macleod_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Richard_Henry_Boyle,_6th_Earl_of_Shannon","/wiki/Macleod_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/Frederick_W._A._G._Haultain","/wiki/Moose_Jaw_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/James_Hamilton_Ross","/wiki/Moose_Mountain_(N.W.T._electoral_district)","/wiki/John_Gillanders_Turriff","/wiki/Moos
