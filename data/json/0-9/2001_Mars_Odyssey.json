The\nproject was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an\nexpected cost for the entire mission of US$297 million. Its mission is to use\nspectrometers and electronic imagers to detect evidence of past or present water\nand volcanic activity on Mars. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will\nhelp answer the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars. It also acts\nas a relay for communications between the Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Science\nLaboratory, and the Phoenix lander to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute\nto Arthur C. Clarke, evoking the name of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A\nSpace Odyssey]]. [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/overview/ NASA\nJPL mission overview page]\n\nOdyssey was launched April 7, 2001 on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air\nForce Station, and reached Mars orbit on October 24, 2001, at 2:30 a.m. UTC\n(October 23, 7:30 p.m. PDT, 10:30 p.m. EDT). The spacecraft's main engine fired in order to brake the\nspacecraft's speed, which allowed it to be captured into orbit around Mars.\nOdyssey used a technique called \"aerobraking\" that gradually brought the\nspacecraft closer to Mars with each orbit. By using the atmosphere of Mars to\nslow down the spacecraft in its orbit, rather than firing its engine or\nthrusters, Odyssey was able to save more than of propellant. Aerobraking ended\nin January, and Odyssey began its science mapping mission on February 19, 2002.\n\nBy December 15, 2010 it broke the record for longest serving spacecraft at Mars,\nwith 3,340 days of operation, claiming the title from NASA's Mars Global Survey-\nor.
