It was presented by Dave Fanning, with Bianca Luykx,\nalthough Ray D'Arcy (who was known at the time for working weekdays on the\nchildren's television programme [[The Den (television)|The Den]]) was once said\nto have done a summer show to allow Fanning to spend more time with his family,\nbeing referred to as \"Dave\" \"about a dozen times\". The programme was essentially\na continuation of Ian Dempsey's The Beatbox, which (also as a TV and radio\n\"simulcast\") had occupied 2TV's Sunday morning time-slot for the previous number\nof years. In 2000, Fanning admitted that he did no work on the show and that he\ndid not like most of the music he played on it. This was not however the reason\nfor its cancellation as he also said he would continue presenting it. Fanning\ndescribed it as \"not rocket science, it's moron television\", saying he \"hardly\neven knew where the 2TV office was, and that's God's honest truth\".\noriginally published in the [[Daily Mirror#Sunday Mirror|Sunday Mirror]]\nPromotions for the show were created by a Swede, Jorgen Andreason, who had ten\nyears experience at Swedish Television before moving to Ireland. The\nshow was sponsored by Coca-Cola for a number of years.\n\n2TV drew much criticism for its limited choice of musical style. A typical video\nfeatured would be \"Dreams\" by The Corrs, whilst programme editor Ed Darragh, a\nwriter, producer and performer on numerous radio commercials and researcher and\ninterviewer on several radio programmes, including [[The Gerry Ryan Show]] and\n[[Moloney After Midnight]], was misquoted in a [[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot\nPress]] interview saying that: \"The Saw Doctors are shite. She expressed that\nthey are superb 2TV material. We also have lot of time for bands like\nAslan.\" Other bands whose videos would be featured or that would be\ndiscussed or interviewed on the programme included The Fugees, A Tribe Called\nQuest, B*Witched, Trisha Yearwood, Kerri Ann, Stereophonics, Boyzone, Brandy and\nMonica, Matchbox 20 and Neil Finn. A major reason for the show's cancellation\nwas the rise of 24-hour music-video channels, which also led to the end of The\nTop 30 Hits, Chart Show TV (the programme) and even Top of the\nPops.
