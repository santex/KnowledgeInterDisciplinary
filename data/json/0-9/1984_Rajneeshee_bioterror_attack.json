The attack\nis one of only two confirmed terrorist uses of biological weapons to harm humans\nsince 1945.\n\nHaving previously gained political control of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's\nfollowers based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, Oregon, sought election to two of the\nthree seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in\nNovember 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials\ndecided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in\nWasco County. The chosen biological agent was [[Salmonella enterica]]\nTyphimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County\nCommissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.\n\n751 people contracted salmonellosis as a result of the attack; 45 of whom\nwere hospitalized. There were no fatalities. Although an initial investigation\nby the Oregon Public Health Division and the Centers for Disease Control did not\nrule out deliberate contamination, the actual source of the contamination was\nonly discovered a year later. On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver\ngave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he \"accused\nthe Rajneeshees of sprinkling salmonella culture on salad bar ingredients in\neight restaurants\". At a press conference in\nSeptember 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his followers of involvement in this\nand other crimes, including an aborted plan to assassinate a United States\nAttorney; and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an\nInteragency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of\nbacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found\nin a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were\nindicted and served 29 months in a minimum-security federal prison.\n","linknr":920,"url":"1984_Rajneeshee_bioterror_attack","recorded":1362501460,"links":65,"instances":["journalist","journalist","united_states","attorney","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164603/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf","http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326082743/http://www.rand.org/nsrd/terrpanel/terror.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326082743/http://www.rand.org/nsrd/terrpanel/terror.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164603/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/thompson06.pdf","http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf","http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1985_Feb_28_Congressman_Weaver_THE_TOWN_THAT_WAS_POISONED.pdf"],"categories":["1984
