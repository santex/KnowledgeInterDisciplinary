{"cursor":"10192","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The '1983 [[NBA Playoffs]]' was the postseason tournament of the National\nBasketball Association's 1982-83 season. This was the final postseason using the\n12-team format, before the NBA expanded the postseason to 16 teams the next\nseason. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion\nPhiladelphia 76ers defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers\n4 games to 0 in the NBA Finals. Moses Malone was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nMalone made a famous prediction about the Sixers' chances prior to the playoffs,\nsaying \"Fo', fo', fo'\" â predicting that the Sixers would sweep every series.\nThey came close; they only lost once to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference\nFinals. The Sixers set a record for highest winning percentage in the playoffs\nthat was not broken until the Lakers went 15â1 in 2001. The Lakers' mark,\nhowever, came after the expansion to the current 16-team, four-round playoff\nformat, which was first implemented in the 1984 playoffs, while the Sixers\navoided the first round by virtue of their top seeding.\n\nIt was the third time in four years that the Lakers and 76ers had met in the NBA\nFinals, with the Lakers winning the previous two series.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs the previous year, the Blazers began a string of 21\nstraight playoff appearances in 1983 lasting until 2003. They made the playoffs\n25 out of 26 years from their title-winning season of 1977â2003. The record was\njust one season shy of the 22-year playoff run set by the Syracuse\nNationals/Philadelphia 76ers from 1950â1971.\n\nThe Celtics were swept out of the playoffs for the first time in team history,\nlosing 4â0 to the Bucks in the second round. However, they won the next 3\nplayoff meetings over the Bucks in (1984, 1986, and 1987).\n\nUntil 1995, this was the Spurs' last appearance in the Conference Finals.\nHowever, for players such as George Gervin and Artis Gilmore, the 6-game loss to\nthe Lakers was the closest they got to reaching the NBA Finals, let alone an NBA\nChampionship (Gilmore did return to the conference finals with the Celtics in\n1988, but played sparingly).\n","linknr":305,"url":"1983_NBA_Playoffs","recorded":1375078619,"links":["/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association","/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_NBA_season","/wiki/1984_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/1983_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Moses_Malone","/wiki/Bill_Russell_NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/2001_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/2003_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1977_NBA_Finals","/wiki/1950_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1971_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1984_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1986_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1987_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1995_NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/George_Gervin","/wiki/Artis_Gilmore","/wiki/NBA_Finals","/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy","/wiki/1988_NBA_Playoffs","#Bracket","#Western_Conference","#First_Round","#Conference_Semifinals","#Conference_Finals","#Eastern_Conference","#First_Round_2","#Conference_Semifinals_2","#Conference_Finals_2","#NBA_Finals","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Phoenix_Suns","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/Arizona_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/Arizona_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum","/wiki/Seattle_SuperSonics","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/Kingdome","/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_(Portland)","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_(Portland)","/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum_(Portland)","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs","/wiki/Denver_Nuggets","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/McNichols_Sports_Arena","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/HemisFair_Arena","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks","/wiki/Boston_Garden","/wiki/Omni_Coliseum","/wiki/Boston_Garden","/wiki/Tree_Rollins","/wiki/Danny_Ainge","/wiki/New_Jersey_Nets","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Izod_Center","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/New_York_Knicks","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","/wiki/Boston_Celtics","/wiki/Boston_Garden","/wiki/Boston_Garden","/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Arena","/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Arena","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Arena","/wiki/U.S._Cellular_Arena","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/1983_NBA_Finals","/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/wiki/The_Forum_(Inglewood)","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=1983_NBA_Playoffs&action=edit&section=12","http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1983.html","/wiki/Template:NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/Template_talk:NBA_Playoffs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NBA_Playoffs&action=edit","/wiki/NBA_Playoffs","/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals","/wiki/NBA_Finals","/wiki/NBA_60_Greatest_Playoff_Moments","/wiki/List_of_NBA_game_sevens","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_streaks","/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts","/wiki/WNBA_Playoffs","/wiki/1947_BAA_Pla
