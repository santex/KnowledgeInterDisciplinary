{"cursor":"4128","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'1-up' (or â1UPâ, â1-UPâ, etc.), pronounced \"one up\", is a term in console video\ngaming that commonly refers to an item that gives the player an extra\nlife, to complete the game. In certain\ngames, it is possible to receive multiple extra lives at once. When this\nhappens, the number of extra lives obtained sometimes changes the notification\nfrom \"1-up\" to the number that reflects the total lives earned: Two lives would\nbe \"2-up\", five lives would be \"5-up\", and so on. Games that don't do it this\nway often simply repeat the \"1-up\" notification in rapid succession concurrent\nwith the number of lives awarded.\n","linknr":127,"url":"1-up","recorded":1362582256,"links":26,"instances":["number","gaming"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070928083706/http://www.gamestyleguide.com/VideoGameStyleGuideeBook.pdf","http://www.gamestyleguide.com/VideoGameStyleGuideeBook.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070928083706/http://www.gamestyleguide.com/VideoGameStyleGuideeBook.pdf"],"categories":["Video game gameplay","Video game terminology"],"headings":["History","Printing","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Gamepad.svg/28px-Gamepad.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["1","number"],["health","gaming"],["health","gaming"]],"members":["1","health"],"related":["1_(number)","Video_game","Health_(gaming)","Pinball","Arcade_game","Multi-player","Health_(gaming)","Power-up"]}
