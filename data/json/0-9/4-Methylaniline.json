{"cursor":"4370","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"There are three isomers of 'toluidine', which are organic compounds. These\nisomers are 'o-toluidine', 'm-toluidine', and 'p-toluidine'. The 'o-' stands for\northo-, 'm-' stands for meta- , and 'p-' stands for para- . All three are aryl\namines whose chemical structures are similar to aniline except that a methyl\ngroup is substituted onto the benzene ring. The difference between these three\nisomers is the position where the methyl group (-CH 3) is bonded to\nthe ring relative to the amino functional group (-NH 2); see\nillustration of the chemical structures below.\n\n \n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin-\nleft:1em; background: #ffffff;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" align=center bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"|'Toluidine isomers'\n|- Common name o-toluidine m-toluidine p-toluidine - Other names o-methylaniline 2-\n|methylaniline m-methylaniline 3-methylaniline p-methylaniline 4-\n|methylaniline - Chemical name 2-amino-1-methylbenzene 3-amino-1-methylbenzene\n|4-amino-1-methylbenzene - Chemical formula colspan=\"3\"\n|align=center|C 7H 9N - Molecular mass colspan=\"3\"\n|align=center|107.17 g/mol - Glass transition temperature 189 K 187 K [no glass former] - Melting point\n|â23 Â°C â30 Â°C 43 Â°C - Boiling point 199â200 Â°C 203â204 Â°C 200 Â°C - Density\n| 1.00 g/cm 3 .98 g/cm 3\n| 1.05 g/cm 3 - CAS number [95-53-4] [108-44-1] [106-49-0] - SMILES\n|   CC1=C(N)C=CC=C1 NC1=CC(C)=CC=C1 NC1=CC=C(C)C=C1 -\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- colspan=4 align=center style=\"background: #ccccff;\"|  - }\n\nThe chemical properties of the toluidines are quite similar to those of aniline\nand toluidines have properties in common with other aromatic amines. Due to the\namino group bonded to the aromatic ring, the toluidines are weakly basic. None\nof the toluidines is very soluble in pure water, but will become soluble if the\naqueous solution is acidic due to formation of ammonium salts, as usual for\norganic amines. At room temperature and pressure, ortho- and meta-toluidines are\nviscous liquids, but para-toluidine is a flaky solid. This can be explained by\nthe fact that the p-toluidine molecules are more symmetrical and fit into a\ncrystalline structure more easily. p-Toluidine can be obtained from reduction of\np-nitrotoluene. p-Toluidine reacts with formaldehyde to form TrÃ¶ger's base.\n\nToluidines are used in the production of dyes. They are a component of\naccelerators for cyanoacrylate glues. They are toxic and are suspected human\ncarcinogens.\n\nThe related compound o-tolidine, used as a presumptive test for blood in\nforensic science, is two o-toluidine molecules linked together.\n","linknr":140,"url":"4-Methylaniline","recorded":1362371450,"links":23,"instances":["molecule"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anilines"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/O-Toluidin.svg/90px-O-Toluidin.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/M-Toluidin.svg/90px-M-Toluidin.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/P-Toluidin.svg/45px-P-Toluidin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["water","molecule"]],"members":["water"],"related":["Isomers","Organic_compound","Aryl","Amine","Chemical_structure","Aniline","Methyl_group","Amino","Functional_group","IUPAC_nomenclature","Chemical_formula","Molecular_mass","Glass_transition_temperature","Melting_point","Boiling_point","Density","CAS_registry_number","Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification","Aniline","Aromatic","Weak_base","Soluble","Water_(molecule)","Aqueous_solution","Acidic","Ammonium","Temperature","Pressure","Liquid","Solid","Molecule","Crystal","Redox","Formaldehyde","Tröger's_base","Dye","Cyanoacrylate","Toxic","Carcinogens","Tolidine"]}
