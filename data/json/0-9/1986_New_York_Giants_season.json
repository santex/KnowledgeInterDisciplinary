The Giants, who play\nin the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL),\nwon their fifth championshipâand first Super Bowlâin franchise history during\nthe season. Led by consensus league Most Valuable Player (MVP) linebacker\nLawrence Taylor and Super Bowl MVP quarterback Phil Simms, the Giants posted a\n14â2 record during the regular season, tied for the best record in the league\nwith the defending Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears and the best in team\nhistory as of 2012. The Giants improved on their 10-6 record from 1985, won\ntheir first division championship since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, and won\nSuper Bowl XXI against the Denver Broncos.\n\nIn the playoffs the Giants, who were the top seed in the conference ahead of the\nBears, defeated the San Francisco 49ers for the second consecutive year in the\nplayoffs by a score of 49-3. They then disposed of their division rivals, the\nWashington Redskins, in the NFC Championship Game 17-0. In the Super Bowl,\nbehind Simms' 88% pass completion percentage and their strong defense, the\nGiants overcame a 10-9 halftime deficit and scored thirty second half points\nwhile allowing only ten more and defeated the Broncos 39-20.\n\nAfter making the playoffs in 1984 and 1985, the Giants entered the 1986 season\nas one of the favorites to win the Super Bowl. They began the season with 31â28\nloss to the Dallas Cowboys, before winning five consecutive games. After losing\n17â12 to the Seattle Seahawks in week seven, the Giants won their final nine\nregular season games. Following the regular season, coach Bill Parcells won the\nNFL Coach of the Year Award and eight Giants were named to the Pro Bowl. The\nGiants' defense, nicknamed the Big Blue Wrecking Crew, finished second in the\nleague in points and yards allowed.
