However, like the 0s, the number of years in the 0s BC is not\nalways clearly defined. Note that there is no year zero (0) in either the\nproleptic Gregorian calendar or Julian calendar. Hence 1 BC is followed by the\nyear AD 1.\n\nAD 1 is the first year of the Anno Domini era (also known as the Common Era). In\n525 (the consulship of Probus Junior Flavius Probus), a Christian monk named\nDionysius Exiguus stated that the incarnation of Jesus occurred 525 years\nearlier. [http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen Year\nCycle of Dionysius] First Argumentum. Whether Dionysius regarded\n\"incarnation\" as Jesus' birth or conception, and whether Dionysius placed it in\n1 BC or AD 1 are debated by modern scholars. Nevertheless, these same scholars\nbelieve Jesus was actually born a few years earlier, during this decade.\n\nThis article concerns the period '9 BC â 1 BC', the last nine years before the\nAnno Domini era, not the last ten years.\n","linknr":547,"url":"0s_BC","recorded":1362571497,"links":55,"instances":["cheng","judea","ai","son_of_herod_i","scholar","wife_of_quintus_lucretius","ping"],"pdf":[],"categories":["0s BC|"],"headings":["Significant people","Births","Deaths","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Albrecht_Altdorfer_006.jpg/220px-Albrecht_Altdorfer_006.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["empress_wang","ping"],["tetrarchy","judea"],["empress_xu","cheng"],["liu_xiang","scholar"],["curia","wife_of_quintus_lucretius"],["antipater","son_of_herod_i"],["empress_fu","ai"]],"members":["empress_xu","tetrarchy","empress_fu","antipater","liu_xiang","curia","empress_wang"],"related":["1st_century_BC","1st_millennium_BC","0s","Year_zero","Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar","Julian_calendar","1_BC","1","Anno_Domini","Common_Era","Flavius_Probus","Dionysius_Exiguus","Jesus","Anno_Domini","Tigranes_IV","Erato_of_Armenia","Emperor_Cheng_of_Han","Han_Dynasty","Emperor_Ai_of_Han","Han_Dynasty","Emperor_Ping","Han_Dynasty","Wang_Mang","Dong_Xian","Han_Dynasty","China","Emperor_Ai_of_Han","Antiochus_III_of_Commagene","Arminius","Germania","18_BC","17_BC","21","Arshak_II_of_Iberia","Caucasian_Iberia","Strato_II_and_III","Lugaid_Riab_nDerg","List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland","Conchobar_Abradruad","List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland","Crimthann_Nia_Náir","List_of_High_Kings_of_Ireland","8_BC","9_AD","Emperor_Suinin","Amanishakheto","List_of_Kushite_Kings","1_BC","Natakamani","List_of_Kushite_Kings","1_BC","20","Osroene","Abgar_V_of_Edessa","Osroene","Phraates_IV_of_Parthia","Arsacid_Empire","Phraates_V_of_Parthia","Arsacid_Empire","Musa_of_Parthia","Caesar_Augustus","Roman_Emperor","27_BC","14","Nero_Claudius_Drusus","Roman_Consul","Gaius_Caesar","Livy","Ovid","Quirinius","Tiberius","Herod_the_Great","Client_state","Iudaea_Province","Hillel_the_Elder","Nasi","Sanhedrin","Shammai","Av_Beit_Din","Sanhedrin","Hyeokgeose_of_Silla","Silla","Nativity_of_Jesus_in_art","9_BC","Emperor_Ping_of_Han","6","Asconius_Pedianus","8_BC","Empress_Wang_(Ping)","23","5_BC","Emperor_Guangwu_of_Han","57","4_BC","Herod_Philip_II","Tetrarchy_(Judea)","3_BC","Seneca_the_Younger","65","Galba","Roman_emperor","69","1_BC","Ptolemy_of_Mauretania","40","Matthew_the_Evangelist","Twelve_Apostles","John_the_Baptist","Jesus","Christianity","6_BC","30","9_BC","Nero_Claudius_Drusus","8_BC","Horace","65_BC","Gaius_Maecenas","70_BC","Empress_Xu_(Cheng)","Liu_Xiang_(scholar)","Polemon_I_of_Pontus","Cilicia","Pontus","Colchis","Bosporan_Kingdom","7_BC","Emperor_Cheng_of_Han","51_BC","Consort_Zhao_Hede","Aristobulus_IV","Herod_the_Great","Geumwa_of_Dongbuyeo","Dongbuyeo","6_BC","Consort_Ban","Emperor_Cheng_of_Han","48_BC","Consort_Feng_Yuan","48_BC","5_BC","Curia_(wife_of_Quintus_Lucretius)","Quintus_Lucretius_Vespillo","4_BC","Antipater_(son_of_Herod_I)","Herod_the_Great","Herod_the_Great","73_BC","Marcus_Tullius_Tiro","Cicero","3_BC","Consort_Fu","Han_Dynasty","2_BC","Iullus_Antonius","Roman_Consul","Phraates_IV_of_Parthia","1_BC","Dong_Xian","Han_Dynasty","China","Emperor_Ai_of_Han","23_BC","Emperor_Ai_of_Han","27_BC","Empress_Fu_(Ai)","Empress_Zhao_Feiyan","32_BC"]}
