{"cursor":"21498","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe '1270s' is the decade starting January 1, 1270, and ending December 31,\n1279.\n\nIn Europe, power struggles within the Holy Roman Empire escalated into civil war\nas the 23-year interregnum without an emperor came to an end. Election of\nRudolph I of Germany as King of Germany over Otakar II of Bohemia in 1273 led to\nopen war in 1276 and Otakar's death in 1278 at the climactic Battle of\nMarchfeld. The resultant power structure in central Europe firmly established\nthe Habsburg dynasty's rule, one that would continue in Austria and other\nregional territories until the end of World War I in 1918. King Edward I of\nEngland returned from the Eighth Crusade to take the throne and was able to\nsubjugate Wales by the end of the decade; Scotland quelled an uprising on the\nIsle of Man, in doing so confirming the concession of that territory made in\n1266 by Norway in the Treaty of Perth. The Statute of Westminster established a\nseries of individuals' rights in England. Both the Eighth Crusade and Ninth\nCrusade were brief efforts that quickly ended in failure, with King Louis IX of\nFrance dying during the former.\n\nIn Asia, the Mongols continued expanding their territories. Kublai Khan moved\nhis capital to present-day Beijing and renamed his empire the Yuan Dynasty,\nreflecting the new eastward focus of the empire. The Yuan Dynasty conquered the\nSouthern Song Dynasty of China by the end of the decade. By this time the\nMongols had subjugated most of continental Asia. The conquest of Southern Song\nwitnessed the first use of firearms in war. The western Ilkhanate established a\ncapital at Tabriz, in present-day Iran. The Mongols were able to quell the\nSambyeolcho Rebellion in Korea and defeat the Nakhi and Pagan Empires, but\nfailed an attempted invasion of Japan in 1274. Marco Polo reached Kublai Khan's\nsummer court Shangdu by 1275, and stayed with the court for over 20 years.\n\nThe Mamluk sultanate of Egypt continued to expand its territory and dodge two\ncrusadesâthe Eighth Crusade never reached its intended target, and the Ninth\nrapidly became a failure. The sultan Baibars was successful in expanding his\nterritory as far north as the Sultanate of RÃ¼m in Anatolia, east into Syria, and\nsouth into Makurian Nubia. After Baibars died in 1277, his successor Qalawun\ncontinued expansionist policies.\n\nEuropean culture witnessed the arrival of several important scientific works in\ntranslation from centuries-old Arabic sources, including Alhazen's work on\noptics and Al-Razi's medical works. The two major surveys of the English census\nknown as the Hundred Rolls were conducted. Thomas Aquinas completed his seminal\nwork [[Summa Theologica]] late in 1273, and died in 1274. Leadership of the\nCatholic Church attempted to address the East-West Schism of the church through\nthe Second Council of Lyons, but despite apparent success the effort was\nultimately doomed to fail. In Japan, Nichiren continued to lead a life that\nwould come to be revered in Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIn North America, a severe 23-year drought began in the Grand Canyon area, which\nwould eventually force the local Anasazi people to emigrate from the region.\n","linknr":627,"url":"1270s","recorded":1362571994,"links":73,"instances":["cairo","catholic","language","region","liturgy","assembly","1271"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1270s|"],"headings":["War
