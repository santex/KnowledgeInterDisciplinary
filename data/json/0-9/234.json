Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian\ncalendar. At the time, it was known as the 'Year of the Consulship of Pupienus\nand Sulla' (or, less frequently, 'year 987Ab urbe condita'). The denomination\n234 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno\nDomini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n","title":"234","headings":["Events","Births","Deaths","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Zhuge_Liang","2: Shu_Han","2: Wei_Yan","2: 305","2: Shu_Kingdom","2: 181","1: Common_year_starting_on_Wednesday","1: Julian_calendar","1: Ab_urbe_condita","1: Anno_Domini","1: Calendar_era","1: Alexander_Severus","1: Julia_Avita_Mamaea","1: Moguntiacum","1: Mainz","1: Germania_Superior","1: Legatus","1: Rhine","1: Alemanni","1: Roman_legion","1: Chancellor","1: Zhuge_Liang's_Northern_Expeditions","1: Cao_Wei","1: Battle_of_Wuzhang_Plains","1: Treason","1: Emperor_Wu_of_Jin_China","1: Neoplatonism","1: Pan_Zhang","1: Eastern_Wu","1: 177","1: Ma_Dai","1: 175","1: Lady_Xiahou_Hui","1: 211","1: Emperor_Xian_of_Han_China","1: Han_Dynasty","1: Wuzhang_Plains","1: Kingdom_of_Wei"]}
