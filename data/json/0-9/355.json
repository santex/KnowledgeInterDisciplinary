('[[Roman numerals|CCCLV]]') was a common year starting on Sunday (link will\n display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as\n the 'Year of the Consulship of Arbitio and Maesius' (or, less frequently, 'year\n 1108Ab urbe condita'). The denomination 355 for this year has been used since\n the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the\n prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n","title":"355","headings":["Events","Births","Deaths","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Alans","2: Claudius_Silvanus","1: Peter_Johann_Nepomuk_Geiger","1: Common_year_starting_on_Sunday","1: Julian_calendar","1: Ab_urbe_condita","1: Anno_Domini","1: Calendar_era","1: January_1","1: Arbitio","1: Lollianus_Mavortius","1: Roman_consul","1: August_11","1: Roman_Emperor","1: Rome","1: November_6","1: Constantius_II","1: Mediolanum","1: Italy","1: Julian_the_Apostate","1: Lentienses","1: Germanic_peoples","1: Roman_Empire","1: Franks","1: Cologne","1: Huns","1: Central_Asia","1: Scythia","1: Russia","1: Horse_breeding","1: Steppe","1: Black_Sea","1: Pope_Liberius","1: Athanasius_of_Alexandria","1: Patriarch_of_Alexandria","1: Milan","1: Veria","1: Greece","1: Antipope_Felix_II","1: Antipope","1: Bishop","1: Fan_Tai","1: 428","1: Murong_Bao","1: Xianbei","1: Later_Yan","1: 398","1: Aedesius","1: Neoplatonism","1: September_7","1: Roman_usurper","1: Fú_Jiàn","1: Former_Qin","1: 317","1: Fu_Sheng","1: Zhang_Yaoling","1: Former_Liang","1: 344","1: Zhang_Zuo"]}
