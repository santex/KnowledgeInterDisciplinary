By the end of 1943 Canadian formations\nin the UK consisted of three infantry divisions, two armoured divisions, and two\nindependent armoured brigades. The first commander was Lieutenant-General A.G.L.\n\"Andy\" McNaughton, who was replaced in 1944 by General H. D. G. \"Harry\" Crerar.\nBoth had been senior artillery officers in the Canadian Corps in the First World\nWar. Allied formations of other nationalities were added to the First Canadian\nArmy to keep it at full strength.
