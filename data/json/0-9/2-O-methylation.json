{"cursor":"1251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] '2'-O-methylation' is a common nucleoside modification of RNA, where a\nmethyl group is added to the 2' hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety of a\nnucleoside. 2'-O-methylated nucleosides are found in the functionally essential\nregions of the ribosome and spliceosome. Also, 2'-O-methylation of\nadenosine in an RNA prevents adenosine deaminase from editing it to an\ninosine.\n","linknr":109,"url":"2'-O-methylation","recorded":1362374283,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/2%27-O-methyl-adenosine.GIF/220px-2%27-O-methyl-adenosine.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Nucleus_ER.png/27px-Nucleus_ER.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nucleoside","RNA","Methyl_group","Nucleic_acid_nomenclature","Ribose","Ribosome","Spliceosome","Adenosine","ADAR","Inosine","Small_nucleolar_RNA"]}
