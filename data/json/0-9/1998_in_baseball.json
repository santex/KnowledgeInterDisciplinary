While Griffey (56) and Vaughn (50)\nwould fall short of the record, both Sosa (66) and McGwire (70) shattered\nMaris's record in an exciting late-season chase that culminated in a final week\nthat saw record-setting performances by McGwire, Sosa, Tom Gordon, Dennis\nEckersley, Trevor Hoffman and Jason Kendall.

The Cubs stay tied with the San Francisco\nGiants for the wildcard lead when they could have led by one game with three\ngames left.

Sammy Sosa\nfails to hit a home run in the Cubs' 4-3 loss to the Houston Astros, leaving him\nat 66 homers. However, the Cubs loss forces a one-game playoff with the San\nFrancisco Giants for the National League wild card, giving Sosa one final chance\nto reach McGwire.\n\n*September 27 - In the San Diego Padres' final regular season game, left fielder\nGreg Vaughn hits his 50th home run of the season, a career high and a San Diego\nPadres record for home runs in a season. This marks the first time in major\nleague history that four players - Vaughn (50), Griffey (56), Sosa (66) and\nMcGwire (70) - hit at least 50 home runs in the same season.

The no-hitter also would have been\nthe third to be pitched on the final day of a regular season, joining the\ncombination of Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers in and\nMike Witt's perfect game in . The home run ball is caught, ironically, by Dave\nStiebâhimself a three-time victim of a no-hitter being broken up with two out in\nthe ninth (his last two starts of the season and a perfect game bid in ) before\nfinally pitching the Blue Jays' only no-hitter to date, in .\n\n*September 28 - In a one-game playoff, the Chicago Cubs defeat the San Francisco\nGiants 5-3 to secure the final playoff spot in the National League. For the\nthird game in a row, the Cubs' Sammy Sosa gets two hits, but no home runs,\nleaving him at 66 home runs for the season; four fewer than Mark McGwire, who\npulled ahead of Sosa with five home runs in his final three games.\n\nOctoberâDecember\n\n*World Series: New York Yankees win 4 games to 0 over the San Diego Padres. The\nSeries MVP is Scott Brosius, Yankees third baseman. The Yankees end the season\nwith a major league record 125 combined regular season and postseason wins.\n\n*Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves wins his second National League Cy Young\nAward in an extremely close vote over two San Diego Padres pitchers: Trevor\nHoffman and Kevin Brown. Glavine, who receives 11 first-place votes to Hoffman's\n13 (Brown receives the remaining 8), becomes the first National League pitcher\nsince the league instituted its four-vote system in 1970 to win the award\ndespite receiving fewer first-place votes than another player. Glavine tallied\n99 points (Hoffman - 88, Brown - 76), with 5 points being awarded for each first\nplace vote, 3 for each second-place vote, 2 for third, and 1 for fourth. Another\noddity is the fact that Hoffman, Brown, and Rod Beck (who did not receive a\nsingle point in the Cy Young Award voting) finished higher than Glavine in the\nMVP voting, despite Glavine's Braves finishing with the best record in the\nNational League.[http://www.baseball-\nreference.com/awards/awards_1998.shtml#NLmvp]\n\n*November 9 - It is revealed that Hall of Fame pitcher Jim
