{"cursor":"28524","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nUnder the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel\narrangement, '{{nowrap|4-4-0}}' represents the arrangement of four leading\nwheels on two axles, usually in a leading bogie, four powered and coupled\ndriving wheels on two axles, and no trailing wheels. Almost every major railroad\nthat operated in North America in the first half of the 19th century owned and\noperated locomotives of this type. Due to the large number of the type that were\nproduced and used there, the is most commonly known as the 'American' type, but\nthe type subsequently became popular in the United Kingdom, where large numbers\nwere produced.
