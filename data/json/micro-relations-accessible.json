Accessibility can be\nviewed as the \"ability to access\" and benefit from some system or entity. The\nconcept often focuses on people with disabilities or special needs (such as the\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) and their right of\naccess, enabling the use of assistive technology.\n\nAccessibility is not to be confused with usability, which is the extent to which\na product (such as a device, service, or environment) can be used by specified\nusers to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction\nin a specified context of use.\n\nAccessibility is strongly related to universal design when the approach involves\n\"direct access.\" This is about making things accessible to all people (whether\nthey have a disability or not). An alternative is to provide \"indirect access\"\nby having the entity support the use of a person's assistive technology to\nachieve access (for example, computer screen readers).\n\n's public
