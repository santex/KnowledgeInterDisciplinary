{"cursor":"3657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In geochronology, an 'epoch' is a subdivision of the geologic timescale that is\nlonger than an age and shorter than a period. We are currently living in the\nHolocene epoch of the Quaternary period. Rock layers deposited during an epoch\nare called a series. Series are subdivisions of the stratigraphic column that,\nlike epochs, are subdivisions of the geologic timescale. Like other\ngeochronological divisions, epochs are normally separated by significant changes\nin the rock layers they correspond to.\n\nEpochs are most commonly used for the younger Cenozoic Era, where a greater\ncollection of fossils has been found and paleontologists have more detailed\nknowledge of the events that occurred during those times. They are less commonly\nreferred to for the other eras and eons, since less fossil evidence exists that\nallows us to form a clearer view of those time periods.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Epoch_(geology)","recorded":1362673381,"links":35,"instances":["reference_date","geology","geology","astronomy","geology","stratigraphy","geology","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geochronology"],"headings":["List of series (epochs) in the Phanerozoic eon","List of periods in the Proterozoic eon","Eras in the Archean eon","Hadean Eon","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Geological_time_spiral.png/34px-Geological_time_spiral.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["age","geology"],["period","geology"],["series","stratigraphy"],["era","geology"],["system","geology"],["era","geology"],["epoch","astronomy"],["epoch","reference_date"],["saros","astronomy"],["mya","unit"]],"members":["epoch","system","period","saros","age","series","era","mya"],"related":["Geochronology","Geologic_timescale","Age_(geology)","Period_(geology)","Holocene","Quaternary","Series_(stratigraphy)","Stratigraphic_column","Era_(geology)","System_(geology)","Cenozoic","Quaternary","Holocene","Pleistocene","Neogene","Pliocene","Miocene","Paleogene","Oligocene","Eocene","Paleocene","Mesozoic","Cretaceous","Late_Cretaceous","Early_Cretaceous","Jurassic","Late_Jurassic","Middle_Jurassic","Early_Jurassic","Triassic","Late_Triassic","Middle_Triassic","Early_Triassic","Paleozoic","Permian","Carboniferous","Pennsylvanian","Mississippian_period","Devonian","Silurian","Ludlow_Group","Wenlock_Group","Llandovery_Group","Ordovician","Cambrian","Furongian","Era_(geology)","Neoproterozoic","Ediacaran","Cryogenian","Tonian","Mesoproterozoic","Stenian","Ectasian","Calymmian","Paleoproterozoic","Statherian","Orosirian","Rhyacian","Siderian","Neoarchean","Mesoarchean","Paleoarchean","Eoarchean","Annum","Anno_Lucis","Anno_Mundi","Before_Common_Era","Before_Christ","Common_Era","Anno_Domini","Dating_Creation","Epoch_(astronomy)","Epoch_(reference_date)","Holocene_calendar","Lunisolar_calendar","Metonic_cycle","Saros_(astronomy)","Mya_(unit)","Cambridge_University"]}
