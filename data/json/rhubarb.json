They have\nlarge leaves that are somewhat triangular, with long fleshy petioles. They have\nsmall flowers grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to rose-red\ninflorescences.\n\nIn culinary use, fresh raw petioles (leaf stalks) are crisp (similar to celery)\nwith a strong, tart taste. Most commonly, the plant's leaf stalks are cooked\nwith sugar and used in pies and other desserts. A number of varieties have been\ndomesticated for human consumption, most of which are recognised as Rheum x\nhybridum by the Royal Horticultural Society.\n\nRhubarb is usually considered to be a vegetable; however, in the United States,\na New York court decided in 1947 that since it was used in the United States as\na fruit, it was to be counted as a fruit for the purposes of regulations and\nduties. A side effect was a reduction on imported rhubarb tariffs, as tariffs\nwere higher for vegetables than fruits.<ref>findlaw.com\n\"[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=149&invol=304\nNIX v. HEDDEN, 149 U.S. 304 (1893)]</ref>\n\nRhubarb also contains glycosides especially rhein, glucorhein and emodin which\nimpart cathartic and laxative activities to it. It is hence useful as a\ncathartic in case of constipation.<ref name=\"mehta\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/12/pharmacognosy-of-\nrhubarb/ Pharmacognosy of Rhubarb]</ref>\n",
