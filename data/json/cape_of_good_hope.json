      "text" : "\n\n\nThe 'Cape of Good Hope' (, Dutch: , , ) is a rocky headland on the Atlantic\ncoast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa.\n\nThere is a misconception that the Cape of Good Hope is the southern tip of\nAfrica, because it was once believed to be the dividing point between the\nAtlantic and Indian Oceans. In fact, the southernmost point is Cape Agulhas,\nabout to the east-southeast. The currents of the two oceans meet at the point\nwhere the warm-water Agulhas current meets the cold water Benguela current and\nturns back on itself—a point that fluctuates between Cape Agulhas and Cape Point\n(about 1.2 kilometres east of the Cape of Good Hope).\n\nWhen following the western side of the African coastline from the equator,\nhowever, the Cape of Good Hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel\nmore eastward than southward. Thus, the first modern rounding of the cape in\n1488 by Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias was a milestone in the attempts by\nthe Portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the Far East (although\nin his histories Herodotus proves, disbelievingly, that some Phoenicians had\ndone so far earlier than this<ref>[http://www.livius.org/he-\nhg/herodotus/hist01.htm The first circumnavigation of Africa<!-- Bot generated\ntitle -->]</ref>). Dias(or Diaz) called the cape Cabo das Tormentas. \"Cape of\nStorms\" was the original name of the \"Cape of Good Hope\".<ref></ref>\n\nAs one of the great capes of the South Atlantic Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope has\nlong been of special significance to sailors, many of whom refer to it simply as\n\"'the Cape'.\"<ref>Along the Clipper Way, Francis Chichester; page 78. Hodder &\nStoughton, 1966. ISBN 0-340-00191-7</ref> It is a waypoint on the clipper route\nfollowed by clipper ships to the Far East and Australia, and still followed by\nseveral offshore yacht races.\n\nThe term Cape of Good Hope is also used in three other ways: *It is a section of\nthe Table Mountain National Park, within which the cape of the same name, as\nwell as Cape Point, falls. Prior to its incorporation into the national park\nthis section constituted the Cape Point Nature\nReserve;<ref>[http://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/tourism/map.php Map\nof the Park, showing the Cape of Good Hope section (retrieved 27 March\n2010).]</ref> *It was the name of the early Cape Colony established in 1652, in\nthe vicinity of the Cape Peninsula. *Just prior to the formation of the Union of\nSouth Africa, the term referred to the entire region that in 1910 was to become\nthe Cape of Good Hope Province (usually shortened to the Cape Province).\n",
