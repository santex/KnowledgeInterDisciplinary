HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR/ErbB) family. Amplification or over-expression of this gene has\nbeen shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of\ncertain aggressive types of breast cancer and in recent years it has evolved to\nbecome an important biomarker and target of therapy for the disease.\n","linknr":1347,"url":"HER2","recorded":1362503678,"links":34,"instances":["protein","medicine","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Clusters of differentiation","Tyrosine kinase receptors","Genes"],"headings":["Function","HER2 and cancer","Drugs targeting HER2","HER2 testing","HER2 interactions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Trastuzumab_Fab-HER2_complex_1N8Z.png/250px-Trastuzumab_Fab-HER2_complex_1N8Z.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/PBB_GE_ERBB2_216836_s_at.png/250px-PBB_GE_ERBB2_216836_s_at.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/PBB_GE_ERBB2_210930_s_at.png/250px-PBB_GE_ERBB2_210930_s_at.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/3D_Dual_Color_Super_Resolution_Microscopy_Cremer_2010.png/550px-3D_Dual_Color_Super_Resolution_Microscopy_Cremer_2010.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/PDB_1n8z_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1n8z_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/PDB_1s78_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1s78_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/PDB_2a91_EBI.png/180px-PDB_2a91_EBI.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biomarker","medicine"],["coactivator","genetics"],["corepressor","genetics"],["erbin","protein"],["heat_shock_protein_90kda_alpha","cytosolic,_member_a1"]],"members":["erbin","biomarker","heat_shock_protein_90kda_alpha","coactivator","corepressor"],"related":["Cluster_of_differentiation","Protein","Gene","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Gene_duplication","Breast_cancer","Biomarker_(medicine)","Proto-oncogene","Chromosome_17","Glioblastoma","Oncogene","Gene","Cell_membrane","Receptor_tyrosine_kinase","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase","Phosphoinositide_3-kinase","Phospholipase_C","Protein_kinase_C","STAT_protein","Apoptosis","Endometrial_carcinoma","GRB7","Monoclonal_antibodies","Trastuzumab","CDKN1B","Pertuzumab","NeuVax","Galena_Biopharma","T_cell","Estrogen_receptor","Estradiol","Tamoxifen","Coactivator_(genetics)","Nuclear_receptor_coactivator_3","Corepressor_(genetics)","PAX2","Breast_cancer","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Cetuximab","Biopsy","Fine-needle_aspiration","Vacuum-assisted_breast_biopsy","Immunohistochemistry","Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridisation","ELISA","Protein-protein_interaction","Beta-catenin","Glycoprotein_130","PLCG1","Erbin_(protein)","MUC1","Grb2","Heat_shock_protein_90kDa_alpha_(cytosolic),_member_A1","DLG4","PIK3R2","PICK1","SHC1","SkBr3"]}
