Aargau is located in the Zug system.\n\nThe planet shares its name with Aargau, a Swiss canton near the banking capital\nof Switzerland, ZÃ¼rich. Also, Zug is the name of another Swiss canton. It can be\nassumed that these names are a play on the fact that Switzerland has an\ninordinate number of banks.\n\nAargonar Aargonar is a dusty, desert planet in the Aargonar system in the Outer\nRim.

Realizing it would be\nmadness to keep fighting against them with so little reinforcements, Acherin's\nleaders asked for a ceasefire. But the Imperial forces refused and initiated an\norbital bombardment of the planet's surface. Only the timely arrival of Obi-Wan\nKenobi and Ferus Olin saved the lives of the resistance leaders Toma and Raina\nQuill. While they fled, the Empire devastated the city of Eluthan and claimed\nthe planet.\n\nAfter the fall of the Empire, Acherin isolated itself and would remain so for\nseveral centuries; as of 137 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin), it was engulfed by\nthe rule of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire.\n\nAcilaris 'Acilaris' is the closest planet to the twin suns Morasil and Termadus\nof the Cularin system. It could be easily mistaken for a large asteroid but is\ndefinitely a planet. Acilaris has enough gravity to maintain an atmosphere,\nwhich is composed mainly of hydrogen with traces of sulfur, carbon and boron.\nBecause of the planet's proximity to its suns, the surface temperature is\nextremely high, which prevents ships from landing on the planet's surface. It is\nfor this reason that no one has set foot on Acilaris.\n\nSensor scans have revealed a variety of rare minerals and even some crystals on\nthe planet. The presence of these minerals on other planets has meant a lack of\ninterest in Acilaris, although it is rumored that one company has a contract\nwith the droids of Uffel to produce some special droids that could withstand the\nsurface temperature.\n\nAdari 'Adari', home to the Adarian race, is a planet covered in snow-capped\nvolcanic mountains.

Because stygium crystals are\nextremely valuable, a number of unscrupulous prospectors descended upon Aeten\nII, where they competed for the rare crystals with abandon. As a result, Aeten\nII became one of the most dangerous planets in the Outer Rim Territories. By the\nrise of the Empire, Aeten II's cache of crystals had been all but depleted,\nmaking the manufacture of new stygium-based cloaking devices a near\nimpossibility. Prospectors looking to retool old mining facilities here have\nsince found other valuable resources to mine. Aeten II's only reference to Star\nWars is through Star Wars Empire at War.\n\nAf'El 'Af'El' is the homeworld to the Defel. It is a high-gravity planet with no\nozone layer and orbits the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. Because of the lack\nof ozone, ultraviolet light passes freely to the surface, while other light\nwavelengths are blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's atmosphere. Thus, all\nlife forms on Af'El can only see in ultraviolet light ranges, and are blind to\nother wavelengths of light.\n\nAgamar 'Agamar' is an agricultural world in the Outer Rim and home to the\nAgamarians which look like a large lizards, the older male Agamarians are a pale\nblue whereas the females are yellow.

The\nplanet is inhabited by the Chubbits, a small lizard-like species. The Chubbits\nhave always been neutral in Galactic affairs, avoiding the Clone Wars and the\nrise of the Empire. However, with many valuable resources under the planet's\nsurface, it could not avoid attention forever. When the Empire discovered the\nseemingly-endless amount of resources, Imperial mining teams rushed to exploit\nthem.

Many of the crystals used for\nmaking lightsabers are found deep underground on Arkania Prime, although the\npeople of the planet do not want to risk going deep underground, in fear of\nbeing crushed in rockslides or become lost, never to return to the surface.\nArkania Prime has three moons, the first, Vector, a fire pit, the second,\nTalikas, an icy, fridgid world that boasts no life, and third, Fellus, an\nunresearched or unexplored forest moon. Fellus has a lopsided orbit around\nArkania Prime, and once every twenty years scratches the surface of the planet.\nThe zone where Fellus brushes Arkania Prime is called the Dead Zone, because\nnothing lives here, including the natives. Arkania Prime is neutral in all\npolitical dealings, trusting their native republic to support the people.\n\nArtus Prime<!-- This section is linked from --> 'Artus Prime' is the location of\nan Imperial mine. The crystals mined there, used in conjunction with the well of\nForce power in the Valley of the Jedi, were able to infuse Imperial soldiers\nwith Force abilities. It was for this reason that the Dark Jedi Desann led the\nImperial Remnant to take control of the planet as a part of his Shadowtrooper\nproject. Desann had the miner colonists of Artus Prime used as part of his\nexperimentation at his research outpost on the planet Kejim. There, scientists\nperfected the shadow armour invented by Admiral Galak Fyyar.\n\nMon Mothma dispatched New Republic mercenaries Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors to Artus\nPrime to ascertain the fate of the colony. Once they discovered the Imperial\noccupation, the Republic fleet was called in and the planet re-secured. This\nrepresents a turning point in the plot of [[Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi\nOutcast]], when Jan Ors is captured and apparently killed by Tavion.\n\nAruza 'Aruza', inhabited by the Aruzans, is a peaceful world orbited by five\nmoons.

The timely rebellion by the Ssi-Ruuvi\nservants the P'w'ecks saved the day, but it was merely a plot by the Vong to\ndefeat the Ssi-Ruuk.\n\nBakura's only native sentient species is the Kurtzen, although its most populous\nsentient species is human. They are also known for their repulsorlift industry,\nthough the people are quite distrustful of droids.\n\nCount Dooku had a secret base on Bakura during the Clone Wars, where he captured\nJedi Knight Sora Bulq and turned him to the Dark Side of the Force.\n\nIn the game Star Wars Rogue Squadron III, Wedge Antilles led a strike force to\nBakura that freed Rebel prisoners from the Battle of Hoth.\n\nBakura manufactures some of the Galactic Empire's Star Destroyers.

With its sea-covered\nsurface speckled with small tropical beach islands, it could have been the most\ndesired tourist location in the galaxy. However, a tourist trade can hardly co-\nexist with a native noisome reptilian species known as the Kon'me. The sentient\nKon'me lived in simple thatch beachside dwellings, though the upper classes\nbuilt glistening bubble-like structures within the ocean-side cliffs.\n\nBal'demnic was largely undisturbed by matters of galactic consequence, until\nCommerce Guild scouts from the Confederacy of Independent Systems discovered\ntraces of cortosis in the planet's cliffs.\n\nUpon reaching Bal'demnic, the CIS delivered an ultimatum to the natives: let\nmining operations begin, or be destroyed. With little choice, Bal'demnic's\nleaders reluctantly allowed the Commerce Guild mining operations to set foot on\nthe islands. The beachfront citizens however, were furious and pockets of\nrebellion emerged\n\nWhen CIS transmissions were intercepted by the Jedi, Mace Windu was\nconcernedâcortosis is a rare ore that is resistant to the blade of a lightsaber.\nThe Jedi Council dispatched a task force including Halagad Ventor, Sha Koon, and\nseveral other Jedi, and a backup detachment of clones to investigate and\nsabotage the CIS operation.\n\nWhen the Jedi arrived on Bal'demnic, the planet was in chaos. The Kon'me had\nrebelled against the CIS and attacked with powerful weapons smuggled to them by\nunscrupulous war profiteers. After clones landed, the furious Kon'me were\nfurther enraged, and opened fire on all off-worlders.\n\nThe difficulty of the island terrain forced both the CIS and the Republic to\nretreat. With the CIS no longer actively harvesting the cortosis, the Republic\nleft an orbital protective fleet to guard against further Separatist incursions\non the planet.\n\nBalamak 'Balamak' was an agriworld in the Taldot sector which housed a vital\nHoloNet node, and provided most of the sector's agricultural resources.\n\nThe Battle of Balamak was fought in 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars, in which the\ncommunications jamming system set up there by the Separatists was neutralized by\nObi-Wan Kenobi, Adar Tallon, and the forces of the Galactic Republic.\n\nIn 25 ABY the Yuuzhan Vong invaded and occupied the world as they made their way\ntoward Hutt Space\n\nBalmorra 'Balmorra' is a war-torn planet during the time of the [[Sith Empire]]\nand the [[Galactic Republic]], 300 years after [[Darth Revan]] defeated [[Darth\nMalak]].

If a Jedi\nlearner isn't chosen to be a Padawan by the age of 13, they will be excluded\nfrom all further training and sent to Bandomeer or other planets like it to work\nwith the AgriCorps and grow crops. There are also several mining guilds on the\nplanet. Offworld Corporation is one of the more corrupt organizations with\noperations on the world.\n\nOn Bandomeer, Qui-Gon Jinn's former apprentice, Xanatos, attempts to take\nrevenge on him, but fails. Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent to Bandomeer, but is captured\nby mine lords. There, he is enslaved to work on mines and meets a friend who\nhelps him escape. Bandomeer has vast traces of valuable ionite, which scrambles\nelectronic fields. As well, Bandomeer has a large ocean which covers about half\nthe planet.<ref>Jude Watson, [[The Rising Force]], Book 1 of the [[Star Wars:\nJedi Apprentice|Jedi Apprentice]] series (1999).

During\ndaylight hours, the planet's dim red star gave off such radiation that most\nliving creatures, including the Barabels, were forced to take shelter in\nunderground tunnels or caverns. Only at night was it safe to venture out onto\nthe surface. Barab I was under the rule of the Empire until it was liberated\nby the New Republic. The planet, along with its inhabitants, was destroyed in\nthe Yuuzhan Vong invasion. The Jedi Knight Saba Sebatyne was responsible for\nthe deaths of what was thought at the time to be the last of the Barabels, an\nunintentional act. She destroys a Slaveship that was taking the prisoners\nfrom Barab I.\n\nBaralou 'Baralou' is a planet in the Baralou system, home to the Krikthasi and\nMultopos races, the Treppok and Grotseth creatures, and inhabited by humans. The\nplanet is mainly ocean, with rocky and tropical islands; much of the food for\nthe Rebel Alliance comes from the planet's algae.\n\nBarkhesh 'Barkhesh' is a tropical sparsely populated planet in the Mid Rim,\nwhich is home to a Rebel Alliance supply base because of its many resources. In\nthe video game [[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron]], the player, Luke, is required to\nescort some Rebel cargo craft through the planet's canyons to a rendezvous\npoint, because the Empire has set up a base on the other side of the canyons.\n\nBaroonda 'Baroonda' is a tropical world that was home to several podraces. It\nfeatures wide, sandy beaches, spectacular waterfalls, thick jungles, and\nnumerous volcanoes. Podrace tracks on this world include Baroo Coast, Grabvine\nGateway, Fire Mountain Rally and Inferno.<ref name=\"lucasarts\" />\n\nBassadro 'Bassadro' was a planet that was conquered by the CIS early in the\nClone Wars. The Republic sent clone troopers, under command of Jedi General\nEmpatojayos Brand, to retake the planet, and succeeded in doing so when the\nSeparatist commander surrendered.\n\nBastion 'Bastion' is the current capital world of the Imperial Remnant, and the\nsector capital for the far-flung Braxant Sector in the Outer Rim Territories.\n\"Bastion\" was originally a codename for the Imperial capital as it was moved\nrepeatedly as the Imperials were forced to retreat again and again during the\nGalactic Civil War. The original name for the planet now known as Bastion is\nSartinaynian, and the Sartinaynian system, which it lies in, was named after it\nbefore it was changed.\n\nBastion is a planet with varied climates, much like Earth in reality, and is\nsaid to be a fairly pleasant world, one of the few in Imperial space with\namenities comparable to Coruscant. It is also, however, a heavily defended\nposition, or \"fortress world\" as the Empire called such positions in the late\nstages of the Galactic Civil War. In addition to planetary deflector shield\ngenerators, Bastion is the home port of the Braxant Sector Fleet, which contains\na number of well-known Star Destroyers.\n\nDuring the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, the Imperial forces defending Bastion were\nheavily damaged and forced to retreat. In the ensuing chaos, the capital city of\nBastion, and the Remnant itself, was burned to the ground by Yuuzhan Vong\norbital strikes. Rebuilding efforts are still underway, and the loss of life was\ngreat, but when compared to the absolute devastation of worlds such as Myrkr,\nBastion was fortunate.\n\nDue to Bastion's destruction, the Empire was forced to see that to remain\nindependent from the rest of the Galaxy was foolish. The Empire joined the\nGalactic Alliance after their victory over the Vong at the Battle of Borosk.\n\nBastion was later turned into the most heavily fortified planet in the galaxy.\nAfter the sith (led by Darth Krayt) maneuvered the Imperial Remnant into\ndeclaring war on a weakened Galactic Alliance (ending with the Remnant\nrecapturing Coruscant), they tried to take the Imperial throne. But the emperor\nRoan Fel anticipated this, and after avoiding the sith for seven years, retook\nBastion, knowing the sith would not risk a frontal assault on the heavily\nfortified planet.\n\nBelasco 'Belasco' is the homeworld of Senator Uta S'orn, the childhood friend of\nJenna Zan Arbor. A wealthy planet with a rigid class system, Belasco was once\nruled by a royal family, but now a Leader is elected who then appoints his own\nCouncil. The capital city is Senta, where the old royal grounds are also\nlocated. Every seven years, a naturally-occurring bacteria invades the planet's\nwater supply from the Great Sea, and the Belascans prepare for this by\nstockpiling water.<ref>Jude Watson, [[The Dangerous Rescue]], Book 13 of the\nJedi Apprentice series (2001). ISBN 0-439-13932-5</ref>\n\nBelgaroth 'Belgaroth' is a planet in the Core Worlds that is covered in toxic\nwaste dumps, junkyards, and scrap yards. The planet was chosen as a proving\nground for Imperial weapons, but the residents didn't care, as it meant money\nand jobs. When the New Republic took control of the planet, the residents were\njust as happy with their rule as they were with the Imperials' rule.<ref\nname=\"lewis\" />\n\nBelkadan 'Belkadan' is the location of the outpost of ExGal-4. It was located in\nthe Dalonbian Sector in the far Outer Rim. Yomin Carr, a Yuuzhan Vong warrior,\nspent time on Belkadan studying the galaxy to prepare for the Yuuzhan Vong\ninvasion.

The capital is Ussa, a\npleasant city with seven large tranquil lakes. Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to Bellassa\nafter learning on Tatooine that one former Jedi, Ferus Olin, survived the Great\nJedi Purge.\n\nBelsavis 'Belsavis' is an ice-covered world located in the Outer Rim. At some\npoint it was used as a prison colony by the Rakata Empire. It was once again\nused as a prison by the Republic to hold Sith lords and war criminals during the\nGreat War. Jedi Master Plett attempted to hide Jedi younglings during the Great\nJedi Purge, and ultimately had to flee from Imperial interference.\n\nBerchest 'Berchest' is best known for its \"City of Glowing Crystal\" (Calius saj\nLeeloo), made from natural formations of red-orange salt deposits along the\ncoast of the Leefari Sea. After the Battle of Endor, Berchest remained under\nImperial control and Grand Admiral Thrawn, who threw off Luke Skywalker with\nfalse leads that Thrawn was massing his armies of clone troopers there. During\nhis investigation, Skywalker encountered Talon Karrde for the second time. Many\nglowing crystals are found on this planet, which can be put in a jedi's\nlightsaber. The most common ones are Sapith, Damind, green, blue, and red.\n\nBespin\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: -->\n\n'Bespin', seen in Episode , is the planet over which Cloud City hovers by means\nof an antigravity pod.

Weather on Bestine IV is generally known to be mild with occasional\nhurricanes sweeping across the planet's surface. The planet's population has\nstruggled for years to establish their settlements atop the planet's island\nspires to create an island paradise. More recently the planet has become\nincreasingly attractive due to Bestine's small but growing ship repair and\nconstruction industry, which can be credited to the planet's unique oceanic-\nbased shipyards that are designed primarily to quickly produce frigate-sized\nvessels. Bestine IV is also home to Jek Porkins and Zev Senesca and home to a\nlarge Imperial Base.\n\nBimmiel 'Bimmiel' was originally reported by Imperial scouts as being a\ntemperate world of grassy plains and cool deserts. However, it was later learned\nthat the scouts had come during the planet's closest pass to its sun, and that\nBimmiel actually had a highly elliptical orbit which froze the planet when it\nwas at its furthest from the sun. It was also discovered that the alien\ninvaders, the Yuuzhan Vong had established a spy post on Bimmiel some five\ndecades previously.\n\nSome centuries before 40 ABY, it is known that the ancient Sith Lord Darth\nVectivus lived on Bimmiel.\n\nBimmisaari 'Bimmisaari', the capital world of Halla Sector, is the homeworld of\nthe Bimm.

The\nentire Bogden system is overrun by criminal fugitives and smugglers. Bogden's\nmoon is, as the name implies, a swampy, boggy, mucky terrained world. It was\nfirst featured in the animated-series [[Star Wars: Droids]] and also expanded on\nlater in the video game [[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]].\n\nBogg V 'Bogg V' was one of Bogden's moons.

As ARC-170 starfighters\nbombed the attacking Separatist forces, Kenobi and Skywalker infiltrated\nSeparatist General Oro Dassyne's heavily-fortified command center and\ndeactivated its ray-shields. With its protection gone, the fort was devastated\nby a massive orbital bombardment, killing General Dassyne in the process.\n\nBonadan\n\n'Bonadan' is a planet that has long been one of the Outer Rim Corporate Sector\nAuthority's most important factory worlds and busiest ports.

Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered\nAsajj Ventress barely alive in a bacta tank inside a Separatist medical facility\nhidden on the planet. Ventress nearly died in the battle, but Kenobi refused to\ngive in to his own dark feelings and allowed her to live&mdash;only so she could\nescape capture and disappear.
