Its scope covers the taxonomy, nomenclature, identification,\ncharacterisation, culture preservation, phylogeny, evolution and biodiversity of\nall microorganisms, including prokaryotes, yeasts and yeast-like organisms,\nprotozoa and algae. The journal is currently published monthly by the Society\nfor General Microbiology, Reading, UK.\n\nAn official publication of the International Committee on Systematics of\nProkaryotes (ICSP; formerly the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology) [http://www.the-\nicsp.org/ International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes] (accessed 26\nSeptember 2007) and of the International Union of Microbiological\nSocieties (Bacteriology and Applied Microbiology\nDivision), [http://iums.org/Publications/index.html International Union of\nMicrobiological Societies: Publications] (accessed 8 August 2011) the\njournal is the single official international forum for the publication of new\nspecies names for prokaryotes.
