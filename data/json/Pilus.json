The terms pilus and [[fimbria\n(bacteriology)|fimbria]] (Latin for 'fringe'; plural: fimbriae) can be used\ninterchangeably, although some researchers reserve the term pilus for the\nappendage required for bacterial conjugation. All pili are primarily composed of\noligomeric pilin proteins.\n\nDozens of these structures can exist on the bacteria. Some bacterial viruses\nor bacteriophages attach to receptors on pili at the start of their\nreproductive cycle.\n\nPili are antigenic. They are also fragile and constantly replaced, sometimes\nwith pili of different composition, resulting in altered antigenicity. Specific\nhost responses to old pili structure are not effective on the new structure.\nRecombination genes of pili code for variable (V) and constant (C) regions of\nthe pili (similar to immunoglobulin diversity).\n","linknr":232,"url":"Pilus","recorded":1362511373,"links":31,"instances":["biochemistry","bacteriology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles","Bacteria"],"headings":["Types","Fimbriae","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Conjugation.svg/350px-Conjugation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["fimbria","bacteriology"]],"members":["receptor","fimbria"],"related":["Latin","Bacterium","Bacterial_conjugation","Oligomer","Pilin","Virus","Bacteriophage","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Reproduction","Antigenic","Immunoglobulin","DNA","Bacterial_conjugation","Sexual_reproduction","Fertility_factor","Nanometer","Mating_bridge","Plasmid","Selfish_DNA","Antibiotic_resistance","Motility","Flagella","Biofilm","Fimbria_(bacteriology)","Mutant","Disease","Lectins","Oligosaccharide","Extracellular_matrix","Gram-negative","Flagellum","Sortase","Bacterial_Nanowires"]}
