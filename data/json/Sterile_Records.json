With a background in the mail art networks, their intention\nwas to create and promote a new form of music. Sterile Recordsâ approach was a\ncombination of the experiments of musique concrÃ¨te and Fluxus combined with the\ncritical eye of conceptual art and the spontaneity and energy of punk rock. The\ndark humour of industrial music and the incomprehensible nonsense of various ultra-\nleftist political fractions were an essential part of the mix. Sterile Records\nused both commercial and non-commercial media to deliver anti-capitalist\nmessages, multi-coloured noise and information overload. Growing from cassette\nculture, output included records and videotapes. Caroline K left the label in\n1983. The October 2011 edition of Record Collector magazine published an article\nabout the significance of cassette culture in the UK and listing 21 rare but\nsought after cassette releases, including \"Standard Response\"\n\nIn 1986 the label was effectively dissolved as Ayers turned his attention to\nsetting up the Earthly Delights company.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Sterile_Records","recorded":1362674754,"links":14,"instances":["record_label","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["British record labels","Record labels established in 1979","Record labels disestablished in 1986","Industrial record labels"],"headings":["Discography","Artists","See also","External links","References","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ac/Sterilerecords.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["earthly_delights","record_label"],["spk","band"]],"members":["earthly_delights","spk"],"related":["Record_label","1979_in_music","Nigel_Ayers","Caroline_K","Industrial_music","Nocturnal_Emissions","Mail_art","Musique_concrète","Fluxus","Conceptual_art","Punk_rock","Industrial_music","Ultra-left","Anti-capitalist","Information_overload","Cassette_culture","Gramophone_record","Videotapes","Caroline_K","1986_in_music","Earthly_Delights_(record_label)","Ian_Bone","Annie_Anxiety","Bourbonese_Qualk","Controlled_Bleeding","Cultural_Amnesia","The_Hafler_Trio","Konstruktivits","Lustmord","Maurizio_Bianchi","Nocturnal_Emissions","SPK_(band)","List_of_record_labels","Cassette_Culture"]}
