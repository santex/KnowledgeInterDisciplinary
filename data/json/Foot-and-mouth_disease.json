The virus causes a high fever for\ntwo or three days, followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet that\nmay rupture and cause lameness.\n\nFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a severe plague for animal farming, since it is\nhighly infectious and can be spread by infected animals through aerosols,\nthrough contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing or feed,\nand by domestic and wild predators. Its containment demands\nconsiderable efforts in vaccination, strict monitoring, trade restrictions and\nquarantines, and occasionally the elimination of millions of animals.\n\nSusceptible animals include cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs,\nantelope, deer, and bison. It has also been known to infect hedgehogs and\nelephants; [http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/-\ndisemala/fmdfie/plan/plan-1e.shtml Canadian Food Inspection Agency - Animal\nProducts - Foot-and-Mouth Disease Hazard Specific Plan] J. D. McLauchlan, W. M. Henderson 'The Occurrence of Foot-and-\nMouth Disease in the Hedgehog under Natural Conditions', The Journal of\nHygiene, Vol. 45, No. 4 (Dec., 1947), pp. 474-479 llamas, and alpacas may\ndevelop mild symptoms, but are resistant to the disease and do not pass it on\nto others of the same species. In laboratory experiments,\nmice, rats, and chickens have been successfully infected by artificial means,\nbut they are not believed to contract the disease under natural conditions. Humans are very rarely infected.\n\nThe virus responsible for the disease is a picornavirus, the prototypic member\nof the genus [[Aphthovirus]]. Infection occurs when the virus particle is taken\ninto a cell of the host. The cell is then forced to manufacture thousands of\ncopies of the virus, and eventually bursts, releasing the new particles in the\nblood. The virus is genetically highly variable, which limits the\neffectiveness of vaccination.\n","linknr":721,"url":"Foot-and-mouth_disease","recorded":1362501425,"links":80,"instances":["dermatology","biology","biology","biology","village"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070710084841/http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/ts/zoo/foot-and-mouth-disease.pdf","http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/ts/zoo/foot-and-mouth-disease.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070710084841/http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/ts/zoo/foot-and-mouth-disease.pdf","http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS20890.pdf","http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fadrep.pdf","http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/fmd/documents/fmdorigins1.pdf","https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/foot_and_mouth_disease.pdf"],"categories":["Animal diseases","Animal virology","Bovine diseases","Picornaviruses","Sheep and goat diseases","Viral diseases"],"headings":["History","Clinical signs","Evolution","Transmission","Foot-and-mouth disease infecting humans","Vaccination","Epizootics","Economic and ethical issues","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Foot_and_mouth_disease_in_mouth.jpg/230px-Foot_and_mouth_disease_in_mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Foot_and_mouth_disease_in_swine.jpg/170px-Foot_and_mouth_disease_in_swine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Plum_Island_Animal_Disease_Center.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["virus","biology"],["vesicle","dermatology"],["cell","biology"],["strain","biology"],["kosti","village"]],"members":["vesicle","strain","cell","virus","kosti"],"related":["ILDS","Infectious_disease","Virus_(biology)","Disease","Cloven-hoof","Animals","Bovidae","Vesicle_(dermatology)","Lameness","Animal_farming","Aerosol","Predator","Vaccine","Trade_restriction","Quarantine","Cattle","Domestic_water_buffalo","Domestic_sheep","Goat","Pig","Antelope","Deer","Bison","Hedgehog","Elephant","Llama","Alpaca","Mice","Rats","Chicken","Foot-and-mouth_disease_virus","Picornavirus","Cell_(biology)","Friedrich_Loeffler","Blood","Chamberland_filter","World_War_II","Asia","Africa","South_America","Chile","Uruguay","Argentina","North_America","Australia","New_Zealand","Europe","European_Union","Vaccination","2001_UK_foot-and-mouth_crisis","Great_Britain","United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001","Isle_of_Man_TT","Epizootic","Republic_of_Ireland","Co._Louth","Surrey","GIS","Agricultural","Fever","Milk","Myocarditis","Asymptomatic","Asymptomatic_carrier","Fomite","Dog","Wolves","Soviet_Union","Continental_Europe","Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease","Coxsackie_A","Epizootic","Serotype","Strain_(biology)","DNA","Vaccine","Immune_system","OIE","Vaccine","Protein","Genetic_engineering","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Plum_Island_Animal_Disease_Center","Michigan","Epizootic","Deer","Montebello,_California","Argentina","Shropshire","Hsinchu","Taiwan","Swine_vesicular_disease","Electric_shock","United_Kingdom","Cumbria","Shandong","Jiangsu","Hebei","Xinjiang","Autonomous_regions_of_China","Northwest_China","World_Health_Organization","Gansu","Qinghai","Xinjiang","Yak","United_Kingdom","Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","Normandy,_Surrey","Surrey","Institute_for_Animal_Health","Merial","Pirbright","Egham","Surrey","BBC_News","BBC_News","Solihull","Defra","Japan","South_Korea","Andong","Gyeongsangbuk-do","South_Korea","North_Korea","Pyongyang","Wild_boar","Bulgaria","Turkey","Kosti_(village)","Burgas_Province","Strandzha_Mountains","Quarantine","Rezovo","Cattle","Gramatikovo","Granichar,_Burgas_Province","Kirovo,_Bulgaria","Animal_virology","Hand,_foot_and_mouth_disease","Swine_vesicular_disease","Center_for_Infectious_Disease_Research_and_Policy","Abigail_Wood","University_of_Manchester"]}
