It is often required to\n'interpolate' (i.e. estimate) the value of that function for an intermediate\nvalue of the independent variable. This may be achieved by curve fitting or\nregression analysis.\n\nA different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the\napproximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the\nformula for some given function is known, but too complex to evaluate\nefficiently. A few known data points from the original function can be used to\ncreate an interpolation based on a simpler function. Of course, when a simple\nfunction is used to estimate data points from the original, interpolation errors\nare usually present; however, depending on the problem domain and the\ninterpolation method used, the gain in simplicity may be of greater value than\nthe resultant loss in accuracy.\n\nThere is also another very different kind of interpolation in mathematics,\nnamely the \"interpolation of operators\". The classical results about\ninterpolation of operators are the Riesz–Thorin theorem and the Marcinkiewicz\ntheorem. There are also many other subsequent results.\n\n.
