It can produce a variety\nof symptoms and effects but the principal problems arise from an inadequate\nsupply of glucose to the brain, resulting in impairment of function\n(neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues\nsuch as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage or\ndeath.\n\nThe most common forms of hypoglycemia occur as a complication of treatment of\ndiabetes mellitus with insulin or oral medications. Hypoglycemia is less\ncommon in non-diabetic persons, but can occur at any age. Among the causes\nare excessive insulin produced in the body (hyperinsulinemia), inborn error\nof metabolism, medications and poisons, alcohol, hormone deficiencies,\nprolonged starvation, alterations of metabolism associated with infection,\nand organ failure.\n\nHypoglycemia is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the\ningestion or administration of dextrose or carbohydrate foods. In more severe\ncircumstances it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon. Recurrent\nhypoglycemia may be prevented by reversing or removing the underlying cause, by\nincreasing the frequency of meals, with medications like diazoxide, octreotide,\nor glucocorticoids, or by surgical removal of much of the pancreas.\n\nThe level of blood glucose low enough to define hypoglycemia may be different\nfor different people, in different circumstances, and for different purposes,\nand occasionally has been a matter of controversy. Most healthy adults maintain\nfasting glucose levels above 4.0 mmol/L (72 mg/dl), and develop symptoms of\nhypoglycemia when the glucose falls below 4 mmol/L. It can sometimes be difficult to determine whether a\nperson's symptoms are due to hypoglycemia. Criteria referred to as Whipple's\ntriad are used to determine a diagnosis of hypoglycemia: #Symptoms known to be caused by hypoglycemia #Low\nglucose at the time the symptoms occur #Reversal or improvement of symptoms or\nproblems when the glucose is restored to normal\n\nHypoglycemia (common usage) is also a term in popular culture and alternative\nmedicine for a common, often self-diagnosed, condition characterized by\nshakiness and altered mood and thinking, but without measured low glucose or\nrisk of severe harm. It is treated by changing eating patterns.\n","linknr":528,"url":"Hypoglycemia","recorded":1362482032,"links":49,"instances":["motivational_state","medical","tests","medical","common_usage","journal","tests","physical","emotion"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_CHD_97.1.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1997/WHO_CHD_97.1.pdf"],"categories":["Disorders of endocrine pancreas","Medical emergencies"],"headings":["Definition","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology of hypoglycemia","Diagnosis","Prevention","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Glucose_test.JPG/230px-Glucose_test.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoglycemia","common_usage"],["hunger","motivational_state"],["rage","emotion"],["fatigue","physical"],["automatism","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["sensitivity","tests"],["specificity","tests"],["diabetic_hypoglycemia","journal"]],"members":["hunger","hypoxia","specificity","automatism","hypoglycemia","diabetic_hypoglycemia","sensitivity","fatigue","rage"],"related":["Glucose_meter","American_and_British_English_differences","Hyperglycemia","Glucose","Blood","Greek_language","Symptoms","Human_brain","Neuroglycopenia","Dysphoria","Seizures","Unconsciousness","Brain_damage","Death","Diabetes_mellitus","Insulin","Oral_hypoglycemic_agent","Hyperinsulinism","Hyperinsulinemia","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Medication","Poison","Alcohol","Hormone","Starvation","Metabolism","Infection","Dextrose","Glucagon","Meal","Medication","Diazoxide","Octreotide","Glucocorticoid","Surgery","Pancreas","Fasting","Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests","Whipple's_triad","Hypoglycemia_(common_usage)","Alternative_medicine","Whipple's_triad","Liter","Molar_mass","Blood_glucose","Vein","Blood_plasma","Glucose_oxidase","Medical_laboratory","Artery","Venous","Capillary","Glucose_meter","Fingerstick","Hematocrit","Phlebotomy","Polycythemia","Sodium_fluoride","Leukocytosis","Hormone","Adrenaline","Glucagon","Dysphoria","Neuroglycopenia","Diabetic_hypoglycemia","Epinephrine","Neuroglycopenic","Anxiety","Palpitation","Tachycardia","Sweat","Pallor","Dilated_pupils","Paresthesia","Hunger_(motivational_state)","Borborygmus","Nausea","Vomiting","Abdominal_pain","Headache","Rage_(emotion)","Fatigue_(physical)","Lethargy","Sleep","Amnesia","Delirium","Diplopia","Automatism_(medical)","Ataxia","Drunkenness","Paralysis","Hemiparesis","Paresthesia","Headache","Seizure","Ketosis","Mania","Stroke","Myoclonic_jerk","Cyanosis","Apnea","Hypothermia","Hypotonia","Asphyxia","Hypocalcemia","Sepsis","Heart_failure","Neuroglycopenia","Glycogen_storage_disease","Hospital","Intensive_care_unit","Iatrogenesis","Hospital","Emergency_department","Hyperglycemia","Premature_birth","Intrauterine_growth_retardation","Perinatal_asphyxia","Diabetes","Congenital_hyperinsulinism","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Gastroenteritis","Diarrhea","Rotavirus","Ketotic_hypoglycemia","Growth_hormone_deficiency","Hyperinsulinemic_hypoglycemia","Glutamate_dehydrogenase_1","Gastric_dumping_syndrome","Maple_syrup_urine_disease","Glycogen_storage_disease","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase_deficiency","Disorders_of_fatty_acid_oxidation","Medium_chain_acylCoA_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Sulfonylurea","Propranolol","Type_1_diabetes","Reactive_hypoglycemia","Idiopathic_postprandial_syndrome","Orthostatic_hypotension","Hyperventilation","Munchausen_syndrome","Addison's_disease","Sepsis","Munchausen_syndrome","Anti-diabetic_medication","Insulinoma","Ketoacidosis","Dumping_syndrome","Reactive_hypoglycemia","Doege-Potter_syndrome","Adrenal_insufficiency","Hypopituitarism","Metabolism","Glycogen","Astrocyte","Central_nervous_system","Neuron","Glycogenolysis","Gluconeogenesis","Diabetic_coma","Hypoxia_(medical)","Ketosis","Glucose_tolerance_test","Sensitivity_(tests)","Specificity_(tests)","Cornstarch","Hyperinsulinemic_hypoglycemia","Diazoxide","Octreotide","Glucosidase_inhibitor","Starch","Caffeine","Carbohydrate","Starch","Acarbose","American_Diabetes_Association","Intramuscular_injection","Diabetic_hypoglycemia","Acarbose","Alpha-glucosidase_inhibitor","Monosaccharide","Diabetic_Hypoglycemia_(journal)","Idiopathic_hypoglycemia","Spontaneous_hypoglycemia"]}
