{"cursor":"10888","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Sympatric speciation' is the process through which new species evolve from a\nsingle ancestral species while inhabiting the same geographic region. In\nevolutionary biology and biogeography, sympatric and sympatry are terms\nreferring to organisms whose ranges overlap or are even identical, so that they\noccur together at least in some places. If these organisms are closely related\n(e.g. sister species), such a distribution may be the result of sympatric\nspeciation. Etymologically, sympatry is derived from the Greek roots ÏÏÎ½\n(\"together\", \"with\") and ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¯Ï (\"homeland\" or \"fatherland\"). http://www.greek-\nlanguage.gr/greekLang/index.html The term was invented by Poulton in 1904,\nwho explains the derivation.

What is a species?\nProceedings of the Entomological Society of London 1903:lxxvii-cxvi.\n\nSympatric speciation is one of three traditional geographic categories for the\nphenomenon of speciation.

Journal of Evolutionary Biology 21: 1452-\n1459. Allopatric speciation is the evolution of geographically isolated\npopulations into distinct species. In this case, divergence is facilitated by\nthe absence of gene flow, which tends to keep populations genetically similar.\nParapatric speciation is the evolution of geographically adjacent populations\ninto distinct species. In this case, divergence occurs despite limited\ninterbreeding where the two diverging groups come into contact. In sympatric\nspeciation, there is no geographic constraint to interbreeding. These categories\nare special cases of a continuum from zero (sympatric) to complete (allopatric)\nspatial segregation of diverging groups.\n\nIn multicellular eukaryotic organisms, sympatric speciation is thought to be an\nuncommon but plausible process by which genetic divergence (through reproductive\nisolation) of various populations from a single parent species and inhabiting\nthe same geographic region leads to the creation of new species.

In bacteria, however, the analogous\nprocess (defined as \"the origin of new bacterial species that occupy definable\necological niches\") might be more common because bacteria are less constrained\nby the homogenizing effects of sexual reproduction and prone to comparatively\ndramatic and rapid genetic change through horizontal gene transfer.\n","linknr":412,"url":"Sympatric_speciation","recorded":1362483552,"links":40,"instances":["galapagos","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.gaianicaragua.org/geiger_et_al_2010.pdf","http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/2/121.full.pdf"],"categories":["Ecology","Evolutionary biology","Speciation","Scientific classification","Taxonomy"],"headings":["Evidence","Controversy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Speciation_modes.svg/350px-Speciation_modes.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["range","biology"],["santa_cruz_island","galapagos"],["host","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["santa_cruz_island","polymorphism","range","host"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Biogeography","Sympatry","Range_(biology)","Sister_species","Speciation","Etymological","Allopatric_speciation","Parapatric_speciation","Eukaryotes","Reproductive_isolation","Ecological_niche","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Peripatric_speciation","Parapatric_speciation","Speciation","Disruptive_selection","John_Maynard_Smith","Homozygote","Allele","Heterozygote","Natural_selection","Sexual_conflict","Thierry_Lodé","Darwin's_Finches","Santa_Cruz_Island_(Galapagos)","Magic_trait","Phenotype","Bird_call","Large-eared_horseshoe_bat","Host_(biology)","Antipredator_adaptation","Apple_maggot","Heteropatry","Crataegus","North_America","Crataegus","Amphilophus","Allochrony","Sister_taxon","Homologous_chromosome","Chromosomes","Polyploidy","Orca","European_Polecat","Mink","Thierry_Lodé","Ernst_Mayr","Polymorphism_(biology)","Ecotype","Polyploidy","Adaptive_radiation","Hybrid_speciation","Cladistics","Phylogenetics","Taxonomy","Wallace_effect"]}
