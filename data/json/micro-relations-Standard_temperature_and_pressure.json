{"cursor":"21452","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Standard conditions for temperature and pressure' are standard sets of\nconditions for experimental measurements established to allow comparisons to be\nmade between different sets of data. The most used standards are those of the\nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), although these are not universally\naccepted standards. Other organizations have established a variety of\nalternative definitions for their standard reference conditions.\n\nIn chemistry, IUPAC established 'standard temperature and pressure' (informally\nabbreviated as 'STP') as a temperature of 273.15 K (0 Â°C, 32 Â°F)\nand an absolute pressure of 100 kPa (14.504 psi, 0.986 atm, 1 bar). ) was changed to 100 kPa in 1982. IUPAC recommends that the\nformer pressure should be discontinued.}} An unofficial, but commonly\nused, standard is 'standard [[ambient temperature]] and pressure' ('SATP') as a\ntemperature of 298.15 K (25 Â°C, 77 Â°F) and an absolute pressure\nof 100 kPa (14.504 psi, 0.986 atm). The 'STP' and the 'SATP' should not be\nconfused with the standard state commonly used in thermodynamic evaluations of\nthe Gibbs energy of a reaction.\n\nNIST uses a temperature of 20 Â°C (293.15 K, 68 Â°F) and an\nabsolute pressure of 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi, 1 atm). The\nInternational Standard Metric Conditions for natural gas and similar fluids are\nand 101.325 kPa.\n\nIn industry and commerce, standard conditions for temperature and pressure are\noften necessary to define the standard reference conditions to express the\nvolumes of gases and liquids and related quantities such as the rate of\nvolumetric flow (the volumes of gases vary significantly with temperature and\npressure). However, many technical publications (books, journals, advertisements\nfor equipment and machinery) simply state \"standard conditions\" without\nspecifying them, often leading to confusion and errors. Good practice is to\nalways incorporate the reference conditions of temperature and pressure.\n","linknr":379,"url":"Standard_temperature_and_pressure","recorded":1362482227,"links":83,"instances":["unit","unit","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05910.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05910.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05921.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05921.pdf","http://www.nord-stream.com/uploads/media/Nord_Stream_Route_Status_ENGLISH.pdf","http://www.nord-stream.com/uploads/media/Nord_Stream_Route_Status_ENGLISH.pdf","http://reports.eea.eu.int/EMEPCORINAIR3/en/B521vs3.1.pdf","http://reports.eea.eu.int/EMEPCORINAIR3/en/B521vs3.1.pdf","http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20051500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/julqtr/pdf/40cfr60.2.pdf","http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.01/PDFs/2003/j80wri.pdf","http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.01/PDFs/2003/j80wri.pdf","http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20051500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2005/julqtr/pdf/40cfr50.3.pdf","http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/papers/authors/Metric_Standard.pdf","http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/papers/authors/Metric_Standard.pdf","http://www.aqmd.gov/rules/reg/reg01/r102.pdf","http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/pdf/ASB2004.pdf","http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/pdf/ASB2004.pdf","http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/natgas/013104.pdf","http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/natgas/013104.pdf","http://www.greenheck.com/pdf/centrifugal/Plug.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2003.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aviation/pilot_handbook/media/PHAK%20-%20Chapter%2003.pdf"],"categories":["Atmospheric thermodynamics","Aerodynamics","Chemical engineering","Environmental engineering","Gases","Measurement","Mechanical engineering","Physical chemistry","Standards","Thermodynamics"],"headings":["Definitions","International Standard Atmosphere","Standard laboratory conditions","Molar volume of a gas","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/4/e0412dbb6e50de76a383b8f6e7d81dce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/2/7/6278dfc80a51f30ef59dde137b7420d7.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pascal","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["bar","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["bar","atmosphere","mole","pascal"],"related":["Technical_standard","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Temperature","Kelvin","Absolute_pressure","Pascal_(unit)","Pound-force_per_square_inch","Atmosphere_(unit)","Bar_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","Temperature","Kelvin","Absolute_pressure","Pascal_(unit)","Pound-force_per_square_inch","Standard_state","Gibbs_free_energy","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Industry","Commerce","Volumetric_flow","Pascal_(unit)","Atmosphere_(unit)","Torr","Imperial_units","United_States_customary_units","Pound-force_per_square_inch","International_Organization_for_Standardization","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","IUPAC","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","IUPAC","ICAO","International_Standard_Atmosphere","European_Environment_Agency","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Compressed_Air_and_Gas_Institute","Society_of_Petroleum_Engineers","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","SCAQMD","Organization_of_Petroleum_Exporting_Countries","Energy_Information_Administration","Air_Movement_and_Control_Association","Federal_Aviation_Administration","Aeronautics","Fluid_dynamics","International_Standard_Atmosphere","U.S._Standard_Atmosphere","Laboratory","New_South_Wales","Australia","ASTM_International","Technical_standard","Test_method","Standards_organization","Universal_gas_law","Pascal_(unit)","Amount_of_substance","Mole_(unit)","Kelvin","Gas_constant","US_Standard_Atmosphere","Atmospheric_models","Environmental_chamber","ISO_1","Standard_Dry_Air","Standard_state","IUPAC","IUPAC","IUPAC","IUPAC"]}
