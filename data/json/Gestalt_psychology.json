{"cursor":"33039","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n'Gestalt psychology' or 'gestaltism ' ( â \"essence or shape of an\nentity's complete form\") is a theory of mind and brain of the Berlin School; the\noperational principle of gestalt psychology is that the brain is holistic,\nparallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies. The principle maintains\nthat the human eye sees objects in their entirety before perceiving their\nindividual parts, suggesting the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nGestalt psychology tries to understand the laws of our ability to acquire and\nmaintain stable percepts in a noisy world. Gestalt psychologists stipulate that\nperception is the product of complex interactions among various stimuli.\nContrary to the behaviorist approach to understanding the elements of cognitive\nprocesses, gestalt psychologists sought to understand their organization\n(Carlson and Heth, 2010). The 'gestalt effect ' is the form-\ngenerating capability of our senses, particularly with respect to the visual\nrecognition of figures and whole forms instead of just a collection of simple\nlines and curves. In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism.\nThe phrase \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts\" is often used when\nexplaining gestalt theory, David Hothersall: History of Psychology, chapter\nseven,(2004) though this is a mistranslation of Kurt Koffka's original\nphrase, \"The whole is other than the sum of the parts\". Gestalt\ntheory allows for the breakup of elements from the whole situation into what it\nreally is. Humphrey, G. (1924). The psychology of the gestalt.
