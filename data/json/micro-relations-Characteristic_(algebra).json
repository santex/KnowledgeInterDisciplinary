{"cursor":"7398","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, the 'characteristic' of a ring R, often denoted char(R), is\ndefined to be the smallest number of times one must use the ring's\nmultiplicative identity element (1) in a sum to get the additive identity\nelement (0); the ring is said to have characteristic zero if this repeated sum\nnever reaches the additive identity.\n\nThat is, char(R) is the smallest positive number n such that\n\n: \\underbrace{1+\\cdots+1}_{n \\text{ summands}} = 0\n\nif such a number n exists, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe characteristic may also be taken to be the exponent of the ring's additive\ngroup, that is, the smallest positive n such that\n\n: \\underbrace{a+\\cdots+a}_{n \\text{ summands}} = 0\n\nfor every element a of the ring (again, if n exists; otherwise zero).
