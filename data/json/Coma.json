{"cursor":"33745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n{{SignSymptom infobox\n | Name = Coma ICD10 = ICD9 =\n}}\n\nIn medicine, a 'coma' (from the Greek koma, meaning deep sleep) is a state of\nunconsciousness lasting more than six hours, in which a person:\ncannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or\nsound; lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle; and, does not initiate voluntary\nactions. A person in a state of coma is described as being\n'comatose'.\n\nAlthough a coma patient may appear to be awake, they are unable to consciously\nfeel, speak, hear, or move. For a patient to maintain consciousness,\ntwo important neurological components must function impeccably. The first is the\ncerebral cortex which is the gray matter covering the outer layer of the brain.\nThe other is a structure located in the brainstem, called reticular activating\nsystem (RAS or ARAS).\n\nInjury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to\nexperience a coma. The cerebral cortex is a group of tight, dense, \"gray matter\"\ncomposed of the nucleus of the neurons whose axons then form the \"white matter\",\nand is responsible for perception, relay of the sensory input (sensation) via\nthe thalamic pathway, and most importantly directly or indirectly in charge of\nall the neurological functions, from simple reflexes to complex thinking.\n\nRAS, on the other hand, is a more primitive structure in the brainstem that is\ntightly in connection with reticular formation (RF). The RAS area of the brain\nhas two tracts, the ascending and descending tract. Made up of a system of acetylcholine-\nproducing neurons, the ascending track, or ascending reticular activating system\n(ARAS), works to arouse and wake up the brain, from the RF, through the\nthalamus, and then finally to the cerebral cortex. A failure in ARAS functioning may then lead to a coma. It is\ntherefore necessary to investigate the integrity of the cerebral cortices, as\nwell as that of the reticular activating system (RAS) in a comatose patient.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Coma","recorded":1362503061,"links":82,"instances":["physiology","kinesiology","medical","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_%202009.pdf","http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/daltrozzo_et_al_2007a.pdf","http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_2010b.pdf","http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf","http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf"],"categories":["Intensive care medicine","Emergency medicine","Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Causes","Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis and findings","Prognosis","Treatment and recovery","Society and culture","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Aaron_in_Coma1.jpg/160px-Aaron_in_Coma1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Comaventilator.jpg/160px-Comaventilator.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Decorticate.PNG/220px-Decorticate.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg/8px-Rod_of_Asclepius2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"],["cortex","anatomy"],["respiration","physiology"],["extension","kinesiology"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["respiration","extension","hypoxia","cortex"],"related":["Medicine","Greek_language","Unconsciousness","Cerebral_cortex","Brainstem","Reticular_activating_system","Reflex","Reticular_formation","Substance_intoxication","Metabolism","Stroke","Herniation","Hypoxia_(medical)","Hypothermia","Hypoglycemia","Head_trauma","Vehicle_collision","Induced_coma","Brain_trauma","Tactile","Glasgow_Coma_Scale","Hypoglycemia","Hypercapnia","Carbon_dioxide","Obtundation","Traumatic_brain_injury","Subarachnoid_hemorrhage","Physical_examination","EEG","Level_of_consciousness","AVPU","Glasgow_Coma_Scale","Asphyxiation","Airway_management","Oropharyngeal_airway","Nasopharyngeal_airway","Endotracheal_tube","Lesion","Red_nucleus","Brain_stem","Cortex_(anatomy)","Decerebrate_posturing","Vital_signs","Respiration_(physiology)","Body_habitus","Oculocephalic_reflex","Caloric_reflex_test","Corneal_reflex","Gag_reflex","Cheyne-Stokes","Hyperventilation","Apnea","Apneustic_breathing","Inhalation","Pons","Ataxic_respiration","Medulla_oblongata","Decorticate_posturing","Flexion","Extension_(kinesiology)","Decerebrate_posturing","Red_nucleus","Oculocephalic_reflex","Medial_longitudinal_fasciculus","Caloric_reflex_test","Nystagmus","Cranial_nerves","Gag_reflex","Parasympathetic","Corneal_reflex","Orbicularis_oculi","Heroin","Oculomotor_nerve","Hypothermia","Hypoxia_(medical)","Computed_tomography","MRI","Hemorrhage","Herniation","EEG","Seizures","Skin_Conductance_Response","Fred_Plum","Jerome_B._Posner","Tentorium_cerebelli","Tentorium_cerebelli","Tentorium_cerebelli","Rancho_Los_Amigos_Scale","Persistent_vegetative_state","Dysarthria","Statistical","Brain_damage","Infection","Pneumonia","Minimally_conscious_state","Terry_Wallis","Poland","Jan_Grzebski","Deep_brain_stimulation","Minimally_conscious_state","Post-traumatic_amnesia","Decubitus_ulcers","Atelectasis","Pulmonary_aspiration","Aspiration_pneumonia","Contractures","Brain_death","Coma_scale","Locked-in_syndrome","Persistent_vegetative_state","Process_Oriented_Coma_Work"]}
