The population was 15,370 at the 2010 census. It is the only\nincorporated Hereford in the country.\n\nHereford's local water supply contains an unusually high level of naturally\noccurring fluorine. Because fluoride is used to protect against tooth decay,\nHereford earned the title \"The Town Without a Toothache\".\n\nIt is also known as the \"Beef Capital of the World\" because of the large number\nof cattle fed in the area. The city is named for the Hereford breed. The local\neconomy is affected significantly by growth in the dairy and ethanol industries.\n\nThe area is known for its semiarid climate with heavy farming and ranching\nthroughout the area sustained by irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer and the\nsaltier Santa Rosa Aquifer beneath it.\n\nHereford is home to the headquarters of the Deaf Smith Electric Cooperative,\nwhich serves Deaf Smith, Castro, Parmer, and Oldham\nCounties.

The restored historic\nstructure can now be seen at the National Ranching Heritage Center at Texas Tech\nUniversity. The Deaf Smith County Historical Museum at 400 Sampson Street in\nHereford offers indoor and outdoor exhibits on the settlement of West Texas.\n","linknr":635,"url":"Hereford,_Texas","recorded":1362508800,"links":38,"instances":["cattle","united_states_census","farmer"],"pdf":["http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/tx/414098.pdf","http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/tx/414098.pdf"],"categories":["Cities in Texas","County seats in Texas","Micropolitan areas of Texas","Populated places in Deaf Smith County, Texas","Populated places in Texas with Hispanic majority populations"],"headings":["Notable people","Geography","Climate","Demographics","Education","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hereford%2C_TX%2C_welcome_sign_IMG_4834.JPG/250px-Hereford%2C_TX%2C_welcome_sign_IMG_4834.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/TXMap-doton-Hereford.PNG/250px-TXMap-doton-Hereford.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Deaf_Smith_County_Hereford.svg/250px-Deaf_Smith_County_Hereford.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/First_Bank_Southwest%2C_Hereford%2C_%27TX_IMG_4848.JPG/200px-First_Bank_Southwest%2C_Hereford%2C_%27TX_IMG_4848.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/St._Anthony%27s_Catholic_Church%2C_Hereford%2C_TX_IMG_4895.JPG/200px-St._Anthony%27s_Catholic_Church%2C_Hereford%2C_TX_IMG_4895.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Map_of_Texas_highlighting_Deaf_Smith_County.svg/100px-Map_of_Texas_highlighting_Deaf_Smith_County.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hereford","disambiguation"],["hereford","cattle"],["frank_ford","farmer"],["race","united_states_census"]],"members":["hereford","race","frank_ford"],"related":["City","U.S._Route_385","List_of_countries","United_States","Political_divisions_of_the_United_States","Texas","List_of_counties_in_Texas","Deaf_Smith_County,_Texas","United_States_Census,_2000","North_American_Central_Time_Zone","ZIP_code","Area_code_806","Federal_Information_Processing_Standard","Geographic_Names_Information_System","Deaf_Smith_County,_Texas","Texas","United_States","2010_United_States_Census","Hereford_(disambiguation)","Fluorine","Fluoride","Hereford_(cattle)","Ethanol","Semiarid","Ogallala_Aquifer","Santa_Rosa_Aquifer","Deaf_Smith_Electric_Cooperative","Deaf_Smith_County,_Texas","Castro_County,_Texas","Parmer_County,_Texas","Oldham_County,_Texas","XIT_Ranch","National_Ranching_Heritage_Center","Texas_Tech_University","Deaf_Smith_County_Historical_Museum","Frank_Ford_(farmer)","Nutritionist","Arrowhead_mills","Maize","Wheat","Pesticide","Ron_Ely","Tarzan","NBC","Television_series","Clint_Formby","Radio","KPAN-FM","Marshall_Formby","Texas_State_Senate","West_Texas","Margaret_Formby","National_Cowgirl_Museum_and_Hall_of_Fame","Fort_Worth,_Texas","Edgar_Mitchell","Astronaut","Apollo_14","Oliver_C._Thomas","World_War_II","Prisoner_of_war","Lubbock,_Texas","Dallas,_Texas","Joe_Castillo_Staton","US_Navy","Private_Sailor","Barrett_Wayne_Weishaar","United_States_Census_Bureau","Steppe_climate","KÃ¶ppen_climate_classification","Semi-arid","The_Weather_Channel","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","Census","Population_density","Race_(United_States_Census)","Marriage","Per_capita_income","Poverty_line","Catholic","U.S._Route_385","Hereford_Independent_School_District"]}
