Rhamnaceae\nhave a worldwide distribution, but are more common in the subtropical and\ntropical regions. The earliest fossil evidence of Rhamnaceae is from the Eocene.\n\nThe simple leaves can be either alternate and spiraling, or opposite. Stipules\nare present. These leaves are modified into spines in many genera, in some (e.g.\n[[Paliurus spina-christi]] and [[Colletia]] cruciata) spectacularly so. Colletia\nstands out by having two axillary buds instead of one, one developing into a\nthorn, the other one into a shoot.\n\n'']] The flowers are radially symmetrical. There are 5 (sometimes 4) separate\nsepals and 5 (sometimes 4 or none) separate petals. The petals may be white,\nyellowish, greenish, pink or blue, and are small and inconspicuous in most\ngenera, though in some (e.g. Ceanothus) the dense clusters of flowers are\nconspicuous. The 5 or 4 stamens are isomerous with the petals (i.e. one stamen\nopposite each petal). The ovary is superior, with 2 or 3 ovules (or one by\nabortion).\n\nThe fruits are mostly berries, fleshy drupes or nuts. Some are adapted to wind\ncarriage, but most are dispersed by mammals and birds. Chinese jujube is the\nfruit of the jujube tree (Ziziphus zizyphus) and is a major fruit in China.\n\nThe American genus [[Ceanothus]], which has several showy ornamental species,\nhas nitrogen-fixing root nodules.\n\nEconomic uses of Rhamnaceae are chiefly as ornamental plants and as the source\nof many brilliant green and yellow dyes. The wood of [[Buckthorn|Rhamnus]] was\nalso the most favoured species to make charcoal for use in gunpowder before the\ndevelopment of modern propellants.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Rhamnaceae","recorded":1362584133,"links":47,"instances":["plants"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhamnaceae","Rosid families"],"headings":["Genera","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Tree986.JPG/250px-Tree986.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Ceanothus_cuneatus1.jpg/220px-Ceanothus_cuneatus1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ovary","plants"]],"members":["ovary"],"related":["Plant","Flowering_plant","Magnoliopsida","Rosidae","Rosales","Antoine_Laurent_de_Jussieu","Carl_Linnaeus","Flowering_plant","Shrub","Eocene","Leaf","Opposite_leaves","Axil","Flower","Stamen","Ovary_(plants)","Ovule","Fruit","Drupe","Jujube","China","Ornamental_plant","Root_nodule","Dye","Wood","Charcoal","Gunpowder","Stephan_Ladislaus_Endlicher"]}
