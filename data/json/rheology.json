R. Schowalter (1978) Mechanics of Non-Newtonian\nFluids Pergamon ISBN 0-08-021778-8</ref> It applies to substances which have a\ncomplex microstructure, such as muds, sludges, suspensions, polymers and other\nglass formers (e.g., silicates), as well as many foods and additives, bodily\nfluids (e.g., blood) and other biological materials or other materials which\nbelong to the class of soft matter.\n\nNewtonian fluids can be characterized by a single coefficient of viscosity for a\nspecific temperature. Although this viscosity will change with temperature, it\ndoes not change with the strain rate. Only a small group of fluids exhibit such\nconstant viscosity, and they are known as Newtonian fluids. But for a large\nclass of fluids, the viscosity changes with the strain rate (or relative\nvelocity of flow) are called non-Newtonian fluids. Rheology generally accounts\nfor the behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number\nof functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strains\nor strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking\n(or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of\ndifferent layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but\nwater cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, as an increase in relative\nvelocity caused a reduction in viscosity, while some other non-Newtonian\nmaterials show the opposite behaviour: viscosity going up with relative\ndeformation, which are called shear thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir\nIsaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with\nstrain rate dependent viscosity is also often called [[non-Newtonian fluid|Non-\nNewtonian fluid mechanics]].<ref name=Schowalter/>\n\nThe term [[wikt:rheology|rheology]] was coined by Eugene C. Bingham, a professor\nat Lafayette College, in 1920, from a suggestion by a colleague, Markus\nReiner.<ref>J. F. Steffe (1996) Rheological Methods in Food Process Engineering\n2nd ed ISBN 0-9632036-1-4 page 1</ref><ref = \"deb1\">[http://www.chbmeng.ohio-\nstate.edu/classes/775/rsb/deborah.pdf The Deborah Number]</ref> The term was\ninspired by the aphorism of Simplicius (often misattributed to Heraclitus),\n[[Heraclitus#Panta rhei, \"everything flows\"|panta rhei]], \"everything flows\"<ref\nname=Barnes1982>{{cite book\n | title = The presocratic philosophers year = 1982 author = Barnes, Jonathan\n | isbn = 978-0-415-05079-1\n}}</ref>\n\nThe experimental characterization of a material's rheological behaviour is known\nas [[rheometry]], although the term rheology is frequently used synonymously\nwith rheometry, particularly by experimentalists. Theoretical aspects of\nrheology are the relation of the flow/deformation behaviour of material and its\ninternal structure (e.g., the orientation and elongation of polymer molecules),\nand the flow/deformation behaviour of materials that cannot be described by\nclassical fluid mechanics or elasticity.\n",
