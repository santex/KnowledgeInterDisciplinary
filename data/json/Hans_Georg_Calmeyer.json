{"cursor":"4760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Hans Georg Calmeyer' (June 23, 1903 – 3 September 1972) was a German\nlawyer from OsnabrÃ¼ck who saved thousands of Jews from certain death during the\nGerman occupation of the Netherlands in from 1941 until 1945.\n\nCalmeyer studied Law in Freiburg, Marburg and Munich. In 1923, as a member of\nthe Reichswehr, he took part in Hitlerâs attempted Putsch. Later, he opened his\nlaw practice in OsnabrÃ¼ck where he enjoyed an excellent reputation as a lawyer.\n\nIn 1933, his license to practice law was revoked because of his activity and\nleaning towards Communist lines of thought. Ten months later, his license was\nreinstated. He was a member of the Federation of the National Socialist German\nLawyers, but not the Nazi party.\n\nIn 1940, Calmeyer, serving as a soldier and a member of an aerial defense\nintelligence unit, took part in the invasion of the Netherlands by the German\nArmy. In 1941, he was active in the Reichs Commissioner's Office\n(Reichskommissariat), which was in charge of all occupied districts in the\nNetherlands. While there, Calmeyer was appointed Director for the Interior\nAdministration, which handled the Jewish Department, thus enabling Calmeyer, as\nan administrative lawyer, to clear \"racially ambiguous\" Jewish cases for the\nGerman occupational administration in The Hague.\n\nUnlike policy in Germany, people of Jewish descent could rebut being registered\nas \"full blooded Jews\" by documenting and proving ancestry through word of mouth\nand birth certificates to qualify as \"half-Jewish\", \"quarter-Jewish\", or of\nAryan descent. Calmeyer described in his own words, how he used his position:\n\"To build a lifeboat.\" He accepted falsified papers of ancestry which documented\nthe subject person as Arian or \"half-Jewish\". He also managed to offer hints and\nadvice on various stratagems and excuses. Despite warnings from the Nazi regime,\nhe persisted in his work.\n\nApproximately 5,700 individuals were designated as doubtful cases through\nCalmeyerâs office, and at least 3,700 were spared certain death. Yet the\ndecisions on \"dubious cases\" concerning the remaining 2,000 individuals were the\nequivalent of a death sentence, as they shared the fate of 140,000 Jews\ntransported by the Germans to various concentration camps for extermination. Seventy-\nfive percent of them died on the way to their final destination.\n\nAccording to a description of Calmeyer by the German Bundespresident Johannes\nRau: \"Calmeyer joined the ranks of human beings who helped, but who were also\nguilty of being caught up in the unjustifiable wrongdoings of the regime\". His\nwork was almost forgotten until a movement to honor him came about during the\n1980s. On March 4, 1992, Yad Vashem honored Hans Calmeyer posthumously with the\ntitle \"A Righteous Man Among Nations\". On January 2, 1995 the town of OsnabrÃ¼ck\nawarded Calmeyer its highest award posthumously: \"The Moesermedaille\". Present\nat the ceremony were his son, Dr. Peter Calmeyer, and the Ambassador of Israel,\nAvi Primor.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","recorded":1375083417,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Hans_Georg_Calmeyer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer.jpg/220px-Hans_Georg_Calmeyer.jpg","/wiki/File:Hans_Georg_Calmeyer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck","/wiki/Jews","/wiki/Battle_of_the_Netherlands","/wiki/University_of_Freiburg","/wiki/University_of_Marburg","/wiki/University_of_Munich","/wiki/Adolf_Hitler","/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch","/wiki/Communism","/wiki/Nazi_party","/wiki/The_Netherlands","/wiki/Wehrmacht_Heer","/wiki/Reichskommissariat","/wiki/The_Hague","/wiki/Aryan","/wiki/Johannes_Rau","/wiki/Yad_Vashem","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Avi_Primor","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/389971122X","/wiki/Osnabr%C3%BCck","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3-934005-95-0","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/18132916","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&oldid=548829443","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1903_births","/wiki/Category:1972_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Osnabr%C3%BCck","/wiki/Category:People_from_the_Province_of_Hanover","/wiki/Category:Collaborators_who_participated_in_the_Beer_Hall_Putsch","/wiki/Category:20th-century_Freikorps_personnel","/wiki/Category:German_lawyers","/wiki/Category:National_Socialist_Motor_Corps_members","/wiki/Category:German_Righteous_Among_the_Nations","/wiki/Category:University_of_Freiburg_alumni","/wiki/Category:University_of_Marburg_alumni","/wiki/Category:Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hans+Georg+Calmeyer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hans+Georg+Calmeyer","/wiki/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","/wiki/Talk:Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","#","/wiki/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&oldid=548829443","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77971","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&id=548829443","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Hans+Georg+Calmeyer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Hans+Georg+Calmeyer&oldid=548829443&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Georg_Calmeyer&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Georg_Calmeyer","//la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannes_Georgius_Calmeyer","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Calmeyer","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77971#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikim
