{"cursor":"9568","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a rock consisting mostly of pyroxene minerals.]] The 'pyroxenes' are a group\nof important rock-forming inosilicate minerals found in many igneous and\nmetamorphic rocks. They share a common structure consisting of single chains of\nsilica tetrahedra and they crystallize in the monoclinic and orthorhombic\nsystems. Pyroxenes have the general formula XY(Si,Al) 2O 6\n(where X represents calcium, sodium, iron +2 and magnesium and more\nrarely zinc, manganese and lithium and Y represents ions of smaller size, such\nas chromium, aluminium, iron +3 , magnesium, manganese, scandium,\ntitanium, vanadium and even iron +2 ). Although aluminium substitutes\nextensively for silicon in silicates such as feldspars and amphiboles, the\nsubstitution occurs only to a limited extent in most pyroxenes.\n\nThe name pyroxene comes from the Greek words for fire (ÏÏÏ) and stranger\n(Î¾Î­Î½Î¿Ï). Pyroxenes were named this way because of their presence in volcanic\nlavas, where they are sometimes seen as crystals embedded in volcanic glass; it\nwas assumed they were impurities in the glass, hence the name \"fire strangers\".\nHowever, they are simply early-forming minerals that crystallized before the\nlava erupted. -peridotite xenolith from San Carlos Indian Reservation, Gila Co.,\nArizona, USA. The xenolith is dominated by green peridot olivine, together with\nblack orthopyroxene and spinel crystals, and rare grass-green diopside grains.\nThe fine-grained gray rock in this image is the host basalt.(unknown scale)]]\nThe upper mantle of Earth is composed mainly of olivine and pyroxene. A piece of\nthe mantle is shown at right (orthopyroxene is black, diopside (containing\nchromium) is bright green, and olivine is yellow-green) and is dominated by\nolivine, typical for common peridotite. Pyroxene and feldspar are the major\nminerals in basalt and gabbro.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Orthopyroxene","recorded":1362268777,"links":52,"instances":["geology","geology","mars"],"pdf":["http://www.mineralogicalassociation.ca/doc/abstracts/ima98/ima98(12).pdf"],"categories":["Inosilicates","Pyroxene group|*"],"headings":["Chemistry and nomenclature of the pyroxenes","Pyroxene minerals","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Orthopyroxenite_%28ALH84001%29.gif/220px-Orthopyroxenite_%28ALH84001%29.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Peridot_in_basalt.jpg/220px-Peridot_in_basalt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Pyrox_names.svg/350px-Pyrox_names.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Na_pyrox_trig.svg/350px-Na_pyrox_trig.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/PIA16217-MarsCuriosityRover-1stXRayView-20121017.jpg/200px-PIA16217-MarsCuriosityRover-1stXRayView-20121017.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["rocknest","mars"]],"members":["mantle","rock","rocknest"],"related":["Inosilicate","Mineral","Igneous","Metamorphic_rock","Rock_(geology)","Tetrahedra","Monoclinic","Orthorhombic","Calcium","Sodium","Iron","Magnesium","Zinc","Manganese","Lithium","Chromium","Aluminium","Scandium","Titanium","Vanadium","Feldspar","Amphibole","Glass","Peridotite","Xenolith","Olivine","Spinel","Mantle_(geology)","Olivine","Diopside","Peridotite","Feldspar","Basalt","Gabbro","Cations","Enstatite","Orthorhombic","Monoclinic","Pigeonite","Augite","Diopside","Wollastonite","Jadeite","Aegirine","Omphacite","Aegirine-augite","Coupled_substitution","Martian_soil","CheMin","Feldspar","Olivine","Curiosity_rover","Rocknest_(Mars)","Monoclinic","Aegirine","Augite","Clinoenstatite","Diopside","Esseneite","Hedenbergite","Jadeite","Kanoite","Omphacite","Pigeonite","Spodumene","Orthorhombic","Hypersthene","Enstatite","Ferrosilite","Clinopyroxene_thermobarometry"]}
