Barton' (born 1936) is an American metallurgical engineer,\nbusinessman and the acting president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from\nApril 1998 until July 1999. [http://rpi.edu/president/bot/barton.html\nCornelius J. Barton '58. RPI Board of Trustees]\n\nHe received bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees in metallurgical engineering\nfrom Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is a member of the engineering honor\nsociety Sigma Xi and is a brother of the Delta Phi social fraternity. After his\nundergraduate work, from 1958â1961, he was employed as a Metallurgical Process\nEngineer at Olin's Nuclear Fuel Division, which manufactured nuclear reactor\ncores for the U. S. Navy. In 1961, Barton returned to R.P.I. for graduate work\nin Engineering. Upon earning an M.S. and Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering, he\njoined US Steel's Research Laboratory in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, as a\nresearch manager in the Advanced Applied Research Division. While at U.S.S., he\nauthored several research papers in refereed journals, submitted patent\napplications for novel steel compositions, and completed a project sponsored by\nthe U. S. Air Force for improvements and problem solving in a complex high-\nstrength, high-performance family of steels.\n\nBarton then joined the Chase Brass & Copper Co. in 1969, a subsidiary of\nKennecott Copper, as Director of Research and Development. From 1975-1980, he\nwas General Manager of Chase Nuclear Inc. \"Cornelius J. Barton.\" Marquis\nWho's Who, Marquis Who's Who, 2008. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center.\nFarmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. In 1981, he returned to Chase\nHeadquarters in Shaker Heights, Ohio, to serve as Vice President, Technology, of\nKennecott Engineered Systems Co., (KESCO). When Standard Oil of Ohio acquired\nKennecott, the technologies of several Standard Oil manufacturing subsidiaries\njoined KESCO Technologies, and Barton's unit was renamed the Standard oil\nChemicals and Industrial Products Co. Technology Group. During the M&A\nactivities engaged by Kennecott, Dorr Oliver Incorporated was acquired. Dorr\nOliver's business was twofold: the separation of liquids from solids, for\ninstance by centrifugation, and the application of Fluid-Bed technology to a\nvariety of process engineering, and incineration activities, including coal-\nfired boilers with sulphur capture. Dorr Oliver was an International Corporation\nwith 16 subsidiaries in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Licensees in\nJapan and South Africa.\n\nIn 1986, Barton was appointed President of Dorr Oliver. Shortly thereafter,\nBritish Petroleum fully acquired Standard Oil and re-shaped and re-organized the\nenergy activities. Dorr Oliver was sold, and an LBO group bought the company;\nBarton remained as President and CEO of Dorr Oliver. The Management of Dorr\nOliver subsequently performed an MBO to take the Company and manage it for\ngrowth. A significant period of world-wide growth occurred, leading ultimately\nto an offer of purchase for the Company\n\nIn 1992, Harriman bought a 20 percent stake in Dorr Oliver. Dorr Oliver was then\nsold to a German company in 1995, and Barton retired as President after more\nthan twelve years in that position. \"RPI chooses acting president\", Albany\nTimes Union, April 9, 1998, page B1\n\nHe has been a member of the Rensselaer Board of Trustees beginning in 1991 until\nthe present, and was the interim president of RPI from April 1998 until July\n1999, until the current President, Shirley Ann Jackson was recruited.
