{"cursor":"17419","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In human vascular diseases, 'endothelial dysfunction' is a systemic pathological\nstate of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly\ndefined as an imbalance between vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances\nproduced by (or acting on) the endothelium.\nNormal functions of endothelial cells include mediation of coagulation, platelet\nadhesion, immune function and control of volume and electrolyte content of the\nintravascular and extravascular spaces.\n\nEndothelial dysfunction can result from and/or contribute to several disease\nprocesses, as occurs in hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, septic\nshock, Behcet's disease, and it can also result from environmental factors, such\nas from smoking tobacco products and exposure to air pollution.
