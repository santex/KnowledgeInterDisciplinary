For example, if one measures the height of a thousand\nindividuals from a country of one million, the average height of the thousand is\ntypically not the same as the average height of all one million people in the\ncountry. Since sampling is typically done to determine the characteristics of a\nwhole population, the difference between the sample and population values is\nconsidered a [[Errors and residuals in statistics|sampling error]] Sarndal, Swenson, and Wretman (1992), Model Assisted Survey\nSampling, Springer-Verlag, ISBN 0-387-40620-4 Exact measurement of\nsampling error is generally not feasible since the true population values are\nunknown; however, sampling error can often be estimated by probabilistic\nmodeling of the sample.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Sampling_error","recorded":1362483361,"links":16,"instances":["statistics","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/pamphlet.pdf","http://www.amstat.org/sections/srms/pamphlet.pdf"],"categories":["Sampling (statistics)","Error","Measurement"],"headings":["Description","See also","Citations","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["standard_error","statistics"],["sampling","statistics"]],"members":["standard_error","sampling"],"related":["Statistics","Statistics","Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics","Statistic","Random_sample","Sample_size","Statistical_power","Observation","Statistical_theory","Probability","Statistic","Estimator","Standard_error_(statistics)","Sampling_bias","Systematic_errors","Non-sampling_error","Systematic_error","Margin_of_error","Propagation_of_error","Ratio_estimator","Sampling_(statistics)"]}
