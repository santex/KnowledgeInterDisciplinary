Note the\n cable provides both the sensor data and sound of the starter to arrive at each\n speaker behind the athlete at exactly the same time]] 'Starting blocks' are a\n device used in the sport of track and field by sprint athletes to hold their\n feet at the start of a race so they don't slip as they push out at the sound of\n the gun. For most levels of competition, including all high level International\n competition, starting blocks are now mandatory equipment for the start of\n sprint races. http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions-\n /TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct0-\n 9_17166.pdf IAAF Rule 161\n\nThe first starting blocks are credited to being invented by Australian Charlie\nBooth and his father in\n1929. http://www.athletics.com.au/news/news/2008/may/vale_charlie_booth\nAthletics Australia\n\nPrior to their invention, runners would dig holes in the dirt track. Trowels\nwere provided at the start of races. This was not the most consistent or stable\nsystem. It also was destructive to the track surface with the holes having to be\nfilled for subsequent runners.\n\nWood was the first material used, with some tracks having permanently placed\nwooden starting blocks with golden structures at the start line. Portable blocks\nwere held by long metal spikes that needed to be pounded into the ground. These\ndevices evolved to metal blocks. The common blocks of the 1960s were heavy and\nadjusted by screws that were frequently broken or became rusted over the years.\nLighter weight blocks were made of sheet metal.\n\nThe rubberized surfaces of new All-weather running tracks that became common\nstarting in the 1970s, made the old blocks even less secure. Original Tartan\ntracks left long holes to secure the blocks but most tracks required blocks to\nbe held by small spikes similar to the ones used in shoes. Block slippage was\ncommon enough, it is an allowable loophole in the rules to recall the start of a\nrace, without calling a \"false start\" against an athlete. In some amateur\nsettings, such as high school track, since block slippage is much more common\ndue to lower quality track surface material and/or starting blocks' spike\nquality, it is a commonly accepted practice to allow another person (usually a\nteammate) to sit on the ground behind the starting block and place their feet\nbehind each block, using their leg power to further reduce the chance for the\nblocks to slip back upon the runner launching out of them.\n\nModern blocks used for world records now must have sensors that detect the\npressure from the athlete and can be used to time their reaction to the starting\ngun. Athletes who react faster than 100/1000ths of a second (one tenth of a\nsecond) can be charged with a false start and the race recalled. Many also carry electronic speakers so the sound of the gun\narrives at the ears of the athletes at exactly the same time.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Starting_blocks","recorded":1363121050,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Starting_block","/wiki/File:NewtonStartingBlocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/NewtonStartingBlocks.jpg/220px-NewtonStartingBlocks.jpg","/wiki/File:NewtonStartingBlocks.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:PressureSensitiveStartingBlocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/PressureSensitiveStartingBlocks.jpg/220px-PressureSensitiveStartingBlocks.jpg","/wiki/File:PressureSensitiveStartingBlocks.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/100_metres","/wiki/2007_Pan_American_Games","/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Havelange_Olympic_Stadium","/wiki/Track_and_field","/wiki/Sprint_(running)","#cite_note-iaaf.org-1","/wiki/Charlie_Booth","#cite_note-2","/wiki/All-weather_running_track","/wiki/Tartan_track","#cite_note-iaaf.org-1","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Nick_Newton","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-iaaf.org_1-0","#cite_ref-iaaf.org_1-1","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.athletics.com.au/news/news/2008/may/vale_charlie_booth","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&oldid=540789731","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Sprint_(running)","/wiki/Category:Athletics_(track_and_field)_terminology","/wiki/Category:Athletics_(track_and_field)_equipment","/wiki/Category:Australian_inventions","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Starting+blocks&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Starting+blocks","/wiki/Starting_blocks","/wiki/Talk:Starting_blocks","#","/wiki/Starting_blocks","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Starting_blocks","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Starting_blocks","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&oldid=540789731","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Starting_blocks&id=540789731","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Starting+blocks","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Starting+blocks&oldid=540789731&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Starting_blocks&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting-block","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocchi_di_partenza","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startblok","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%96%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startblokk","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startblock","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Starting
