{"cursor":"40901","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Systems theory' is the interdisciplinary study of systems in general, with the\ngoal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems at\nall nesting levels in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-\nestablished, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a\nspecialization of systems thinking, a generalization of systems science, a\nsystems approach. The term originates from Bertalanffy's general system theory\n(GST) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the action theory of\nTalcott Parsons Rudolf Stichweh (2011) \"[http://www.unilu.ch/files/stw_systems-theory-international-encyclopedia-of-\npolitical-science_2.pdf Systems Theory]\", in:y. In: Bertrand Badie et al.\n(eds.), International Encyclopedia of Political Science. Sage New\nYork. Stichweh states: \"... Since its beginnings the social sciences were an\nimportant part of the establishment of systems theory... the two most\ninfluential suggestions were the comprehensive sociological versions of systems\ntheory which were proposed by Talcott Parsons since the 1950s and by Niklas\nLuhmann since the 1970s.\" and the social systems theory of Niklas\nLuhmann.\n\nIn this context the word systems is used to refer specifically to self-\nregulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through feedback. Self-\nregulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of\nour body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climateâand in human learning\nprocesses.\n","linknr":670,"url":"Systems_theory","recorded":1362476973,"links":62,"instances":["sociology","philosophy","physics","sociologist","systems","systems_theory","systems_scientist","epistemic"],"pdf":["http://www.unilu.ch/files/stw_systems-theory-international-encyclopedia-of-political-science_2.pdf","http://www.isnature.org/events/2009/Summer/r/Bertalanffy1950-GST_Outline_SELECT.pdf","http://www.isnature.org/events/2009/Summer/r/Bertalanffy1950-GST_Outline_SELECT.pdf","http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/~gossimit/ifsr/francois/papers/systemics_and_cybernetics_in_a_historical_perspective.pdf"],"categories":["Branches
