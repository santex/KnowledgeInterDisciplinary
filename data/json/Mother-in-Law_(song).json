The song was\na number-one hit in the U.S. on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B\ncharts. The song was written and produced by Allen Toussaint who also\nplayed the piano solo. It was issued by Minit Records. After several\nunsuccessful takes, Allen Toussaint balled the composition up and threw it away\nas he was leaving the room. One of the backup singers, Willie Hopper, thought\nthat it was such a good song that he convinced Ernie K-Doe to calm down and give\nit one more try.
