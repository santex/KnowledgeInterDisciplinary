The chain steamers pull themselves\nupstream along a fixed chain lying on the ground of a river. The chain was\nraised from the riverbed to pass over the deck of the steamer. The chain was\nmoved by a heavy winch powered by a steam engine. A lot of different companies\noperated also on the rivers Elbe, Rhine, Neckar, Main, Saale, Havel, Spree and\nSaÃ´ne and some companies also existed in Belgium, Holland and in the USA.\n\nThe practice fell out of favour when more modern steam ships with more powerful\nengines and higher boiler pressures [able to react to the force of the river\ncurrent] became common.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Chain_steam_shipping","recorded":1362476867,"links":19,"instances":["river_or_stream","river"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Shipping"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Toueur.jpg/220px-Toueur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Ketten-Schleppdampfer_1885.jpg/220px-Ketten-Schleppdampfer_1885.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["source","river_or_stream"],["main","river"]],"members":["source","main"],"related":["Source_(river_or_stream)","Elbe","Rhine","Neckar","Main_(river)","Saale","Havel","Spree","Cable_ferry"]}
