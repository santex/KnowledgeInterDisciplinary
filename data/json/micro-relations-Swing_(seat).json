The seat of a swing may be suspended\nfrom chains or ropes. Once a swing is in motion it continues to oscillate like a\npendulum until external interference or drag brings it to a halt. Swing sets are\nvery popular with children.\n\nOn playgrounds, several swings are often suspended from the same metal or wooden\nframe, known as a 'swing set', allowing more than one child to play at a time.\nSuch swings come in a variety of sizes and shapes. For infants and toddlers,\nswings with leg holes support the child in an upright position while a parent or\nsibling pushes the child to get a swinging motion. Some swing sets include play\nitems other than swings, such as a rope ladder or sliding pole.\n\nFor older children, swings are sometimes made of a flexible canvas seat, of\nrubberized ventilated tire tread, of plastic, or of wood. A common backyard\nsight in modern America is a wooden plank suspended on both sides by ropes from\na tree branch. Older children can go much higher, sometimes over 15 feet (5 m)\nabove the ground. In the United States, some adults go to the extreme and\ncompete in the NSA, \"National Swing Association\", where competitors reach\nheights over 20 feet, while leaping at the peak of their swing.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Swing_(seat)","recorded":1362485921,"links":61,"instances":["painting","building","furniture"],"pdf":["http://staff.kfupm.edu.sa/phys/tahmed/How%20to%20pump%20a%20swing.pdf"],"categories":["Play"],"headings":["Types of swings","Swinging sideways","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Woman_swing_Louvre_F60.jpg/220px-Woman_swing_Louvre_F60.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/AMI_-_Schaukel.jpg/220px-AMI_-_Schaukel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Keemu_sadam_2.JPG/120px-Keemu_sadam_2.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Hws.jpg/120px-Hws.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Kiiking.jpg/90px-Kiiking.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Rope_swing_really_tall_Summit_NJ.jpg/59px-Rope_swing_really_tall_Summit_NJ.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["glider","furniture"],["canopy","building"],["the_swing","painting"]],"members":["the_swing","canopy","glider"],"related":["Red-figure_pottery","Amphora","Vulci","Louvre","Minoan_chronology","Heraklion","Crete","Playgrounds","Circus","Acrobatics","Porch","Oscillation","Pendulum","Metal","Wood","Liana","Vine","Aokigahara","Mount_Fuji","Swing_boarding","Seat_belt","Porch","Rocking_chair","Glider_(furniture)","Canopy_(building)","Hammock","Kiiking","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","Patent","Outdoor_playset","Parametric_oscillator","The_Swing_(painting)","Russian_swing"]}
