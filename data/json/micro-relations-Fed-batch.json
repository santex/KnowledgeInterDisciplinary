The fed-batch strategy is\ntypically used in bio-industrial processes to reach a high cell density in the\nbioreactor. Mostly the feed solution is highly concentrated to avoid dilution of\nthe bioreactor. The controlled addition of the nutrient directly affects the\ngrowth rate of the culture and helps to avoid overflow metabolism (formation of\nside metabolites, such as acetate for [[Escherichia coli]], lactic acid in cell\ncultures, ethanol in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]), oxygen limitation\n(anaerobiosis).\n\n\n\nSubstrate limitation offers the possibility to control the reaction rates\nto avoid technological limitations connected to the cooling of the reactor\nand oxygen transfer. Substrate limitation also allows the metabolic\ncontrol, to avoid osmotic effects, catabolite repression and overflow\nmetabolism of side products.\n\nDifferent strategies can be used to control the growth in a fed-batch process:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
