It occurs when an allergen, such as pollen, dust or animal dander\n(particles of shed skin and hair) is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized\nimmune system. In such individuals, the allergen triggers the production of the\nantibody immunoglobulin E (IgE), which binds to mast cells and basophils\ncontaining histamine. When caused by pollens of any plants, it is called\n\"pollinosis\", and if specifically caused by grass pollens, it is known as \"'hay\nfever'\". Hay fever isn't caused by hay and does not exhibit symptoms of fever,\nbut since grasses shed their pollens into the air at about the same time that\nhay is being cut, the common term hay fever is used.\n\nIgE bound to mast cells are stimulated by pollen and dust, causing the release\nof inflammatory mediators such as histamine (and other chemicals). This usually causes sneezing, itchy and watery eyes,\nswelling and inflammation of the nasal passages, and an increase in mucus\nproduction. Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive\nindividuals can experience hives or other rashes. Particulate matter in polluted\nair, and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be\ntolerated, can greatly aggravate allergic rhinitis. The physician John Bostock\nfirst described hay fever in 1819 as a disease.\n\nAllergies are common. Heredity and environmental exposures may contribute to a\npredisposition to allergies. It is roughly estimated that one in three people\nhave an active allergy at any given time and at least three in four people\ndevelop an allergic reaction at least once in their lives. In Western countries\nbetween 10â25% of people annually are affected by allergic rhinitis.\n","linknr":395,"url":"Hay_fever","recorded":1362373133,"links":39,"instances":["physician","fraxinus"],"pdf":["http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol20issue5/cme.pdf","http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol20issue5/cme.pdf"],"categories":["Allergology","Type 1 hypersensitivity"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Allergy testing","Pollen allergies","Treatment","Complications","Local allergic rhinitis","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Misc_pollen.jpg/220px-Misc_pollen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_bostock","physician"],["ash","fraxinus"],["h1_antagonist#first-generation","non-selective,_classical"],["h1_antagonist#second-generation_and_third-generation","selective,_non-sedating"]],"members":["john_bostock","ash"],"related":["Pollen","Allergic","Inflammation","Allergen","Pollen","Immune_system","Antibody","Immunoglobulin_E","Mast_cells","Basophil_granulocyte","Histamine","Hay","Sneezing","Mucus","Hives","Rash","Chlorine","John_Bostock_(physician)","Rhinorrhea","Pruritis","Erythema","Nasal_turbinates","Dennie–Morgan_fold","Periorbital_hyperpigmentation","Allergic_salute","Transverse_nasal_crease","Oral_allergy_syndrome","Comorbidity","Eczema","Asthma","Clinical_depression","RAST_blood_test","Eosinophilia","Skin_allergy_test","RAST_test","Pollen","Hay","Anemophily","Plant","Entomophily","Poplar","Bet_v_I_allergen","Hay_fever_in_Japan","Sugi","Hinoki","Ash_(Fraxinus)","Maple","Poplar","Dogwood","Magnolia","Double-flowered","Cherry","Fir","Spruce","Plum","Poaceae","Ryegrass","Timothy-grass","Ragweed","Nettle","Urticaceae","Mugwort","Fat_hen","Sorrel","Corticosteroid","Mite","Intranasal","Nasal_spray","Steroids","Prednisone","Antihistamine","Decongestant","Cromolyn","Leukotriene_receptor_antagonist","Nasal_irrigation","Drowsiness","Diphenhydramine","Cetirizine","Loratadine","Ketotifen","Pseudoephedrine","Topical_decongestant","Rhinitis_medicamentosa","Corticosteroid","Oxymetazoline","Adrenergic_alpha-agonist","Rhinitis_medicamentosa","Allergen_immunotherapy","Sinusitis","Nasal_polyp","Bronchial_asthma","Skin_allergy_test","RAST_test","Immunoglobulin_E","Allergen","Skin_allergy_test","Allergic_conjunctivitis","Asthma"]}
