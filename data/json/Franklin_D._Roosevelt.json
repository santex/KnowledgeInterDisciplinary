A dominant\nleader of the Democratic Party and the only American president elected to more\nthan two terms, he built a New Deal Coalition that realigned American politics\nafter 1932, as his domestic policies defined American liberalism for the middle\nthird of the 20th century.\n\nWith the bouncy popular song \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as his campaign theme,\nFDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932, at the depth\nof the Great Depression. Energized by his personal victory over polio, FDR's\nunfailing optimism and activism contributed to a renewal of the national\nspirit. Siracusa, p.22 He worked closely with Winston Churchill and\nJoseph Stalin in leading the Allies against Germany and Japan in World War II,\nand restoring prosperity to the nation's economy.\n\nIn his first hundred days in office, which began March 4, 1933, Roosevelt\nspearheaded major legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that\ninstituted the New Dealâa variety of programs designed to produce relief\n(government jobs for the unemployed), recovery (economic growth), and reform\n(through regulation of Wall Street, banks and transportation). The economy\nimproved rapidly from 1933 to 1937, but then relapsed into a deep recession. The\nbipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the\nSupreme Court or passing any considerable legislation; it abolished many of the\nrelief programs when unemployment diminished during World War II. Most of the\nregulations on business were ended about 1975â85, except for the regulation of\nWall Street by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which still exists. Along\nwith several smaller programs, major surviving programs include the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, which was created in 1933, and Social Security,\nwhich Congress passed in 1935.\n\nAs World War II loomed after 1938, with the Japanese invasion of China and the\naggression of Nazi Germany, FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to\nChina and Great Britain, while remaining officially neutral. His goal was to\nmake America the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" which would supply munitions to the\nAllies. In March 1941, Roosevelt, with Congressional approval, provided Lend-\nLease aid to the countries fighting against Nazi Germany with Britain. With\nvery strong national support, he made war on Japan and Germany after the\nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, calling it a \"date which\nwill live in infamy\". He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to\nsupport the Allied war effort. As an active military leader, Roosevelt\nimplemented an overall war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of\nthe Axis Powers and the development of the world's first atom bomb. In 1942\nRoosevelt ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians.\nUnemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the industrial\neconomy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in\nwar centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or\nvolunteered for military service.\n\nRoosevelt dominated the American political scene not only during the twelve\nyears of his presidency, but also for decades afterward. He orchestrated the\nrealignment of voters that created the Fifth Party System. FDR's New Deal\nCoalition united labor unions, big city machines, white ethnics, African\nAmericans and rural white Southerners. He also influenced the later creation of\nthe United Nations and Bretton Woods. Roosevelt is consistently rated by\nscholars as one of the top three U.S. Presidents, along with Abraham Lincoln and\nGeorge Washington.\n","linknr":3248,"url":"Franklin_D._Roosevelt","recorded":1362501449,"links":232,"instances":["writer","strategy","1943","dog","historian","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states","historian","educator","united_states","united_states","united_states_coin","paris_métro","african_american","island","world_war_ii","taipei"],"pdf":["http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1946-01.pdf"],"categories":["Franklin D.
