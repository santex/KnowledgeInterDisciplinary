This\nregion of repeated nucleotide called telomeres contains noncoding DNA and\nhinders the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. As a result, every time\nthe chromosome is copied only 100â200 nucleotides are lost, which causes no\ndamage to the organism's DNA. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that carries\nits own RNA molecule, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres,\nwhich are shortened after each replication cycle.\n\nThe existence of a compensatory mechanism for telomere shortening was first\npredicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973, who also suggested the telomere hypothesis of aging\nand the telomere's connections to cancer. Telomerase was discovered by Carol W.\nGreider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate [[Tetrahymena]]. Together with Jack W. Szostak, Greider and Blackburn\nwere awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their\ndiscovery.\n","linknr":930,"url":"Telomerase","recorded":1362374380,"links":49,"instances":["genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v2/n10/pdf/100200.pdf","http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v2/n10/pdf/100200.pdf"],"categories":["Telomere-related proteins","Aging","EC 2.7.7","Enzymes","DNA replication","Gerontology","Senescence","Telomeres","Aging-related proteins","Aging-related enzymes","Anti-aging substances"],"headings":["Structure","Function","Clinical implications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Telomerase_illustration.jpg/240px-Telomerase_illustration.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Working_principle_of_telomerase.png/400px-Working_principle_of_telomerase.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology#3.27-end"],["translation","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["dominance","genetics"]],"members":["dominance","directionality","translation","cell"],"related":["Ribonucleoprotein","Enzyme","DNA","Thymine","Thymine","Adenine","Guanine","Guanine","Guanine","Telomere","Eukaryote","Chromosomes","Nucleotide","DNA_replication","Reverse_transcriptase","RNA","Cell_cycle","Alexey_Olovnikov","Aging","Carol_W._Greider","Elizabeth_Blackburn","Jack_W._Szostak","Nobel_Prize","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase","Telomerase_RNA_component","Dyskerin","Genome","Translation_(genetics)","Protein","Amino_acids","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Protein_folding","Non-coding_RNA","Nucleotide","Reverse_transcriptase","Virus","Scientist","Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction","Children's_Medical_Research_Institute","Protein_structure","Catalysis","Finger","Thumb","Polymerase","Bacteriophage","Telomeres","Mitosis","Hayflick_limit","Cancer","Embryonic_stem_cells","Somatic","Werner_syndrome","Ataxia_telangiectasia","Ataxia-telangiectasia_like_disorder","Bloom_syndrome","Fanconi_anemia","Nijmegen_breakage_syndrome","DNA_repair","DNA_damage_theory_of_aging","Michael_Fossel","Cancer","Baby_Boomers","United_States","Europe","Michael_Fossel","Ashkenazi_Jews","Progeria","Adeno-associated_virus","Hayflick_limit","Cell_culture","Senescence","Tumor_suppressor_gene","P53","Retinoblastoma_protein","Cell_(biology)","DNA_repair","Mutation","Apoptosis","Biological_immortality","Hayflick_limit","Cancer_cell","Tumor","HeLa_cell","Cell_line","Cloning","Ras_subfamily","C-myc","Proto-oncogenes","Phosphatase","Mitosis","Cancer","Elizabeth_Blackburn","Diabetes","Insulin","Lasker_Award","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Aplastic_anemia","Bone_marrow","Cri_du_chat_Syndrome","Dyskeratosis_congenita","Bone_marrow","Sex_linkage","Dominance_(genetics)","Autosome","Skin_pigmentation","Leucoplakia","Nail_dystrophy","Immune_system","Drug","Vaccine","Geron_Corporation","GRNVAC1","TVAX","T-cell","GRN163L","RNA","Mutation","Glycolysis","DNA_repair","TA-65","Telomere","Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland","Elizabeth_Blackburn"]}
