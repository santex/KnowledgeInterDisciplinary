{"cursor":"34355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n ]]\n\n\nAn 'orchestra' is a large instrumental ensemble that contains sections of\nstring, brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. The term orchestra derives\nfrom the Greek Î¿ÏÏÎ®ÏÏÏÎ±, the name for the area in front of an ancient Greek\nstage reserved for the Greek chorus. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/t-\next?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rxh%2Fstra Î¿ÏÏÎ®ÏÏÏÎ±], Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The\norchestra grew by accretion throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, but changed\nvery little in composition during the course of the 20th century.\n\nA smaller-sized orchestra for this time period (of about fifty musicians or\nfewer) is called a 'chamber orchestra'. A full-size orchestra (about 100\nmusicians) may sometimes be called a \"'symphony orchestra'\" or \"'philharmonic\norchestra'\"; these modifiers do not necessarily indicate any strict difference\nin either the instrumental constitution or role of the orchestra, but can be\nuseful to distinguish different ensembles based in the same city (for instance,\nthe London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra). A symphony\norchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases\nover a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular\nperformance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the\nvenue. A leading chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some\nare much smaller than that. Orchestras can also be found in schools. The term\n'concert orchestra' may sometimes be used (e.g., BBC Concert Orchestra; RTÃ\nConcert Orchestra)âno distinction is made on size of orchestra by use of this\nterm, although their use is generally distinguished as for live concert. As such\nthey are commonly chamber orchestras.\n","linknr":617,"url":"Orchestra","recorded":1362670841,"links":90,"instances":["theatre","beethoven","instrument","vaughan_williams","beethoven","walton","mahler","composer","beethoven","music","beethoven","beethoven","music","stockhausen","glass","vaughan_williams","music","music","berlioz","instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ancient
