He was also\nawarded the Paul-Lewis Award in Enzyme Chemistry from the American Chemical\nSociety in 1951, L.H.D. degree from Yeshiva University in 1962, as well as\nNational Medal of Science in 1979.\n\nHis primary research interests were in biochemistry, especially enzyme\nchemistry, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis (DNA replication) and studying the\nnucleic acids which control heredity in animals, plants, bacteria and\nviruses.\n","linknr":883,"url":"Arthur_Kornberg","recorded":1362374396,"links":59,"instances":["central_europe","biology"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/kornberg-lecture.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/kornberg-arthur.pdf"],"categories":["Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York) alumni","American biochemists","Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization","American Orthodox Jews","American Nobel laureates","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","Jewish American scientists","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","Stanford University School of Medicine faculty","University of Rochester alumni","City University of New York alumni","National Medal of Science laureates","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","People from New York City","1918 births","2007 deaths","Washington University in St. Louis faculty"],"headings":["Early life","Scientific research","Family life","See also","References","Books","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Arthur_Kornberg.jpg/220px-Arthur_Kornberg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["galicia","central_europe"],["abraham_lincoln_high_school","brooklyn,_new_york"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["abraham_lincoln_high_school","galicia","cell"],"related":["New_York_City","United_States","Stanford","United_States","Molecular_biology","University_of_California,_Berkeley","National_Institutes_of_Health","Washington_University_in_St._Louis","Stanford_University","University_of_Rochester","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Royal_Society","Paul-Lewis_Award_in_Enzyme_Chemistry","United_States","Biochemist","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Deoxyribonucleic_acid","Severo_Ochoa","New_York_University","Paul-Lewis_Award_in_Enzyme_Chemistry","American_Chemical_Society","Yeshiva_University","National_Medal_of_Science","Biochemistry","Enzyme","Deoxyribonucleic_acid","DNA_replication","New_York_City","Jewish","Galicia_(Central_Europe)","Poland","Lower_East_Side,_Manhattan","Brooklyn","Abraham_Lincoln_High_School_(Brooklyn,_New_York)","Oxford_University_Press","City_College_of_New_York","New_York_City","Doctor_of_Medicine","University_of_Rochester","Bilirubin","Jaundice","Hereditary","Gilbert's_syndrome","Strong_Memorial_Hospital","Rochester,_New_York","United_States_Coast_Guard","Rolla_Dyer","NIH","Enzyme","Severo_Ochoa","New_York_University","Columbia_University","Adenosine_triphosphate","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","NADP","Molecule","Washington_University_in_St._Louis","DNA_polymerase_I","LL.D.","D.Sc.","University_of_Rochester","Stanford_University","Stanford","Josh_Lederberg","Spore","Gall_bladder","Cell_(biology)","University_of_Rochester_Medical_Center","Inorganic","Polyphosphate","I._Robert_Lehman","Randy_Schekman","William_T._Wickner","James_Rothman","Arturo_Falaschi","Ken-ichi_Arai","Sylvy_Kornberg","Roger_D._Kornberg","Thomas_B._Kornberg","Ken_Kornberg","Orthodox_Jews","Stanford_University","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","DNA_polymerase","University_of_California,_San_Francisco","List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates","New_York_City","United_States","Stanford","United_States"]}
