{"cursor":"29657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n in Gregg and a variety of 19th-century systems]] stenography using the \"System\n Groote\"]] 'Shorthand' is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases\n speed and brevity of writing as compared to a normal method of writing a\n language. The process of writing in shorthand is called 'stenography', from\n the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphÄ or graphie (writing). It has also been\n called 'brachygraphy', from Greek brachys (short) and 'tachygraphy', from\n Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of\n writing is the goal.\n\nMany forms of shorthand exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or\nabbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well trained\nin the system to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-\nbased and use different abbreviating approaches. Several autocomplete programs,\nstandalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a\nshorthand function for often used phrases.\n\nShorthand was used more widely in the past, before the invention of recording\nand dictation machines. Shorthand was considered an essential part of\nsecretarial training as well as being useful for journalists. Although the\nprimary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some\nsystems are used for compact expression. For example, health-care professionals\nmay use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes\nare typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later\ntranscription to longhand, although longer term uses do exist, diaries (like\nthat of the famous Samuel Pepys) being a common example. , Volume I, pp.\nxlviiâliv (for Thomas Shelton's shorthand system and Pepys' use of it)\n","linknr":462,"url":"Shorthand","recorded":1362890647,"links":65,"instances":["stenographer","law","east_asia","stenographer","stenographer"],"pdf":["http://legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/greggj.pdf","http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3895.pdf"],"categories":["Shorthand systems| Shorthand","Stenographers","Transcription (linguistics)"],"headings":["History","Classification","Common modern English shorthand systems","Notable shorthand systems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Eclectic_shorthand_by_cross.png/200px-Eclectic_shorthand_by_cross.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Groote.jpg/200px-Groote.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Treatise_On_Calligraphy.jpg/220px-Treatise_On_Calligraphy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Heinrich_Roller_Grabstein.jpg/220px-Heinrich_Roller_Grabstein.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg/100px-Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thomas_shelton","stenographer"],["samuel_taylor","stenographer"],["cursive_script","east_asia"],["james_hill","stenographer"],["transcript","law"]],"members":["samuel_taylor","transcript","cursive_script","thomas_shelton","james_hill"],"related":["Gregg_shorthand","Greek_language","Autocomplete","Dictation_machine","Cursive","Samuel_Pepys","Ancient_Greece","Parthenon","Hellenistic_civilization","Egypt","Ancient_Rome","Marcus_Tullius_Tiro","Freedman","Cicero","Tironian_notes","Latin","Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire","Carolingian_Renaissance","Monastery","Secularization","Protestant_Reformation","China","Chinese_character","England","Timothy_Bright","Edmond_Willis","Thomas_Shelton_(stenographer)","Sir_Isaac_Newton","Theophilus_Metcalfe","Jeremiah_Rich","Floruit","German_language","John_Byrom","Samuel_Taylor_(stenographer)","Taylor_shorthand","Germany","Franz_Xaver_Gabelsberger","Gabelsberger_shorthand","Cursive_script_(East_Asia)","Sir_Isaac_Pitman","Latin_language","Phonemic_orthography","Vowel","Cincinnati","Ohio","United_States","John_Robert_Gregg","Thomas_Stratford_Malone","Boyd's_Syllabic_Shorthand","Duployan_shorthand","Kamloops_Wawa","Chinook_Jargon","Teeline_Shorthand","Thomas_Natural_Shorthand","Stenoscript","Stenospeed","Speedwriting","Forkner_shorthand","Quickhand","Alpha_Hand","Personal_Shorthand","SuperWrite","Easy_Script_Speed_Writing","Agiliwriting","Keyscript","Computer","Personal_digital_assistant","Cellphone","Stenotype","Alphanumeric_keyboard","Subtitling","Velotype","Palantype","Grandjean_Stenotype","Michela_Stenotype","Stenokey","Speech-to-Text_Reporter","Teeline_Shorthand","National_Council_for_the_Training_of_Journalists","Current_Shorthand","Henry_Sweet","Duployan_Shorthand","Eclectic_Shorthand","Gabelsberger_shorthand","Deutsche_Einheitskurzschrift","Gregg_Shorthand","John_Robert_Gregg","Munson_Shorthand","Personal_Shorthand","Pitman_Shorthand","Speedwriting","Teeline_Shorthand","James_Hill_(stenographer)","Tironian_notae","Autocomplete","Abbreviation","Breviograph","Captioned_telephone","Closed_captioning","Court_reporter","Internet_slang","Interpreting_notes","Modi_script","Quikscript","Shavian_alphabet","Stenomask","Transcript_(law)"]}
