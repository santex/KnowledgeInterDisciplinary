Among his compositions are chamber works (including\ntwo string quartets, a piano trio, piano quartet and a quintet for piano,\nstrings and winds), symphonic poems, three symphonies, at least seven operas\n(the most famous probably [[Å Ã¡rka (Fibich)|Å Ã¡rka]] and [[The Bride of Messina\n(opera)|The Bride of Messina]]), melodramas including the substantial trilogy\n[[Hippodamia]], liturgical music including a mass - a missa brevis; and a large\ncycle (almost 400 pieces, from the 1890s) of piano works called Moods,\nImpressions, and Reminiscences. The piano cycle served as a diary of sorts of\nhis love for a piano pupil. He was born in VÅ¡eboÅice (Å eboÅice) near ÄÃ¡slav.\n\nThat Fibich is far less known than either AntonÃ­n DvoÅÃ¡k or BedÅich Smetana can\nbe explained by the fact that he lived during the rise of Czech nationalism\nwithin the Habsburg Empire. And while Smetana and DvoÅÃ¡k gave themselves over\nentirely to the national cause, consciously writing Czech music with which the\nemerging nation strongly identified, Fibichâs position was more ambivalent. That\nthis was so was due to the background of his parents and to his education.\nFibichâs father was a Czech forestry official and the composerâs early life was\nspent on various wooded estates of the nobleman for whom his father worked. His\nmother, however, was an ethnic German Viennese. Home schooled by his mother\nuntil the age of nine, he was first sent to a German-speaking gymnasium in\nVienna for two years before attending a Czech speaking gymnasium in Prague where\nhe stayed until he was 15. After this he was sent to Leipzig where he remained\nfor three years studying piano with Ignaz Moscheles and composition with Salomon\nJadassohn and Ernst Richter. Then, after the better part of a year in Paris,\nFibich concluded his studies with Vinzenz Lachner (the younger brother of Franz\nand Ignaz) in Mannheim. Fibich spent the next few years living with his parents\nback in Prague where he composed his first opera Bukovina, based on a libretto\nof Karel Sabina, the librettist of [[The Bartered Bride]]. At the age of 23, he\nmarried RÅ¯Å¾ena HanuÅ¡ovÃ¡ and took up residence in the Lithuanian city of Vilnius\nwhere he had obtained a position of choirmaster. After spending two personally\nunhappy years there (his wife and newly born twins both died in Vilnius), he\nreturned to Prague in 1874 and remained there until his death in 1900. In 1875\nFibich married RÅ¯Å¾ena's sister, the operatic contralto Betty FibichovÃ¡ (nÃ©e\nHanuÅ¡ovÃ¡), but left her in 1895 for his former student and lover AneÅ¾ka\nSchulzovÃ¡. The relationship between SchulzovÃ¡ and Fibich was important to him\nartistically, since she both wrote the libretti for all his later operas\nincluding [[Å Ã¡rka (Fibich)|Å Ã¡rka]], but also served as the inspiration for his\nMoods, Impressions, and Reminiscences.\n\nFibich was given a bi-cultural education, living, during his formative early\nyears, in Germany, France and Austria in addition to his native Bohemia. He was\nfluent in German as well as Czech. In his instrumental works, Fibich generally\nwrote in the vein of the German romantics, first falling under the influence of\nWeber, Mendelssohn and Schumann and later Wagner. His early operas and close to\n200 of his early songs are in German. These works along with his symphonies and\nchamber music won considerable praise from German critics if not from Czechs.\nThe bulk of Fibichâs operas are in Czech, although many are based on subjects\nfrom non-Czechs such as Shakespeare, Schiller and Byron. In his chamber music,\nmore than anywhere else, Fibich makes use of Bohemian folk melodies and dance\nrhythms such as the Dumka. Fibich was the first to write a Czech nationalist\ntone poem (ZÃ¡boj, Slavoj a LudÄk) which served as the inspiration for Smetanaâs\n[[MÃ¡ vlast]]. He was also the first to use the polka in a chamber work, his\nquartet in A.\n\nIn the years after his return to Prague in 1874, Fibich's music encountered\nseverely negative reactions in the Prague musical community, stemming from his\n(and Smetana's) adherence to Richard Wagner's theories on opera. While Smetana's\nlater career was plagued with problems for presenting Wagnerian-style music\ndramas in Czech before a conservative audience, Fibich's pugilistic music\ncriticism, not to mention his overtly Wagnerian later operas, Hedy, [[Å Ã¡rka\n(Fibich)|Å Ã¡rka]], and PÃ¡d Arkuna, exacerbated the problem in the years after\nSmetana's death in 1884. Together with the music aesthetician Otakar HostinskÃ½\nhe was ostracized from the musical establishment at the National Theatre and\nPrague Conservatory, and forced to rely on his private composition studio. This\nstudio nevertheless was well respected among students, drawing such names as\nEmanuel ChvÃ¡la, Karel KovaÅovic, Otakar OstrÄil, and ZdenÄk NejedlÃ½, the\nnotorious critic and subsequent politician. Much of the reception of Fibich's\nmusic in the early twentieth century is a result of these students' efforts\nafter their teacher's death, especially in NejedlÃ½'s highly polemical campaigns\nenacted in a series of monographs and articles that sought to redress what he\nconsidered to be past inequities. Although this served to bring Fibich's music\nto greater attention, subsequent scholarship has had to deal with the spectre of\nNejedlÃ½'s intensely personal bias.\n\nThere is a Fibich Society which has organized projects such as Hudec's\nThematic Catalog below, and\n[http://www.music.ucsb.edu/projects/csms/csmsnew2.html much else].\n\nFibich was the original composer of the tune for \"My Moonlight Madonna\" for\nwhich Paul Francis Webster wrote the English lyrics. In 1933 the tune was\npopularly harmonized by William Scotti.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Zdeněk_Fibich","recorded":1375067789,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Zdenek_Fibich.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Zdenek_Fibich.jpg/200px-Zdenek_Fibich.jpg","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Czech_and_Slovak","/wiki/List_of_Czech_composers","/wiki/European_classical_music","/wiki/String_quartet","/wiki/Piano_trio","/wiki/Piano_quartet","/wiki/Quintet","/wiki/Symphonic_poem","/wiki/Symphony","/wiki/Opera","/wiki/%C5%A0%C3%A1rka_(Fibich)","/wiki/The_Bride_of_Messina_(opera)","/wiki/Melodrama","/wiki/Hippodamia","/wiki/Mass_(music)","/wiki/%C4%8C%C3%A1slav","/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k","/wiki/Bed%C5%99ich_Smetana","/wiki/Czech_nationalism","/wiki/Habsburg_Empire","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Leipzig","/wiki/Ignaz_Moscheles","/wiki/Salomon_Jadassohn","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Vinzenz_Lachner","/wiki/Franz_Lachner","/wiki/Ignaz_Lachner","/wiki/Mannheim","/wiki/The_Bartered_Bride","/wiki/Vilnius","/wiki/Contralto","/wiki/Betty_Fibichov%C3%A1","/wiki/%C5%A0%C3%A1rka_(Fibich)","/wiki/Wagner","/wiki/Shakespeare","/wiki/Schiller","/wiki/Byron","/wiki/M%C3%A1_vlast","/wiki/Richard_Wagner","/wiki/Music_drama","/wiki/%C5%A0%C3%A1rka_(Fibich)","/wiki/Aesthetics_of_music","/wiki/Otakar_Hostinsk%C3%BD","/wiki/National_Theatre_(Prague)","/wiki/Prague_Conservatory","/wiki/Emanuel_Chv%C3%A1la","/wiki/Karel_Kova%C5%99ovic","/wiki/Otakar_Ostr%C4%8Dil","/wiki/Zden%C4%9Bk_Nejedl%C3%BD","http://www.music.ucsb.edu/projects/csms/csmsnew2.html","/wiki/Paul_Francis_Webster","/wiki/1933_in_music#Published_popular_music","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich","/wiki/Category:Compositions_by_Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Olomouc","/wiki/Special:BookSources/8086385108","/wiki/Michael_Kennedy_(music_critic)","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0198608845","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit&section=3","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Fibich,_Zden%C4%9Bk","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","http://hjem.get2net.dk/Brofeldt/Catalogue_f.htm","http://www.musicianbios.com/Biography/38303/Zdenek-Fibich.htm","http://www.nekrolog.cz/index.php/1900/10/","http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/May02/Fibich_Sarka.htm","http://www.editionsilvertrust.com/music-books-a-to-g.htm","http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n84-132607","/wiki/WorldCat","http://hdl.handle.net/1802/4398","http://hdl.handle.net/1802/1487","http://hdl.handle.net/1802/1233","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/22327203","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zdeněk_Fibich&oldid=565515911","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Romantic_composers","/wiki/Category:Opera_composers","/wiki/Category:Czech_composers","/wiki/Category:Czech_nationalists","/wiki/Category:1850_births","/wiki/Category:1900_deaths","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Czech_people","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_April_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zden%C4%9Bk+Fibich&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zden%C4%9Bk+Fibich","/wiki/Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich","/wiki/Talk:Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich","#","/wiki/Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zden%C4%9Bk_Fibich&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/st
