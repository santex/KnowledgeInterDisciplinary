It has a population of 3,85 million (census 2007). The\nprovincial capital is Quelimane on the Bons Sinais River.\n\nZambezia has a total area of 103,127 km 2, much of it drained by\nthe Zambezi River. Much of the coast consists of mangrove swamps, and there is\nconsiderable forest inland.\n\nAgricultural products include rice, maize, cassava, cashews, sugarcane,\ncoconuts, citrus, cotton, and tea; the country's largest tea estates are at\nGurÃºÃ¨. Fishing is especially productive of shrimp, and gemstones are mined at\nseveral sites.\n\nVasco da Gama landed at the site of Quelimane in 1498. Shortly after, the\nPortuguese established a permanent presence, and many moved up the Zambezi into\nthe interior, for many years the farthest inland European presence (although\nover time there was much intermarrying, and few residents were of purely\nPortuguese descent).\n","linknr":184,"url":"Zambezia_Province","recorded":1362562434,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Provinces of Mozambique","Former Portuguese colonies","Zambezia Province|"],"headings":["Districts","Stamps and postal history of Zambezia","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Mozambique_Provinces_Zambezia_250px.png/220px-Mozambique_Provinces_Zambezia_250px.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Stamp_Zambezia_1903_25r.jpg/130px-Stamp_Zambezia_1903_25r.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Flag_of_Mozambique.svg/44px-Flag_of_Mozambique.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mozambique","Nampula_Province","Sofala_Province","Quelimane","Bons_Sinais_River","Zambezi_River","Mangrove","Rice","Maize","Cassava","Cashew","Sugarcane","Coconut","Citrus","Cotton","Tea","Gurúè","Fishing","Shrimp","Gemstone","Vasco_da_Gama","Alto_Molocue_District","Chinde_District","Gilé_District","Gurué_District","Ile,_Mozambique","Inhassunge_District","Lugela_District","Maganja_da_Costa_District","Milange_District","Mocuba_District","Mopeia_District","Morrumbala_District","Namacurra_District","Namarroi_District","Nicoadala_District","Pebane_District","Portuguese_East_Africa_Colony","Postage_stamp","Charles_of_Portugal","Provisional_issue","Overprint","Quelimane","Tete","Mozambique"]}
