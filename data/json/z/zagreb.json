It\nis located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the\nsouthern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of\napproximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011, the\npopulation of the settlement of Zagreb was 792,875.<ref></ref> The wider Zagreb\nmetropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County\nbringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,110,517. It is the only\nmetropolitan area in Croatia with a population of over one\nmillion.<ref>{{Croatian Census 2011 First Results |format= HTML |url=\nhttp://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/htm/e11_RH.html |title= Enumerated\npersons, households and housing units |accessdate= 2011-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nZagreb has a special status in the Republic of Croatia's administrative division\nand is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is\nadministratively subdivided into 17 city districts, most of them being at low\nelevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city\ndistricts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills\nof the Sljeme mountain, making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The\ncity extends over 30 kilometres east-west and around 20 kilometres north-south,\ncovering an immense area of Prigorje region. Its favourable geographic position\nin the southwestern part of the Pannonian Basin, which extends to the Alpine,\nDinaric, Adriatic and Pannonic regions, provides an excellent connection for\ntraffic between Central Europe and the Adriatic Sea. The transport connections,\nconcentration of industry, scientific and research institutions and industrial\ntradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat\nof the central government, administrative bodies and almost all government\nministries. Zagreb is a global and cosmopolitan city, and one of the leading\ncentres of Central and Southeastern Europe.\n","title":"zagreb","headings":["History","Climate","Demographics","Economy","Cityscape","Metropolitan administration","Transport","Cultural sites","Education","Religious
