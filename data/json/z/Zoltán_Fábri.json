His films [[The Boys of Paul Street]] (1969) and [[Hungarians (film)|Hungarians]] (1978) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign\nLanguage Film. His 1965 film [[Twenty Hours]] shared the Grand Prix with [[War\nand Peace (film series)|War and Peace]] at the 4th Moscow International Film\nFestival. His 1969 film [[The Toth Family]] was\nentered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1975 film [[141 Minutes from the Unfinished\nSentence]] was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, where he\nwon a Special Prize for Directing.\n\nFÃ¡bri wanted to become an artist from an early age on. He studied painting and\ngraduated at the Hungarian College of Fine Arts. He began working in the\nHungarian film industry in 1950 as a production designer. He directed his first\nfilm [[Vihar]] (Storm) in 1951. He became an internationally acclaimed director\nwith his third feature KÃ¶rhinta ([[Merry-Go-Round (1956 film)|Merry Go-Round]])\nin 1956. He continued directing and writing until the early 1980s. After his\nretirement from the film industry FÃ¡bri taught on the Hungarian University of\nTheatrical and Film Arts. In his last years he wrote screenplays; they were\nnever made. FÃ¡bri was also the president of the Hungarian Film Artist Union from\n1959 to 1981.\n\nFÃ¡bri's style of filmmaking can be described mainly as \"classical\", using\nacademic techniques of art filmmaking. His greatest influences were the Italian\nNeorealism and French Poetic Realism. He experimented with narrative and\nflashback techniques for a while in the 1960s (in his films Nappali sÃ¶tÃ©tsÃ©g and\nHÃºsz Ã³ra) and his 1976 film [[Az Ã¶tÃ¶dik pecsÃ©t]] contains some highly surrealist\nscenes, but overall he never used the mannerisms of modernist film in his works.\nFor this reason the KÃ¡dÃ¡r regime favored FÃ¡bri over more controversial and\nexperimental directors like MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³. The film won the Golden Prize at the\n10th Moscow International Film Festival and was\nentered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nAt the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the\nHonorable Prize for the contribution to cinema.\n\nHe was known as a perfectionist who wrote, drawn and choreographed every scene\nto the most precise detail months before production began and never improvised\nanything. His reputation as a rigid, tyrannical director was somewhat\ncontradicted by his friendly and kind behaviour towards the British and American\nchild actors on the set of The Boys of Paul Street.\n\nFÃ¡bri made nearly all of his films based on literary material (novels or short\nstories) and wrote the screenplays himself. His constant theme was the question\nof humanity. Many of his films are set in or around World War II. Two of his\nfrequent collaborators were actress Mari TÃ¶rÅcsik and cinematographer GyÃ¶rgy\nIllÃ©s. In 1969 he played the role of prosecuted statesman ZoltÃ¡n DÃ¡niel in his\nfriend PÃ©ter BacsÃ³'s cult satire, [[The Witness (1969 Hungarian film)|A tanÃº]]\n(The Witness) as his sole acting job.\n\nFÃ¡bri died in a heart attack at the age of 76 in 1994.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Zoltán_Fábri","recorded":1375072516,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:F%C3%A1bri_Zolt%C3%A1n_s%C3%ADrja.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/F%C3%A1bri_Zolt%C3%A1n_s%C3%ADrja.jpg/220px-F%C3%A1bri_Zolt%C3%A1n_s%C3%ADrja.jpg","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Austria-Hungary","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Hungarian_people","/wiki/Film_director","/wiki/Screenwriter","/wiki/The_Boys_of_Paul_Street","#cite_note-Oscars1969-1","/wiki/Hungarians_(film)","#cite_note-Oscars1979-2","/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film","/wiki/Twenty_Hours","/wiki/War_and_Peace_(film_series)","/wiki/4th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-Moscow1965-3","/wiki/The_Toth_Family","/wiki/7th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-Moscow1971-4","/wiki/141_Minutes_from_the_Unfinished_Sentence","/wiki/9th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-Moscow1975-5","/w/index.php?title=Hungarian_College_of_Fine_Arts&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Vihar&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Merry-Go-Round_(1956_film)","/w/index.php?title=Hungarian_University_of_Theatrical_and_Film_Arts&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Neorealism_(art)","/wiki/France","/wiki/Poetic_Realism","/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)","/wiki/Az_%C3%B6t%C3%B6dik_pecs%C3%A9t","/wiki/Surrealist","/w/index.php?title=Modernist_film&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/J%C3%A1nos_K%C3%A1d%C3%A1r","/wiki/Mikl%C3%B3s_Jancs%C3%B3","/wiki/10th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-Moscow1977-6","/wiki/27th_Berlin_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-imdb-7","/wiki/11th_Moscow_International_Film_Festival","#cite_note-Moscow1979-8","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Mari_T%C3%B6r%C5%91csik","/w/index.php?title=Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ill%C3%A9s&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/P%C3%A9ter_Bacs%C3%B3","/wiki/The_Witness_(1969_Hungarian_film)","/wiki/Heart_attack","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Merry-Go-Round_(1956_film)","/wiki/Professor_Hannibal","/wiki/%C3%89des_Anna","/wiki/D%C3%BAvad","/wiki/Two_Half_Times_in_Hell","/wiki/Twenty_Hours","/wiki/The_Toth_Family","/wiki/141_Minutes_from_the_Unfinished_Sentence","/wiki/The_Fifth_Seal","/wiki/Hungarians_(film)","/wiki/Requiem_(1982_film)","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Oscars1969_1-0","http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/41st-winners.html","#cite_ref-Oscars1979_2-0","http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/51st-winners.html","#cite_ref-Moscow1965_3-0","http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1965","#cite_ref-Moscow1971_4-0","http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971","#cite_ref-Moscow1975_5-0","http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1975","#cite_ref-Moscow1977_6-0","http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1977","#cite_ref-imdb_7-0","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075467/awards","#cite_ref-Moscow1979_8-0","http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1979","/w/index.php?title=Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri&action=edit&section=3","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299586/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/118138704","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Film_director","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Austria-Hungary","/wiki/Budapest","/wiki/Hungary","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoltán_Fábri&oldid=558760781","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1917_births","/wiki/Category:1994_deaths","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_film_directors","/wiki/Category:Hungarian_screenwriters","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zolt%C3%A1n+F%C3%A1bri&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Zolt%C3%A1n+F%C3%A1bri","/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri","/wiki/Talk:Zolt%C3%A1n_F%C3%A1bri","#","/
