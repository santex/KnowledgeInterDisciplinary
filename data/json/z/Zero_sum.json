{"cursor":"14911","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}}\n\nIn game theory and economic theory, a 'zeroâsum game' is a mathematical\nrepresentation of a situation in which a participant's gain (or loss) of utility\nis exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other\nparticipant(s). If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the\ntotal losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus cutting a cake, where\ntaking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a\nzeroâsum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal\nutility). In contrast, 'non-zeroâsum' describes a situation in which the\ninteracting parties' aggregate gains and losses are either less than or more\nthan zero. A zeroâsum game is also called a strictly competitive game while non-\nzeroâsum games can be either competitive or non-competitive. Zeroâsum games are\nmost often solved with the minimax theorem which is closely related to linear\nprogramming duality, or with Nash equilibrium.\n\nIn common parlance, the expression zero-sum game is often used in a pejorative\nsense. It is especially used to point out cases where both sides may gain by an\ninteraction (such as a business transaction), contrary to an assumption that the\nevent must be competitive (zero-sum).\n","linknr":362,"url":"Zero_sum","recorded":1362485797,"links":45,"instances":["journalist","decision_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-cooperative games","International relations theory"],"headings":["Definition","Solution","Non-zero–sum","Extensions","Misunderstandings","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/7/d7767371cf2ea8dcb5922c5f52afc9c6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/3/363b122c528f54df4a0446b6bab05515.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/7/5c7a368ba8a0e0fe099f113c565d6e64.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/3/893b7719713faaa97b1caa5603313723.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/3/893b7719713faaa97b1caa5603313723.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["maximin","decision_theory"],["robert_wright","journalist"]],"members":["robert_wright","maximin"],"related":["Game_theory","Economic_theory","Mathematical_model","Utility","Cake_cutting","Marginal_utility","Minimax_theorem","Nash_equilibrium","Pareto_optimal","Game_theory","Solution_concept","Nash_equilibrium","Minimax","Maximin_(decision_theory)","Mixed_strategy","Payoff_matrix","Émile_Borel","John_von_Neumann","Probability","Expected_value","Linear_programming","Minimax","Nash_equilibrium","Linear_programming","Transaction_costs","Coercion","Information_asymmetry","Perfect_information","The_Market_for_Lemons","Comparative_advantage","Zero-sum_fallacy","Gains_from_trade","Free_trade","Social_Traps","Robert_Wright_(journalist)","President_of_the_United_States","Bill_Clinton","John_von_Neumann","Oskar_Morgenstern","Rational_choice_theory","Game"]}
