In 'direct zoonosis' the agent needs only\none host for completion of its life cycle, without a significant change during\ntransmission.\n\nIn a systematic review of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were\nzoonotic.

The emergence of a pathogen into a new\nhost species is called disease invasion or \"disease emergence\".\n\nThe emerging interdisciplinary field of conservation medicine, which integrates\nhuman and veterinary medicine, and environmental sciences, is largely concerned\nwith zoonoses.\n","linknr":899,"url":"Zoonotic","recorded":1362672741,"links":87,"instances":["medicine","animal_disease","biology","biology","disease","biology","human","disease","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5404.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5404.pdf","http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/aboutdhs/budget/0507budget/w-m_ph_ph1_ov.pdf","http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/aboutdhs/budget/0507budget/w-m_ph_ph1_ov.pdf","http://www.medvetnet.org/pdf/Reports/Report_07-001.pdf","http://www.medvetnet.org/pdf/Reports/Report_07-001.pdf"],"categories":["Animal
