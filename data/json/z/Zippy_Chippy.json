Tom Gilcoyne, a retired historian for the National Museum of\nRacing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York, said that Zippy Chippy\n\"...hasn't done anything to harm the sport. But it's a little bit like looking\nat the recorded performances of all horse races through the wrong end of the\ntelescope.\"\n\nFelix Monserrate, who had boarded Zippy Chippy, acquired the horse in 1995 in a\ntrade for an '88 Ford truck. Eventually, Zippy Chippy was banned from competing\nat numerous tracks. The only track not to ban him was at the Northampton,\nMassachusetts' Three-County Fair.\n\nIn August 2001, he came home first against a minor league baseball player in a\nrace. (Although there are sources that say he lost this 40-yard dash, it seems\nthere may have been two races. On August 18, 2000, Rochester outfielder JosÃ©\nHerrera outran Zippy Chippy in a 40-yard race.) Zippy also won against a\nharness racer called Paddy's Laddy. He squeaked past Paddy's Laddy and his rig\nto win by a neck in a publicity stunt in which he spotted the trotter a twenty-\nlength lead.\n\nAfter his win, Monserrate said, \"It feels good to win but it doesn't count until\nwe do it against thoroughbreds. Who knows? Maybe winning will give him a little\nheart.\" Monserrate refused to enter his horse in a claiming race just to get a\nwin. \"I don't want any crazy people claiming him. He's like a member of my\nfamily. He's mean, he kicks, he bites, but he has a home forever with me and my\ndaughter.\"\n\nZippy Chippy's 100th loss occurred on September 10, 2004, in the Northampton\nFair at the Three County Fairgrounds. He went off at odds of 7-2, making him the\nsecond betting\nchoice.

Said his\njockey, \"It would be nice if people took photos at the end of the race too.\"\nHowever, Zippy Chippy finished last.\n\nIn December 2004, he retired to become an outrider pony at his hometown track,\nFinger Lakes racetrack in Farmington, New York, where he'd also been banned from\nracing on September 8, 1998, after failing to leave the gate with the rest of\nthe field for the third consecutive time. As an outrider pony, he escorted\nhorses in the post parade and led them to the gate.\n\nIn 2000, People magazine included Zippy Chippy on its list of that year's most\ninteresting personalities. An English ad campaign used his name and image to\nconvince kids to stay in school.\n\n\"Say you have three children,\" Monserrate said, \"One is a lawyer, doing well.\nThe other a doctor, very, very successful. But the third one, not so smart, so\nhe's working at McDonald's. What do you do? Ignore him? Course not. He's the one\nwho needs your help. That's Zippy.\" [http://www.boston.com/sports/other_spo-\nrts/horse_racing/articles/2003/09/07/despite_game_effort_zippy_chippy_gets_zip/\nDespite Game Effort, Zippy Chippy Gets Zip], Boston
