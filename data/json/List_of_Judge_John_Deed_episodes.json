{"cursor":"28262","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe British courtroom drama television series [[Judge John Deed]], starring\nMartin Shaw as a maverick High Court judge, began with a pilot episode called\n\"Exacting Justice\", which was first broadcast on BBC One on 9 January 2001. The\nseries proper began on 26 November 2001. The first to third series contained\nfour 90-minute episodes, the fourth and fifth were extended to a six-episode run\nand the latest series comprised two 120-minute episodes split into two parts on\nbroadcast. When it began, the programme followed an episodic format, though\nlater series have developed a serialised format, with plots developing over a\nnumber of stories.\n\nAs of the end of the sixth series in 2007, the number of episodes is 29. The\npossibility of more episodes was in doubt after Shaw became involved in other\nprojects, and the series had been officially cancelled by the BBC by\n2009. The first four series have been released on DVD in\nthe UK. The pilot and first series were released in North America in March 2010.\n","linknr":224,"url":"List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes","recorded":1375074648,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/British_people","/wiki/Courtroom_drama","/wiki/Television_series","/wiki/Judge_John_Deed","/wiki/Martin_Shaw","/wiki/High_Court_judge","/wiki/Television_pilot","/wiki/BBC_One","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#Pilot_.282001.29","#Series_1_.282001.29","#Series_2_.282002.29","#Series_3_.282003.E2.80.932004.29","#Series_4_.282005.29","#Series_5_.282006.29","#Series_6_.282007.29","#Broadcast_history","#Notes_and_references","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-4","/wiki/G.F._Newman","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Murder_in_English_law","/wiki/Provocation_in_English_law","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-6","/wiki/MI5","/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor%27s_Department","/wiki/Newton_hearing","/wiki/Date_rape","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Corporate_manslaughter_(England_and_Wales)","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm","/wiki/Bail#In_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Witness_tampering","#cite_note-9","/wiki/General_practitioner#United_Kingdom","/wiki/Expert_witness","/wiki/HIV","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Pound_sterling","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Trade_and_Industry","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Hit_and_run_(vehicular)","#cite_note-judicialreview-15","/wiki/Non-custodial_sentence","#cite_note-judicialreview-15","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom","/wiki/Perverting_the_course_of_justice","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Trade_and_Industry","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Armed_robbery","#cite_note-19","/wiki/South_Africa","#cite_note-20","/wiki/Home_Office","#cite_note-21","#cite_note-22","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","/wiki/Sussex_University","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","/wiki/Depleted_uranium","#cite_note-27","/wiki/MMR_vaccine","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-racerow-28","/wiki/British_National_Party","#cite_note-29","#cite_note-racerow-28","#cite_note-30","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes&action=edit&section=9","#cite_ref-1","http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/16073/sentence-hangs-over-judge-john-deed","/wiki/The_Stage","#cite_ref-2","http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/30/martin-s-tv-judge-deed-and-buried-115875-21319793/","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a1677/new-bbc1-drama-hit-with-viewers.html","/wiki/Digital_Spy","#cite_ref-6","http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,607956,00.html","/wiki/Guardian_Unlimited","#cite_ref-7","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,611943,00.html","#cite_ref-8","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,616993,00.html","#cite_ref-9","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,620642,00.html","#cite_ref-10","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,845501,00.html","#cite_ref-11","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,850677,00.html","#cite_ref-12","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,859486,00.html","#cite_ref-13","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,863757,00.html","#cite_ref-14","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1095518,00.html","#cite_ref-judicialreview_15-0","#cite_ref-judicialreview_15-1","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1105741,00.html","#cite_ref-16","http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1132264,00.html","#cite_ref-17","/wiki/Crimewatch","/wiki/Soham_murders","http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2003/10_october/24/drama_nov.shtml#
