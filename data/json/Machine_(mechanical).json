{"cursor":"27588","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Machines' employ power to achieve desired forces and movement. A machine has a\npower source and actuators that generate forces and movement, and a system of\nmechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of\noutput forces and movement. Modern machines often include computers and sensors\nthat monitor performance and plan movement, and are called mechanical systems.\n\nThe meaning of the word \"machine\" is traced by the Oxford English Dictionary Oxford English Dictionary to an independently functioning\nstructure and by Merriam-Webster Dictionary Merriam-\nWebster Dictionary [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/machine Definition\nof machine] to something that has been constructed. This includes human\ndesign into the meaning of machine.\n\nThe adjective \"mechanical\" refers to skill in the practical application of an\nart or science, as well as relating to or caused by movement, physical forces,\nproperties or agents such as is dealt with by mechanics.\nSimilarly Merriam-Webster Dictionary Merriam-Webster\nDictionary [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mechanical Definition of\nmechanical] defines \"mechanical\" as relating to machinery or tools.\n\nPower flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of\ndevices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems.\nThe German mechanician Franz Reuleaux Reuleaux, F., 1876\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=WUZVAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=kinematic-\ns+of+machinery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qpn4Tse-\nE9SasgLcsZytDw&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=kinematics%20of%20machinery&f=false\nThe Kinematics of Machinery,] (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy),\nreprinted by Dover, New York (1963) wrote \"a machine is a combination of\nresistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature\ncan be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion.\" Notice\nthat forces and motion combine to define power.\n\nMore recently, Uicker et al. J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock,\nand J. E. Shigley, 2003, 'Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,' Oxford University\nPress, New York. state that a machine is \"a device for applying power or\nchanging its direction.\" And McCarthy and Soh J.
