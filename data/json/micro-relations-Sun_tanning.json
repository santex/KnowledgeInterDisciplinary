The process is most often a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV)\nradiation from the sun or from artificial sources, such as a tanning bed, but\ncan also be a result of windburn or reflected light. People who deliberately tan\ntheir skin by exposure to the sun engage in 'sun bathing', though there are also\nartificial tanning methods. Some people use chemical products which can produce\na tanning result without exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Casual exposure to\nthe sun has moderate beneficial impact, including the production of vitamin D by\nthe body, but excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays has detrimental health\neffects, including possible sunburn and even skin cancer, as well as depressed\nimmune system function and increased risk of accelerated aging. To avoid\nsunburn, most people apply suitable sunscreen to skin exposed to the sun, but\nothers use oils to accelerate the tanning process.\n\nSome people tan or sunburn more easily than others. This may be the result\nof different skin types and natural skin color, and these may be as a result\nof genetics.\n\nThe term \"tanning\" has a cultural origin, arising from the color tan. Its origin\nlies in the Western culture of Europe when it became fashionable for young women\nto seek a less pale complexion (see Cultural history below).\n","linknr":491,"url":"Sun_tanning","recorded":1362483211,"links":53,"instances":["headgear","modern"],"pdf":["http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/127/1/99.pdf","http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/127/1/99.pdf"],"categories":["Sun tanning|","Ultraviolet radiation"],"headings":["Tanning process","Tanning behavior of different skin colors","Avoiding tan lines","Sunless tanning","Tanning controversy","Tanning agents","Cultural history","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Skin_tanning.JPG/220px-Skin_tanning.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Jeremy_beatertan.jpg/170px-Jeremy_beatertan.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/715px-Sunbedoff_large.jpg/220px-715px-Sunbedoff_large.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Monet_Umbrella.JPG/220px-Monet_Umbrella.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["celts","modern"],["bonnet","headgear"]],"members":["bonnet","celts"],"related":["Human_skin_color","Ultraviolet_radiation","Tanning_bed","Windburn","Vitamin_D","Sunburn","Skin_cancer","Sunscreen","Skin_color","Genetics","Melanin","Melanocytes","Melanogenesis","Pheomelanin","Eumelanin","Direct_DNA_damage","Indirect_DNA_damage","Melanogenesis","Pyrimidine_dimers","Ultraviolet","Ultraviolet","Melanocyte","Reactive_oxygen_species","Cyclobutane_pyrimidine_dimer","Direct_DNA_damage","Direct_DNA_damage","Cyclobutane_pyrimidine_dimer","Vitamin_D","Sun_protection_factor","Melanocytic_nevus","Thomas_B._Fitzpatrick","Fitzpatrick_scale","Von_Luschan_scale","Celts_(modern)","Mediterranean_race","Olive_skin","Brown_people","Black_people","Tan_line","Aesthetic","Nudity","Clothing-optional_beaches","Nude_beach","Toplessness","Swimsuit","Microkini","Tan-through_swimwear","Sunburn","Sunscreen","Shade","Sunless_tanning","Dihydroxyacetone","Dyes","Tyrosine","Make-up","Gels","Lotions","Cosmetics","Spas","Beauty_salon","Erythrulose","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Human_eyes","Lip","Skin_cancer","DNA","Melanoma","US_Public_Health_Service","Ultraviolet","Carcinogen","Michael_Holick","Seasonal_affective_disorder","Dermatologist","American_Academy_of_Dermatology","Psoralen","Photocarcinogen","AltaMira_Press","Bonnet_(headgear)","Parasol","Lead_poisoning","Arsenic","Victorian_era","Niels_Finsen","Lupus_vulgaris","Rickets","Vitamin_D_deficiency","Edward_VII","Sigmaringen","Coco_Chanel","French_Riviera","Josephine_Baker","Paris","Arcadia_Publishing","Jean_Patou","Bikini","Coppertone","Coppertone_girl","Sun_protection_factor","Mattel","Sunscreen","Tanning_beds","Ski_masks","Sunless_tanning","Sunburn","Tanning_booth","Tanning_bed","Freckles","Health_effects_of_sun_exposure","Skin_whitening","Slip-Slop-Slap","Sun_glasses","Sunscreen","Tanning_addiction"]}
