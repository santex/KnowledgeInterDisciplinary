{"cursor":"18718","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ultimate tensile strength' ('UTS'), often shortened to 'tensile strength'\n('TS') or 'ultimate strength', is the maximum stress that\na material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before failing or\nbreaking. Tensile strength is the opposite of compressive strength and the\nvalues can be quite different.\n\nSome materials will break sharply, without deforming, in what is called a\nbrittle failure. Others, which are more ductile, including most metals, will\nstretch some - and for rods or bars, shrink or neck at the point of maximum\nstress as that area is stretched out.\n\nThe UTS is usually found by performing a tensile test and recording the stress\nversus strain; the highest point of the stress-strain curve is the UTS. It is an\nintensive property; therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test\nspecimen. However, it is dependent on other factors, such as the preparation of\nthe specimen, the presence or otherwise of surface defects, and the temperature\nof the test environment and material.\n\nTensile strengths are rarely used in the design of ductile members, but they are\nimportant in brittle members. They are tabulated for common materials such as\nalloys, composite materials, ceramics, plastics, and wood.\n\nTensile strength is defined as a stress, which is measured as force per unit\narea. For some non-homogeneous materials (or for assembled components) it can be\nreported just as a force or as a force per unit width. In the SI system, the\nunit is the pascal (Pa) (or a multiple thereof, often megapascals (MPa), using\nthe mega- prefix); or, equivalently to pascals, newtons per square metre (N/mÂ²).\nThe customary unit is pounds-force per square inch (lbf/inÂ² or psi), or kilo-\npounds per square inch (ksi, or sometimes kpsi), which is equal to 1000 psi; kilo-\npounds per square inch are commonly used for convenience when measuring tensile\nstrengths.\n","linknr":369,"url":"Tensile_strength","recorded":1362485869,"links":42,"instances":["fiber","mechanics","unit","engineering","mechanics","engineering","unit","engineering","fiber"],"pdf":["http://www.toraycfa.com/pdfs/T1000GDataSheet.pdf","http://www-lgm2b.iut.u-bordeaux1.fr/publi/PE%20fibre.pdf","http://www.fols.org/fols_library/white_papers/documents/Fiber%20Myths%20White%20Paper%20final.pdf","http://nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf","http://nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf"],"categories":["Materials science","Elasticity (physics)"],"headings":["Concept","Testing","Typical tensile strengths","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Stress_v_strain_Aluminum_2.png/220px-Stress_v_strain_Aluminum_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Stress_v_strain_A36_2.svg/220px-Stress_v_strain_A36_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Al_tensile_test.jpg/220px-Al_tensile_test.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","mechanics"],["necking","engineering"],["strain","engineering"],["pascal","unit"],["newton","unit"],["deformation","engineering"],["tension","mechanics"],["necking","engineering"],["glass","fiber"],["glass","fiber"],["carbon","fiber"]],"members":["carbon","stress","pascal","necking","tension","strain","newton","deformation","glass"],"related":["Stress_(mechanics)","Compressive_strength","Brittle_failure","Ductile","Necking_(engineering)","Tensile_test","Strain_(engineering)","Stress-strain_curve","Intensive_and_extensive_properties","Ductile","Alloy","Composite_material","Ceramic","Plastic","Wood","Force","Area","SI","Pascal_(unit)","SI_prefix","Newton_(unit)","Customary_unit","Pounds-force_per_square_inch","Fracture","Strain_hardening","Deformation_(engineering)","Tension_(mechanics)","Ductile","Plastic_deformation","Ductile","Necking_(engineering)","Statics","Yield_stress","Yield_point","Indentation_hardness","Rockwell_hardness","Steel","A36_steel","Human_skin","Maraging_steel","A514_steel","High-density_polyethylene","Polypropylene","Stainless_steel","Cast_iron","Liquidmetal","Beryllium","Aluminium_alloy","Copper","Cupronickel","Brass","Tungsten","Glass","Glass_(fiber)","Glass_(fiber)","Basalt_fiber","Marble","Concrete","Carbon_(fiber)","Human_hair","Bamboo","Spider_silk","Darwin's_bark_spider","Silkworm","Aramid","Kevlar","Twaron","Ultra_high_molecular_weight_polyethylene","Vectran","Polybenzoxazole","Pine","Bone","Nylon","Epoxy_adhesive","Rubber","Boron","Silicon","Silicon_carbide","Silica","Sapphire","Diamond","Graphene","Carbon_nanotube","Colossal_carbon_tube","Carbon_nanotube","Iron","Silicon","Tungsten","Iron","Titanium","Copper","Tantalum","Tin","Zinc","Nickel","Silver","Gold","Aluminium","Lead","Flexural_strength","Strength_of_materials","Tensile_structure","Toughness"]}
