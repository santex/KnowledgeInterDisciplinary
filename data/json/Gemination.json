Gemination is distinct from stress and may appear independently\nof it. Gemination literally means \"twinning\", and is from the same Latin\nroot as \"Gemini\".\n\n'Consonant length' is distinctive in some languages, for instance Arabic,\nDanish, Estonian, Finnish, Classical Hebrew, Hungarian, Catalan, Italian,\nJapanese, Latin, Russian and Slovak. Most languages (including English) do not\nhave distinctive long consonants. Vowel length is distinctive in more languages\nthan consonant length, although several languages feature both independently (as\nin Japanese, Finnish, and Estonian), or have interdependent vowel and consonant\nlength (as in Norwegian and Swedish).\n","linknr":366,"url":"Gemination","recorded":1362684696,"links":37,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","phonetics","disambiguation","linguistics","orthography","linguistics","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Consonants","Phonetics"],"headings":["Phonology","Examples","Writing","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/45px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Sound-icon.svg/15px-Sound-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","linguistics"],["twinning","disambiguation"],["gemini","disambiguation"],["voice","linguistics"],["mora","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["colon","punctuation#phonetics"],["digraph","orthography"],["length","phonetics"]],"members":["colon","voice","stress","length","twinning","mora","digraph","morphology","gemini"],"related":["Phonetics","Consonant","Consonant","Stress_(linguistics)","Twinning_(disambiguation)","Gemini_(disambiguation)","Distinctive_feature","Arabic_language","Danish_language","Estonian_language","Finnish_language","Classical_Hebrew","Hungarian_language","Catalan_language","Italian_language","Japanese_language","Latin","Russian_language","Slovak_language","English_language","Vowel_length","Norwegian_language","Swedish_language","Fricative_consonant","Nasal_consonant","Lateral_consonant","Approximant_consonant","Trill_consonant","Stop_consonant","Italian_language","Swedish_language","Faroese_language","Icelandic_language","Luganda","Vowel_length","Classical_Arabic","Long_vowel","Consonants","Colloquial_Arabic","Modern_Standard_Arabic","Finnish_language","Vowel_length","Consonant_gradation","Sandhi","Glottal_stop","Pattani_Malay_language","Chuukese_language","Romance_languages","Sicilian_language","Neapolitan_language","High_Alemannic_German","Thurgovia","Setswana","Luganda","Grammar","Spoken_Finnish","Italian_phonology","Sandhi","Stop_consonant","Fricative","Voice_(linguistics)","Consonant_gradation","Nominative","Shadda","Arabic_diacritics","Ambiguity","English_phonology","Root_word","Fricative","Nasal_consonant","Stop_consonant","Affricate","Minimal_pair","Welsh_English","Estonian_language","Suprasegmental","Allophony","Ancient_Greek","Modern_Greek","Cypriot-Greek","Hungarian_language","Italian_language","Mora_(linguistics)","Syntactic_doubling","Japanese_language","Syllabary","Sokuon","Hiragana","Katakana","Latin","Vowel_length","Italian_language","Catalan_language","French_language","Romanian_language","West_Iberian_languages","Nasal_vowel","Portuguese_language","Galician_language","Luganda","Morphology_(linguistics)","Polish_language","Punjabi_language","Gurmukhi_script","Russian_language","Word_formation","Grammatical_conjugation","Ukrainian_language","Wagiman_language","Indigenous_Australian_languages","Fortis_and_lenis","Writing","Shadda","Sokuon","Japanese_language","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","Phonemic","Catalan_orthography","Interpunct","Hungarian_language","Digraph_(orthography)","Luganda","Italian_language","Swedish_language","Norwegian_language","Modern_Greek","Hangul","Korean_romanization","Faucalized_voice","Syntactic_doubling","West_Germanic_gemination","Glottal_stop","Length_(phonetics)","List_of_phonetic_topics"]}
