{"cursor":"3874","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Paul Edward Peek Jr' (June 23, 1937 – April 3, 2001) was an early\nrockabilly pioneer. Peek was born in High Point, NC was raised in Greenville,\nSC. Paul learned to play the guitar, steel guitar and bass while he was 12\nyears old. When he was 14 he played in several local country bands. He\ngraduated from Greenville Senior High School in 1955 and performed (Steel\nGuitar) with Claude Casey and the Sagedusters on WFBC-TV in 1955 on a weekly TV\nshow. In 1956 Paul was recruited as an early member of Gene Vincent & The Blue\nCaps, sometimes stealing the limelight. As a member of the Blue Caps, Peek was\none of the first rock artists to appear in the movies, appearing in [[The Girl\nCan't Help It]] (1956).\n\nPeek had the distinction of being the first artist to record for National\nRecording Corporation out of Atlanta. In 1958, NRC 001 (\"Sweet Skinny\nJenny\"/\"The Rock a Round\") was recorded at WGST Radio Station. In 1958 Paul\nrecorded a novelty song \"Olds-Mo-William\" and performed the song on Dick Clark's\nSaturday Night \"Beech Nut\" National TV Show. Because of distribution problems\nwith NRC Records, the recording died before it could become a national hit. He\nalso appeared on New York City's \"The Big Beat\" with host Alan Freed. Musicians\nwho appeared on Peek's NRC singles included Joe South, Jerry Reed, and Ray\nStevens, Sonny James. Eskew Reeder, Jr, also known as Esquerita was a co-writer\nand keyboard player on this first single. Reeder, a fellow Carolinian, was\ninstrumental in developing the style popularized by Little Richard. Esquerita's\nwild recordings for Capitol Records are collector's items. The flip side of Olds\nMo Williams, \"I'm Not Your Fool Anymore,\" has a fine vocal group backing up\nPaul, the members of which are unknown.\n\nPeek's NRC recordings have been bootlegged in Europe for years, and have now\nbeen re-released on CD by NRC. Although Peek recorded for several major labels\nsome of his most memorable recordings are the NRC singles, Olds-Mo-William and\nThe Rock-Around. Peek's biggest sellers were \"Brother-In-Law (He's A Moocher)\n(1961) produced by Joe South on Fairlane Records (distributed by King reaching\nNo. 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \"Pin The Tail On The Donkey\" (1966),\nanother Joe South Production on CBS Records reaching No. 91 on the chart.\n\nIn early 1964, local Minneapolis band Gregory Dee & The Avantis had a big\nregional hit of Old-Mo-William.\n\nAlthough his national recording career waned, Peek continued to play music\nprofessionally, establishing a stage persona that made him a wildly popular\nnightclub performer in Atlanta, GA for decades. In the early 1980s, he and\nDickie Harrell, Bobby Jones, Bubba Facenda, and Johnny Meeks, all former Blue\nCaps, made the first of several appearances at rockabilly festivals in England.\nThe Blue Caps' popularity was, and is, alive and well in Europe. It was only\nafter his health began to decline that Paul Peek gave up performing publicly.\n\nIn 2012, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Peek as a member of the Blue\nCaps by a special committee, aimed at correcting the previous mistaking of not\nincluding the Blue Caps with Gene Vincent.\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Peek, Paul ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = DATE OF BIRTH =
