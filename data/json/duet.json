      "text" : "\n\n]] A 'duet' is a musical composition for two performers. In classical music, the\nterm is most often used for a composition for two singers or pianists; with\nother instruments, the word [[Wiktionary:duo|duo]] can be used. A piece\nperformed by two pianists performing together on the same piano is referred to\nas \"piano duet\" or \"piano four hands\". A piece for two pianists performing\ntogether on separate pianos is referred to as a \"piano duo\".\n\nWhen Mozart was young, he and his sister Marianne played a duet of his\ncomposition at a London concert in 1765. While young, he helped introduce what a\nduet is. The four-hand, described as a duet, was in many of his compositions.\nWhich also included five sonatas; a set of variations, two performers and one\ninstrument, and a sonata for two pianos. These mark the beginning of duet\nhistory. The first published sonata or duet was in 1777.<ref>Miller, H.-\nM.(1943). The Earliest Keyboard Duets. The Journal of the Musical\nQuarterly,29(4), 438-457.</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century different combinations of four-hand piano were published in\nevery musical genre. On the radio, a duet was blend with different instruments\nsuch as a performance of an orchestra. Arrangements with traditional musical\ndivisions between symphonic and chamber genres, professional and amateur music\ncultures gendered as masculine and feminine. It brought music intended to the\npublic into a home parlor. The 19th century shows that a duet is used in many\ndifferent cultures. <ref>Christensen, T. (1999). Four-Hand Piano. Journal of the\nAmerican Musicological Society, 52(2) 255-298</ref> In 1913 a duet was combined\nwith the Opera and the traditional Plains Indian ritual. Gertrude Simmons Bonnin\nfrom an Indian tribe collaborated with a music teacher, William F. Hanson to\nproduce and stage the combination of Opera with the traditional Plain Indian\nritual in a regional performance. Later on before Bonnin's death in 1938, the\nopera was performed by the New York Opera Guild as opera of the year. The\ncomposition of opera presents the troubles of disparate cultures by harmonizing\nthe traditional Native melodies with western civilization. The combination of\nthe two, known as the Grand Opera, provided context that represents varied and\ncomplex manifestations of culture. With costumes, make-up, singing, dancing and\nstorytelling it provided aspects of the Plains culture with an orchestral\naccompaniment and dramatic plot infused elements of the western civilization. As\na classically trained musician, Bonnin used her skills to affirm her Sioux\ncultural identity and to engage the conventions of popular culture. And Hanson\nused his fondness for Indians and his association with them in an artistic\ncolonialism. The result was an uneasy duet of the two cultures.<ref>Hafen, J.\n(1998, April 1). A Cultural Duet Zitkala Ša And The Sun Dance. Retrieved from\ndigitalcommons.unl.edu</ref>\n\n\"Duet\" is also used as a verb for the act of performing a musical duet, or\ncolloquially as a noun to refer to the performers of a duet. The word is also\noccasionally used in reference to non-musical activities performed together by\ntwo people.\n\nIn Renaissance music, a duet specifically intended as a teaching tool, to be\nperformed by teacher and student, was called a bicinium (see [[Étude]]).\n",
