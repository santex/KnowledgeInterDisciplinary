Closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide, AlO(OH), and\naluminium oxide, Al 2O 3, differing only by loss of water.\nThese compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite.\nFreshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels, which is the basis for\napplication of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification. This gel\ncrystallizes with time. Aluminium hydroxide gels can be dehydrated (e.g., using\nwater-miscible non-aqueous solvents like ethanol) to form an amorphous aluminium\nhydroxide powder, which is readily soluble in acids. Aluminium hydroxide powder\nwhich has been heated to an elevated temperature under carefully controlled\nconditions is known as activated alumina and is used as a desiccant, an\nadsorbent, in gas purification, as a Claus catalyst support, water purification,\nand an adsorbent for the catalyst during the manufacture of polyethylene by the\nSclairtech process.\n","linknr":593,"url":"Aluminium_hydroxide","recorded":1362481714,"links":56,"instances":["materials_science","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aluminium compounds","Antacids","Hydroxides","Inorganic compounds","Phosphate binders"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Properties","Production","Uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Gibbsite-crystal-3D-balls.png/200px-Gibbsite-crystal-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Hydroxid_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG/200px-Hydroxid_hlinit%C3%BD.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/7px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/NFPA_704.svg/75px-NFPA_704.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/14px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","materials_science"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["precipitation","chemistry"]],"members":["polymorphism","precipitation"],"related":["Amorphous","Acid","Alkali","Hydrochloric_acid","Sulfuric_acid","Sodium_oxide","Aluminium_oxide_hydroxide","Gibbsite","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Aluminium_oxide_hydroxide","Aluminium_oxide","Ore","Bauxite","Gel","Flocculation","Aluminium","Hydroxide","Greek_language","Aluminium_phosphate","United_States","Europe","Alpha","Bayerite","Beta","Aluminium_oxide","Gamma","Nordstrandite","Crystallography","Doyleite","Prefix","Dehydration_reaction","Hydrogen_bonds","Amphoteric","Acid","Hydrolysis","Alkali","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Aluminium","Hydroxide","Crystal","Gibbsite","Bayerite","Octahedron","Molecule","Atom","Hydroxyl","Hydrogen_bond","PH","Salt","Chemical_stability","Hexagon","Bayer_process","Red_mud","Red_mud","Ajka_alumina_plant_accident","Red_mud","Magnesium_hydroxide","Huntite","Hydromagnesite","Antacid","Peptic_ulcer","Heartburn","Dyspepsia","Magnesium_hydroxide","Magnesium_carbonate","Laxative","Phosphate","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Adjuvant","Vaccine","Anthrax_vaccine","Alum","Aluminium_potassium_sulfate","Adsorption","Antigen","Protein","Immune_system","Uric_acid","Monocytes","Dendritic_cells","Lymph_nodes","T_cells","B_cells","Th1/Th2_Model_for_helper_T_cells","Peptide","Neurological_disorder","Alzheimer's_disease","Epidemiology","Macrophagic_myofasciitis"]}
