{"cursor":"44645","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Sensitivity analysis' is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of a\nmathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned to\ndifferent sources of uncertainty in its inputs. Saltelli, A.,\nRatto, M., Andres, T., Campolongo, F., Cariboni, J., Gatelli, D. Saisana, M.,\nand Tarantola, S., 2008, Global Sensitivity Analysis. The Primer, John Wiley &\nSons. A related practice is uncertainty analysis, which has a greater\nfocus on uncertainty quantification and propagation of uncertainty. Ideally,\nuncertainty and sensitivity analysis should be run in tandem.\n\nSensitivity analysis can be useful for a range of purposes, Pannell, D.J. (1997). Sensitivity analysis of normative economic\nmodels: Theoretical framework and practical strategies, Agricultural Economics\n16: 139-152.[http://dpannell.fnas.uwa.edu.au/dpap971f.htm] including:\n* Testing the robustness of the results of a model or system in the presence of\n  uncertainty.\n* Increased understanding of the relationships between input and output\n  variables in a system or model.\n* Uncertainty reduction: identifying model inputs that cause significant\n  uncertainty in the output and should therefore be the focus of attention if\n  the robustness is to be increased (perhaps by further research).\n* Searching for errors in the model (by encountering unexpected relationships\n  between inputs and outputs).\n* Model simplification â fixing model inputs that have no effect on the output,\n  or identifying and removing redundant parts of the model structure.\n* Enhancing communication from modelers to decision makers (e.g. by making\n  recommendations more credible, understandable, compelling or persuasive).\n* Finding regions in the space of input factors for which the model output is\n  either maximum or minimum or meets some optimum criterion (see optimization\n  and Monte Carlo filtering).\n\nTaking an example from economics, in any budgeting process there are always\nvariables that are uncertain. Future tax rates, interest rates, inflation rates,\nheadcount, operating expenses and other variables may not be known with great\nprecision. Sensitivity analysis answers the question, \"if these variables\ndeviate from expectations, what will the effect be (on the business, model,\nsystem, or whatever is being analyzed), and which variables are causing it?\"\n","linknr":399,"url":"Sensitivity_analysis","recorded":1362482524,"links":25,"instances":["statistics","statistics","probability_theory","statistics"],"pdf":["http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/commission_guidelines/docs/iag_2009_en.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/CREM/library/cred_guidance_0309.pdf","http://www.iemss.org/iemss2006/papers/s7/268_Fasso_0.pdf","http://www.modeling.uga.edu/tauc/background_material/Washington-Main.pdf"],"categories":["Business terms","Scientific modeling","Process management","Sensitivity analysis|"],"headings":["Overview","Settings and Constraints","Core Methodology","Alternative Methods","Other Issues","Applications","Related concepts","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Sensitivity_scheme.jpg/500px-Sensitivity_scheme.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Scatter_plots_for_sensitivity_analysis_bis.jpg/500px-Scatter_plots_for_sensitivity_analysis_bis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/c/a0c7bd62f8d6fc6387893822472ba5d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/b/f9b362db4bf9d3320973d1b243190834.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampling","statistics"],["independence","probability_theory"],["interaction","statistics"],["interaction","statistics"],["cross-validation","statistics"]],"members":["interaction","independence","sampling"],"related":["Uncertainty","Mathematical_model","Uncertainty","Uncertainty_analysis","Uncertainty_quantification","Propagation_of_uncertainty","Robust_decision","Optimization","Mathematical_model","Equations","Climate_model","Economic_model","Finite_element_analysis","Black_box","Uncertainty_quantification","Measurement_uncertainty","Confidence","Stochastic","Quantification","Uncertainty_analysis","Impact_assessment","European_Commission","Impact_assessment","Office_of_Management_and_Budget","Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change","US_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Sampling_(statistics)","Dimension","Curse_of_dimensionality","Independence_(probability_theory)","Linear_regression","Nonlinear_system","Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis","Interaction_(statistics)","Additive_function","Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis","Univariate","Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis","Partial_derivatives","Elementary_effects_method","Design_of_experiments","OFAT","Partial_derivatives","Linear_regression","Interaction_(statistics)","Partial_derivative","Scatter_plots","Correlation_and_dependence","Nonlinear_regression","Regression_analysis","Linear_regression","Standardized_coefficient","Coefficient_of_determination","Probability_distribution","Monte_Carlo_integration","Elementary_effects_method","Computational_expense","Data-modelling","Machine_learning","Low-discrepancy_sequences","Sobol_sequence","Latin_hypercube_sampling","Gaussian_processes","Kriging","Multivariate_Gaussian_distribution","Heteroscedasticity","Random_forest","Decision_trees","Gradient_boosting","Polynomial_chaos","Orthogonal_polynomials","Smoothing_spline","Machine_learning","Nonlinear","Cross-validation_(statistics)","High-dimensional_model_representation","Fourier_series","Inference","Expert_elicitation","Global_climate_model","Weather_forecasts","Climate_change","Heteroskedastic","Correlation","Environmental_Performance_Index","Optimal_experimental_design","Engineering","Meta_analysis","Generalizability","Multi-criteria_decision_making","Decision_making","Uncertainty_analysis","Uncertainty","Design_of_experiments","Causality","Elementary_effects_method","Experimental_uncertainty_analysis","Fourier_amplitude_sensitivity_testing","Info-gap_decision_theory","Interval_FEM","Perturbation_analysis","Probabilistic_design","Probability_bounds_analysis","Robustification","ROC_curve","Uncertainty_analysis","Uncertainty_quantification","Variance-based_sensitivity_analysis","Vadim_Komkov"]}
