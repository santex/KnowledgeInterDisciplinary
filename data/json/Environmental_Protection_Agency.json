The EPA was proposed by\nPresident Richard Nixon and began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon\nsigned an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by\ncommittee hearings in the House and Senate. {{cite web |url=http://publicac-\ncess.supportportal.com/link/portal/23002/23012/Article/23723/When-and-how-was-\nthe-EPA-created |title=Public AccessWhen and how was the EPA Created?\n|publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=6 November 2011 }} The agency is led by\nits Administrator, who is appointed by the president and approved by Congress.\nThe current acting administrator is Bob Perciasepe. The EPA is not a Cabinet\ndepartment, but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank.\n\nThe EPA has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., regional offices for each of\nthe agency's ten regions, and 27 laboratories. The agency conducts environmental\nassessment, research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining\nand enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in\nconsultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some\npermitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to U.S. states and Native\nAmerican tribes. EPA enforcement powers include fines, sanctions, and other\nmeasures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in\na wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy\nconservation efforts.\n\nThe agency has approximately 17,000 full-time employees.
