It is literally the removal of water () from\nan object; however, in physiological terms, it entails a deficiency of fluid\nwithin an organism. Dehydration of skin and mucous membranes can be called\nmedical dryness.\n\nSome authors have reported three types of dehydration based on serum sodium\nlevels: hypotonic or hyponatremic (referring to this as primarily a loss of\nelectrolytes, sodium in particular), hypertonic or hypernatremic (referring to\nthis as primarily a loss of water), and isotonic or isonatremic (referring to\nthis as equal loss of water and electrolytes). In reality however, it\nemerges that by \"hyponatremic\" and \"eunatremic\" dehydration these authors are\nactually referring to \"hypovolemia\" (see definition below). In humans, it is\nthought that the most commonly seen type of dehydration by far is isotonic\n(isonatraemic) dehydration, but this effectively refers to hypovolemia.\n\"Dehydration\", is thus a term that has loosely been used to mean loss of water,\nregardless of whether it is as water and solutes (mainly sodium) or free water.\nThose who refer to hypotonic dehydration therefore refer to solute loss and thus\nloss of intravascular volume but in the presence of exaggerated intravascular\nvolume depletion for a given amount of total body water gain. It is true that\nneurological complications can occur in hypotonic and hypertonic states. The\nformer can lead to seizures, while the latter can lead to osmotic cerebral edema\nupon rapid rehydration. It is thus important to distinguish\n\"dehydration\" from \"hypovolemia\" and maybe limit the term \"dehydration\" to\nstates of \"hypernatremia\" and call all other usage \"hypovolemia\" as that would\ngreatly facilitate management.\n","linknr":614,"url":"Dehydration","recorded":1362373870,"links":54,"instances":["medicine","physiology","medical","injury","sports","circulatory","medical","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Causes of death","Electrolyte disturbances","Nutrition","Symptoms","Body water"],"headings":["Definition","Signs and symptoms","Differential diagnosis","Prevention","Treatment","See also","References","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Cholera_rehydration_nurses.jpg/230px-Cholera_rehydration_nurses.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dryness","medical"],["flushing","physiology"],["fatigue","medical"],["fatigue","medical"],["respiration","physiology"],["stress","medicine"],["shock","circulatory"],["burn","injury"],["water_stop","sports"]],"members":["stress","respiration","dryness","burn","water_stop","shock","fatigue","flushing"],"related":["Cholera","Body_water","Metabolism","Water","Physiology","Human_skin","Mucous_membranes","Dryness_(medical)","Electrolyte","Sodium","Hypovolemia","Seizure","Osmotic_cerebral_edema","Rehydration","Hypovolemia","Blood_plasma","Pure","Symptom","Headache","Hangover","Blood_pressure","Hypotension","Dizziness","Fainting","Orthostatic_hypotension","Delirium","Unconsciousness","Death","Thirst","Appetite","Dry_skin","Constipation","Sportsperson","Flushing_(physiology)","Heart_rate","Fatigue_(medical)","Symptom","Thirst","Urine","Headache","Dry_mouth","Dizziness","Orthostatic_hypotension","Hyperalbuminemia","USDA","Confusion","Fatigue_(medical)","Lethargy","Seizure","Fontanel","Fainting","Respiration_(physiology)","Blood_plasma","Blood_pressure","Nausea","Paresthesia","Thirst","Hyperthermia","Terminal_dehydration","Homeostasis","Stress_(medicine)","Sweating","Blood_loss","Hypotension","Physical_trauma","Diarrhea","Hyperthermia","Shock_(circulatory)","Vomiting","Burn_(injury)","Lacrimation","Methamphetamine","Amphetamine","Alcoholic_beverages","Infectious_diseases","Cholera","Gastroenteritis","Shigellosis","Yellow_fever","Malnutrition","Electrolyte_disturbance","Hypernatremia","Hyponatremia","Sodium_chloride","Dieting","Fasting","Weight_loss","Patient_refusal_of_nutrition_and_hydration","Hyperglycemia","Diabetes_mellitus","Glycosuria","Uremia","Diabetes_insipidus","Foodborne_illness","Drinking","Water","United_Kingdom","Litre","Water_vapor","Perspiration","Kidney","Urine","Diarrhea","Bowel","Hypertonicity","Hypotonicity","Hyponatremia","Hypernatremia","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Marathon","Water_stop_(sports)","Water_break","European_Food_Safety_Authority","Electrolyte","Oral_rehydration_therapy","Fluid_replacement","Intravenous_therapy","Isotonicity","Hypotonicity","Lysis","Erythrocytes","Fresh_water","Seawater","Alcohol","Urine","Fainting","Unconsciousness","Hydrational_fluid","Terminal_dehydration","Ira_Byock"]}
