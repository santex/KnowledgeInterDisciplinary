{"cursor":"31490","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'television network' is a telecommunications network for distribution of\ntelevision program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to\nmany television stations or pay TV providers. Until the mid-1980s, television\nprogramming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of\nbroadcast networks. Many early television networks (e.g., the BBC, NBC or CBC)\nevolved from earlier radio networks.\n\nIn countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated\ncontent to all their stations and where most individual TV transmitters\ntherefore operate only as large \"repeater stations\", the terms \"television\nnetwork\", \"television channel\" (a numeric identifier or radio frequency), and\n\"television station\" have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language,\nwith professionals in TV-related occupations continuing to make a difference\nbetween them. Within the industry, a tiering is sometimes created among groups\nof networks based on whether their programming is simultaneously originated from\na central point, and whether the network master control has the technical and\nadministrative capability to take-over the programming of their affiliates in\nreal-time when it deems this necessary â the most common example being national\nbreaking news events.\n\nIn North America in particular, many television networks available via cable and\nsatellite television are branded as \"channels\" because they are somewhat\ndifferent than traditional networks in the sense defined above, as they are\nsingular operations â they have no affiliates or component stations, but instead\nare distributed to the public via cable or direct-broadcast satellite companies.\nSuch networks are commonly referred to by terms such as \"specialty channels\" in\nCanada or \"cable networks\" in the U.S.\n\nA network may or may not produce all of its own programming. If not, production\nhouses such as Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures can distribute their content to\nthe different networks, and it is common that a certain production house may\nhave programs on two or more rival networks. Similarly, some networks may import\ntelevision programs from other countries, or use archival programming to help\ncomplement their schedules.\n\nSome stations have the capability to interrupt the network through the local\ninsertion of TV commercials, station IDs, and emergency alerts. Others\ncompletely break away from the network for their own programming, known as\nregional variation. This is common where small networks are members of\nlarger networks. The majority of commercial television stations are self-\nowned, even though a variety of these instances are the property of an Owned\nAnd Operated television network. The commercial television stations can also\nbe linked with a non-commercial educational broadcasting agency. It is also\nimportant to note that some countries have installed nationwide television\nnetworks, so that individual television stations can act as common repeaters\nof nationwide programs.\n\nOn the other hand, televisions networks also undergo the impending experience of\nmajor changes related to cultural varieties. The emergence of cable television\nnetwork has made available in major media markets on television, programs aimed\nat American bi-cultural Latinos. Such a diverse captive audience presents an\noccasion for the networks and affiliates to advertise the best programming that\nneeds to be aired.\n\nThis is explained by author Tim P. Vos in his abstract \"A Cultural Explanation\nof Early Broadcast\" where he determines Targeted group/non-targeted group\nrepresentations and also the cultural specificity employed in the television\nnetwork entity. He notes: Policymakers did not expressly intend to create a\nbroadcast order dominated by commercial networks. In fact, legislative attempts\nwere made to limit the network's preferred position.\n\nAs to individual stations, modern network operations centers usually use\nbroadcast automation to handle most tasks. These systems are not only used for\nBroadcast programming and for video server playout, but use exact atomic time\nfrom GPS or other sources to maintain perfect synchronization with upstream and\ndownstream systems, so that programming appears seamless to audience viewers.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Television_networks","recorded":1375087178,"links":[],"instances":["us","philippines","north_america","am","tv_channel","tv_network","tv_channel","broadcasting","tv_system","uk","united_states","tv_network","russia","united_states","russia","tv_network","russia","russia","1991","tv_channel","tv_channel","tv_channel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Television
