{"cursor":"8895","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues\n | unreferenced=July 2008 cleanup=June 2008\n}}\n\nIn real estate, a 'lot' or 'plot' is a tract or parcel of land owned or meant to\nbe owned by some owner(s). A lot is essentially considered a parcel of real\nproperty in some countries or immovable property (meaning practically the same\nthing) in other countries. Possible owner(s) of a lot can be one or more\nperson(s) or another legal entity, such as a company/corporation, organization,\ngovernment, or trust. A common form of ownership of a lot is called fee simple\nin some countries.\n\nA lot may also be defined as a small area of land that is empty except for\npavement or similar improvement. An example would be a parking lot. This article\ncovers lots as parcels of land meant to be owned as units by an owner(s).\n\nLike most other types of real estate, lots owned by private parties are subject\nto a periodic real estate tax payable by the owners to local governments such as\na county or municipality. These real estate taxes are based on the assessed\nvalue of the real property; additional taxes usually apply to transfer of\nownership and property sales. Other fees by government are possible for\nimprovements such as curbs and sidewalks or an impact fee for building a house\non a vacant lot.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Land_lot","recorded":1362689262,"links":29,"instances":["law","land","land_use","house"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Real estate terminology","Urban studies and planning terminology","Surveying"],"headings":["Definition and Boundaries","Development and use","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Lot_map.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["garage","house"],["setback","land_use"],["covenant","law"],["subdivision","land"]],"members":["covenant","subdivision","setback","garage"],"related":["Real_estate","Owner","Real_property","Immovable_property","Person","Corporation","Organization","Government","Trust_company","Fee_simple","Parking_lot","Real_estate_tax","Municipality","Impact_fee","Map","Area","Surface_area","House","Land_description","Public_Land_Survey_System","Polygon","Line_segment","Surveying","Surveying","Structural_encroachment","Alley","Garage_(house)","Waste_collection","Lawn","Zoning","Setback_(land_use)","Building_code","Water_well","Septic_system","Sanitary_sewer","Covenant_(law)","Real_estate_developer","Easement","Utility","Electric_power","Telephone","Building","Driveway","Sidewalk","Water_well","Septic_system","Condominium","Subdivision_(land)","Street","Alley","Map","County","Recorder_of_deeds","City_block","Land_patent","Conveyancing","Deed","Land_description","Sidewalk","Road_verge","Carriageway","Road","City_planning","Site_plan","Zoning"]}
