{"cursor":"3073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'constant function' is a function whose values do not vary and\nthus are constant. For example the function f(x) = 4 is constant since f maps\nany value to 4. More formally, a function f : A â B is a constant\nfunction if f(x) = f(y) for all x and y in A.\n\nEvery empty function is constant, vacuously, since there are no x and y in A for\nwhich f(x) and f(y) are different when A is the empty set.\n\nIn the context of polynomial functions, a non-zero constant function is called a\npolynomial of degree zero.\n\nA function is said to be 'identically zero{{Anchor|identically zero}}' if it takes the value 0 for every argument; it is then trivially\na constant function.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Constant_function","recorded":1362667361,"links":33,"instances":["mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematics","order","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings","Elementary mathematics","Types of functions"],"headings":["Properties","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["constant","mathematics"],["variable","mathematics"],["interval","mathematics"],["domain","mathematics"],["lattice","order"],["domain","mathematics"],["continuous_function","topology"]],"members":["domain","continuous_function","variable","function","lattice","constant","interval"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Constant_(mathematics)","Empty_function","Vacuous_truth","Polynomial","Function_composition","Function_composition","Constant_morphism","Category_theory","Derivative","Real_number","Variable_(mathematics)","Interval_(mathematics)","If_and_only_if","Derivative","Preorder","Order-preserving","Order-reversing","Domain_(mathematics)","Lattice_(order)","Domain_(mathematics)","Codomain","Idempotent","Topological_space","Continuous_function_(topology)","Connected_set","Locally_constant"]}
