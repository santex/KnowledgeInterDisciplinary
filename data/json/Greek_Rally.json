The party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative\nright in Greek society and was modeled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement\ndu Peuple FranÃ§ais (RPF). The creation of the party reflected the\ninterests of the United States, who believed it would help clean up the image\nof the Greek right and make it attractive to centrist voters. Throughout the\nyears, the Greek right, represented by the People's Party, had become\nsplintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the\nPopulist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos\nStephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and\nmerged with the Greek Rally. The popularity of Papagos, who had reinstated the\nautonomy of the Greek military during his tenure as its commander, enabled the\nparty to quickly eclipse the Populists. In the September 1951 general election,\nthe Greek Rally garnered 114 parliamentary seats (taking 36.5 per cent of the\nvote) compared to the People's Party two seats. In the subsequent November 1952\ngeneral election, the Greek Rally gained 240 out of 300 seats in the Greek\nParliament, an achievement helped in no small way by a change in the electoral\nsystem. The party effectively ended with the death of its leader in October\n1955. His successor, Konstantinos Karamanlis, relaunched the party as the\nNational Radical Union.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Greek_Rally","recorded":1375082481,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Alexandros_Papagos","/wiki/National_Radical_Union","/wiki/List_of_political_ideologies","/wiki/National_conservatism","/wiki/Royalist","/wiki/Anti-communism","/wiki/Political_spectrum","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/Politics_of_Greece","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Elections_in_Greece","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Right-wing_politics","/wiki/Alexandros_Papagos","/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle","/wiki/Rassemblement_du_Peuple_Fran%C3%A7ais","#cite_note-1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/w/index.php?title=Populist_Uniting_Party&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Panagiotis_Kanellopoulos","/wiki/Stephanos_Stephanopoulos","/wiki/New_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Spiros_Markezinis","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1951","/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Greece)","/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_1952","/wiki/Greek_Parliament","/wiki/Konstantinos_Karamanlis","/wiki/National_Radical_Union","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/History_of_Greece","/wiki/Politics_of_Greece","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Greece","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&oldid=544451179","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Political_parties_established_in_1951","/wiki/Category:Conservative_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:Defunct_political_parties_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:1951_establishments_in_Greece","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Greek-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Greek+Rally&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Greek+Rally","/wiki/Greek_Rally","/wiki/Talk:Greek_Rally","#","/wiki/Greek_Rally","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Greek_Rally","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Greek_Rally","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&oldid=544451179","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3563354","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Greek_Rally&id=544451179","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Greek+Rally","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Greek+Rally&oldid=544451179&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Greek_Rally&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagrupament_Grec","//el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%95%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82_%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3563354#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wik
