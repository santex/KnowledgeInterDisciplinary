It is a form of hyperventilation, which is any breathing\npattern that reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased rate or depth\nof respiration.\n\nIn metabolic acidosis, breathing is first rapid and shallow  but as\nacidosis worsens, breathing gradually becomes deep, labored and gasping. It is\nthis latter type of breathing pattern that is referred to as Kussmaul breathing.\n","linknr":208,"url":"Kussmaul_breathing","recorded":1362482078,"links":27,"instances":["physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Endocrinology","Abnormal respiration"],"headings":["Terminology","History","Mechanism","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Breathing_abnormalities.svg/220px-Breathing_abnormalities.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"],["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration"],"related":["Labored_breathing","Acidosis","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Hyperventilation","Metabolic_acidosis","Adolph_Kussmaul","Adolph_Kussmaul","German_people","Physician","Diabetes_mellitus","Kussmaul's_sign","Respiration_(physiology)","Metabolic_acidosis","Diabetic","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Carbon_dioxide","Bicarbonate","Respiration_(physiology)","Carbon_dioxide","Urge_to_breathe","Hepatomegaly","Differential_diagnosis","Hyperglycemia"]}
