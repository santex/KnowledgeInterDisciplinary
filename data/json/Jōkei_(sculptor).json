{"cursor":"3044","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" was a Japanese sculptor of the Kei school, which flourished in the Kamakura\n period. Aside from his artwork, JÅkei left little record of his life, so\n sorting out the details of his biography is difficult. The fact that two men by\n that name were working in Nara in the 13th century only complicates\n matters. Mason 192.\n\nJÅkei probably began his career as a disciple of KÅkei, the organizer of the Kei\nschool of sculpture, or of Unkei. In fact, JÅkei may even have been KÅkei's\nson, though others call him the son of Unkei. Paine\n110. Noma 272. In this capacity, he sculpted\nworks for the reconstruction of the temples KÅfuku-ji and TÅdai-ji in Nara.\n\nJÅkei followed the lead of Unkei and others in the Kei school in his pursuit of\nrealism. An early example of this is his Guardian King (NiÅ), carved sometime in\nthe 1190s. The figure stands beside another by Unkei at\nthe main gateway in front of the KÅfuku-ji. JÅkei's NiÅ is nude to the waist,\nexposing a tense musculature. The veins in the neck and head are engorged, only\nheightening the figure's expression of rage. The pose is action-ortiented, as if\nthe king is in the midst of a fight. Noma 103.\n\nThe figures of Yuima (Sanskrit: Vimalakirti) and Monju (Sanskrit: Manjushri)\nin the East [[kÅndÅ]] of KÅfuku-ji also show JÅkei's interpretation of the Kei\naesthetic. The debate between these two men had been the subject of earlier\nJapanese sculpture, but JÅkei's depiction is different and subject to\ninterpretation. Some see his Yuima as strong and healthy, while others view the figure as aged and ill in keeping with his\ndescription in the [[Vimalikirtinirdesha Sutra]]. Noma 85. The work\nalso indicates that JÅkei was familiar with the Buddhist sculpture of Song\nChina. His Yuima sits on a pedestal, which is decorated\nwith an elaborately carved lion. The sculpture's high wooden backing, carved\nto look as if it is covered in cloth, is another Chinese element. Mason 193. An inscription inside the chest portion of\nthe work says that JÅkei worked on it in 1196 for 53 days. It lists KÅen,\npossibly his son, Paine 113. as the artist who did the\ncoloration.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Jōkei_(sculptor)","recorded":1375074399,"links":["/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Japan","/wiki/Sculpture","/wiki/Kei_school","/wiki/Kamakura_period","/wiki/Nara,_Nara","#cite_note-Mason_192-1","/wiki/K%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","/wiki/Unkei","#cite_note-Mason_192-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-Noma_272-3","/wiki/K%C5%8Dfuku-ji","/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji","/wiki/Realism_(arts)","/wiki/Ni%C5%8D","#cite_note-Noma_272-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Yuima","/wiki/Sanskrit","/wiki/Vimalakirti","/wiki/Manjusri","/w/index.php?title=K%C5%8Dnd%C5%8D&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-Mason_192-1","/w/index.php?title=Vimalikirtinirdesha_Sutra&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Buddhist_art#China","/wiki/Song_Dynasty","/wiki/China","#cite_note-Mason_192-1","#cite_note-Mason_193-6","/w/index.php?title=K%C5%8Den&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-Mason_193-6","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Mason_192_1-0","#cite_ref-Mason_192_1-1","#cite_ref-Mason_192_1-2","#cite_ref-Mason_192_1-3","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-Noma_272_3-0","#cite_ref-Noma_272_3-1","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-Mason_193_6-0","#cite_ref-Mason_193_6-1","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=edit&section=2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jōkei_(sculptor)&oldid=544289396","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Japanese_Buddhists","/wiki/Category:Japanese_sculptors","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Japanese-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=J%C5%8Dkei+%28sculptor%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=J%C5%8Dkei+%28sculptor%29","/wiki/J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","/wiki/Talk:J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","#","/wiki/J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&oldid=544289396","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3191234","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=J%C5%8Dkei_%28sculptor%29&id=544289396","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=J%C5%8Dkei+%28sculptor%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=J%C5%8Dkei+%28sculptor%29&oldid=544289396&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dkei","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%9A%E6%85%B6","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3191234#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dkei_(sculptor)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/l
