When used in reference\nto a taxon, the word does not apply to an individual plant but to all those\nplants sharing the unique characteristics that define the cultivar. is a\nplant or grouping of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be\nmaintained by propagation. Most cultivars have arisen in cultivation but a few\nare special selections from the wild. Popular ornamental garden plants like\nroses, camellias, daffodils, rhododendrons, and azaleas are cultivars produced\nby careful breeding and selection for flower colour and form. Similarly, the\nworld's agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been\nselected for characteristics such as improved yield, flavour, and resistance to\ndisease: very few wild plants are now used as food sources. Trees used in\nforestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield\nof timber.\n\nCultivars form a major part of Liberty Hyde Bailey's broader grouping, the\ncultigen, defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily\ndue to intentional human activity. Cultivar was coined by Liberty\nHyde Bailey and it is generally regarded as a portmanteau of \"'culti'vated\" and\n\"'var'iety\", but could also be derived from \"'culti'gen\" and \"'var'iety\". A\ncultivar is not the same as a botanical variety, and there are\ndifferences in the rules for the formation and use of the names of botanical\nvarieties and cultivars. In recent times the naming of cultivars has been\ncomplicated by the use of statutory Plant Patents and Plant Breeders' Rights na-\nmes. [http://www.hort.purdue.edu/hort/courses/HORT217/Nomenclature/descript-\nion.htm See]\n\nThe International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV â\nFrench: Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions vÃ©gÃ©tales) offers\nlegal protection of plant cultivars to people or organisations who introduce new\ncultivars to commerce. UPOV requires that a cultivar be distinct, uniform and\nstable. To be distinct, it must have characteristics that easily distinguish it\nfrom any other known cultivar. To be uniform and stable, the cultivar must\nretain these characteristics under repeated propagation.\n\nThe naming of cultivars is an important aspect of cultivated plant taxonomy, and\nthe correct naming of a cultivar is prescribed by the Rules and Recommendations\nof the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (the ICNCP,\ncommonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code). A cultivar is given a cultivar\nname, which consists of the scientific Latin botanical name followed by a\ncultivar epithet. The cultivar epithet is usually in a vernacular language. For\nexample, the full cultivar name of the King Edward potato is Solanum tuberosum\n'King Edward'. The 'King Edward' part of the name is the cultivar epithet which,\naccording to the Rules of the Cultivated Plant Code, is bounded by single\nquotation marks.
