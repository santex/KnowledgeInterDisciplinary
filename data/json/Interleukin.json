{"cursor":"36401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Interleukins' are a group of cytokines (secreted proteins/signaling molecules)\nthat were first seen to be expressed by white blood cells\n(leukocytes). The term interleukin derives from (inter-) \"as a means\nof communication\", and (-leukin) \"deriving from the fact that many of these\nproteins are produced by leukocytes and act on leukocytes\". The name is\nsomething of a relic, though (the term was coined by Dr. Vern Paetkau,\nUniversity of Victoria); it has since been found that interleukins are produced\nby a wide variety of body cells. The function of the immune system depends in a\nlarge part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been\ndescribed, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. The majority\nof interleukins are synthesized by helper CD4 T lymphocytes, as well as through\nmonocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and\ndifferentiation of T, B, and hematopoietic cells.\n\nInterleukin receptors on astrocytes in the hippocampus are also known to be\ninvolved in the development of spatial memories in mice.\n","linknr":1058,"url":"Interleukin","recorded":1362504335,"links":36,"instances":["cellular"],"pdf":["http://www.ebioscience.com/ebioscience/whatsnew/pdf/Cytokines.pdf","http://www.ebioscience.com/ebioscience/whatsnew/pdf/Cytokines.pdf"],"categories":["Cytokines"],"headings":["Common
