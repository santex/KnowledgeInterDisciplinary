Turn offered a more pop/singer songwriter direction for Meath based\nband. Their first album, [[Antisocial (album)|Antisocial]], had shown a strong\nPixies style influence, their second album, [[Forward (Turn album)|Forward]],\noffered an even darker side to the bands sound, but with Turn they showed they\nweren't getting any darker. The album was a mixture of catchy pop tunes such as\n\"It's About Nothing\" and \"Stop\", and also more Elliot Smith inspired tunes, such\nas \"Close Your Eyes\" and \"Wildside\".\n\nOpinions were very mixed about the album among fans and critics. Some called it\na mile stone in musical growth for the band, others claimed it was a last-ditch\neffort by the band to become more commercial and popular on the Irish airwaves.\nHowever, the strength of the songs proved themselves and became live favourites\ninstantly on the tours that followed.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Turn_LP","recorded":1362892611,"links":12,"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2005 albums","Turn albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Line-up","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turn","band"]],"members":["turn"],"related":["Setanta_Records","Turn_(band)","Pixies","Elliot_Smith","Ollie_Cole","Ollie_Cole","Ian_Melady","Ciran_kavanagh"]}
