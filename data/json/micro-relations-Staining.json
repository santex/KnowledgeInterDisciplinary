{"cursor":"26601","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n and coverslip, mounted on the stage of a light microscope.]]\n\n'Staining' is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance contrast in\nthe microscopic image. Stains and dyes are frequently used in biology and\nmedicine to highlight structures in biological tissues for viewing, often with\nthe aid of different microscopes. Stains may be used to define and examine bulk\ntissues (highlighting, for example, muscle fibers or connective tissue), cell\npopulations (classifying different blood cells, for instance), or organelles\nwithin individual cells.\n\nIn biochemistry it involves adding a class-specific (DNA, proteins, lipids,\ncarbohydrates) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a\nspecific compound. Staining and fluorescent tagging can serve similar purposes.\nBiological staining is also used to mark cells in flow cytometry, and to flag\nproteins or nucleic acids in gel electrophoresis.\n\nStaining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study\nthe morphology of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-\ncrystalline polymers or the domain structures of block copolymers.\n","linknr":534,"url":"Staining","recorded":1362500238,"links":30,"instances":["chemistry","histology","histology","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dyes|dyes","Pigments|pigments","Staining|","Staining
