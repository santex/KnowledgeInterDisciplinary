The purpose of administering MTD is to\ndetermine whether long-term exposure to a chemical might lead to unacceptable\nadverse health effects in a population, when the level of exposure is not\nsufficient to cause premature mortality due to short-term toxic effects. The\nmaximum dose is used, rather than a lower dose, to reduce the number of test\nsubjects (and, among other things, the cost of testing), in order to detect an\neffect that might occur only rarely. This type of analysis is also used in\nestablishing chemical residue tolerances in foods. Maximum tolerated dose\nstudies are also done in clinical trials.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Maximum_tolerated_dose","recorded":1362676196,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf"],"categories":["Toxicology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/MUTCD_W14-1.svg/40px-MUTCD_W14-1.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Hazard_T.svg/30px-Hazard_T.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":[]}
