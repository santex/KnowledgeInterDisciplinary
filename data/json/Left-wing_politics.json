It usually\ninvolves a concern for those in society who are disadvantaged relative to others\nand an assumption that there are unjustified inequalities (which right-wing\npolitics views as natural or traditional) that need to be reduced or\nabolished.

Bellamy (eds.), [http://books.google.com/books?id=N1h4_NqTOFoC&p-\nrintsec=frontcover&dq=The+Cambridge+History+of+Twentieth-\nCentury+Political+Thought&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=Hm1YTuKCIsjd0QH7iOCkDA&sa=X&oi=book-\n_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false The Cambridge\nHistory of Twentieth-Century Political Thought].\n\nThe political terms Left and Right were coined during the French Revolution\n(1789â1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the Estates General: those\nwho sat on the left generally opposed the monarchy and supported the revolution,\nincluding the creation of a republic and secularization,\nwhile those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the\nOld Regime. Use of the term \"Left\" became more prominent after the restoration\nof the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the\n\"Independents\". Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions (1996), ed. Pierre\nNora, \"Right and Left\" by Marcel Gauchet, p. 248\n\nThe term was later applied to a number of movements, especially republicanism\nduring the French Revolution, socialism, communism, and\nanarchism. Beginning in the last half of the Twentieth Century, the\nphrase left-wing has been used to describe an ever widening family of\nmovements, including the civil rights movement, anti-war movements,\nand environmental movements, , and finally being extended\nto entire parties, including the Democratic Party in the United States and the\nLabour Party in the United Kingdom. http://www.econ.ohio-\nstate.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf In two party systems,\nthe terms \"left\" and \"right\" are now sometimes used as labels for the two\nparties, with one party designated as the \"left\" and the other \"right\", even\nwhen neither party is \"left-wing\" in the original sense of being opposed to the\nruling class.\n","linknr":878,"url":"Left-wing_politics","recorded":1362574380,"links":71,"instances":["france","united_states","centrism","journal","classification_of_human_beings","economics","priest","politics","socialism","france","united_states"],"pdf":["http://as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/244/cup.pdf","http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf","http://www.jasonwmoore.com/uploads/Moore__Capitalism_as_World-Ecology__Braudel_and_Marx_on_Environmental_History__O_E__2003_.pdf","http://www.jasonwmoore.com/uploads/Moore__Capitalism_as_World-Ecology__Braudel_and_Marx_on_Environmental_History__O_E__2003_.pdf","http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf"],"categories":["Left-wing
