A joint stock company divides its capital into\nshares, which are offered for sale to raise capital, termed as issuing shares.\nThus, a share is an indivisible unit of capital, expressing the proprietary\nrelationship between the company and the shareholder. The denominated value of a\nshare is its face value: the total capital of a company is divided into a number\nof shares.\n\nIn financial markets, a share is a unit of account for various financial\ninstruments including stocks (ordinary or preferential), and investments in\nlimited partnerships, and real estate investment trusts. The common feature of\nall these is equity participation (limited in the case of preference shares).\n\nThe income received from shares is known as a dividend. A shareholder, also\nknown as a stockholder, is a person who owns shares of a certain company or\norganization, and is thus a part-owner of the company. The process of\npurchasing and selling shares often involves going through a stockbroker as a\nmiddle man.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Share_(finance)","recorded":1362673553,"links":82,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":["http://www.nos.org/srsec320newE/320EL22.pdf","http://www.nos.org/srsec320newE/320EL22.pdf"],"categories":["Equity securities","Stock market"],"headings":["Valuation","Tax treatment","Stock certificates","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Vereinigte_Ostindische_Compagnie_bond.jpg/140px-Vereinigte_Ostindische_Compagnie_bond.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capital","economics"]],"members":["capital"],"related":["Corporation","Mutual_fund","Organization","Joint_stock_company","Capital_(economics)","Finance","Unit_of_account","Stock","Limited_partnership","Real_estate_investment_trust","Dividend","Shareholder","Stockbroker","Middle_man","Market","Liquidity","India","Tax","Dividend","Dividend_stripping","Stock_certificate","CREST","Mutual_organization","Stock"]}
