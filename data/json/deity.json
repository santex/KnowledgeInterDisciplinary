Scott Littleton's Gods, Goddesses, and Mythology defined a deity as \"a being\n   with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with\n   humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of\n   consciousness beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary\n   life.\"<ref></ref>\n\nDeities are depicted in a variety of forms, but are also frequently expressed as\nhaving human form. Some faiths and traditions consider it blasphemous to imagine\nor depict the deity as having any concrete form. Deities are often thought to be\nimmortal, and are commonly assumed to have personalities and to possess\nconsciousness, intellects, desires, and emotions comparable but usually superior\nto those of humans. A male deity is a god, while a female deity is a goddess.\n\nHistorically, natural phenomena whose causes were not well understood, such as\nlightning and catastrophes such as earthquakes and floods, were attributed to\nthem. They were thought to be able to work supernatural miracles and to be the\nauthorities and controllers of various aspects of human life (such as birth or\nan afterlife). Some deities were asserted to be the directors of time and fate\nitself, to be the givers of human law and morality, to be the ultimate judges of\nhuman worth and behavior, and that the universe is designed by them, instead of\nbeing a natural result of the laws of physics.\n",
