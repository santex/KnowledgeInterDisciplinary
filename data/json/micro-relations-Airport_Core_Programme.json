{"cursor":"9227","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'The Hong Kong Airport Core Programme' () was a series of infrastructure\nprojects centred around the new Hong Kong International Airport during the early\n1990s. The programme was part of the Port and Airport Development Strategy,\ncommonly known as the Rose Garden Project.\n\nThe cost for the whole project was estimated at over HK$200 billion, and\nthe Chinese Government was concerned about its impact on the financial reserve\nof the future Hong Kong SAR Government. Several changes were made to the plan,\nincluding the shortening of the Tsing Ma Bridge and the constructing of the\nAirport Railway as a double-track railway. The project ended up costing\nHK$160.2 billion (160,200,000,000).\n\nThe Programme formally commenced after the signing of a memorandum of\nunderstanding between British Prime Minister John Major and Chinese Premier Li\nPeng in Beijing on 3 September 1991, and lasted 8 years in total. It was the\nmost expensive airport project in the world according to the Guinness World\nRecords. It was the biggest infrastructure programme in Hong Kong's history.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Airport_Core_Programme","recorded":1362540503,"links":18,"instances":["hong_kong","mtr","hong_kong"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transport in Hong Kong","History of Hong Kong","Hong Kong International Airport"],"headings":["History","The Ten Core Projects","Exhibition Centre","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Tsing_Ma_Bridge.jpg/250px-Tsing_Ma_Bridge.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/22px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Hong_Kong_bauhinia.svg/60px-Hong_Kong_bauhinia.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["airport_express","mtr"],["route_3","hong_kong"],["route_3","hong_kong"],["route_3","hong_kong"],["central","hong_kong"]],"members":["route_3","airport_express","central"],"related":["Infrastructure","Hong_Kong_International_Airport","Port_and_Airport_Development_Strategy","HKD","Government_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","Government_of_the_Hong_Kong_Special_Administrative_Region","Tsing_Ma_Bridge","HKD","Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","John_Major","Premier_of_the_State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","Li_Peng","Guinness_World_Records","Kai_Tak_Airport","Hong_Kong_Government","Economy_of_Hong_Kong","Chek_Lap_Kok","Lantau_Island","Tung_Chung","Sino-British_Joint_Declaration","Governor_of_Hong_Kong","David_Wilson,_Baron_Wilson_of_Tillyorn","Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989","Hong_Kong_International_Airport","Chek_Lap_Kok","Chris_Patten","Transfer_of_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong","Kowloon_Peninsula","Hong_Kong_Island","North_Lantau_New_Town","MTR_Corporation","Airport_Express_(MTR)","Tung_Chung_Line","Commuter_railway","Tsuen_Wan_Line","MTR","Kap_Shui_Mun_Bridge","Tsing_Ma_Bridge","Lantau","Tsing_Yi","Ma_Wan","Victoria_Harbour","Build-operate-transfer","Western_Harbour_Tunnel_Company","Cross_Harbour_Tunnel","Route_3_(Hong_Kong)","Speed_limit","Tung_Chung","Lantau_Link","Lantau","Route_3_(Hong_Kong)","Hong_Kong_Strategic_Route_and_Exit_Number_System","Sai_Ying_Pun","Yuen_Long","New_Territories","Lantau_Link","West_Kowloon_Highway","West_Kowloon_Expressway","Lai_Chi_Kok","Kwai_Tsing_Container_Terminals","Cheung_Tsing_Bridge","Tsing_Kwai_Highway","Cheung_Tsing_Bridge","Rambler_Channel","Cheung_Tsing_Tunnel","Cheung_Tsing_Highway","Kowloon","Western_Harbour_Crossing","Tsing_Kwai_Highway","Kowloon_Peninsula","Route_3_(Hong_Kong)","Central_(Hong_Kong)","Hong_Kong_Station","Outlying_Islands_Ferry_Pier","Lantau","Tung_Chung","Airport","Tung_Chung","Tung_Chung","Tai_Ho,_Hong_Kong","Airport_Core_Programme_Exhibition_Centre","Ting_Kau","Sham_Tseng"]}
