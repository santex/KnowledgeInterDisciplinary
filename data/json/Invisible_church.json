{"cursor":"6684","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'invisible church' or 'church invisible' is a theological concept of an\n\"invisible\" body of the elect who are known only to God, in contrast to the\n\"visible church\"âthat is, the institutional body on earth which preaches the\ngospel and administers the sacraments. Every member of the invisible church is\nsaved, while the visible church contains some individuals who are saved and\nothers who are unsaved. According to this view, Bible passages such as , , and\nspeak about this distinction.\n\nThis concept has been attributed to St Augustine of Hippo as part of his\nrefutation of the Donatist sect. {{cite book |author=Justo L. Gonzalez\n|title=A History of Christian Thought: Volume 2 (From Augustine to the eve of\nthe Reformation) |publisher=Abingdon Press |date=1970-1975}} He was\nstrongly influenced by the Platonist belief that true reality is invisible and\nthat, if the visible reflects the invisible, it does so only partially and\nimperfectly (see Theory of\nForms). [http://books.google.com/books?id=JeXFXXHBgnoC Wallace M. Alston,\nThe Church of the Living God: A Reformed Perspective] (Westminster John Knox\nPress, 2002 ISBN 0-664-22553-5, ISBN 978-0-664-22553-7), p. 53] Others\nquestion whether Augustine really held to some form of an \"invisible true\nChurch\" concept. [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/non-orthodox_ch7.pdf\nPatrick Barnes, The Non-Orthodox: The Orthodox Teaching on Christians Outside of\nthe Church]\n\nThe concept was insisted upon during the Protestant reformation as a way of\ndistinguishing between the \"visible\" Roman Catholic Church, which according to\nthe Reformers was corrupt, and those within it who truly believe, as well as\ntrue believers within their own denominations. John Calvin described the church\ninvisible as \"that which is actually in God's presence, into which no persons\nare received but those who are children of God by grace of adoption and true\nmembers of Christ by sanctification of the Holy Spirit... [it] includes not only\nthe saints presently living on earth, but all the elect from the beginning of\nthe world.\" He continues in contrasting this church with the church scattered\nthroughout the world. \"In this church there is a very large mixture of\nhypocrites, who have nothing of Christ but the name and outward appearance...\"\n(Institutes 4.1.7)\n\nPietism later took this a step further, with its formulation of ecclesiolae in\necclesia (\"little churches within the church\").\n\nRoman Catholic theology, reacting against the Protestant concept of an invisible\nChurch, emphasized the visible aspect of the Church founded by Christ, but in\nthe twentieth century placed more stress on the interior life of the Church as a\nsupernatural organism, identifying the Church, as in the encyclical Mystici\nCorporis Christi [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/do-\ncuments/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html Mystici Corporis\nChristi] of Pope Pius XII, with the Mystical Body of Christ. [http://-\nwww.therealpresence.org/archives/Church_Dogma/Church_Dogma_027.htm John Hardon,\nDefinition of the Catholic Church] In Catholic doctrine, the one true\nChurch is the visible society founded by Christ, namely, the Catholic Church\nunder the global jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome.\n\nThis encyclical rejected two extreme views of the Church: Heribert MÃ¼hlen,\nUna Mystica Persona, MÃ¼nchen, 1967, p. 51\n* (1) A rationalistic or purely sociological understanding of the Church,\n  according to which it is merely a human organization with structures and\n  activities, is mistaken. The visible Church and its structures do exist but\n  the Church is more, as it is guided by the Holy Spirit: Although\n  the juridical principles, on which the Church rests and is established, derive\n  from the divine constitution given to it by Christ and contribute to the\n  attaining of its supernatural end, nevertheless that which lifts the Society\n  of Christians far above the whole natural order is the Spirit of our Redeemer\n  who penetrates and fills every part of the Church. Pius XII, Mystici\n  Corporis Christi, 63\n* (2) An exclusively mystical understanding of the Church is mistaken as well,\n  because a mystical \"Christ in us\" union would deify its members and mean that\n  the acts of Christians are simultaneously the acts of Christ. The theological\n  concept una mystica persona (one mystical person) refers not to an individual\n  relation but to the unity of Christ with the Church and the unity of its\n  members with him in her. S Tromp, Caput influit sensum et motum,\n  Gregorianum, 1958, pp. 353-366\n\nEastern Orthodox theologian Vladimir Lossky too characterizes as a \"Nestorian\necclesiology\" that which would \"divide the Church into distinct beings: on the\none hand a heavenly and invisible Church, alone true and absolute; on the other,\nthe earthly Church (or rather 'the churches'), imperfect and relative\".
