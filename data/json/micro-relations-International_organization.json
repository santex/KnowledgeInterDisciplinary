There are two main types: The Penguin\nDictionary of International Relations divides modern international organizations\ninto two \"basic types, the 'public' variety known as intergovernmental\norganizations (IGOs) and the 'private' variety, the international non-\ngovernmental organization (INGOs).\" (Evans, Graham, and Richard Newnham.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=hUACAAAACAAJ Penguin Dictionary of\nInternational Relations]. Penguin, 1998, p. 270.)\n\n*International nongovernmental organizations (INGOs): non-governmental\norganizations (NGOs) that operate internationally. There are two types:\n**International non-profit organizations. Examples include the World\nOrganization of the Scout Movement, International Committee of the Red Cross and\nMÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. **International corporations, referred to as\nmultinational corporations. Examples include The Coca-Cola Company and Toyota.\n\n*Intergovernmental organizations, also known as international governmental\norganizations (IGOs): the type of organization most closely associated with the\nterm 'international organization', these are organizations that are made up\nprimarily of sovereign states (referred to as member states). Notable examples\ninclude the United Nations (UN), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),\nCouncil of Europe (CoE), European Union (EU; which is a prime example of a\nsupranational organization), and World Trade Organization (WTO). The UN has used\nthe term \"intergovernmental organization\" instead of \"international\norganization\" for clarity. \"[http://www.un.org/members/intergovorg.shtml\nIntergovernmental organizations having received a standing invitation to\nparticipate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly\nand maintaining permanent offices at Headquarters].\" United Nations Department\nof Public Information, United Nations Secretariat.\n","linknr":155,"url":"International_organization","recorded":1362585323,"links":59,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["International organizations","Sociocultural globalization"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Ruzgar-deneme-y%C3%B6netici4.png/40px-Ruzgar-deneme-y%C3%B6netici4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organization","International_nongovernmental_organization","Non-governmental_organization","Non-profit_organization","World_Organization_of_the_Scout_Movement","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","Médecins_Sans_Frontières","Corporation","Multinational_corporation","The_Coca-Cola_Company","Toyota","Intergovernmental_organization","Sovereign_state","Member_state","United_Nations","Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development","Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe","Council_of_Europe","European_Union","Supranational_union","World_Trade_Organization","United_Nations_Secretariat","Regional_integration","List_of_intergovernmental_organizations"]}
