An import in the receiving country is an export to the\nsending country.\n\nImports, along with exports, form the basics of international trade. Import of\ngoods normally requires involvement of the customs authorities in both the\ncountry of import and the country of export and are often subject to import\nquotas, tariffs and trade agreements. When the \"imports\" are the set of goods\nand services imported, \"Imports\" also means the economic value of all goods and\nservices that are imported. The macroeconomic variable I usually stands for the\nvalue of these imports over a given period of time, usually one year.\n",
