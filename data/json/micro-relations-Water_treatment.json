{"cursor":"11137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] 'Water treatment' describes those industrial-scale processes used to make\nwater more acceptable for a desired end-use. These can include use for\ndrinking water, industry, medical and many other uses. Such processes may be\ncontrasted with small-scale water sterilization practiced by campers and other\npeople in wilderness areas. The goal of all water treatment process is to\nremove existing contaminants in the water, or reduce the concentration of such\ncontaminants so the water becomes fit for its desired end-use. One such use is\nreturning water that has been used back into the natural environment without\nadverse ecological impact.\n\nThe processes involved in treating water for drinking purpose may be solids\nseparation using physical processes such as settling and filtration, and\nchemical processes such as disinfection and coagulation.\n\nBiological processes are employed in the treatment of wastewater and these\nprocesses may include, for example, aerated lagoons, activated sludge or slow\nsand filters.\n","linknr":220,"url":"Water_treatment","recorded":1362372032,"links":32,"instances":["water_treatment"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/primer.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/fact_sheets/WW4.pdf"],"categories":["Waste treatment technology|","Water pollution","Water treatment|"],"headings":["Potable water purification","Sewage treatment","In developing countries","Industrial water treatment","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Bragan%C3%A7a43.jpg/300px-Bragan%C3%A7a43.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Water_plant.jpg/220px-Water_plant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Pr%C3%A1zdn%C3%A1_aera%C4%8Dn%C3%AD_m%C3%ADstnost%2C_%C3%9AV_K%C3%A1ran%C3%BD.jpg/220px-Pr%C3%A1zdn%C3%A1_aera%C4%8Dn%C3%AD_m%C3%ADstnost%2C_%C3%9AV_K%C3%A1ran%C3%BD.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/P%C3%ADskov%C3%A9_rychlofiltry_od%C5%BEelezovny_v_K%C3%A1ran%C3%A9m_v_klidu.jpg/220px-P%C3%ADskov%C3%A9_rychlofiltry_od%C5%BEelezovny_v_K%C3%A1ran%C3%A9m_v_klidu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sedimentation","water_treatment"]],"members":["sedimentation"],"related":["Water","Drinking_water","Portable_water_purification","Contaminant","Settling","Filtration","Disinfection","Flocculation","Aerated_lagoon","Activated_sludge","Slow_sand_filter","United_States","Drinking_water","Suspended_solids","Bacteria","Algae","Virus","Fungi","Mineral","Iron","Manganese","Sulphur","Pollutants","Fertiliser","World_Health_Organisation","Chlorination","Aeration","Flocculation","Polyelectrolyte","Sedimentation","Desalination","Water_industry","Contaminant","Sewage","Natural_environment","Sludge","Sewage_collection_and_disposal","Solid","Liquid","Sedimentation_(water_treatment)","Waterborne_diseases","Sanitation","Sanitary_sewer","Greywater_treatment","Point-of-use","ERDLator","Reverse_Osmosis_Water_Purification_Unit","Developing_countries","Corrosion","Agricultural_wastewater_treatment","Carl_Rogers_Darnall","Ecological_sanitation","Industrial_wastewater_treatment","Peak_water","Pulsed-power_water_treatment","SODIS","Water_pollution","Water_quality","Water_supply_network"]}
