Its silver\nsalt was discovered in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard and later investigated in\n1824 by Justus von Liebig. It is an organic acid and an isomer of isocyanic\nacid, the silver salt of which was discovered one year later by Friedrich\nWoehler.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Fulminic Acid in the History of Organic Chemistry author = F.

The vapors also are toxic.\n",
