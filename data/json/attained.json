It entailed losing not only one's property\nand hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one's\nheirs. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.\n\n'Attainder by confession' resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges\nor before the coroner in sanctuary. 'Attainder by verdict' resulted from\nconviction by a jury. 'Attainder by process' resulted from a legislative act\noutlawing a fugitive. The latter form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in\nthe United States), and the other forms have been abolished.\n","title":"Attainder","headings":["Attainders of British aristocracy in the Middle Ages and Renaissance","Passage in Parliament","Corruption of blood","Examples of cases where a person's property was subject to attainder","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Henry_VII_of_England","2: War_of_the_Roses","1: Criminal_law","1: Capital_crime","1: Felony","1: Treason","1: Coroner","1: Outlaw","1: Commoners","1: Henry_VI_of_England","1: Edward_IV","1: Margaret_of_Anjou","1: Henry_VIII_of_England","1: Anne_Boleyn","1: Catherine_Howard","1: Edward_Stafford,_3rd_Duke_of_Buckingham","1: Margaret_Pole,_8th_Countess_of_Salisbury","1: Henry_Howard,_Earl_of_Surrey","1: Thomas_Howard,_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk","1: Westminster_system","1: Bill_of_attainder","1: Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: High_treason","1: A_Summary_View_of_the_Rights_of_British_America","1: Forfeiture_Act_1870","1: Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution","1: Ex_post_facto_law","1: United_States_Constitution","1: Slayer_rule","1: England_and_Wales","1: Forfeiture_Act_1982","1: Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford","1: John_de_la_Pole,_1st_Earl_of_Lincoln","1: Mervyn_Tuchet,_2nd_Earl_of_Castlehaven","1: Parker_Wickham","1: Richard_FitzAlan,_11th_Earl_of_Arundel","1: Thomas_Cromwell"]}
