{"cursor":"4802","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n about to take Mohammad Yousuf caught and bowled]] 'Caught' is a method of\n dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. Being caught out is the most\n common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition. This method of\n dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the Laws of cricket which reads: [http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-\n caught,58,AR.html Laws of Cricket: Law 32 (Caught)]\n\nA batsman is out caught if a fielder catches the ball fully within the field of\nplay without it bouncing once the ball has touched the striker's bat, glove or\nonly the leg of the batsman. If a batsman could be given out caught or by any\nother method except [[bowled]], 'caught' takes precedence.\n\nThis means that the batsman cannot be out caught if:\n* The ball is called a no ball or dead ball.\n* The batsman does not hit the ball with his bat or the gloved hand\n  holding the bat.\n* The ball, having been hit, makes contact with the field before a fielder\n  catches the ball.\n* The ball does not remain under the control of the fielder.\n* The ball is hit and lands beyond the boundary; (six runs).\n* A fielder taking the catch makes contact with the boundary rope or the area\n  outside the boundary.\n* The ball hits a close in fielder on the helmet, and rebounds in the air\n  for a catch.\n\nIf a batsman is out caught, any runs scored off that delivery are voided. If the\ncatch is taken by the wicket-keeper, then informally it is known as a \"'caught\nbehind'\". A catch by the bowler is known as a \"'caught and bowled'\". This has\nnothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the\ncatcher and bowler are the same player (the scorecard annotation is usually c.\nand b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name).\n\nIf the catch taken is pronounced or obvious, the players need not appeal to the\numpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself.\nHowever, in the event that the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is\ntaken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the\nbatsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come\noff the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is\nreluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal\nto the umpire for this decision. In international competition, if neither field\numpire can clearly decide if a catch has been made or not, they may refer to the\nthird (television) umpire for a review. The third umpire may also be used if the\nUmpire Decision Review System is available and a team wishes to dispute a call\nconcerning a possible catch.\n\nIf a batsman is caught, the bowler is credited with the batsman's wicket and the\ncatching fielder is credited for the dismissal. If the two batsmen cross each\nother, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the non-striking\nbatsman at the time remains at the opposite end of the pitch as the new incoming\nbatsman comes to the crease at his former end. This means, unless it is now a\nnew over, he is now on strike and the incoming batsman is not.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Caught","recorded":1374541000,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Caught_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:In_the_air.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/In_the_air.jpg/250px-In_the_air.jpg","/wiki/File:In_the_air.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf,_Dunedin,_NZ,_2009.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf%2C_Dunedin%2C_NZ%2C_2009.jpg/250px-Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf%2C_Dunedin%2C_NZ%2C_2009.jpg","/wiki/File:Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf,_Dunedin,_NZ,_2009.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shane_Bond","/wiki/Mohammad_Yousuf_(cricketer)","/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)","/wiki/Batsman","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Laws_of_cricket","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/No_ball","/wiki/Dead_ball_(cricket)","/wiki/Cricket_bat","/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)","/wiki/Six_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket-keeper","/wiki/Bowler_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/Appeal_(cricket)","/wiki/Umpire_Decision_Review_System","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1999_Cricket_World_Cup","/wiki/South_African","/wiki/Herschelle_Gibbs","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Steve_Waugh","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-caught,58,AR.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151523.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65231.html","/wiki/Template:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket&action=edit","/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/Handled_the_ball","/wiki/Hit_the_ball_twice","/wiki/Hit_wicket","/wiki/Leg_before_wicket","/wiki/Obstructing_the_field","/wiki/Run_out","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman","/wiki/Timed_out","/wiki/Template:Cricket_statistics","/wiki/Template_talk:Cricket_statistics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cricket_statistics&action=edit","/wiki/Cricket_statistics","/wiki/Batting_(cricket)","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Run_(cricket)","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Century_(cricket)","/wiki/Nervous_nineties","/wiki/Strike_rate","/wiki/Not_out","/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)","/wiki/Over_(cricket)","/wiki/Run_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket","/wiki/No_ball","/wiki/Wide_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowling_average","/wiki/Hat-trick#Cricket","/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)","/wiki/Leg_bye","/wiki/Wicket-keeper","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)","/wiki/Bye_(cricket)","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caught&oldid=564158743","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Cricket_laws_and_regulations","/wiki/Category:Cricket_terminology","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Caught&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Caught","/wiki/Caught","/wiki/Talk:Caught","#","/wiki/Caught","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipe
