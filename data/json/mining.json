Mining\nis required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural\nprocesses, or created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider\nsense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum,\nnatural gas, or even water.\n\nMining of stone and metal has been done since pre-historic times. Modern mining\nprocesses involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential\nof a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation\nof the land after the mine is closed.\n\nThe nature of mining processes creates a potential negative impact on the\nenvironment both during the mining operations and for years after the mine is\nclosed. This impact has led to most of the world's nations adopting regulations\nto moderate the negative effects of mining operations. Safety has long been a\nconcern as well, and modern practices have improved safety in mines\nsignificantly.\n","title":"mining","headings":["History","Environmental effects","Mining
