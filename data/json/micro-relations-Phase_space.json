For mechanical systems,\nthe phase space usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum\nvariables (i.e. the cotangent space of configuration space). The concept of\nphase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri\nPoincarÃ©, and Willard Gibbs.\n\nA plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes\ncalled a 'phase plot' or a 'phase diagram'. Phase diagram, however, is more\nusually reserved in the physical sciences for a diagram showing the various\nregions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which\nconsists of pressure, temperature, and composition.\n\nIn a phase space, every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is\nrepresented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is\ncalled a phase line, while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane. For\nevery possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the\nsystem's parameters, a point is plotted in the multidimensional space. Often\nthis succession of plotted points is analogous to the system's state evolving\nover time. In the end, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be,\nand its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be\nobvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great many dimensions. For\ninstance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for\neach particle's x, y and z positions and momenta as well as any number of other\nproperties.\n\nIn classical mechanics, any choice of generalized coordinates q i for\nthe position (i.e. coordinates on configuration space) defines conjugate\ngeneralized momenta p i which together define co-ordinates on phase\nspace. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent\nspace of configuration space, and in this interpretaton the procedure above\nexpresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a\nchoice of natural local Darboux coordinates for the standard symplectic\nstructure on a cotangent space.\n\nThe motion of an ensemble of systems in this space is studied by classical\nstatistical mechanics. The local density of points in such systems obeys\nLiouville's Theorem, and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a\nmodel system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system\nat any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamical variables.\nBecause of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any\ngiven time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or\nLagrange's equations of motion.\n","linknr":233,"url":"Phase_space","recorded":1362540675,"links":37,"instances":["physics","mathematics","vector","mathematics","mathematics","hamiltonian","mathematical_physics","physics","statistical_mechanics","mathematics","physics_and_chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Dynamical systems","Dimensional analysis","Hamiltonian mechanics"],"headings":["Examples","Quantum mechanics","Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics","Phase Integral","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Focal_stability.png/300px-Focal_stability.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/4/f6497d7116301f53da81d0f908fcebf6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Limitcycle.jpg/340px-Limitcycle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["space","mathematics"],["position","vector"],["degrees_of_freedom","physics_and_chemistry"],["phase_line","mathematics"],["statistical_ensemble","mathematical_physics"],["liouville's_theorem","hamiltonian"],["autonomous_system","mathematics"],["phase_line","mathematics"],["distribution","mathematics"],["action","physics"],["microstate","statistical_mechanics"],["phase_line","mathematics"],["state_space","controls"],["state_space","physics"]],"members":["state_space","phase_line","position","space","distribution","statistical_ensemble","action","microstate","autonomous_system","degrees_of_freedom"],"related":["Mathematics","Physics","Space_(mathematics)","System","Classical_mechanics","Position_(vector)","Momentum","Cotangent_space","Configuration_space","Ludwig_Boltzmann","Henri_Poincaré","Willard_Gibbs","Phase_diagram","Physical_sciences","Pressure","Temperature","Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)","Parameter","Phase_line_(mathematics)","Phase_plane","Generalized_coordinates","Configuration_space","Conjugate_momentum","Cotangent_space","Darboux_coordinates","Symplectic_structure","Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics)","Statistical_mechanics","Liouville's_theorem_(Hamiltonian)","Autonomous_system_(mathematics)","Ordinary_differential_equation","Phase_line_(mathematics)","Exponential_growth_model","Logistic_growth_model","Phase_plane","Phase_portrait","Limit_cycle","Van_der_Pol_oscillator","Van_der_Pol_oscillator","Chaos_theory","Lorenz_attractor","Logistic_map","Complex_quadratic_polynomial","Mandelbrot_set","Quantum_mechanics","Hermitian_operators","Hilbert_space","Moyal_product","Uncertainty_principle","Observable","Distribution_(mathematics)","Hermann_Weyl","John_von_Neumann","Eugene_Wigner","Hilbrand_J._Groenewold","José_Enrique_Moyal","Deformation_quantization","Geometric_quantization","Wigner_quasi-probability_distribution","Wigner–Weyl_transform","Deformation_theory","Action_(physics)","Special_relativity","General_Relativity","Schwarzschild_radius","Thermodynamic_phase_space","Thermodynamics","Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)","Avogadro's_number","Liquid","Solid","Manifold","Phase_line_(mathematics)","Phase_plane","Phase_portrait","Phase_space_method","Parameter_space","Optical_phase_space","State_space_(controls)","State_space","Molecular_dynamics","Cotangent_bundle","Dynamical_system","Symplectic_manifold","Weyl_quantization","Classical_mechanics","Hamiltonian_mechanics","Lagrangian_mechanics","State_space_(physics)"]}
