{"cursor":"6978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'tumor' (American English) or 'tumour' (British English) is commonly used as a\nsynonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled [cystic] lesion that\nmay or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears\nenlarged in size. Tumor is not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by\ndefinition malignant, a tumor can be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant, or can\nrepresent a lesion without any cancerous potential whatsoever.\n\nThe terms \"mass\" and \"nodule\" are often used synonymously with \"tumor\".\nGenerally speaking, however, the term \"tumor\" is used generically, without\nreference to the physical size of the lesion. More specifically, the term \"mass\"\nis often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters\n(mm) in greatest direction, while the term \"nodule\" is usually used when the\nsize of the lesion is less than 20 mm in its greatest dimension\n(25.4 mm = 1 inch).\n","linknr":434,"url":"tumors","recorded":1362685581,"links":68,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anatomical pathology","Medical signs","Oncology"],"headings":["Etymology","Causes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Hidradenoma.jpg/200px-Hidradenoma.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nodule","medicine"]],"members":["nodule"],"related":["American_English","British_English","Neoplasm","Lesion","Cancer","Benign_tumor","Precancerous_condition","Malignancy","Nodule_(medicine)","Latin","Old_French","Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus","Inflammation","De_Medicina","Neoplasm","Tumescence","Benign_tumor","Sweat_glands","Hidradenoma","Mutation","Leukemia","Carcinoma_in_situ","Sebaceous_cyst","Breast_cyst","Keloid","Granuloma","Enteric_duplication_cyst","Biopsy","Anatomical_pathology","Surgery","History_of_medicine"]}
