{"cursor":"1981","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The \"Principle of Instantiation\" or \"Principle of Exemplification\" is a thesis\nin philosophy that states that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified\nproperties (or universals). In other words, it is impossible for a property to\nexist which is not had by some object. Aristotle is well known for endorsing the\nprinciple and Plato for denying it.\n\nConsider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus,\naccording to the Principle of Instantiation, the property of being a chair did\nnot exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly (and assuming objects are\ncolored), if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the\nproperty of being red would likewise go out of existence.\n\nThose who endorse the Principle of Instantiation are known as in re realists or\n\"immanent realists\". {{cite book\n| last = Loux first = Michael authormask = authorlink = coauthors = firstn =\n| lastn = authorn-link = editorn-last = Zimmerman editorn-first = Dean W. editor-\n| link = http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-\n| author=Dean%20W.%20Zimmerman&search-alias=books-de-intl-us title = Oxford\n| Studies in Metaphysics trans_title = url = http://www.amazon.de/gp/reader/019-\n| 9290598/ref=sr_1_1?p=S009&keywords=Aristotle%27s+Constituent+Ontology%27&ie=U-\n| TF8&qid=1340617206#reader_0199290598 format = paperback accessdate = 2012-06-\n| 25 type = book edition = origyear = 2006 year = 2006 publisher = Oxford\n| University Press location = language = English isbn = 978-0-19-929058-1 page =\n| pages = chapter = Aristotle's Constituent Ontology trans_chapter =\n}}\n","linknr":78,"url":"Instantiation_principle","recorded":1362543437,"links":10,"instances":["metaphysics","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophical concepts"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["property","philosophy"],["universal","metaphysics"]],"members":["universal","property"],"related":["Philosophy","Property_(philosophy)","Universal_(metaphysics)","Aristotle","Plato"]}
