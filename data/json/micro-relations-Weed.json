{"cursor":"17703","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe term 'weed' is used in a variety of senses, generally centering around a\nplant that is not desired within a certain context. The term weed is a\nsubjective one, without any classification value, since a plant that is a weed\nin one context is not a weed when growing where it belongs or is wanted. Indeed,\na number of plants that many consider \"weeds\", are often intentionally grown by\npeople in gardens or other cultivated-plant settings. Therefore, a weed is a\nplant that is considered by the user of the term to be a nuisance. The word\ncommonly is applied to unwanted plants in human-controlled settings, especially\nfarm fields and gardens, but also lawns, parks, woods, and other areas. More\nvaguely, \"weed\" is applied to any plants that grow and reproduce aggressively\nand invasively. The term weed has also been generalized to any\nspecies, not just plants, that can live in diverse environments and reproduce\nquickly, and the term has even been applied to humans.\n\n}}\n","linknr":337,"url":"Weed","recorded":1362373130,"links":81,"instances":["gardener","botany"],"pdf":["http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf","http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf","http://employees.csbsju.edu/ssaupe/biol327/Lecture/Plant_Foraging_case_study.pdf","http://employees.csbsju.edu/ssaupe/biol327/Lecture/Plant_Foraging_case_study.pdf","http://plantecology.dbs.umt.edu/Full%20text%20papers%20and%20abstracts/2004%20papers/Callaway&Ridenour2004NOVEL.pdf","http://plantecology.dbs.umt.edu/Full%20text%20papers%20and%20abstracts/2004%20papers/Callaway&Ridenour2004NOVEL.pdf"],"categories":["Plants","Agricultural pests","Environmental issues","Garden pests","Invasive plant species|"],"headings":["Ecological role","Dispersal","Competition with cultivated and endemic plants","Benefits of weed species","Weeds as adaptable species","Role in mass extinctions","Plants often considered to be weeds","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Top_view_of_a_dandelion.JPG/220px-Top_view_of_a_dandelion.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Cattle_poison.jpg/220px-Cattle_poison.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Trifolium_repens_macro.jpg/220px-Trifolium_repens_macro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg/32px-Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["christopher_lloyd","gardener"],["volunteer","botany"]],"members":["christopher_lloyd","volunteer"],"related":["Word_sense","Plant","Agriculture","Garden","Lawn","Park","Forest","Invasive_species","Humans","Leaf_vegetable","Herbal_medicine","Adaptation","Dune","Alluvial","River_bank","River_delta","Reproduce","Soil_seed_bank","Allelopathy","Grain","Invasive_species","Noxious_weed","Livestock","Book_of_Genesis","William_Shakespeare","Sonnet","Agriculture","Crop","Lawn","Landscape_architecture","Playing_field","Golf_course","Native_plant","Horticulture","Environmentalism","Soil","Pathogen","Tephritidae","Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","Bur","Dandelion","Herbal_medicine","Burdock","East_Asia","Beneficial_weed","Insect","Hardpan","Corncockle","Christopher_Lloyd_(gardener)","Feral_Pigeon","Brown_rat","Raccoon","Coyote","White-tailed_deer","Brown_headed_cowbird","Mass_extinction","Endemic_species","Cockroaches","Holocene_extinction","Bermuda_grass","Bindweed","Broadleaf_plantain","Burdock","Chenopodium_album","Creeping_Charlie","Dandelion","Goldenrod","Japanese_Knotweed","Kudzu","Leafy_spurge","Milk_thistle","Poison_ivy","Ragweed","Sorrel","St_John's_wort","Sumac","Tree_of_heaven","Wild_carrot","Wood_sorrel","Yellow_nutsedge","Crop_weeds","Herbicide","Introduced_species","List_of_beneficial_weeds","R-selection","Vavilovian_mimicry","Volunteer_(botany)","Weed_control","Weed_of_cultivation"]}
