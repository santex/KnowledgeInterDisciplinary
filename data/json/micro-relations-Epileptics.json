Some\ndefinitions of epilepsy require that seizures be recurrent and unprovoked, but\nothers require only a single seizure combined with brain alterations which\nincrease the chance of future seizures. In many cases a\ncause cannot be identified; however, factors that are associated include brain\ntrauma, strokes, brain cancer, and drug and alcohol misuse among\nothers. [http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Epilepsy/Pages/Causes.aspx] NHS\nchoices website\n\nEpileptic seizures result from abnormal, excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal\nactivity in the brain. About 50 million people\nworldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of epilepsy occurs in developing\ncountries. Epilepsy becomes more common as people\nage. Onset of new cases occurs most frequently in infants\nand the elderly. As a consequence of brain surgery, epileptic\nseizures may occur in recovering patients.\n\nEpilepsy is usually controlled, but not cured, with medication. However,\nmore than 30% of people with epilepsy do not have seizure control even with\nthe best available medications. Surgery may be considered in difficult\ncases. Not all epilepsy syndromes are lifelong â some forms are\nconfined to particular stages of childhood. Epilepsy should not be\nunderstood as a single disorder, but rather as syndromic with vastly\ndivergent symptoms, all involving episodic abnormal electrical activity in\nthe brain and numerous seizures.\n","linknr":1352,"url":"Epileptics","recorded":1362503026,"links":102,"instances":["religion","medicine","anatomy","medicine","medicine","digestion","symptom"],"pdf":["http://www.acutemed.co.uk/docs/Epilepsy,%20Lancet%204-06.pdf","http://www.acutemed.co.uk/docs/Epilepsy,%20Lancet%204-06.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00817.x/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00817.x/pdf","http://www.neurologia.com/pdf/Web/5010/bd100616.pdf","http://www.neurologia.com/pdf/Web/5010/bd100616.pdf","http://www.sudep.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/National-Sentinel-Audit-2002.pdf","http://www.sudep.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/National-Sentinel-Audit-2002.pdf","http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/downloads/pdf/epilepsyaction_driving.pdf"],"categories":["Medical
