{"cursor":"5708","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"-Modifying Enzymes, the sites for modification are marked in color.]]\n\nThe packaging of the eukaryotic genome into highly condensed chromatin makes it\ninaccessible to the factors required for gene transcription, DNA replication,\nrecombination and repair. Eukaryotes have developed intricate mechanisms to\novercome this repressive barrier imposed by the chromatin. The nucleosome is\ncomposed of an octamer of the four core histones (H3, H4, H2A, H2B) around which\n147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped. Several distinct classes of enzyme can modify\nhistones at multiple sites. The figure on the right enlists those histone-\nmodifying enzymes whose specificity has been determined. There are at least\neight distinct types of modifications found on histones (see the legend box on\nthe top left of the figure). Enzymes have been identified for\nacetylation, methylation, demethylation, phosphorylation,\nubiquitination, sumoylation, ADP-ribosylation,\ndeimination, and proline isomerization. For a\ndetailed example of histone modifications in transcription regulation see RNA\npolymerase control by chromatin structure and table .\n","linknr":199,"url":"Histone-Modifying_Enzymes","recorded":1362481199,"links":13,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epigenetics","Genetics","Proteins"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/NucleosomeKG.jpg/300px-NucleosomeKG.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Eukaryotic","Genome","Chromatin","Transcription_(genetics)","Genetic_recombination","Eukaryotes","Chromatin","Histone","Enzyme","Histone","Histones","Enzyme","Acetylation","Methylation","Demethylation","Phosphorylation","Ubiquitination","Sumoylation","ADP-ribosylation","Deimination","Proline_isomerization","RNA_polymerase_control_by_chromatin_structure","Histone_deacetylase","Histone_methyltransferase","Histone_acetyltransferase","Nucleosome","Chromatin","PRMT4_pathway"]}
