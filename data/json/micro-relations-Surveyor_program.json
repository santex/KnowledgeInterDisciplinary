(NASA)]]\n\nThe 'Surveyor Program' was a NASA program that, from 1966 through 1968, sent\nseven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. Its primary goal was to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of soft landings on the Moon. The mission called for\nthe craft to travel directly to the Moon on an impact trajectory, on a journey\nthat lasted 63 to 65 hours, and ended with a deceleration of just over three\nminutes to a soft-landing. The program was implemented by NASA's Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory (JPL) to prepare for the Apollo program. The total cost of the\nSurveyor program was officially $469 million.\n\nFive of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the moon, including the\nfirst one. The other two failed: Surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a\nfailed mid-course correction, and Surveyor 4 was lost to contact (possibly\nexploding) 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down.\n\nAll seven spacecraft are still on the Moon; none of the missions included\nreturning them to Earth. Some parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the\ncrew of Apollo 12, which landed near it in 1969. The camera from this craft is\non display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n","linknr":354,"url":"Surveyor_program","recorded":1362267812,"links":55,"instances":["lunar_crater","rocket_family","crater"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690027073_1969027073.pdf","http://ia600508.us.archive.org/3/items/surveyorprogramr00unit/surveyorprogramr00unit.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720019081_1972019081.pdf"],"categories":["Surveyor program|*","Missions to the Moon"],"headings":["Goals","Launch and lunar landing","Missions","Space Race competition","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/Surveyor_diagram.jpg/400px-Surveyor_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Apollo12ConradSurveyor.jpg/235px-Apollo12ConradSurveyor.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Tycho_Crater_Panorama.jpg/220px-Tycho_Crater_Panorama.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Surveyor_1_launch.jpg/220px-Surveyor_1_launch.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Moon_landing_map_surveyor.svg/300px-Moon_landing_map_surveyor.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Moon_landing_map_surveyor.svg/300px-Moon_landing_map_surveyor.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/Surveyor_lander.png/220px-Surveyor_lander.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/LRO_2006.jpg/120px-LRO_2006.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Moon_nearside_LRO.jpg/120px-Moon_nearside_LRO.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg/120px-Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["copernicus","lunar_crater"],["tycho","crater"],["atlas","rocket_family"]],"members":["copernicus","atlas","tycho"],"related":["NASA","Robotic_spacecraft","Moon","Landing","Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory","Apollo_program","Surveyor_3","Apollo_12","National_Air_and_Space_Museum","Luna_9","Alpha_particle_scattering","NASA","Hughes_Aircraft_Company","Atlas-Centaur","Oceanus_Procellarum","Copernicus_(lunar_crater)","Oceanus_Procellarum","Sinus_Medii","Mare_Tranquillitatis","Sinus_Medii","Tycho_(crater)","United_States","Space_Race","Soviet_Union","Luna_9","Apollo_program","Atlas_(rocket_family)","Luna_programme","Lunar_Orbiter_program","Ranger_program"]}
