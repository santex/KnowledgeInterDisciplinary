They may allow for denser\npackaging of DNA in spermatozoon than histones, but they must be decompressed\nbefore the genetic data can be used for protein synthesis. However, in humans\nand maybe other primates, 10-15% of the sperm's genome is packaged by histones\nthought to bind genes that are essential for early embryonic development. \n","linknr":309,"url":"Protamines","recorded":1362481143,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v4/n9/pdf/3300484a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/gt/journal/v4/n9/pdf/3300484a.pdf"],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["Medical uses","Examples","Protamine structure","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Arginine","Cell_nucleus","Proteins","Histones","Haploid","Spermatogenesis","Sperm","DNA","Spermatozoon","Insulin","NPH_insulin","Cardiopulmonary_bypass","Protamine_sulfate","Heparin","Antigenicity","Protamine_sulfate","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Salmon","Herring","Rainbow_trout","Tunafish","Squaliformes"]}
