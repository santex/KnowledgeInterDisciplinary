He has\ngarnered respect internationally as a fine musician and engaging communicator.\nHis live performances are always passionate and compelling leaving audiences\nwanting more. Graham performed with the Wesley Brothers in the U.K. before\nembarking on his solo career.\n\nGraham was born in Colchester Essex into a musical family and began song writing\nas early as 5 years old. He began playing the guitar in his early teens, being\ntaught by his Father and also various music teachers at night school and private\nlessons. During the late 1970s while still at school in Wales he performed in\nthe Punk band âFire Exitâ. In the early eighties he made the move to London\nwhere he lived briefly in Chelsea and later in Hatfield, eventually settling in\nSt Albans. He became a regular as a solo act performing in the North London\nclubs and pubs supporting various bands and other Artists. His Younger brother\nDoug joined him later and together with Daryl C they formed the New Wave band\nâPrussian Bluesâ. They recorded together and performed in various clubs and wine\nbars in the London area.\n\nGrahamâs musical direction took a major turn after he found faith in Christ and\nfor a year or so he didnât perform too much in public. Later he teamed up with\nbass player Dave Moore and together they began performing as a duo. Later they\nasked Grahamâs brother to join them on drums and formed the band âHearts on\nFireâ. This band later became known as the Wesley Brothers Graham taking the\nname Leslie Wesley and Dave being known as Elvis Wesley. Other band members were\ninducted including Grunt, Hormone, Chipalater, Doc and Andrew Lloyd Wesley! The\nWesleyâs ended up having 13 drummers in a twelve-year period, the last of which\nwas Geronimo Wesley named after a re usable condom from the 50âs! The Wesley\nbrothers performed regularly on the North London pub circuit and recorded their\ndebut âFill Me Upâ which charted in 1996. Produced by Martin Smith of Delirious\nithe title track also featured a duet with Graham and Kevin Prosch. Graham and\nDave later also toured with Kevinâs band in the UK. Shortly after the Wesleyâs\nsigned with Alliance Media the band broke up and Graham went on to record a solo\nproject entitled âCryinâ Freedomâ again with Martin Smith producing and\nfeaturing Marc James on lead guitar and Jimmy the Skin Cooke on drums (now with\nVera Cruz). It was a killer rock and roll album which sadly despite promises of\nmajor distribution was never widely released. In 1998 Grahamâs popular song âThe\nLord is Gracious and Compassionateâ was recorded by Vineyard Music Group in the\nUK and Ireland, while Graham relocated to Canada and began a solo Career in\nVancouver BC. His first Canadian release was an instrumental recording entitled\nâWaitingâ He then went on to record two CDâs with producer and writer Brian\nDoerksen with the Vineyard Canada Music group.\n\nGraham has since traveled extensively around the world as a musician and has\nreleased eight solo albums to date together with several collaborative projects\nwhich have attracted accolades from around the world. He has also written and\nproduced music for several other successful artists and has composed scores for\nshort film and narratives.\n\nHis production work with Canadian First Nations Artist Cheryl Bear won three\nmajor awards in 2007 including 'Single of the year' at the Aboriginal People's\nChoice Awards in Canada and in the US.\n\nHis latest recording Chill, an instrumental collaboration with Andrew Smith and\nBrian Wiebe, was nominated for a Shai award (Canadaâs peoples choice music\nawards) for instrumental CD of the year.\n\nGraham now works as a full-time musician and recording artist based out of\nKelowna, B.C., Canada.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Graham_Ord","recorded":1374965972,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Grahamord.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Grahamord.jpg/200px-Grahamord.jpg","/wiki/Colchester,_Essex","/wiki/England","/wiki/London,_England","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Blues","/wiki/Gospel","/wiki/Record_label","/w/index.php?title=Knewsense_Records&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.grahamord.com/","/wiki/England","/wiki/Songwriter","/w/index.php?title=Wesley_Brothers&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","#Discography","#Albums","#Songs_in_other_projects","#Songs_on_compilations","#Soundtracks","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Independent_record_label","#cite_note-2","/wiki/1996_in_music","/wiki/2000_in_music","/wiki/2001_in_music","#cite_note-3","/wiki/2003_in_music","/wiki/2005_in_music","#cite_note-4","/wiki/2006_in_music","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Lianna_Klassen","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Sea_to_Sea:_I_See_the_Cross","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/Graham_Ord_Worship_Album/14070/p1/","/wiki/Cross_Rhythms","#cite_ref-2","http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Graham_Ord/Crying_Freedom/18037/","/wiki/Cross_Rhythms","#cite_ref-3","http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Graham_Ord/An_Offering_Honest_To_God_Worship/4400/","/wiki/Cross_Rhythms","#cite_ref-4","http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Graham_Ord/Regarding_The_Maker/12625/","/wiki/Cross_Rhythms","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit&section=7","http://www.knewsenserecords.ca/","http://www.grahamord.com/","http://www.aboriginalpeopleschoice.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&oldid=542454274","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1961_births","/wiki/Category:English_Pentecostals","/wiki/Category:British_performers_of_Christian_music","/wiki/Category:Christian_religion-related_songwriters","/wiki/Category:English_songwriters","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Graham+Ord&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Graham+Ord","/wiki/Graham_Ord","/wiki/Talk:Graham_Ord","#","/wiki/Graham_Ord","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Graham_Ord","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Graham_Ord","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&oldid=542454274","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593119","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Graham_Ord&id=542454274","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Graham+Ord","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Graham+Ord&oldid=542454274&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Ord&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593119#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediaf
