Like any biofilm, dental plaque is formed by colonizing bacteria\ntrying to attach themselves to the tooth's smooth surface. It has been speculated that plaque forms part of the defense\nsystems of the host by helping to prevent colonization of microorganisms that\nmay be pathogenic. [http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html\nLeeds University: Introduction to dental plaque] [http://web.archive.org/web/20110717211203/http://www.dentistry.leeds.a-\nc.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html: Archive.org capture of original reference\nfrom July 17, 2012]\n\nThe oral cavity contains the only known anatomical aspect of the human body that\ndoes not have a regulated system of shedding surfaces: the teeth. This allows a\nnumerous amount of microorganisms to adhere to the surface of teeth for long\nperiods of time. These multiple species of bacteria\nbecome dental biofilm. Dental biofilm, more commonly referred to as dental\nplaque, is composed of about a thousand species of bacteria that take part in\nthe complex ecosystems of the mouth. The natural, non-frequent regulation of\ntooth shedding plays a large role in making dental biofilm the most diverse\nbiofilm in the human body despite the relatively small size of the teeth.\n\nThe human oral cavity is also called the human oral microbiome. This is because\nthe human oral cavity can contain several environments at a given moment that\ncould vary from tooth to tooth. Additionally\nit has been estimated that 25,000 species of bacteria reside in the\nmouth. This is in contrast to the previously estimated 700+\nspecies. Studies have found that out of the\n25,000 species that exist in the oral cavity, about 1,000 species can exist as\npart of the dental biofilm ecosystem. This is\nalso in contrast to the previous estimate of more than 500 species as part of\nthe dental biofilm. These 1,000 species have the ability to change\ntheir environment through a series of biotic relationships.\n\nAt first, the biofilm is soft enough to come off by using the fingernail.\nHowever, it starts to harden within 48 hours, and in about 10 days the plaque\nbecomes dental calculus (tartar) hard and difficult to remove.\n\nDental plaque can give rise to dental caries (tooth decay)—the localised\ndestruction of the tissues of the tooth by acid produced from the bacterial\ndegradation of fermentable sugars —and periodontal problems such as gingivitis and chronic\nperiodontitis.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Dental_plaque","recorded":1362511570,"links":48,"instances":["biology","biology","biochemistry","dental"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acquired tooth disorders"],"headings":["Basic plaque formation","Microorganisms","Environment","Biotic relationships","Components of plaque","Consequence of plaque build up","Detection of plaque build up","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Mandibulartori02-04-06.jpg/220px-Mandibulartori02-04-06.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/20100926_180124_DentalPlaque.jpg/400px-20100926_180124_DentalPlaque.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Dentistry_stub.svg/14px-Dentistry_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colonization","biology"],["calculus","dental"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["mutualism","biology"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["calculus","dental"],["calculus","dental"]],"members":["mutualism","colonization","fermentation","calculus"],"related":["Biofilm","Teeth","Bacteria","Colonization_(biology)","Microorganism","Pathogenic","Oral_cavity","Human_body","Teeth","Oral_cavity","Microbiome","Species","Bacteria","Species","Calculus_(dental)","Dental_caries","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Sugar","Periodontal","Gingivitis","Chronic_periodontitis","Adsorption","Van_der_Waals_force","Electrostatic","Adhesion","Species","Bacteria","Biofilm","Species","The_Forsyth_Institute","Bacteria","PH","Saliva","Redox_reaction","Buffer_solution","Bacteria","Gingival_crevicular_fluid","Redox_reactions","Aerobic_bacteria","Bacteria","Oral_cavity","Commensal","Mutualism_(biology)","Symbiotic_relationships","Anaerobic_bacteria","Adsorption","Acquired_pellicle","Acquired_pellicle","Glycoproteins","Bacteria","Bacteria","Genotype","Phenotype","Phenotypic_plasticity","Pathogens","Dental_caries","Periodontal_disease","Pathogens","Dental_caries","Pathogenic_bacteria","Periodontal_disease","Microorganism","Anaerobic_organism","Fusobacterium","Actinobacteria","Tooth_brushing","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Remineralisation_of_teeth","Dental_caries","Saliva","Remineralisation_of_teeth","Gingivitis","Periodontal_disease","Calculus_(dental)","Calculus_(dental)","Flossing","Gingiva","Dental_disease","Oral_hygiene","Oral_microbiology"]}
