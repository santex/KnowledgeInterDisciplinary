David Baird et al.}} According to the Merriam-\nWebster dictionary, the word \"colored\" was first used in the 14th Century. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/colored Merriam-Webster Dictionary]\n\nIn other English-speaking countries, the term has varied meanings. In South\nAfrica, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the term Coloured refers both to a\nspecific ethnic group of complex mixed origins, which is considered neither\nblack nor white, and in other contexts to people of mixed race; in neither\ncontext is its usage considered derogatory. In British usage, the term refers to\n\"a person who is wholly or partly of non-white descent\" and its use may be\nregarded as antiquated or offensive, \"In Britain it was the accepted term\nuntil the 1960s, when it was superseded (as in the US) by black. The term\ncoloured lost favour among black people during this period and is now widely\nregarded as offensive except in historical contexts.\" and other\nterms are preferable, particularly when referring to a single ethnicity.\n\nThe term should not be confused with the more recent term people of color, which\ngenerally refers to all \"non-white people\".\n","linknr":321,"url":"colored","recorded":1362575763,"links":15,"instances":["classification_of_human_beings","magazine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["African American|+","History of the United States","Native American people","Race in the United States"],"headings":["History in America","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","classification_of_human_beings"],["american_heritage","magazine"]],"members":["race","american_heritage"],"related":["United_States","Black_people","Sub-Saharan","Ancestry","Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","Brown_People","Asians","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Merriam-Webster","South_Africa","Namibia","Zambia","Zimbabwe","Coloured","United_Kingdom","Person_of_color","White_people","Colonial_era","Bureau_of_Colored_Troops","Census","Negro","Henry_Louis_Gates","American_Heritage_(magazine)","Naugahyde","Politically_correct","National_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Colored_People","Washington,_D.C.","Free_people_of_color","Black_people","Coloured","United_States_Colored_Troops"]}
