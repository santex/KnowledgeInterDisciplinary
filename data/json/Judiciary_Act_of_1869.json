{"cursor":"2247","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Judiciary Act of 1869' (16 Stat. [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-\nbin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=79 44]), also called the\n'Circuit Judges Act of 1869', was a United States statute that made two\nimportant reforms of the federal judiciary.\n\nFirst, judgeships were created for the circuit courts; in this case, one circuit\njudgeship was created for each of the nine circuits. Up until this time, circuit\ncourts were normally only staffed by district judges and Supreme Court justices\n\"riding circuit.\" This was actually the third time that Congress had created\ncircuit judgeships, but the first time was the soon-repealed Judiciary Act of\n1801, and the second was a single circuit judgeship in the frontier state of\nCalifornia which only lasted from 1855 to 1863. This law did not abolish circuit\nriding, but significantly reduced its burden by requiring each justice to attend\ncircuit court in each district within his circuit only once every two years.\nCircuit riding would later be abolished by the Judiciary Act of 1891, and the\ncircuit courts themselves by the Judicial Code of 1911.\n\nSecond, for the first time, federal judges (including Supreme Court justices)\nwere given the option to retire with a pension. The pension was set at the\nsalary of the judge at the time of retirement, and a judge had to be at least\nseventy years old and have ten years of service on the federal bench before\nbeing allowed to retire.\n\nThis Act also set the Supreme Court at its current size of nine justices. The\nJudicial Circuits Act of 1866 had reduced the Court from ten to seven justices,\nalthough the reduction was to occur only as seats became vacant. As only two\nseats were vacated between 1866 and 1869, the Court had eight justices at the\ntime of this Act, so one new seat was created.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Judiciary_Act_of_1869","recorded":1375074693,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Statutes_at_Large","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=79","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Statute","/wiki/United_States_federal_court_system","/wiki/United_States_circuit_court","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1801","/wiki/California","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1891","/wiki/Judicial_Code_of_1911","/wiki/United_States_federal_judge","/wiki/Pension","/wiki/Judicial_Circuits_Act","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/29px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-law-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-law-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-law-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&oldid=503844563","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:United_States_law_stubs","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_judiciary_legislation","/wiki/Category:1869_in_law","/wiki/Category:1869_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:History_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judiciary+Act+of+1869&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judiciary+Act+of+1869","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869","/wiki/Talk:Judiciary_Act_of_1869","#","/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Judiciary_Act_of_1869","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Judiciary_Act_of_1869","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&oldid=503844563","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6303054","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&id=503844563","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Judiciary+Act+of+1869","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Judiciary+Act+of+1869&oldid=503844563&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Judiciary_Act_of_1869&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6303054#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciar
