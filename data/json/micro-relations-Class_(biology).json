Other well-known ranks are life, domain, kingdom, phylum,\n  order, family, genus, and species, with class fitting between phylum and\n  order. As for the other well-known ranks, there is the option of an\n  immediately lower rank, indicated by the prefix sub-: subclass (Latin:\n  subclassis).\n* a taxonomic unit, a taxon, in that rank. In that case the plural is classes\n  (Latin classes)\n\nThe composition of each class is determined by a taxonomist. Often there is no\nexact agreement, with different taxonomists taking different positions. There\nare no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing a class, but\nfor well-known animals there is likely to be consensus. For example, dogs are\nusually assigned to the phylum Chordata (animals with notochords); in the class\nMammalia; in the order Carnivora.\n","linknr":282,"url":"Class_(biology)","recorded":1362897478,"links":93,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific classification|rank06","Botanical nomenclature|Class","Plant taxonomy|1rank06","Biology terminology","Classes (biology)|"],"headings":["Hierarchy of ranks","History of the concept","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg/150px-Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"],["order","biology"],["family","biology"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["domain","order","kingdom","family"],"related":["Biological_classification","Taxonomic_rank","Life","Domain_(biology)","Kingdom_(biology)","Phylum","Order_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Genus","Species","Taxon","Dog","Chordate","Notochord","Mammalia","Carnivora","Prefix","Tetrapoda","Mammalia","Maxillopoda","Sauropsida","Thecostraca","Avialae","Cirripedia","Aves","Neornithes","France","Botanist","Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort","Carolus_Linnaeus","Ernst_Mayr","Kingdom_(biology)","Mineral","Plant","Animal","Phylum","Systematics","Cladistics","List_of_animal_classes","Phylogenetics","Taxonomy"]}
