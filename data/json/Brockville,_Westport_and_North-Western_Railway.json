Construction began in 1886\nheading north-west from Brockville, Ontario to Westport, Ontario. The line\nopened March 4, 1888 between Westport and Brockville. From Lyn Junction to\nBrockville, the railway used trackage rights on the Grand Trunk Railway. In\n1889, the line from Lyn Junction to Brockville opened. In 1894 the company was\nplaced into receivership, and in 1903 it was sold by the court to a New York-\nbased syndicate (Holm-Gerken-Schmitt-King) for $160,000 and re-incorporated as\nthe Brockville, Westport and Northwestern Railway. The line was sold to William\nMackenzie and Donald Mann from the Canadian Northern Railway in 1910, and was\neventually amalgamated into the Canadian National Railways in 1919.\n\nIn 1921, passenger service was maintained by a 20-passenger Reo gasoline-powered\nrailcar. The line was abandoned from Lyn Junction to Brockville in 1922, and\nfrom Lyn Junction to the Phillips Cables plant in 1925.\n\nAn application to abandon the line from Lyn Junction to Westport was filed with\nthe Board of Transport Commissioners in June 1951 and was approved (order number\n#49236) in 1952. Service ended on the line August 30, 1952 and was scrapped in\nlate 1952 into the summer of 1953.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","recorded":1375061452,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Help:Template","/wiki/Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2013_July_27#Template:Infobox_rail","/wiki/Reporting_mark","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Track_gauge","/wiki/Standard_gauge","/wiki/Railway_electrification_system","/wiki/Brockville,_Ontario","/wiki/Westport,_Ontario","/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway","/wiki/William_Mackenzie_(railway_entrepreneur)","/wiki/Donald_Mann","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/wiki/Reo","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Phillips_Cables","/wiki/Board_of_Transport_Commissioners","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit&section=2","http://www.railwaychronicles.com/Brockville&WestportRailway.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&oldid=561876845","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Ontario_railways","/wiki/Category:Predecessors_of_the_Canadian_National_Railway","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brockville%2C+Westport+and+North-Western+Railway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brockville%2C+Westport+and+North-Western+Railway","/wiki/Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","/wiki/Talk:Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","#","/wiki/Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&oldid=561876845","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4972878","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Brockville%2C_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&id=561876845","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Brockville%2C+Westport+and+North-Western+Railway","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Brockville%2C+Westport+and+North-Western+Railway&oldid=561876845&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Brockville,_Westport_and_North-Western_Railway&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4972878#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki
