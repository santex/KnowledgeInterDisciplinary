It is about equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth at\nsea level, and since 1982 the IUPAC has recommended that the standard for\natmospheric pressure should be harmonized to 100,000 Pa = 1 bar â\n750.0616827 Torr. The same definition is used in the compressor\nand the pneumatic tool industries (ISO 2787).\n\nThe bar and the millibar were introduced by the British meteorologist William\nNapier Shaw in 1909, while he was the director of the Meteorological Office in\nLondon. [http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/Cambridge/entries/061/Sir-William-\nNapier-Shaw.html Sir William Napier Shaw]\n\nUnits derived from the bar are the 'megabar' (symbol: 'Mbar'), 'kilobar'\n(symbol: 'kbar'), 'decibar' (symbol: 'dbar'), 'centibar' (symbol: 'cbar'), and\n'millibar' (symbol: 'mbar' or 'mb'). They are not SI or cgs units, but they are\naccepted for use with the SI. . The bar is legally recognized in\ncountries of the European Union.
