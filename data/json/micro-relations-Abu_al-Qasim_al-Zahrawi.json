He is\nconsidered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the Islamic\nWorld, and has been described by many as the father of modern surgery. His greatest contribution to medicine is the [[Al-Tasrif|Kitab\nal-Tasrif]], a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices. His pioneering contributions to the field of surgical\nprocedures and instruments had an enormous impact in the East and West well into\nthe modern period, where some of his discoveries are still applied in medicine\nto this day.\n\nHe was the first physician to describe an ectopic pregnancy, and the first\nphysician to identify the hereditary nature of haemophilia.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Abu_al-Qasim_al-Zahrawi","recorded":1362510678,"links":41,"instances":["islam","islam","onomastics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["936 births","1013 deaths","Medieval Arab and Moorish physicians of Spain","10th-century physicians","Physicians of medieval Islam","Anatomists"],"headings":["Biography","Works","Legacy","See also","Notes","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Albucasis.gif/220px-Albucasis.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Al-zahrawi_surgical_tools.gif/220px-Al-zahrawi_surgical_tools.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nisbat","onomastics"],["ansar","islam"],["alchemy","islam"],["sublimation","chemistry"]],"members":["ansar","alchemy","nisbat","sublimation"],"related":["Islamic_science","Islamic_Golden_Age","Sunni_Islam","Arab","Al-Andalus","Caliphate_of_Córdoba","Surgery","Abu_Muhammad_bin_Hazm","Guy_de_Chauliac","Jacques_Delechamps","Kitab_al-Tasrif","Western_world","Arab","Muslim","Physician","Al-Andalus","Surgeon","Father_of_modern_surgery","Ectopic_pregnancy","Haemophilia","Medina_Azahara","Córdoba,_Spain","Andalusia","Nisbat_(onomastics)","Medinian","Ansar_(Islam)","Abu_Muhammad_bin_Hazm","Al-Humaydī","Andalusian_people","Alchemy_(Islam)","Ibn_al-Wafid","Maslamah_Ibn_Ahmad_al-Majriti","Artephius","Al-Andalus","Al-Hakam_II","Cauterization","Surgical_instruments","Urethra","Throat","Ear","Ectopic_pregnancy","Cannulae","Wart","Dentistry","Childbirth","Doctor-patient_relationship","Latin","Gerard_of_Cremona","Europe","Middle_Ages","Europe","Obstetrics","Ambroise_Paré","Haemophilia","Migraine_surgery","Elliot_Shevel","Forceps","Surgical_instruments","Catgut","Fetus","Pharmacy","Pharmacology","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Distillation","Luisa_Arvide","Medieval_France","Guy_de_Chauliac","Renaissance","Islamic_medicine","Islamic_science","List_of_Arab_scientists_and_scholars","Islamic_Golden_Age","Islamic_scholars","Muslim_inventions","Timeline_of_historic_inventions","Avicenna"]}
