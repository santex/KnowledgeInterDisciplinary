It was inspired by Richard\nWagner's cycle of four operas [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] and features music\nfrom a popular performance conducted by Georg Solti. French comic-book artist\nPhilippe Druillet also worked on the game, providing much of the artwork.\n\nIt made a departure from the source material by binding the stories behind the\nfour parts of the cycle with a surrealist science fiction background. The main\nplot involves a being by the name of Ish, who is guided by a voice (played by\nCharlotte Rampling), and who discovers the story of the Nibelungen.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Ring_(video_game)","recorded":1362687853,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adventure games","1999 video games","Windows games","Cryo Interactive games"],"headings":["Gameplay","Story","References and differences to the original opera","Critical reaction","Sequel","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Ring_Game_Box.jpg/250px-Ring_Game_Box.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Arxel_Tribe","Cryo_Interactive","GameFAQs","Adventure_game","Single-player_video_game","Pan_European_Game_Information","Microsoft_Windows","Video_game","Personal_computer","Arxel_Tribe","Cryo_Interactive","Richard_Wagner","Georg_Solti","Philippe_Druillet","Surrealism","Science_fiction","Charlotte_Rampling","Nibelung","Alberich","Loki","Sigmund","W≈çden","Brynhildr","Valkyrie","Trade_union","Rhinemaidens","List_of_necropoleis","Valhalla","Signy","Germanic_mythology","German_language","GameSpot","IGN"]}
