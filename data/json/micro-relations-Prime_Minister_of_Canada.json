Not outlined in any constitutional\ndocument, the office exists only as per long-established convention originating\nin Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom, which stipulates that the\nmonarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister\nthe person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of\nCommons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that\nholds the largest number of seats in that chamber.\n\nThe current, and 22nd, Prime Minister of Canada is the Conservative Party's\nStephen Harper, who was appointed on February 6, 2006, by Governor General\nMichaÃ«lle Jean, following the general election that took place that year. As\nwith all other Canadian prime ministers, Harper is styled as [[The Right\nHonourable]] (), a privilege maintained for life.\n","linknr":988,"url":"Prime_Minister_of_Canada","recorded":1362559957,"links":76,"instances":["government","heraldry","canada","parliamentary","canada","manner_of_address","heraldry","canada","canada","government","canada","canada","former_city","constitutional"],"pdf":["http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf","http://www.dominion.ca/DominionInstituteDecember15Factum.pdf","http://www.dominion.ca/DominionInstituteDecember15Factum.pdf","http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2009/Autumn_2009_CMN.pdf","http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2009/Autumn_2009_CMN.pdf","http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/crnCdn/crn_mpls-eng.pdf","http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/crnCdn/crn_mpls-eng.pdf","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf","http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf","http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35225/pages/4213/page.pdf"],"categories":["Prime
