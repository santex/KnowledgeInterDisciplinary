However, roots can also be aerial or aerating\n(growing up above the ground or especially above water). Furthermore, a stem\nnormally occurring below ground is not exceptional either (see\nrhizome).Therefore, the root is best defined as the non-leaf, non-nodes bearing\nparts of the plant's body. However, important internal structural differences\nbetween stems and roots exist.\n\nThe first root that comes from a plant is called the radicle. The four major\nfunctions of roots are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2)\nanchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food\nand nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction. In response to the concentration of\nnutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how\nfast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients.\nThe roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi\nto form mycorrhizas, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria\nalso closely associate with roots.\n","title":"Root","headings":["Anatomy","Root growth","Types of roots","Rooting depths","Rooting depth records","Root architecture","Evolutionary history","Economic importance","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Sweet_potato","3: Taproot","2: Aerial_root","2: Mycorrhiza","2: Pericycle","2: Ivy","2: Monocot","2: Mangrove","2: Strangler_fig","2: Carrot","2: Beet","1: Vascular_plant","1: Plant_organ","1: Rhizome","1: Plant","1: Radicle","1: Nutrient","1: Vegetative_reproduction","1: Cytokinin","1: Fungi","1: Bacteria","1: Root_hair","1: Epiblem","1: Endodermis","1: Vascular_tissue","1: Root_cap","1: Aeration","1: Nutrients","1: Water","1: Germination","1: Gravitropism","1: Woody_plant","1: Lateral_meristem","1: Vascular_cambium","1: Cork_cambium","1: Secondary_xylem","1: Secondary_phloem","1: Periderm","1: Plant_stem","1: Lateral_roots","1: Monocots","1: Dicot","1: Clover","1: Strawberry","1: Willow","1: Epiphyte","1: Orchid","1: Maize","1: Lily","1: Dandelion","1: Mistletoe","1: Dodder","1: Basal_shoot","1: Canada_thistle","1: Cherry","1: Phosphate","1: Iron","1: Proteaceae","1: Betulaceae","1: Casuarinaceae","1: Elaeagnaceae","1: Moraceae","1: Fabaceae","1: Myricaceae","1: Maple","1: Root_crop","1: Potato","1: Cassava","1: Rutabaga","1: Turnip","1: Parsnip","1: Radish","1: Horseradish","1: Sassafras","1: Angelica","1: Smilax_regelii","1: Licorice","1: Sugar_beet","1: Rotenone","1: Ginseng","1: Aconitum","1: Syrup_of_ipecac","1: Gentian","1: Reserpine","1: Bald_cypress","1: White_spruce","1: Tree","1: Maya_architecture","1: Temple","1: Central_America","1: Angkor_Wat","1: Cambodia","1: Landslides","1: Vegetative_propagation","1: Chrysanthemum","1: Poinsettia","1: Carnation","1: Shrub","1: Houseplants","1: Sand_dunes","1: Cypress_knee","1: Drought_rhizogenesis","1: Fibrous_root_system","1: Plant_physiology","1: Rhizosphere","1: Root_cutting","1: Auxin","1: Stolon"]}
