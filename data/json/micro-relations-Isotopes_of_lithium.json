{"cursor":"17199","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Naturally occurring '[[lithium]]' (chemical symbol 'Li') (standard atomic mass:\n6.941(2) atomic mass units, a.m.u.) is composed of two stable isotopes, lithium-\n6 and lithium-7, with the latter being by far the more abundant one: about 92.5\npercent of the atoms. Both of the natural isotopes have an unexpectedly low\nnuclear binding energy per nucleon when compared with the adjacent lighter and\nheavier elements, helium and beryllium. This means that solely among the stable\nlight elements, lithium can release energy through nuclear fission. The most\nstable radioisotope of lithium is lithium-8, which has a half-life of just 838\nmilliseconds. Lithium-9 has a half-life of 178 milliseconds, and lithium-11 has\na half-life of about 8.6 milliseconds. All of the remaining isotopes of lithium\nhave half-lives that are smaller than 10 nanoseconds. The shortest-lived known\nisotope of lithium is lithium-4 which decays by proton emission with a half-life\nof about 7.6x10 â23 seconds.\n\nLithium-7 and lithium-6 are two of the primordial nuclides that were produced in\nthe Big Bang. A small percentage of lithium-6 is also known to produced by\nnuclear reactions in certain stars. The isotopes of lithium separate somewhat\nduring a variety of geological processes, including mineral formation (chemical\nprecipitation and ion exchange). Lithium ions replace magnesium or iron in\ncertain octahedral locations in clays, and lithium-6 is sometimes preferred over\nlithium-7. This results in some enrichment of lithium-7 in geological processes.\n\nLithium-6 is an important isotope in nuclear physics because when it is\nbombarded with neutrons, tritium (heavy, heavy hydrogen) is produced.\n","linknr":403,"url":"Isotopes_of_lithium","recorded":1362375520,"links":30,"instances":["element","physics","unit"],"pdf":["http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2002/pdf/7410x1987.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf","http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf"],"categories":["Lithium","Isotopes of lithium|","Lists of isotopes by element|Lithium"],"headings":["Isotopes","Lithium-4","Lithium-6","Lithium-7","Lithium-11","Table","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"],["barn","unit"]],"members":["mercury","spin","barn"],"related":["Atomic_mass_unit","Stable_isotope","Lithium-6","Lithium-7","Atom","Isotope","Nuclear_binding_energy","Nucleon","Helium","Beryllium","Energy","Nuclear_fission","Radioisotope","Half-life","Millisecond","Nanosecond","Proton_emission","Primordial_nuclide","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Nuclear_reaction","Geology","Ion_exchange","Magnesium","Iron","Octahedron","Clay","Nuclear_physics","Neutron","Tritium","Hydrogen","Chemical_element","Mercury_(element)","Lithium_hydroxide","Raw_material","Celsius","Vacuum","Proton","Neutron","Proton_emission","Helium-3","Nuclear_fusion","Tritium","Hydrogen-3","Neutron","Nuclear_fusion","Hydrogen_bomb","Thermonuclear","Fermion","Electron","Spin_(physics)","Boson","Boson","Spin_(physics)","Integer","Helium","Beryllium","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Atomic_nucleus","Lithium-7","Pennsylvania","Atomic_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Atomic_mass","Lithium_fluoride","Molten_salt_reactor","Fluoride","Nuclear_reactors","Neutron_cross_section","Barn_(unit)","Neutron_cross-section","Millibarn","Lithium_hydroxide","Pressurized_water_reactor","Lambda_baryon","Atomic_nucleus","Atomic_nucleus","Neutron","Proton","Pion","Halo_nucleus","Proton_emission","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Beta_decay","Neutron_emission","Halo_nucleus","Beryllium-10","Tritium","Atomic_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Standard_deviation","Nuclear_halo","Neutron"]}
