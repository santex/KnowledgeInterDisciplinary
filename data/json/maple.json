Modern\nclassifications, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system, favour\ninclusion in Sapindaceae. The type species of the genus is [[Acer\npseudoplatanus]] (Sycamore maple).<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C. J. & van\nGelderen, D. M. (1999). Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 128 species, most of which are native to\nAsia,<ref></ref> with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and\nNorth America. Only one species, the poorly studied [[Acer laurinum]], is native\nto the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"The Red List of Maples\">Gibbs, D. & Chen,\nY.

It was first applied\nto the genus by the French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1700. The\nearliest known fossil maple is [[Acer alaskense]], from the Latest Paleocene\nof Alaska.\n","title":"maple","headings":["Morphology","Pests and diseases","Cultural significance","Uses","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Sapindaceae","2: Aceraceae","2: Tree","2: Shrub","2: North_America","2: Maple_leaf","2: Leaf_shape","2: Pollen","1: Plantae","1: Angiosperms","1: Eudicots","1: Rosids","1: Sapindales","1: Hippocastanoideae","1: Carolus_Linnaeus","1: List_of_Acer_species","1: Genus","1: Hippocastanaceae","1: Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group","1: Type_species","1: Species","1: Asia","1: Europe","1: Africa","1: International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","1: Latin_language","1: French_people","1: Joseph_Pitton_de_Tournefort","1: Late_Paleocene","1: Deciduous","1: Mediterranean_region","1: Evergreen","1: Shade_tolerance","1: Root","1: Root_sprout","1: Clonal_colony","1: Leaf","1: Flower","1: Raceme","1: Corymb","1: Umbels","1: Sepal","1: Petal","1: Stamen","1: Pistil","1: Carpel","1: Winter","1: Bee","1: Computed_tomography","1: Voxel","1: Fruit","1: Seed","1: Biological_dispersal","1: Germination","1: Acer_pseudoplatanus","1: Larva","1: Lepidoptera","1: List_of_Lepidoptera_that_feed_on_maples","1: Aphid","1: Asian_Longhorned_Beetle","1: Fungus","1: Drought","1: Root_rot","1: Mildew","1: Canada","1: Canadian_flag","1: Canadian_Forces","1: Ornamental_tree","1: Invasive_species","1: Cultivar","1: Plant_propagation","1: Asexual_reproduction","1: Tissue_culture","1: Grafting","1: Western_world","1: Bonsai","1: Japanese_maple","1: Trident_maple","1: Amur_maple","1: Field_maple","1: Montpellier_maple","1: Arboretum","1: England","1: Wakehurst_Place_Garden","1: Westonbirt_Arboretum","1: Windsor_Great_Park","1: Winkworth_Arboretum","1: Wisley_Garden","1: United_States","1: Harvard_University","1: Arnold_Arboretum","1: Boston,_Massachusetts","1: Esveld_Aceretum","1: Boskoop","1: Autumn_foliage","1: Japan","1: Momijigari","1: Nikko,_Tochigi","1: Kyoto","1: Seoraksan","1: Naejang-san","1: Leaf_peeping","1: Central_Ontario","1: Quebec","1: Vermont","1: New_Hampshire","1: Western_Massachusetts","1: Lincoln_County_Process","1: Tennessee_Whiskey","1: Ornamental_plant","1: Tourism","1: Agriculture","1: Sugar_maple","1: Maple_syrup","1: Maple_sugar","1: Maple_taffy","1: Timber","1: Bowling","1: Cue_stick","1: Butcher_block","1: Baseball_bat","1: Hickory","1: Recurve_bow","1: Wood_grain","1: Flame_maple","1: Quilt_maple","1: Birdseye_maple","1: Burl","1: Tonewood","1: Musical_instrument","1: Mahogany","1: Violins","1: Violas","1: Cellos","1: Double_bass","1: Electric_guitar","1: Stratocaster","1: Telecaster","1: Rosewood","1: Gibson_Guitar_Corporation","1: Les_Paul","1: Solid_body","1: Bassoon","1: Woodwind_instrument","1: Drum","1: Birch","1: Honeybee","1: Pulpwood","1: Paper","1: Autumn"]}
