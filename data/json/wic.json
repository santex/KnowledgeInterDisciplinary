(See Child nutrition programs.) The eligibility\nrequirement is a family income below 185% of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines.\nIf a person participates in other benefit programs, or has family members who\nparticipate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, or\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, they automatically meet the eligibility\nrequirements. This program is unrelated to the USDA's Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program. Currently, WIC serves 53 percent of all infants born in the\nUnited States.<ref></ref>\n","title":"WIC","headings":["History","Eligibility","WIC Services","Nutrition education and anemia screening","Check/Voucher & EBT card","Items provided","Responsibilities of recipients","Literature review","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Federal_assistance","1: Food_and_Nutrition_Service","1: United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","1: Child_nutrition_programs","1: Federal_poverty_level","1: Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families","1: Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program","1: Point-of-sale","1: MICR","1: Texas","1: Nevada","1: Whole_wheat_bread"]}
