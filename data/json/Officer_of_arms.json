{"cursor":"5685","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s of several officers of arms at the College of Arms in London.]] An 'officer of\narms' is a person appointed by a sovereign or state with authority to perform\none or more of the following functions: *to control and initiate armorial\nmatters *to arrange and participate in ceremonies of state *to conserve and\ninterpret heraldic and genealogical records.\n\nTraditionally, officers of arms are of three ranks: kings of arms, heralds of\narms, and pursuivants of arms. Officers of arms whose appointments are of a\npermanent nature are known as officers of arms in ordinary; those whose\nappointments are of a temporary or occasional nature are known as officers of\narms extraordinary.\n\nThe medieval practice of appointing heralds or pursuivants to the establishment\nof a noble household is still common in European countries, particularly those\nin which there is no official heraldic control or authority. Such appointments\nare also still made in Scotland, where four private officers of arms exist.\nThese appointments are all purely advisory.\n\nIn England, the authority of the thirteen officers of arms in ordinary who form\nthe corporation of the Kings, Heralds, and Pursuivants of Arms extends\nthroughout the Commonwealth, with the exception of Scotland, Canada and South\nAfrica. In Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and the Lyon Clerk and Keeper\nof the Records control matters armorial within a strict legal framework not\nenjoyed by their fellow officers of arms in London, and the court which is a\npart of Scotland's criminal jurisdiction has its own prosecutor, the court's\nProcurator Fiscal, who is however not an officer of arms . Lord Lyon and the\nLyon Clerk are appointed by the crown, and, with the Crown's authority, Lyon\nappoints the other Scottish officers. The officers of arms in ordinary who form\nthe College of Arms in England are members of the royal household and receive a\nnominal salary. The officers of arms in Scotland are also members of the royal\nhousehold.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, matters armorial and genealogical come within the\nauthority of an officer designated the Chief Herald of Ireland. The legal basis\nfor Ireland's heraldic authority, and therefore all grants since 1943, has been\nquestioned by the Attorney General\n[http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/armscrisis.htm], therefore, on\nMay 8, 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy & Heraldry Bill, 2006,\n[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf] in\nSeanad Ãireann (Irish Senate) to remedy this situation and legitimise actions\nsince the transfer of power from the Ulster King of Arms.\n\nIn the Netherlands, officers of arms do not exist as permanent functions.\nPrivate heraldry is not legislated, and state heraldry and the heraldry of the\nnobility is regulated by the High Council of Nobility. During the royal\ninauguration ceremony however, two Kings of Arms and two or four Heralds of Arms\nhave figured. These were usually members of the High Council of Nobility. During\nthe inaugurations of Wilhelmina and Juliana, the Kings of Arms wore nineteenth-\ncentury style court dress, whereas the Heralds wore tabards. All officers\ncarried rods and wore chains of\noffice. http://www.ambtskostuums.nl/ambtskostuums/adel/wapenen.htm In\nthe inauguration of Queen Beatrix in 1980, the ceremonial office was held by\nmembers of the resistance, Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema being the elder King of\nArms. A.J.P.H. van Cruyningen, De inhuldiging van de Nederlandse vorst. Van\nWillem Frederik tot Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard (unpublished thesis, Katholieke\nUniversiteit Nijmegen, 1989) 92. Like most other participants in the\npageant the officers of arms were no longer wearing ceremonial dress, but white\ntie instead. The senior King of Arms proclaims the King to be inaugurated after\nhe or she has sworn allegiance to the constitution. The Heralds step outside the\nNew Church in Amsterdam, where the inauguration ceremony is held, to announce\nthis fact to the people gathered outside the church.

Cruyningen,\npassim.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Officer_of_arms","recorded":1374762934,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:BadgesofHeraldsandPursuivants.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/BadgesofHeraldsandPursuivants.jpg/220px-BadgesofHeraldsandPursuivants.jpg","/wiki/File:BadgesofHeraldsandPursuivants.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Heraldic_badge","/wiki/College_of_Arms","/wiki/London","/wiki/Sovereignty","/wiki/Sovereign_state","/wiki/Armory_(heraldry)","/wiki/Heraldry","/wiki/Genealogical","/wiki/King_of_Arms","/wiki/Herald","/wiki/Pursuivant","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Private_Officer_of_Arms","/wiki/England","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/South_Africa","/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms","/wiki/College_of_Arms","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Chief_Herald_of_Ireland","http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/chiefs/armscrisis.htm","http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf","/wiki/Ulster_King_of_Arms","/wiki/Netherlands","/w/index.php?title=High_Council_of_Nobility&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wilhelmina_of_the_Netherlands","/wiki/Juliana_of_the_Netherlands","/wiki/Court_dress","/wiki/Tabard","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Queen_Beatrix","/wiki/Dutch_resistance","/wiki/Erik_Hazelhoff_Roelfzema","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Ceremonial_dress","/wiki/White_tie","/wiki/Nieuwe_Kerk_(Amsterdam)","/wiki/Amsterdam","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Officers_of_arms","/wiki/Heraldry","/wiki/King_of_Arms","/wiki/Herald","/wiki/Pursuivant","/wiki/Private_Officer_of_Arms","/wiki/College_of_Arms","/wiki/Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon","/wiki/Canadian_Heraldic_Authority","/wiki/Chief_Herald_of_Ireland","/wiki/Flemish_Heraldic_Council","/wiki/Hofpfalzgraf","/wiki/Cronista_Rey_de_Armas","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.ambtskostuums.nl/ambtskostuums/adel/wapenen.htm","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Katholieke_Universiteit_Nijmegen","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit&section=3","http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk","http://www.lyon-court.com","http://www.nli.ie/en/heraldry-introduction.aspx","http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/index_e.asp","http://www.heraldik.se/artiklar/riks1.html","/wiki/Template:Heraldry","/wiki/Template_talk:Heraldry","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Heraldry&action=edit","/wiki/Heraldry","/wiki/Achievement_(heraldry)","/wiki/Blazon","/wiki/Coat_of_arms","/wiki/Cadency","/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)","/wiki/Compartment_(heraldry)","/wiki/Helmet_(heraldry)","/wiki/Mantling","/wiki/Quartering_(heraldry)","/wiki/Impalement_(heraldry)","/wiki/Escutcheon_(heraldry)","/wiki/Supporter","/wiki/Attributed_arms","/wiki/Heraldic_badge","/wiki/Canting_arms","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_heraldry","/wiki/Heraldic_flag","/wiki/Vexillology","/wiki/File:Herb_Szablon_1.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Herb_Szablon_1.PNG/22px-Herb_Szablon_1.PNG","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&oldid=546967816","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Heraldry","/wiki/Category:Positions_of_authority","/wiki/Category:Officers_of_arms","/wiki/Category:Legal_professions","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Officer+of+arms&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Officer+of+arms","/wiki/Officer_of_arms","/wiki/Talk:Officer_of_arms","#","/wiki/Officer_of_arms","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Officer_of_arms&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wi
