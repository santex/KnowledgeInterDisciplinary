In contemporary vessels, they may be gyroscopically controlled active\nfins, which have the capacity to change their angle of attack to counteract roll\ncaused by wind or waves acting on the ship.\n\nThe bilge keel is an early 20th century predecessor. Although not as effective\nat reducing roll, bilge keels are cheaper, easier to install, and do not require\ndedicated internal space inside the hull.\n\nIn November 1932 the ship Conte di Savoia made its maiden voyage. It had three\nhuge gyroscopes fitted low down in a forward hold. These rotated at high\nrevolutions and were designed to eliminate rolling - a persistent problem on the\nrough North Atlantic crossing that affected all shipping lines. Each of the\nthree flywheels was 13 feet in diameter and weighed 108 tons.\n\nThe first mention of automatic stabilizers for ships was in 1932, by an engineer\nworking for General Electric.

The top of the tubes had\ncompressed air or steam pumped in. As the ship rolled the side it was rolling to\nwould fill with water and then compressed air or steam would be injected to push\nthe water down countering the roll.
