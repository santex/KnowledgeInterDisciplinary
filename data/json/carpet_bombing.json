      "text" : ", German bombers set the entire inner city of ablaze, killing 814 of its\ninhabitants]] was 97% destroyed before it was finally taken by Allied\ntroops in 1945]]\n\n'Carpet bombing', also known as 'saturation bombing', is a large aerial bombing\ndone in a progressive manner to inflict damage in every part of a selected area\nof land.<ref></ref> The phrase evokes the image of explosions completely\ncovering an area, in the same way that a carpet covers a floor. Carpet bombing\nis usually achieved by dropping many unguided bombs. In contrast to precision\nbombing, it is not aimed at a small target, such as a bunker, an airfield, or a\nmilitary unit. One of its uses is the aerial bombing of cities.\n\nThe term obliteration bombing is sometimes used to describe especially\nintensified bombing with the intention of destroying a city or a large part of\nthe city. The term [[area bombing]] refers to indiscriminate bombing of an area,\nand also encompasses cases of carpet bombing, including obliteration bombing. It\nwas used in that sense especially during World War II.\n",
