{"cursor":"2083","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET)' is a field-effect transistor which uses\nthe field-effect due to the partial charges of DNA molecules to function as a\nbiosensor. The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs with the\nexception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of\nimmobilized ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) molecules which act as surface\nreceptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge\ndistribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport\nthrough the semiconductor transducer.\n\nArrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing. Their main advantage\ncompared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not\nrequire labeling of molecules. Furthermore they work continuously and (near) real-\ntime. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge\ntransport.\n","linknr":96,"url":"DNA_field-effect_transistor","recorded":1362510032,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Field-effect_transistor","DNA","Biosensor","DNA","Transducer","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","DNA_sequencing"]}
