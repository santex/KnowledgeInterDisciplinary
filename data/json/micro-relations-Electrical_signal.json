In the physical\nworld, any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space (such as\nan image) is potentially a signal that might provide information on the status\nof a physical system, or convey a message between observers, among other\npossibilities. The IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing\nelaborates upon the term \"signal\" as follows:\n\n\nA signal is a physical quantity which varies with respect to time,space &\ncontain information from source to destination.\n\nOther examples of signals are the output of a thermocouple, which conveys\ntemperature information, and the output of a pH meter which conveys acidity\ninformation. Typically, signals are often provided by a\nsensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of\nenergy using a transducer. For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal\nto a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.\n\nThe formal study of the information content of signals is the field of\ninformation theory. The information in a signal is usually accompanied by noise.\nThe term noise usually means an undesirable random disturbance, but is often\nextended to include unwanted signals conflicting with the desired signal (such\nas crosstalk). The prevention of noise is covered in part under the heading of\nsignal integrity. The separation of desired signals from a background is the\nfield of signal recovery, one branch of which is\nestimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.\n\nEngineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the\ndesign, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage,\nand manipulation of information. In the latter half of the 20th century,\nelectrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising\nin the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals;\nelectronic engineering and computer engineering as examples; while design\nengineering developed to deal with functional design of manâmachine interfaces.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Electrical_signal","recorded":1362560397,"links":51,"instances":["radio","signal_processing","biology","signal_processing","telecommunications","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering concepts","Digital signal processing","Signal processing","Telecommunication theory"],"headings":["Signal processing","Some definitions","Discrete-time and continuous-time signals","Analog and digital signals","Examples of signals","Entropy","See also","References","General references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Signal_processing_system.png/400px-Signal_processing_system.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Sampled.signal.svg/220px-Sampled.signal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Digital.signal.svg/220px-Digital.signal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["noise","electronics"],["receiver","radio"],["signalling","telecommunications"],["sampling","signal_processing"],["sampling","signal_processing"],["quantization","signal_processing"],["sampling","signal_processing"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["receiver","quantization","cell","sampling","signalling","noise"],"related":["Communication_systems","Signal_processing","Electrical_engineering","Information","Message","Thermocouple","PH_meter","Sensor","Transducer","Microphone","Voltage","Loudspeaker","Information_theory","Noise_(electronics)","Crosstalk","Signal_integrity","Detection_theory","Estimation_theory","Electrical_engineering","Data_transmission","Data_storage_device","Information_processor","Electrical_engineering","Electronic_engineering","Computer_engineering","Industrial_design","User_interface","Signal_processing","Transducer","Waveform","Electric_current","Voltage","Electromagnetic_radiation","Free-space_optical_communication","Radio_transmission","Amplifier","Electronic_filters","Transmitter","Receiver_(radio)","Information_theory","Signal_processing","Mary_had_a_little_lamb","Telephone","Volt","Signalling_(telecommunications)","Common-channel_signaling","Discrete-time_signal","Continuous-time_signal","Continuous_function","Digital_signals","Digital_modulation","Discrete-time_signal","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Real_numbers","Complex_numbers","Mathematical_function","Continuous_time","Discrete_time","Integer","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Analog-to-digital_converter","Microseconds","Computer","Digital","Finite_set","Quantization_(signal_processing)","Sensor","Radar","Gyroscope","Oscillation","Pressure","Microphone","Voltage","Sampling_(signal_processing)","Compact_disc","Second","Stereophonic_sound","Laser","Charge-coupled_device","Raster_scanning","Digital_image","Primary_colors","Scan_line","Electric_potential","Cell_(biology)","Organelle","Neuron","Electrophysiology","Information_entropy","Impulse_function","Signal_noise","Signal_to_noise_ratio","Signal_processing","Digital_signal_processing","Image_processing","Digital_image_processing","Claude_Shannon"]}
