{"cursor":"3641","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Field Hill' is a steep portion of the mainline of the\nCanadian Pacific Railway located near Field, British Columbia. Field was created\nsolely to accommodate the Canadian Pacific Railway's need for additional\nlocomotives to be added to trains about to tackle both Field Hill, and the Big\nHill. Here a stone roundhouse with turntable was built at what was first known\nsimply as Third Siding. In December 1884 the CPR renamed it Field after Cyrus W.\nField, a Chicago businessman who had visited recently on a special train.\n\nDifficult grades exist in both directions from Field, east through spiral\ntunnels to Calgary, Alberta; and west to Revelstoke, British Columbia, through\nRogers Pass and the Connaught Tunnel, and where the modern Mount Macdonald\nTunnel was opened in 1989.\n\nFollowing completion of the Spiral Tunnels which eliminated the Big Hill, Field\nremained an important place as it was still necessary to add helper (bank)\nengines to get trains over the steep 2.2% (116 feet to the mile, or 22 metres to\nthe kilometre) grade of Field Hill.\n\nEven bigger locomotives were needed and this time six massive 0-6-6-0 Mallet\ntype (see: Whyte notation) were built (one in 1909 and five in 1911). Five\nwere compound engines, the last one a simple engine). These were of a unique\ndesign with both pairs of cylinders together at the middle of the boiler. The\ndesign was not repeated and eventually these engines were rebuilt (1916â17)\ninto 2-10-0s.\n\nMore powerful still were the fourteen 2-10-2s built (1919â20) for work on the\nmountain. These were followed in 1929 by the most powerful steam locomotives in\nthe British Empire, twenty 2-10-4 Selkirks. A further ten were built in 1938 and\na final six in 1949, the last one being 5935, the last steam locomotive built\nfor the CPR.\n\nDiesel-electric locomotives followed, and over the decades bigger and more\npowerful diesels replaced smaller ones just as was the case with the steam\nlocomotives that had preceded them.\n\nEven though the Spiral Tunnels eliminated the Big Hill, the mountains remained\nand so too did the Field Hill. The Ottertail revision of 1902 and the five-\nmile () long double track Connaught Tunnel of 1916 were other improvements\nmade to the original line in British Columbia. It was not until the late 20th\ncentury when a major new project of including the Mount Macdonald Tunnel\nreduced the grade to a very manageable average of 0.82%, (maximum 1%) opened\nin December 1988.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Field_Hill","recorded":1374759734,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Field,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Big_Hill","/wiki/Cyrus_West_Field","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/Spiral_(railway)","/wiki/Revelstoke,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Rogers_Pass_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/Connaught_Tunnel","/wiki/Mount_Macdonald_Tunnel","/wiki/Bank_engine","/wiki/Whyte_notation","/wiki/2-10-0","/wiki/2-10-2","/wiki/2-10-4","/wiki/Selkirk_locomotive","/wiki/Diesel-electric","/wiki/Mount_Macdonald_Tunnel","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Pierre_Berton","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0025676601","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0919130224","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0919203515","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0919487149","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Field_Hill&params=51.43_N_-116.40_E_","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&oldid=555543131","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Landforms_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Category:History_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Category:Canadian_Pacific_Railway_facilities","/wiki/Category:Rail_infrastructure_in_British_Columbia","/wiki/Category:Hills_of_British_Columbia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Field+Hill&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Field+Hill","/wiki/Field_Hill","/wiki/Talk:Field_Hill","#","/wiki/Field_Hill","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Field_Hill","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Field_Hill","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&oldid=555543131","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5446913","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Field_Hill&id=555543131","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Field+Hill","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Field+Hill&oldid=555543131&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Field_Hill&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5446913#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Hill","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["railway","british_columbia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landforms
