A writer of belles-lettres is a . However, the boundaries\nof that category vary in different usages.\n\nLiterally, belles-lettres is a French phrase meaning \"beautiful\" or \"fine\"\nwriting. In this sense, therefore, it includes all literary works —\nespecially fiction, poetry, drama, or essays — valued for their aesthetic\nqualities and originality of style and tone. The term thus can be used to refer\nto literature generally. The [[Nuttall Encyclopedia]], for example, described\nbelles-lettres as the \"department of literature which implies literary culture\nand belongs to the domain of art, whatever the subject may be or the special\nform; it includes poetry, the drama, fiction, and criticism,\" while the\n[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] describes it as \"the more artistic\nand imaginative forms of literature, as poetry or romance, as opposed to more\npedestrian and exact studies.\"\n\nHowever, for many modern purposes, belles lettres is used in a narrower sense to\nidentify literary works that do not fall into other major categories, such as\nfiction, poetry or drama. Thus, it would include essays, [[rÃ©cit]]s, published\ncollections of speeches and letters, satirical and humorous writings, and other\nmiscellaneous works. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2nd Edition) says that\n\"it is now generally applied (when used at all) to the lighter branches of\nliterature.\" The term remains in use among librarians and others who have to\nclassify books: while a large library might have separate categories for essays,\nletters, humor and so forth (and most of them are assigned different codes in,\nfor example, the Dewey decimal classification system), in libraries of modest\nsize they are often all grouped together under the heading belles lettres.\n\nThe phrase is sometimes used in a derogatory manner when speaking about the\nstudy of literature: those who study rhetoric often deride many language\ndepartments (particularly English departments in the English-speaking world) for\nfocusing on the aesthetic qualities of language rather than its practical\napplication. A quote from Brian Sutton's article in Language and Learning Across\nthe Disciplines, \"Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the\nResearch Paper\", serves to illustrate the rhetoricians' opinion on this subject\nand their use of the term:\n\nWriting-in-the-disciplines adherents, well aware of the wide range\nof academic genres a first-year composition student may have to deal with in the\nfuture, are unlikely to force those students to venture so deeply into any one\ngenre as to require slavish imitation. The only first-year composition teachers\nlikely to demand âconformity and submissionâ to a particular kind of academic\ndiscourse are those English-department fixtures, the evangelical disciples of\nliterature, professors whose goal in first-year composition is to teach students\nto explicate belles lettres. Writing-in-the-disciplines adherents, unlike\nteachers of literature-as-composition, generally recognize the folly of forcing\nstudents to conform to the conventions of a discourse community they have no\ndesire to join.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Belles-lettres","recorded":1362669470,"links":33,"instances":["language","literature","message","fiction","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Literary genres"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["french","language"],["style","fiction"],["tone","literature"],["letter","message"],["arts_and_letters","disambiguation"]],"members":["french","tone","letter","style","arts_and_letters"],"related":["French_(language)","Fiction","Poetry","Drama","Essay","Artistic_merit","Style_(fiction)","Tone_(literature)","Literature","Essay","Speeches","Letter_(message)","Satire","Humour","Dewey_decimal_system","Rhetoric","Arts_and_letters_(disambiguation)"]}
