{"cursor":"58648","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn genetics, a 'mutation' is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome\nof an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal genetic element. Mutations result\nfrom unrepaired damage to DNA or to RNA genomes (typically caused by radiation\nor chemical mutagens), from errors in the process of replication, or from the\ninsertion or deletion of segments of DNA by mobile genetic elements.\nMutations may or may not produce discernable changes in the observable\ncharacteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal\nand abnormal biological processes, including evolution, cancer, and the\ndevelopment of the immune system.\n\nMutation can result in several different types of change in sequences; these can\neither have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from\nfunctioning properly or completely. One study on genetic variations between\ndifferent species of [[Drosophila]] suggests that if a mutation changes a\nprotein produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an\nestimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and\nthe remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on\ngenes, organisms have mechanisms such as DNA repair to prevent mutations.\n","linknr":1145,"url":"Mutations","recorded":1362484149,"links":96,"instances":["naturally_occurring","biology","genetics","chemistry","biologist","engineering","genetics","human","genetics","biology","biology","evolution","molecular_biology","biology","letter","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/EWNRG07.pdf","http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/EWNRG07.pdf"],"categories":["Mutation|","Evolutionary
