For the use of the term in the sphere of disabilities see\n::Inclusion (disability rights).\n\n'Inclusion' is an organizational practice and goal stemming from the\nsociological notion of 'inclusiveness' which is the political action and\npersonal effort but at the same time the presence of inclusion practices in\nwhich different groups or individuals having different backgrounds like origin,\nage, race and ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation and identity and\nother are culturally and socially accepted and welcomed, equally treated, etc.\n\nMiller and Katz (2002) presents a common definition of an 'inclusive value\nsystem' where they say, âInclusion is a sense of belonging: feeling respected,\nvalued for who you are; feeling a level of supportive energy and commitment from\nothers so than you can do your best work.â Miller, Frederick A. and Katz,\nJudith H. 2002. The Inclusion Breakthrough: Unleashing the Real Power of\nDiversity. San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers Inclusion is a shift\nin organization culture. The process of inclusion engages each individual and\nmakes people feeling valued essential to the success of the organization.\nIndividuals function at full capacity, feel more valued, and included in the\norganizationâs mission. This culture shift creates higher performing\norganizations where motivation and morale soar.\n\nGasorek (1998) notes her success of instituting diversity and inclusion\ninitiatives at Dun & Bradstreet, a credit-reporting firm.

John Wiley & Sons\n\nRoberson (2006) notes that the term inclusion is often coupled with the term\ndiversity and these terms are often used interchangeably, however they are\ndistinctly different. Roberson, Quinetta M. 2006. âDisentangling the\nMeanings of Diversity and Inclusion in Organizations.â Group & Organization\nManagement 31/2:212-236 The Institute for Inclusion, a nonprofit\norganization, has collectively attempted to define inclusion apart from\ndiversity. It has developed a set of core values and general principles and\nconceives of inclusion as requiring a paradigm shift in human consciousness,\nawareness, and interaction.\n\nInteractional participation skills are not currently standardized in formal\nevaluations of communicative competence, and there will probably be much\ncontroversy surrounding any proposals to standardize the testing of\ninteractional competence. Nonetheless, we need some set of 'inclusion\nguidelines' to decide what skills to look for and how to document them. (page\n116, Sawzin, 1984)\n\nThis study focused on the aspects of Jennie that can be appreciated. \"Positive\nanalysis\" is a strategy which has much utility in many contexts, but is very\nmuch needed in the lives of children and adults with developmental difficulties.\nThere are many opportunities for parents, professionals and neighbors to\nminimize their fears, and to move from expectations of deviance to acceptances\nof difference.
