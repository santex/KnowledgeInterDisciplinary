The collimator images\nthe reticle pattern at infinity, and the mirror superimposes this image over the\ntarget area. The collimator's pupil is so large that the eye can be positioned\nat any point within a large cylindrical volume in back of the sight. The\ncollimating system may employ a simple spherical mirror, a Schmidt lens, or a\nMangin mirror.â] These sights work on the simple optical principle that\nanything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated\nreticle) will look like it is sitting in front of the viewer at infinity.\nReflector sights employ some sort of \"reflector\" to allow the viewer to see the\ninfinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the\nimage created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear\ncurved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through\nthe reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the\ndevice the sight is attached to regardless of the viewers eye position, removing\nmost of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.\n\nSince their invention in 1900, reflector sights have come to be used as gun\nsights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited\ncapacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base\ncomponent in many types of modern head-up display. They have been used in other\ntypes of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti\ntank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving\ntargets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with\nsufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight\non small arms after World War II but it came into wide spread use after the late\n70s with the invention of the \"red dot\" type of sight, with a red light-emitting\ndiode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and\nextremely long illumination run time.\n\nReflector sights are also used in civilian applications such as sights on\nsurveying equipment, optical telescope pointing aids, and camera viewfinders.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Reflector_sight","recorded":1362574443,"links":33,"instances":["electricity","device","waves","insignia","military","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Firearm sights","Optical devices"],"headings":["Overview","History","Weapon sights","Other uses","Similar types","Further reading","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Mark_III_free_gun_reflector_sight_mk_9_variant_reflex_sight_animation.gif/250px-Mark_III_free_gun_reflector_sight_mk_9_variant_reflex_sight_animation.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Reflector_reflex_sight_diagram_3.png/250px-Reflector_reflex_sight_diagram_3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Reflector_reflex_sight_howard_grubb_1901.png/400px-Reflector_reflex_sight_howard_grubb_1901.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-584-2165-12%2C_Frankreich%2C_Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger_an_Gesch%C3%BCtz.jpg/175px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-584-2165-12%2C_Frankreich%2C_Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger_an_Gesch%C3%BCtz.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Revi_C12-A.jpg/220px-Revi_C12-A.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/HUD_view.jpg/200px-HUD_view.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/INDIA5.jpg/220px-INDIA5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Tasco_PDP2.jpg/175px-Tasco_PDP2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/PS90_sky.jpg/175px-PS90_sky.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Telrad_hinten.jpg/220px-Telrad_hinten.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sight","device#simple_sights"],["sight","device"],["deflection","military"],["solid_state","electronics"],["battery","electricity"],["chevron","insignia"],["polarization","waves"]],"members":["battery","sight","polarization","chevron","deflection","solid_state"],"related":["Magnification","Field_of_view","Reticle","Parallax","Sight_(device)","Fighter_aircraft","World_War_I","World_War_II","Head-up_display","Anti-aircraft_gun","Small_arm","Red_dot_sight","Light-emitting_diode","Optical_telescope","Viewfinder","Curved_mirror","Reticle","Beam_splitter","Silvered","Infinity","Collimated_light","Gun_barrel","Parallax","Optical_axis","Dichroic_filter","Red_dot_sight","Optical_engineer","Lieuwe_Van_Albada","Bazooka","Refraction","Iron_sights","Eye_relief","Optical_telescope","Irish_people","Optical_engineering","Howard_Grubb","Telescopic_sight","Anti-aircraft_warfare","Iron_sight","Collimated_light","Optical_axis","Parallax","Eye_relief","Dominant_eye","Depth_perception","Field_of_view","Deflection_(military)","Gyro_gunsight","Head_up_display","Light_pipe","Light-emitting_diode","Dichroic_filter","Solid_state_(electronics)","Aimpoint_CompM2","Battery_(electricity)","Fiber_optic","Tritium","Night_vision_devices","Chevron_(insignia)","Minute_of_angle","English_unit","Ballistics","Action_shooting","Night_vision","Telescopic_sight","Polarization_(waves)","UV_filter","Large_format","Camera","Telescope","Finderscope","Celestron","Televue","Theater","Follow_spot","Spotlight_operator","Collimator_sight","Holographic_weapon_sight","Three-dimensional_space","Holography","Laser","Windage","EOTech","Fire-control_system","Glossary_of_firearms_terminology"]}
