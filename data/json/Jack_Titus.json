In the golden era of the 1930s, Titus was one of\nthe great forwards who regularly thrilled the crowds with spectacular\ngoalkicking feats. A lightly built player who seemed at first glance to be too\nfrail for the robust game of Australian football, Titus proved to be one of the\ngreat survivors of the game as he set the record for durability that remained\nunbeaten for a century. Titus continued to serve Richmond for decades after his\nretirement, a fact acknowledged by the Australian Football League (AFL), which\npresents the \"Jack Titus Service Award\" for outstanding service to the game.\n\nAs a teenager, Titus showed potential playing with the local Richmond club\nBurnley in the Metropolitan Football League. He was noticed by the Tigers'\nbrilliant secretary Percy Page and invited to play with the Richmond seconds in\n1925, aged 17. However, Titus' frame caused concern. At just 175 cm and a\nbit more than 60 kg, Titus wouldn't be considered a potential talent in the\nmodern AFL, let alone play a key forward position as he did. The Tigers\npersevered with Titus because of his excellent ball-winning ability and innate\ngoal sense, and hoped that he would gain size as he got older.\n\nTitus' early career was a battle for recognition at a powerful club with a\nnumber of excellent forwards. He played a single senior game in 1926, and a\nhandful the following year but missed selection in the finals as the team\nfinished runner-up. He attracted notice by winning the reserves best and\nfairest in 1928, a performance that won him a place in the Tigers' semi final\nteam. He booted six goals in a match-winning performance, but was more subdued\nin the Grand Final when Richmond went down to Collingwood for the second\nconsecutive time.\n\nBy 1929, Titus had established himself in the senior side's forward line,\nplaying alongside Jack Baggott. He won the best and fairest and led the club's\ngoalkicking for the first time, but was held goalless in the Grand Final as the\nTigers lost yet again. The Tigers used him as a flanker or in the pocket during\nthe next few years as they desperately sought a combination that could break the\njinx caused a succession of Grand Final losses. Finally, Richmond broke through\nfor a premiership in 1932 and Titus was a member of the team.\n\nIn 1933 and 1934, Richmond faced South Melbourne in two Grand Finals billed as a\nbattle of the best defence (Richmond) against the best attack (South Melbourne).\nThe glamorous Swans triumphed the first time, but Titus was instrumental in his\nteam gaining revenge the following year when he booted six goals to eclipse his\nrival Bob Pratt, the highest scoring full forward in the game. In direct\ncontrast to the spectacular Pratt, Titus was a hard working player, solid in the\nair and getting a lot of goals through opportunism and adept ground play.\n\nFor the remainder of his career, Titus was a consistent goalkicker and the\nteam's full forward, even though he regularly conceded several inches to taller\nopponents and his weight never exceeded 66 kg. His record emphasises\nconsistency rather than big \"bags\" of goals, although he did have a number of\nnotable individual performances. As Richmond's success rate slowed, he\nmaintained his output, booting 83 goals in 1935, 84 in 1936, 65 in 1937, 72 in\n1938 and 48 in 1939. By now a veteran of the team, he provided leadership to the\nyounger players and a cool head during the big games. He earned a reputation as\nfeisty customer who would deliberately antagonise opponents if he thought they\ncould be distracted. Although protected by the bigger players in the team, such\nas Jack Dyer, Titus could handle himself and always seemed to emerge from\nincidents unscathed. Indeed, his ability to front up to play every week became\ncentral to his legend as a player.\n\nTitus' golden season came in 1940. He led the VFL goalkicking for the first time\nas Richmond headed into the Grand Final for the first time in six years. Needing\nthree goals to become the first Tiger to boot one hundred in a season, he duly\ngot them, but it was little consolation as his team was thrashed by Melbourne.\nThe next season he dazzled by twice kicking ten goals in a match (equalling his\nbest personal effort) and winning the best and fairest, but the Tigers were\nbundled out in the semi-final. A similar story unfolded in 1942 when Richmond\nlost the Grand Final and Titus set a record (still unbeaten) of playing in his\nsixth losing Grand Final team.\n\nSeason 1943 loomed as a record-breaking year for the veteran forward. He was\npoised to become the second player to reach 300 games and 1000 goals, and break\nthe record streak of 191 consecutive appearances. He did the latter, but\nsustained serious injury for the first time causing him to miss playing in\nRichmond's fifth premiership. The club then decided that, at 35, his career was\nover. Without Titus, the Tigers stumbled to a Grand Final loss against Fitzroy,\nwhen Titus could have offered experience and another forward option. Titus\naccepted the decision gracefully, even though he was left stranded five games\nless than 300 and 26 goals from 1000.\n\nTitus proved a point when he joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club\nCoburg in 1945. He kicked 119 goals for Coburg and then retired in the middle of\nthe next season. In all, he held the following Richmond records at his\nretirement:\n* Most games (since broken)\n* Most goals\n* Most finals games (since broken)\n* Most Grand Finals\n* Most finals goals\n* Most consecutive games\n* Most goalkicking awards (since broken)\n* Most Grand Final losses\n\nTitus averaged 3.3 goals per game and just five players in VFL/AFL history have\nkicked more goals, four of those players competing in an era when more games\nwere played in a season. Titus' record in finals, where he kicked 74 goals, has\nbeen bettered by only two men, Gordon Coventry (Collingwood) and Jason Dunstall\n(Hawthorn).\n\nTitus returned to Richmond as a committeeman for 1947. Mid-season, the seconds\nwere caught short and needed an extra player. Aged 39, he scored 12 goals then\nretired for the last time. He continued to serve the club loyally for the next\nthree decades as a selector, vice president and VFL delegate. In an emergency\nduring 1965, Titus coached the team after the incumbent, Len Smith, suffered a\nheart attack. He guided the team to fifth place, an important contribution to\nthe Richmond renaissance of the late 1960s. It was his only coaching effort at\nany level.\n\nA dapper man never seen without a bow tie, Titus maintained his lean physique\nand always looked younger than his years. Among the recognition for his 50\nyears service to the Tigers was VFL life membership in 1970 and when the VFL\ndecided to inaugurate an annual award for long and outstanding service to the\ngame, Titus was the first winner. A non-smoker and teetotaller, Titus spent\nvirtually his entire working life running various pubs around Melbourne. He\ndied in 1978 after intervening in an altercation at his pub the Limerick Castle\nin North Melbourne. (The pub was run by another Richmond player Kevin Morris\nduring the 80's). The VFL immediately named the long service award after him.\nAlso named in his honour is Richmond's runner-up Best and Fairest award, the\n\"Jack Titus Medal\".\n\nIn 1995, much interest centred on Jim Stynes' effort to finally break Titus'\nmark of 204 consecutive matches. Some had believed the record invincible, but\nStynes eventually extended the mark to 244. Titus was elected a hall of famer in\n1996 and made the Tigers' Hall of Fame and Team of the Century a few years\nlater. Titus' number 12 was inherited by Matthew Richardson who appears likely\nto break Titus' eleven goalkicking awards, another record thought to be safe.\nAfter the 2008 season, Richardson had also won the honour thirteen times.\n","linknr":488,"url":"Jack_Titus","recorded":1375083398,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jack_Titus&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Titus&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Jack_Titus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Jack_Titus.jpg","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Jack_Dyer_Medal","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Michael_Roach_Medal","/wiki/Coleman_Medal","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Australian_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Australian_rules_football","/wiki/VFL/AFL","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/w/index.php?title=Percy_Page_(administrator)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Collingwood_Football_Club","/wiki/Jack_Baggott","/wiki/Jack_Dyer_Medal","/wiki/Sydney_Swans","/wiki/Bob_Pratt","/wiki/Full-forward","/wiki/Jack_Dyer","/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club","/wiki/Fitzroy_Football_Club","/wiki/Victorian_Football_Association","/wiki/Coburg_Tigers","/wiki/Gordon_Coventry","/wiki/Collingwood_Football_Club","/wiki/Jason_Dunstall","/wiki/Hawthorn_Football_Club","/wiki/Len_Smith_(footballer)","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Best_and_Fairest","/wiki/Jim_Stynes","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Matthew_Richardson_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Michael_Roach_Medal","/wiki/Michael_Roach_Medal","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Titus&action=edit&section=1","http://richmondfc.com.au/default.asp?pg=halloffame","/wiki/Basil_McCormack","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Jack_Dyer_Medal","/wiki/Jack_Dyer","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Jack_Dyer_Medal","/wiki/Leo_Merrett","/wiki/Template:1932/34_Richmond_Tigers_dual_premiership_players","/wiki/Template_talk:1932/34_Richmond_Tigers_dual_premiership_players","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1932/34_Richmond_Tigers_dual_premiership_players&action=edit","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/1932_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1934_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/Percy_Bentley","/wiki/Maurie_Sheahan","/wiki/Stan_Judkins","/wiki/Alan_Geddes","/wiki/Martin_Bolger","/wiki/Basil_McCormack","/wiki/Joe_Murdoch","/wiki/Jack_Baggott","/wiki/Kevin_O%27Neill_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Thomas_O%27Halloran","/wiki/Gordon_Strang","/wiki/Eric_Zschech","/wiki/Ray_Martin_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Percy_Bentley","/wiki/Template:Richmond_Football_Club_coaches","/wiki/Template_talk:Richmond_Football_Club_coaches","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Richmond_Football_Club_coaches&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_Richmond_Football_Club_coaches","/wiki/Dick_Condon","/wiki/Alex_Hall_(Australian_footballer)","/wiki/Len_Incigneri","/wiki/Charlie_H._Pannam","/wiki/Ern_Jenkins","/wiki/Charlie_Ricketts","/wiki/Percy_Maybury","/wiki/Bernie_Nolan_(footballer)","/wiki/Norm_Clark","/wiki/Dan_Minogue","/wiki/Mel_Morris","/wiki/Frank_%27Checker%27_Hughes","/wiki/Billy_Schmidt","/wiki/Percy_Bentley","/wiki/Jack_Dyer","/wiki/Alby_Pannam","/wiki/Max_Oppy","/wiki/Alan_McDonald_(Australian_footballer)","/wiki/Des_Rowe","/wiki/Dick_Harris_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Len_Smith_(footballer)","/wiki/Tom_Hafey","/wiki/Verdun_Howell","/wiki/Barry_Richardson_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Tony_Jewell_(footballer)","/wiki/Francis_Bourke","/wiki/Mike_Patterson_(footballer)","/wiki/Paul_Sproule","/wiki/Tony_Jewell_(footballer)","/wiki/Kevin_Bartlett_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Allan_Jeans","/wiki/John_Northey","/wiki/Robert_Walls","/wiki/Jeff_Gieschen","/wiki/Danny_Frawley","/wiki/Terry_Wallace","/wiki/Jade_Rawlings","/wiki/Damien_Hardwick","/wiki/Template:VFL_Leading_Goalkicker_Medal_winners","/wiki/Template_talk:VFL_Leading_Goalkicker_Medal_winners","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:VFL_Leading_Goalkicker_Medal_winners&action=edit","/wiki/Coleman_Medal#Leading_Goalkicker_Medal","/wiki/Australian_Football_League","/wiki/1897_VFL_season","/wiki/1954_VFL_season","/wiki/Coleman_Medal","/wiki/Jack_Leith","/wiki/Eddy_James","/wiki/Archie_Smith","/wiki/Eddy_James","/wiki/Teddy_Lockwood","/wiki/Albert_Thurgood","/wiki/Fred_Hiskins","/wiki/Charlie_Baker_(footballer)","/wiki/Teddy_Lockwood","
