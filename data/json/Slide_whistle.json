{"cursor":"6340","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'slide whistle' (variously known as a 'swanee' or 'swannee whistle', 'piston\nflute' or 'jazz flute') is a wind instrument consisting of a fipple like a\nrecorder's and a tube with a piston in it. Thus it has an air reed like some\nwoodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a\nbicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and\nclosed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.\n\nPiston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in\nAfrica, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured\nversion was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The\nlatter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle,\nis commonly made of plastic or metal. Hugh Davies. \"Swanee\nwhistle.\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online,\nhttp://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/47634 (accessed\nOctober 10, 2009).\n\nThe modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound\neffect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can\nsuggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a\n\"Bankrupt\" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on\nthe slide whistle.\n\nThe swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by\nthe Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide\nwhistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the\n1920s the slide whistle was common in the U.S.A., and was occasionally used in\npopular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul\nWhiteman's early hit recording of Whispering (1920). Berrett, Joshua (2004).\nLouis Armstrong & Paul Whiteman: Two Kings of Jazz, p. 62. Yale University\nPress. ISBN 0-300-10384-0. Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his\nmore usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings\nwith King Oliver's Creole Jazz\nBand. [http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section1 Louis Armstrong's\ndiscography: Early years - 1901 1925] At that time, slide saxophones, with\nreeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in\nJug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler's Jug Band.\n\nIn the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul\n'Hezzie' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They\nmade many successful recordings and Hezzie's virtuosity was legendary.\n\nA more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song \"Get\nUp\" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by\nDeee-Lite in their 1990 hit Groove Is in the Heart. The Las Vegas based band\nHoles and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song Dancing Monkey.\n\nFred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live\nperformances of the song \"Party Out of Bounds\" as a prop for the song's drunken\npartygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the [[Wild\nPlanet]] song.\n\nIn 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session\nplayers such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.\n\nThe slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of \"toy\"\ninstrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be\nused in various forms of \"serious\" music. Its first appearance in notated\nEuropean classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his\nopera, [[L'enfant et les sortilÃ¨ges]]. More modern uses in\nclassical music include Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922),\nLuciano Berio's Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of GyÃ¶rgy\nLigeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner\nHenze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also\nused in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.\n\nTo fans of 1970s BBC children's television, the instrument will always be\nassociated with the voices of the [[Clangers]]. The instrument also features\nprominently in the game of \"Swanee-Kazoo\" in the long-running British radio\npanel game, [[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]].\n\nIn the earliest episodes of [[The Simpsons]], the character of Sideshow Bob\nonly communicates through the use of a slide whistle. He abandons the whistle\nwhen he frames Krusty the Clown for armed robbery and takes over as host of\nKrusty's television show. From this point, Sideshow Bob is voiced by actor\nKelsey Grammer.\n\nOne of the slide whistle's most notable appearances in the media are being a\nstaple on the Anthony Cumia SiriusXM satellite radio program.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Slide_whistle","recorded":1374861648,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Flauta_d%27%C3%A8mbol_-_edit.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Flauta_d%27%C3%A8mbol_-_edit.jpg/100px-Flauta_d%27%C3%A8mbol_-_edit.jpg","/wiki/File:Flauta_d%27%C3%A8mbol_-_edit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Wind_instrument","/wiki/Fipple","/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument)","/wiki/Piston","/wiki/Woodwind","/wiki/Slide_(wind_instrument)","/wiki/Bicycle_pump","/wiki/Overblowing","/wiki/Harmonic","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/Sound_effect","/wiki/Animated_cartoon","/wiki/Glissando","/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(US_game_show)","/wiki/Distin_family","/wiki/J_Stevens_%26_Son","/wiki/H_A_Ward","/wiki/Popular_music","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Paul_Whiteman","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Louis_Armstrong","/wiki/Cornet","/wiki/Joe_%22King%22_Oliver","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Saxophone","/wiki/Jug_band","/wiki/Hoosier_Hot_Shots","/wiki/Vernon_Burch","/wiki/Deee-Lite","/wiki/Groove_Is_in_the_Heart","/wiki/Fred_Schneider","/wiki/The_B-52s","/wiki/Trumpet","/wiki/Wild_Planet","/wiki/European_classical_music","/wiki/Maurice_Ravel","/wiki/Opera","/wiki/L%27enfant_et_les_sortil%C3%A8ges","#cite_note-Grove-1","/wiki/Paul_Hindemith","/wiki/Luciano_Berio","/wiki/Violin_Concerto_(Ligeti)","/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti","/wiki/Cornelius_Cardew","/wiki/Alberto_Ginastera","/wiki/Hans_Werner_Henze","/wiki/Peter_Maxwell_Davies","/wiki/Krzysztof_Penderecki","/wiki/P._D._Q._Bach","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Children%27s_television_series","/wiki/Clangers","/wiki/Kazoo","/wiki/Panel_game","/wiki/I%27m_Sorry_I_Haven%27t_a_Clue","/wiki/The_Simpsons","/wiki/Sideshow_Bob","/wiki/Krusty_the_Clown","/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer","/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony","/wiki/SiriusXM","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tin_whistle","/wiki/Whistle","/wiki/Whistling","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Grove_1-0","#cite_ref-Grove_1-1","http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/47634","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0300103840","#cite_ref-3","http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section1","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit&section=3","http://whistlemuseum.com/2009/03/29/strauss-slide-whistle--many-other-samples--at-work-to-be-cont.aspx","http://academic.lipscomb.edu/windbandhistory/RhodesWindBand_07_BritishBrassBand.htm#sax_distinAdolph","http://www.sfxsource.com/sound-effects/cartoon-sound-effects/cartoon-sound-design-sound-effects/cartoon-slide-whistle-wind-down-01.html/","http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=leech&s2=musical&OS=leech+AND+musical&RS=leech+AND+musical","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&oldid=552603474","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Woodwind_instruments","/wiki/Category:Continuous_pitch_instruments","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slide+whistle&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slide+whistle","/wiki/Slide_whistle","/wiki/Talk:Slide_whistle","#","/wiki/Slide_whistle","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slide_whistle&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Slide_whistle","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Slide_whistle","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?
