By coming out to watch one's\nfriend's team play a match, one is likely not directly supporting her team in\nany significant way (especially if there is no charge to attend), but one's\nfriend may still feel encouraged by the moral support of one's presence.\n\nThe line between moral support and other forms of help is often hard to draw.\nFor example, some athletes report that they play better when the spectators\nencourage themâand in some cases referees' decisions may be influenced by a\npartisan crowd.\n\nThere is also moral support that one can offer someone who is experiencing a\ndifficult situation. One may not be able to offer any concrete assistance\nexcept empathy.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Moral_support","recorded":1362535150,"links":15,"instances":["creative_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Collaboration"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/30px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["acknowledgment","creative_arts"]],"members":["acknowledgment"],"related":["Paraguay","World_War_II","Sport","Sportsperson","Acknowledgment_(creative_arts)","Morale"]}
