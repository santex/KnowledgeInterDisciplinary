{"cursor":"7068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'iRobot Create' is a hobbyist robot manufactured by iRobot that is based on the\nRoomba platform and was introduced in 2007. However, iRobot Create is explicitly\ndesigned for robotics development, rather than simply hacking the Roomba. In place of the vacuum hardware of\nthe Roomba, the Create includes a cargo bay which houses a 25 pin port that can\nbe used for digital and analog input and output. The Create also possesses a serial port through which sensor data\ncan be read and motor commands can be issued using the \"iRobot Roomba Open\nInterface protocol\".\n\nThe platform accepts virtually all accessories designed for iRobot's domestic\nrobots and can also be programmed with the addition of iRobot's own Command\nModule (a microcontroller with a USB connector and four DE-9 expansion\nports), although it is no longer being sold.\n","linknr":231,"url":"IRobot_Create","recorded":1362538558,"links":20,"instances":["technology_slang","robot"],"pdf":["http://cs.oberlin.edu/mcurcsm2009/files/papers/07-Create-ing%20a%20Simulator.pdf","http://cs.oberlin.edu/mcurcsm2009/files/papers/07-Create-ing%20a%20Simulator.pdf"],"categories":["Hobbyist robots","IRobot","2007 robots","Rolling robots"],"headings":["Controller","Community","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/IRobotCreate.jpg/220px-IRobotCreate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/IRobot_Create_team.jpg/220px-IRobot_Create_team.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/ISpy.jpg/220px-ISpy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Simulation_of_an_iRobot_Create_in_Webots.png/220px-Simulation_of_an_iRobot_Create_in_Webots.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hack","technology_slang"],["turtle","robot"]],"members":["hack","turtle"],"related":["Robot","IRobot","Roomba","Hack_(technology_slang)","Microcontroller","Universal_Serial_Bus","DE-9","Player_Project","Roomba","URBI","Microsoft_Robotics_Studio","Webots","Botball","Brown_University","MATLAB","Cornell_University","Telepresence_robot","Netbook","Xbox_Kinekt","3D_scanner","Lego_Mindstorms","Robotis_Bioloid","Vex_Robotics_Design_System","Big_Trak","Turtle_(robot)","Robot_app_store"]}
