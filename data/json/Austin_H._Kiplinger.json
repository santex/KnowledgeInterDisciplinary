Kiplinger, the founder of Kiplinger\nWashington Editors, publishers of The Kiplinger Letters and Kiplinger's Personal\nFinance Magazine.\n\nKiplinger started his journalistic career began as an office boy for The\nKiplinger Washington Letter while a student at Western High School in\nWashington, D.C. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University,where he\nwas active in student government, gained prominence in a movement seeking to\nmake ROTC voluntary, and led intercollegiate student forums concerned about the\nrise of Fascism in Europe. He worked as the Cornell campus stringer for the\n[[Ithaca Journal]], with some of his stories picked up by the Associated Press\nwire in New York State. He was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity,\nTelluride Society and Quill and Dagger senior men's honorary society.\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1939, Kiplinger did a year of graduate study in\neconomics at Harvard, then became a reporter for the [[San Francisco\nChronicle]]. He enlisted to train as a naval aviator in 1942 and flew numerous\ncombat missions off carriers in the Pacific during World War II. In December\n1944, he married Mary Louise \"Gogo\" Cobb of Winnetka, Ill. In 1946 he moved to\nChevy Chase and went to work for Kiplinger Washington Editors, helping found,\nwith his father, 'The Kiplinger Magazine''the following year. (It was renamed\nChanging Times in 1949.)\n\nIn 1948, he moved to Chicago to write a daily front-page column for the Chicago\nJournal of Commerce. In 1950, while doing his column, he also began an evening\nbusiness news program on WGN-TV, which was possibly the first daily TV segment\ndevoted largely to business news. In 1951 he left the Journal of Commerce and\nbegan hosting a national evening radio news program for the ABC network, and\nlater became a TV reporter and anchor for ABC's Chicago affiliate (WBKB-TV) as\nwell. In 1952 he covered the national political conventions in Chicago as part\nof an ABC television team that included Martin Agronsky and Pauline Frederick.\nHe moved to NBC (WNBQ) in 1955. While in Chicago, he also helped create and\nanchor \"Impact,\" a live weekly news feature program that pioneered the TV \"news\nmagazine\" format later made famous by \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nIn 1956, he returned to Kiplinger Washington Editors. In 1961, he succeeded his\nfather as editor-in-chief of the Kiplinger Letters and Changing Times. The\nmagazine, today edited by his son Knight (who is president and chairman of\nKWE),is the longest continually published personal finance publication in the\nUnited States. His older son, Todd (1945-2008), was vice chair of the KWE board.\n\nIn addition to his journalism career, Kiplinger followed his fatherâs lead as a\ncollector of Washingtoniana--historical prints and photographs depicting the\nhistory of Washington, D.C. He championed the creation of a city museum for the\nDistrict of Columbia. The library at the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.\nis named in his honor. In 2011 the 5,000-piece Kiplinger Washington Collection\nwas pledged to several Washington area museums, with most of it (4,000 graphic\nworks) going to the Historical Society and other portions going to Mount Vernon,\nthe National Portrait Gallery and President Lincoln's Cottage at Soldiers Home.\n\nKiplinger is chairman emeritus of the Cornell University Board of Trustees and a\ntrustee or past trustee of the Tudor Place Foundation, the National Symphony\nOrchestra, the National Press Foundation, Washington International Horse Show\nand Federal City Council, among other civic commitments.\n\nin 1958 Kiplinger and his wife restored Montevideo, an 1830 home in Seneca, Md.,\nand the centerpiece today of a 400-acre working farm near the Potomac River.\nLong active in farmland preservation, he was the first Montgomery County, Md.\nlandowner, in 1989, to put most of his land into a new county easement program,\nunder which development rights were sold to the county and property taxes\nreduced. The historic house and 25 acres are owned today by his son Knight,\nwhile Austin retains ownership of most of the farmland.\n\n","linknr":112,"url":"Austin_H._Kiplinger","recorded":1364147424,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources","/wiki/Defamation","/wiki/Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Journalist","#cite_note-Cortez-1","/wiki/W._M._Kiplinger","/wiki/Kiplinger","/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa_Society","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/ROTC","/wiki/Ithaca_Journal","/wiki/Delta_Upsilon","/wiki/Quill_and_Dagger","/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle","/wiki/Pacific_War","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/WMAQ-TV","/wiki/Historical_Society_of_Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/National_Symphony_Orchestra_(United_States)","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Cortez_1-0","http://www.gazette.net/article/20111214/ENTERTAINMENT/712149975/1152/1152/writer-s-center-to-honor-austin-kiplinger&template=gazette","/wiki/The_Capital","http://www.gazette.net/article/20111214/ENTERTAINMENT/712149975/1152/1152/writer-s-center-to-honor-austin-kiplinger&template=gazette","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit&section=3","http://www.kiplinger.com/","/wiki/Jansen_Noyes,_Jr.","/wiki/Cornell_University_Board_of_Trustees","/wiki/Stephen_H._Weiss","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/50502804","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&oldid=535748781","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1918_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Cornell_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Newsletter_publishers_(people)","/wiki/Category:People_from_Washington,_D.C.","/wiki/Category:BLP_articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2011","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Austin+H.+Kiplinger&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Austin+H.+Kiplinger","/wiki/Austin_H._Kiplinger","/wiki/Talk:Austin_H._Kiplinger","#","/wiki/Austin_H._Kiplinger","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Austin_H._Kiplinger","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Austin_H._Kiplinger","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&oldid=535748781","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Austin_H._Kiplinger&id=535748781","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Austin+H.+Kiplinger","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Austin+H.+Kiplinger&oldid=535748781&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Austin_H._Kiplinger&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_H._Kiplinger","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21
