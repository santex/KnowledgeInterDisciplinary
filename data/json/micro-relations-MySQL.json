The SQL\nphrase stands for Structured Query Language.\n\nThe MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms\nof the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary\nagreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the\nSwedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.\n\nMySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a\ncentral component of the widely used LAMP open source web application software\nstack (and other 'AMP' stacks). LAMP is an acronym for \"Linux, Apache, MySQL,\nPerl/PHP/Python.\" Free-software-open source projects that require a full-\nfeatured database management system often use MySQL.\n\nFor commercial use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional\nfunctionality. Applications which use MySQL databases include: TYPO3, Joomla,\nWordPress, phpBB, MyBB, Drupal and other software. MySQL is also used in many\nhigh-profile, large-scale World Wide Web products, including\nWikipedia, Google (though\nnot for searches), Facebook, Twitter,\nFlickr, Nokia.com, and YouTube.\n","linknr":1018,"url":"MySQL","recorded":1362891313,"links":88,"instances":["databases","operating_system","database_server","database_architecture","computing","sql","software_bundle","software","program_lifecycle_phase","database","concept","sql","programming_language","operating_system","database","storage_engine","storage_engine","software","operating_system","programming_language","database","database_server","programming_language","database","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["MySQL","1995
