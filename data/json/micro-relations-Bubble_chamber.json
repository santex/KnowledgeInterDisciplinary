It was invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser, {{cite\njournal |author = Donald A.

While bubble\nchambers were extensively used in the past, they have now mostly been supplanted\nby wire chambers and spark chambers. Historically, notable bubble chambers\ninclude the Big European Bubble Chamber (BEBC) and Gargamelle.\n\n__TOC__\n","linknr":194,"url":"Bubble_chamber","recorded":1362480536,"links":43,"instances":["optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Particle detectors","Hydrogen technologies"],"headings":["Function and use","Drawbacks","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/BubbleChamber-fnal.jpg/220px-BubbleChamber-fnal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Liquid_hydrogen_bubblechamber.jpg/225px-Liquid_hydrogen_bubblechamber.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Bubble-chamber.svg/225px-Bubble-chamber.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transparency","optics"]],"members":["transparency"],"related":["Liquid_hydrogen","Superheating","Transparency_(optics)","Liquid","Liquid_hydrogen","Electric_charge","Donald_A._Glaser","Physical_Review","Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","The_Nobel_Foundation","Beer","Prototype","Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory","Cloud_chamber","Supersaturation","Superheating","Wire_chamber","Spark_chamber","Big_European_Bubble_Chamber","Gargamelle","Cloud_chamber","Boiling_point","Piston","Metastable","Liquid_bubble","Micrometers","Helix","Charge-to-mass_ratio","Electron","Momentum","Neutral_current","Gargamelle","CERN","Electroweak_theory","W_and_Z_bosons","UA1_experiment","UA2_experiment","Weakly_interacting_massive_particles","COUPP","PICASSO","COUPP","PICASSO","Wire_chamber","Energy","Spark_chamber","CERN"]}
