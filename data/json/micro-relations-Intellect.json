Historically the term comes from the Greek\nphilosophical term nous, which was translated into Latin as\n[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]] (derived from the verb intelligere) and into\nFrench (and then English) as [[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]].\n\nDiscussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of\nthese areas, the terms \"intellect\" and \"intelligence\" have continued to be used\nas related words.\n\n*[[Nous]]. In philosophy, especially in classical and medieval philosophy the\nintellect or [[nous]] is an important subject connected to the question of how\nhumans can know things. Especially during late antiquity and the middle ages,\nthe intellect was often proposed as a concept which could reconcile\nphilosophical and scientific understandings of nature with monotheistic\nreligious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human\nsoul, and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the cosmos itself. (During the\nLatin Middle Ages a distinction developed whereby the term \"intelligence\" was\ntypically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which governed the celestial\nspheres in many of these accounts. page 6. )\n\n*Intelligence. Discussion of Intelligence as the mental ability (or abilities)\nthat allow people to understand things has continued as a subject studied by\nmodern scientific psychology and neuroscience.\n\nA person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and critical or analytical\nreasoning in either a professional or a personal capacity is often referred to\nas an intellectual.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Intellect","recorded":1362485172,"links":24,"instances":["spirit","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in metaphysics","Intelligence","Philosophy of mind","Psychology terminology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg/30px-Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/30px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","philosophy"],["soul","spirit"]],"members":["soul","nature"],"related":["Human","Mind","Truth","Reality","Problem_solving","Classical_philosophy","Medieval_philosophy","Knowledge","Late_antiquity","Middle_ages","Nature_(philosophy)","Monotheism","Soul_(spirit)","Cosmos","Middle_Ages","Intelligence","Intelligence","Theory_of_multiple_intelligences","Understanding","Psychology","Neuroscience","Critical_thinking","Logic","Profession","Individual_capacity","Intellectual","Nous","Intelligence"]}
