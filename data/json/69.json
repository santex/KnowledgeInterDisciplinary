calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the\ntime, it was known as the 'Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Augustus]] and\n[[Rufinus]]' (or, less frequently, 'year 822Ab urbe condita'). The denomination\n69 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno\nDomini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n","title":"69","headings":["Events","Births","Deaths","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Galba","2: Otho","2: Vitellius","2: Roman_legion","2: Lucius_Calpurnius_Piso_Licinianus","2: January_15","2: December_22","1: Myles_Edgars","1: Common_year_starting_on_Sunday","1: Julian_calendar","1: Ab_urbe_condita","1: Medieval_period","1: Anno_Domini","1: Calendar_era","1: Year_of_the_Four_Emperors","1: Nero","1: Vespasian","1: January_1","1: Germania_Superior","1: January_10","1: Praetorian_Guard","1: Roman_Forum","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Suicide","1: Marcus_Trebellius_Maximus","1: Governors_of_Roman_Britain","1: Roman_Britain","1: Gaul","1: Mutiny","1: Legio_XX_Valeria_Victrix","1: Deva_Victrix","1: Chester","1: April_14","1: First_Battle_of_Bedriacum","1: April_17","1: Marcus_Vettius_Bolanus","1: Venutius","1: Brigantes","1: July_1","1: Tiberius_Julius_Alexander","1: Alexandria","1: Allegiance","1: August_1","1: Batavian_rebellion","1: Batavians","1: Germania_Inferior","1: Netherlands","1: Gaius_Julius_Civilis","1: German_peoples","1: Mainz","1: Rhine","1: Fectio","1: Gallia_Belgica","1: Tongeren","1: Ardennes","1: Roman_Empire","1: Raetia","1: Moesia","1: October_24","1: Second_Battle_of_Bedriacum","1: Flavians","1: Antonius_Primus","1: Gemonian_stairs","1: Judea","1: First_Jewish-Roman_War","1: Jerusalem","1: Titus","1: Josephus","1: Historian","1: Legio_I_Macriana_liberatrix","1: Flavian_dynasty","1: Polycarp","1: 155","1: Locusta","1: Roman_emperor","1: 3_BC","1: April_16","1: 32","1: June_29","1: Saint_Peter","1: Bishop_of_Rome","1: 15","1: 38"]}
