{"cursor":"37558","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'microbiome' is the totality of microbes, their genetic elements (genomes),\nand environmental interactions in a particular environment. The term\n\"microbiome\" was coined by Joshua Lederberg, who argued that microorganisms\ninhabiting the human body should be included as part of the human genome,\nbecause of their influence on human physiology. The human body contains over 10\ntimes more microbial cells than human cells, although the entire microbiome only\nweighs about Because bacteria are 10-100 times smaller than\nhuman cells, the entire microbiome weighs about . See also }} , with some\nweight estimates ranging as high as 3 pounds (approximately 48 ounces or 1,400\ngrams). Some consider it to be a \"newly-discovered organ\" since its existence\nwas not generally recognized until the late 1990's and it is understood to\npotentially have overwhelming impact on human health. Modern DNA testing of\ntheir residues has enabled researchers to find the majority of these microbes,\nsince they do not culture easily in a lab. Its most important aspect may be its\npossible effect on auto-immune diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,\nmuscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and perhaps some cancers.\nCommon obesity might also be aggravated by a poor mix of microbes in the gut.\nSince some of the microbes in our body can modify the production of\nneurotransmitters known to be found in the brain, we may also find some relief\nfor schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and other neuro-chemical\nimbalances.\n\nMicrobiomes are being characterized in many other environments as well,\nincluding soil, seawater and freshwater systems. It has been suggested that\nmicrobes have had a symbiotic relationship with other organisms since complex\ncreatures first appeared on Earth.\n\nTo avoid confusion, it should be noted that the microbes being discussed are\ngenerally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally).\nThey exist in harmony and symbiotically with us.\n\nSome researchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in\nthe human body are not bacteria, but a very old class of single-celled organisms\ncalled '[[archaea]]' {{Cite book\n| edition = 13th ed publisher = Benjamin Cummings isbn = 9780321649638 last =\n| Madigan first = Michael T. title = Brock biology of microorganisms location =\n| San Francisco date = 2012\n}} .\n","linknr":658,"url":"Microbiome","recorded":1362509410,"links":35,"instances":["biology","biophysical","journal"],"pdf":["http://people.nnu.edu/jocossel/Stuart%20et%20al%202004.pdf","http://people.nnu.edu/jocossel/Stuart%20et%20al%202004.pdf","http://www.reefresilience.org/pdf/Baird_etal_2009.pdf","http://www.reefresilience.org/pdf/Baird_etal_2009.pdf","http://sequoia.ucmerced.edu/Shini/CGNGS/literature/Rosenberg_et_al_2007.pdf","http://sequoia.ucmerced.edu/Shini/CGNGS/literature/Rosenberg_et_al_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Microbiology"],"headings":["Introduction","Case studies","Human microbiome","Hologenome theory of evolution","Research methods","Projects","Conclusion","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg/220px-Skin_Microbiome20169-300.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/Th1-Th2-Th17-Treg_origin.png/200px-Th1-Th2-Th17-Treg_origin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Chytridiomycosis.jpg/200px-Chytridiomycosis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Cycas_coralloid_root_XS_high.jpg/200px-Cycas_coralloid_root_XS_high.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Microbiome_analysis_flowchart.png/220px-Microbiome_analysis_flowchart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/Keppelbleaching.jpg/200px-Keppelbleaching.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"],["mutualism","biology"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["mutualism","environment","nature"],"related":["Microorganism","Environment_(biophysical)","Joshua_Lederberg","Genome","Symbiosis","Symbiosis","Metagenomics","Metatranscriptonomics","Pyrosequencing","Enterotype","Germ-free_animal","T_helper_17_cell","Multiple_sclerosis","Psoriasis","Juvenile_diabetes","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Crohn's_disease","Autoimmune_uveitis","Chytridiomycosis","Rumen","Leaf-cutter_ants","Parasitism","Mutualism_(biology)","Commensalism","Oomycetes","Fungi","Plant-growth_promoting_rhizobacteria","Nitrogen_fixation","Plant_hormones","Allelochemicals","Neonatal_necrotizing_enterocolitis","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Vaginosis","Human_Microbiome_Project","Human_Microbiome_Project","Amplicon","Shotgun_sequencing","Metagenomics","Human_microbiome","Human_Microbiome_Project","NIH","Francis_Collins","Nature_(journal)","Public_Library_of_Science","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Genera","Coral_bleaching","Adaptive_immune_system","Innate_immune_system","Amplicon","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Molecular_phylogenetic","Operational_taxonomic_unit","Metagenomics","Sanger_sequencing","Pyrosequencing","Contig","BLAST","KEGG","Integrated_Microbial_Genomes_System","Non-coding_RNAs","Metaproteomics","Human_Microbiome_Project","National_Institutes_of_Health","Earth_Microbiome_Project","Anagenesis","Biome","Gut_flora","Human_microbiome_project","Metagenomics","Multigenomic_organism","Skin_flora"]}
