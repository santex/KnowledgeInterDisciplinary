{"cursor":"48579","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (mRNA) molecule. Each codon consists of three nucleotides, usually representing\n a single amino acid. The nucleotides are abbreviated with the letters A, U, G\n and C. This is mRNA, which uses U (uracil). DNA uses T (thymine) instead. This\n mRNA molecule will instruct a ribosome to synthesize a protein according to\n this code.]]\n\nThe 'genetic code' is the set of rules by which information encoded within\ngenetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins (amino acid\nsequences) by living cells. Biological decoding is accomplished by the ribosome,\nwhich links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA)\nmolecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time.\nThe genetic code is highly similar among all organisms, and can be expressed in\na simple table with 64 entries.\n\nThe code defines how sequences of these nucleotide triplets, called codons,\nspecify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis. With some\nexceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic\nacid sequence specifies a single amino acid. Because the vast majority of genes\nare encoded with exactly the same code (see the RNA codon table), this\nparticular code is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code,\nor simply the genetic code, though in fact some variant codes have evolved. For\nexample, protein synthesis in human mitochondria relies on a genetic code that\ndiffers from the standard genetic code.\n\nNot all genetic information is stored using the genetic code. All organisms' DNA\ncontains regulatory sequences, intergenic segments, chromosomal structural\nareas, and other non-coding DNA that can contribute greatly to phenotype. Those\nelements operate under sets of rules that are distinct from the codon-to-amino\nacid paradigm underlying the genetic code.\n","linknr":882,"url":"Codon_table","recorded":1362484122,"links":56,"instances":["genetics","data_type","genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular genetics","Gene expression","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Discovery","Salient features","Transfer of information via the genetic code","RNA codon table","DNA codon table","Variations to the standard genetic code","Origin","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/RNA-codons.png/220px-RNA-codons.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/GeneticCode21-version-2.svg/220px-GeneticCode21-version-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Notable_mutations.svg/300px-Notable_mutations.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Genetic_Code_Bias_2.svg/220px-Genetic_Code_Bias_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["translation","biology"],["translation","biology"],["transition","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["word","data_type"]],"members":["transition","word","translation","transcription","cell"],"related":["Nucleotide","Amino_acid","Uracil","Thymine","Ribosome","DNA","MRNA","Translation_(genetics)","Protein","Amino_acid","Cell_(biology)","Ribosome","Transfer_RNA","Nucleotides","Protein_synthesis","Gene","Mitochondrion","Non-coding_DNA","Phenotype","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Maurice_Wilkins","Rosalind_Franklin","George_Gamow","Crick,_Brenner_et_al._experiment","Marshall_Nirenberg","Heinrich_J._Matthaei","National_Institutes_of_Health","Cell-free_system","Translation_(biology)","Polypeptide","Phenylalanine","Severo_Ochoa","Lysine","Proline","Har_Gobind_Khorana","Robert_W._Holley","Transfer_RNA","Severo_Ochoa","Nobel_prize","Enzymology","Philip_Leder","MRNA","Ribosome","Translation_(biology)","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Reading_frames","Reading_frames","Start_codon","Start_codon","Shine-Dalgarno","Initiation_factor","Stop_codon","Release_factor","DNA_replication","Mutations","DNA_polymerase","Missense_mutation","Nonsense_mutation","Point_mutation","Sickle-cell_disease","Thalassemia","Stop_codon","Indels","Gene_insertion","Genetic_deletion","Frameshift_mutation","Stop_codon","Tay-Sachs_disease","Wild-type","Natural_selection","Virus","RNA","Immune_system","Clonal_interference","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Glutamic_acid","Leucine","Serine","Glycine","Glutamic_acid","Purine","Pyrimidine","Isoleucine","Methionine","Serine","Leucine","Arginine","Methionine","Tryptophan","Synonymous_mutation","Point_mutation","Codon_usage_bias","Transition_(genetics)","Transversion","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetases","Hemoglobin","Sickle-cell_disease","Glutamate","Valine","Beta_globulins","Hemoglobin","Erythrocyte","Mutation","Malaria","Thalassemia","Zygosity","Heterozygote_advantage","Anticodon","Wobble_base_pair","Inosine","Genome","Organism","DNA","RNA","Gene","Phosphate","Deoxyribose","Nucleobase","Purine","Adenine","Guanine","Pyrimidine","Cytosine","Thymine","Base_pair","Uracil","Ribose","Transcription_(genetics)","Prokaryote","Messenger_RNA","Eukaryote","Post-transcriptional_modification","Translation_(genetics)","Ribosome","Amino_acid","Peptide","Transfer_RNA","Covalent","Guanosine_triphosphate","Anticodons","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase","Reading_frame","Bioinformatics","Word_(data_type)","Bit","Asparagine","Cysteine","Amino_acid","DNA_codon_table","Codon_table","Codon_dictionary","RNA_codon_table","Uracil","Thymine","Human_mitochondrial_genetics","Bacteria","Archaea","Selenocysteine","Pyrrolysine","Carl_Sagan","Polyaromatic","Sulfonyl_halides","Protein_structure","Steven_A._Benner","Aptamer","Metabolism","Mutations","Ribosome","Information_theory","Rate-distortion_theory","Map_coloring_problem","Aminoacyl-tRNA_synthetase","DNA","Genotype","Human_Genome_Project","Mutation","Nucleobases","Phenotype","Proteins"]}
