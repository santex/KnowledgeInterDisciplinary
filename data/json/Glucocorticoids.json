{"cursor":"41751","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a glucocorticoid]] binds more powerfully to the glucocorticoid receptor than\ncortisol does. Dexamethasone is based on the cortisol structure but differs in\nthree positions (extra double bond in the A-ring between carbons 1 and 2 and\naddition of a 9-Î±-fluoro group and a 16-Î±-methyl substituent).]]\n\n'Glucocorticoids' (GC) are a class of steroid hormones that bind to the\nglucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is present in almost every vertebrate animal\ncell. The name glucocorticoid (pertaining to 'gluco'se + 'cort'ex ) derives from\nits role in the regulation of the metabolism of glucose, its synthesis in the\nadrenal cortex, and its steroidal structure (see structure to the right).\n\nGCs are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system that turns immune\nactivity (inflammation) down. They are therefore used in medicine to treat\ndiseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma,\nautoimmune diseases and sepsis. GCs have many diverse (pleiotropic) effects,\nincluding potentially harmful side effects, and as a result are rarely sold over\nthe counter. They also interfere with some of the\nabnormal mechanisms in cancer cells, so they are used in high doses to treat\ncancer. This includes mainly inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation\n(treatment of lymphomas and leukaemias) and mitigation of side effects of\nanticancer drugs.\n\nGCs cause their effects by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The\nactivated GR complex, in turn, up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory\nproteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the\nexpression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the\ntranslocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus\n(transrepression).\n\nGlucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by\ntheir specific receptors, target cells, and effects. In technical terms,\n\"corticosteroid\" refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (as both\nare mimics of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex), but is often used as a\nsynonym for \"glucocorticoid\".\n\nCortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is\nessential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important\ncardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. Various\nsynthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are used either as replacement\ntherapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.\n","linknr":1265,"url":"Glucocorticoids","recorded":1362482142,"links":50,"instances":["biochemistry","transcription_factor","drugs","biology","molecule","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.jcaai.readyportal.net/file_depot/0-10000000/20000-30000/27387/folder/63948/Atopic_Derm1997.pdf","http://www.jcaai.readyportal.net/file_depot/0-10000000/20000-30000/27387/folder/63948/Atopic_Derm1997.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~pspang/Specific%20Topics%20and%20Infections/Immunocompromised/Steroid%20Induced%20Immunocompromise/Infectious%20Steriods/cunha.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~pspang/Specific%20Topics%20and%20Infections/Immunocompromised/Steroid%20Induced%20Immunocompromise/Infectious%20Steriods/cunha.pdf"],"categories":["Corticosteroids","Glucocorticoids|"],"headings":["Effects","Mechanism
