{"cursor":"3969","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", from bovine pancreas]] A 'carboxypeptidase' (EC number 3.4.16 - 3.4.18) is a\nprotease enzyme that hydrolyzes (cleaves) a peptide bond at the carboxy-terminal\n(C-terminal) end of a protein or peptide. (Contrast with an aminopeptidase,\nwhich cleaves peptide bonds at the other end of the protein.) Humans, animals,\nand plants contain several types of carboxypeptidases that have diverse\nfunctions ranging from catabolism to protein maturation.\n","linknr":249,"url":"Carboxypeptidase","recorded":1362484404,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Enzymes","Metabolism"],"headings":["Functions","Classification","Activation","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Carboxypeptidase_A.png/220px-Carboxypeptidase_A.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Enzyme_Commission_number","Protease","Enzyme","Hydrolysis","Peptide_bond","Protein","Peptide","Aminopeptidase","Digestion","Catabolism","Post-translational_modification","Neuroendocrine","Insulin","Blood_clotting","Growth_factor","Wound_healing","Reproduction","Serine","Cysteine","Thiol","Aromatic","Branched-chain_amino_acids","Carboxypeptidase_A","Aliphatic","Arginine","Lysine","Carboxypeptidase_B","Base_(chemistry)","Glutamate_carboxypeptidase","Prolyl_carboxypeptidase","Procarboxypeptidase","Zymogen","Enteropeptidase","Carboxypeptidase_E","Carboxypeptidase_A","Enzyme_Commission_number","Thrombin-activatable_fibrinolysis_inhibitor","Transpeptidase","Penicillin-binding_protein","Phenylalanine"]}
