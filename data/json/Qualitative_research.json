Denzin, Norman K. & Lincoln, Yvonna S.\n(Eds.). (2005). The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research (3rd ed.). Thousand\nOaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-2757-3 Qualitative researchers aim to gather\nan in-depth understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such\nbehavior. The qualitative method investigates the why and how of decision\nmaking, not just what, where, when. Hence, smaller but focused samples are more\noften needed than large samples.\n\nIn the conventional view, qualitative methods produce information only on the\nparticular cases studied, and any more general conclusions are only propositions\n(informed assertions). Quantitative methods can then be used to seek empirical\nsupport for such research hypotheses.\n","linknr":446,"url":"Qualitative_research","recorded":1362483644,"links":44,"instances":["sociology","statistics","case_studies","science","social_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.techsociety.com/cal/soc190/fssba2009/ParticipantObservation.pdf","http://www.techsociety.com/cal/soc190/fssba2009/ParticipantObservation.pdf","http://ddl.uwinnipeg.ca/res_des/files/readings/cwmills-intel_craft.pdf"],"categories":["Qualitative research|","Scientific method","Evaluation methods","Research methods","Methods in sociology","Sociology index"],"headings":["History","Data collection","Data analysis","Paradigmatic differences","Trustworthiness","Academic research","See also","Notes","References","External links","Videos"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sample","statistics"],["reflexivity","social_theory"],["phenomenology","science"],["life_history","sociology"],["phenomenology","science"],["sampling","case_studies"]],"members":["life_history","sample","sampling","phenomenology","reflexivity"],"related":["Social_sciences","Market_research","Human_behavior","Decision_making","Sample_(statistics)","Quantitative_methods","Positivism","Empiricism","Paradigm","Postpositivism","Reflexivity_(social_theory)","Grounded_theory","Narratology","Organizational_storytelling","Ethnography","Shadowing","Action_research","Actor-network_theory","Interviews","Participant_observation","Focus_group","Market_research","Pilot_experiment","Ethnographic","Critical_Social_Research","Ethical_Inquiry","Grounded_Theory","Phenomenology_(science)","Computer_Assisted_Qualitative_Data_Analysis_Software","Content_analysis","Paradigm","Data_analysis","Ontology","Epistemology","Interpretivism","Postmodernism","Critical_theory","Positivism","Postpositivism","Critical_theory","Constructivist_epistemology","Axiology","Member_check","Analytic_induction","Case_study","Content_analysis","Critical_ethnography","Critical_theory","Dialectical_research","Discourse_analysis","Educational_psychology","Ethnomethodology","Ethnography","Focus_group","Grounded_theory","Hermeneutics","Life_history_(sociology)","Online_research_communities","Participatory_action_research","Phenomenology_(science)","Phenomenography","Qualitative_economics","Quantitative_research","Qualitative_marketing_research","Qualitative_psychological_research","Sampling_(case_studies)","Semiotics","Sensemaking","Thematic_analysis","Theoretical_sampling","Franz_Boas","Stanford_University_Press","Kaminski,_Marek_M.","Princeton_University_Press","Steven_J._Taylor","Robert_Bogdan","John_Van_Maanen","Cambridge_University_Press"]}
