this model represents the key\ncharacteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract\nsystem or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the\nsimulation represents the operation of the system over time.\n\nSimulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for\nperformance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and\nvideo games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models.\nSimulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human\nsystems to gain insight into their functioning.<ref>In the words of the\n[http://www.modelbenders.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html Simulation article]\nin Encyclopedia of Computer Science, \"designing a model of a real or imagined\nsystem and conducting experiments with that model\".</ref> Simulation can be used\nto show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of\naction. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because\nit may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or\nit is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.<ref></ref>\n\nKey issues in simulation include acquisition of valid source information about\nthe relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviours, the use of\nsimplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation, and fidelity\nand validity of the simulation outcomes.\n","title":"simulation","headings":["Classification and
