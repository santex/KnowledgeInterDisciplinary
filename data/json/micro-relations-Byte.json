For other uses, see [[Byte\n(disambiguation)]].\n\nThe 'byte' () is a unit of digital information in computing and\ntelecommunications that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, a\nbyte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a\ncomputer {{citation |url=http://archive.computerhistory.or-\ng/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/pdfs/Buchholz_102636426.pdf |title=Planning a\nComputer System â Project Stretch\n| first1 = RW | last1 = Bemer | first2 = Werner | last2 = Buchholz editor-first\n| = Werner | editor-last = Buchholz\n|year=1962 | chapter = 4, Natural Data Units | format = PDF | pages= 39-40\n}} and for this reason it is the basic addressable element in\nmany computer architectures. The size of the byte has historically been hardware\ndependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. The ''de\nfacto'' standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the\nvalues 0 through 255 for one byte. With ISO/IEC 80000-13, this common meaning\nwas codified in a formal standard. Many types of applications use variables\nrepresentable in eight or fewer bits, and processor designers optimize for this\ncommon usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures have\naided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.\n\nThe term octet was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of 8 bits because of\nthe ambiguity associated at the time with the term byte.\n","linknr":410,"url":"Byte","recorded":1362891452,"links":83,"instances":["computing","programming_language","computing","computing","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/pdfs/Buchholz_102636426.pdf","http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/pdfs/Buchholz_102636426.pdf"],"categories":["Data types","Units of information","Computer memory","Data unit","Primitive types"],"headings":["History","Unit symbol","Unit multiples","Common uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Binaryvdecimal.svg/175px-Binaryvdecimal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","computing"],["octet","computing"],["bcd","6-bit"],["octet","computing"],["protocol","computing"],["octet","computing"],["c","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["protocol","c","octet","bcd","character","java"],"related":["Units_of_information","Computing","Telecommunications","Bit","Character_(computing)","Address_space","Computer_architecture","De_facto_standard","Power_of_two","ISO/IEC_80000","Octet_(computing)","Werner_Buchholz","IBM_7030","Binary_coded_decimal","Sixbit","U.S._Army","Fieldata","ASCII","Federal_Information_Processing_Standard","Control_character","System/360","Extended_Binary_Coded_Decimal_Interchange_Code","BCD_(6-bit)","Digital_telephony","Trunk_line","Μ-law_algorithm","Internet","8-bit","Microprocessor","Intel_8008","Intel_8080","Intel_8086","4bit","Auxiliary_flag","Nibble","Hexadecimal","Octet_(computing)","Protocol_(computing)","IEEE_1541","International_System_of_Units","Decibel","Alexander_Graham_Bell","Decibel","Signal_strength","Sound_pressure_level","Kilobyte","Kilobit","Bit","Octet_(computing)","French_language","Romanian_language","ISO/IEC_80000","SI_prefix","Power_of_two","Approximation","Kilo-","Mega-","Yotta","Data_type","Programming_language","C_(programming_language)","C++","Limits.h","Java_(programming_language)","Parity_bit","Data_hierarchy","Primitive_data_type"]}
