The condition is also\nassociated with other diseases that influence fat metabolism. Morphologically, it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic\nFLD from nonalcoholic FLD, and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty\nchanges at different stages.\n\nAccumulation of fat may also be accompanied by a progressive inflammation of the\nliver (hepatitis), called steatohepatitis. By considering the contribution by\nalcohol, fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD), and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis\n(part of alcoholic liver disease) and Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n","linknr":637,"url":"Fatty_liver","recorded":1362477335,"links":36,"instances":["biology","blood_vessel","nmr"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diseases of liver","Medical conditions related to obesity","Histopathology"],"headings":["Causes","Pathology","Diagnosis","Treatment","Complication","Epidemiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg/230px-Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Stage_of_liver_damage.JPG/220px-Stage_of_liver_damage.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Periportal_hepatosteatosis_intermed_mag.jpg/220px-Periportal_hepatosteatosis_intermed_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Steatosis.jpg/220px-Steatosis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Steatohepatitis_high_mag.jpg/220px-Steatohepatitis_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Liversteatosis.png/220px-Liversteatosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vesicle","biology"],["sinusoid","blood_vessel"],["relaxation","nmr"]],"members":["vesicle","sinusoid","relaxation"],"related":["Micrograph","Macrovesicular_steatosis","Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","Trichrome_stain","Vacuole","Triglyceride","Hepatocyte","Steatosis","Disease","Alcohol","Insulin_resistance","Metabolism","Vesicle_(biology)","Hepatitis","Steatohepatitis","Nonalcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","Alcoholic_liver_disease","Non-alcoholic_steatohepatitis","Alcohol","Metabolic_syndrome","Diabetes","Hypertension","Obesity","Dyslipidemia","Abetalipoproteinemia","Glycogen_storage_disease","Weber-Christian_disease","Acute_fatty_liver_of_pregnancy","Lipodystrophy","Malnutrition","Total_parenteral_nutrition","Weight_loss","Refeeding_syndrome","Jejunoileal_bypass","Gastric_bypass","Diverticulosis","Bacterial_overgrowth","Amiodarone","Methotrexate","Diltiazem","Tetracycline","Highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy","Glucocorticoids","Tamoxifen","Hepatotoxin","Phosphorus","Mushroom_poisoning","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","HIV","Liver_lobule","Liver","Steroid","Trichrome_stain","Cytoplasm","Liposomes","Cell_nucleus","Signet_ring","Cyst","Steatosis","Alcohol","Diabetes","Obesity","Corticosteroids","Acute_fatty_liver_of_pregnancy","Reye's_syndrome","Fatty_acid_metabolism","Pathogenesis","Adipose_tissue","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor","Sterol_regulatory_element_binding_protein","Inflammation","Steatohepatitis","Non-alcoholic_steatohepatitis","Pathological","Lipid","Hepatocyte","Necrosis","Hepatic_stellate_cell","Fibrosis","Sinusoid_(blood_vessel)","Hepatic_lobule","Hepatic_veins","Alanine_transaminase","Aspartate_transaminase","Ultrasonography","Echogenicity","Medical_imaging","Density","Spleen","Computed_tomography","Relaxation_(NMR)","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Histology","Liver_biopsy","Hepatocellular_carcinoma","Liver_function_test","United_States","Steatosis","Steatohepatitis","Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease","Metabolic_syndrome","Alcoholic_liver_disease","Cirrhosis","Focal_fatty_liver"]}
