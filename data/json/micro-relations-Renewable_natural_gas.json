{"cursor":"10183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Renewable natural gas', also known as 'sustainable natural gas', is a biogas\nwhich has been upgraded to a quality similar to fossil natural gas. A biogas is\na gas methane obtained from biomass. By upgrading the quality to that of natural\ngas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas\ngrid, within existing appliances. Renewable natural gas is a subset of synthetic\nnatural gas or substitute natural gas (SNG).\n\nRenewable natural gas can be produced economically, and distributed via the\nexisting gas grid, making it an attractive means of supplying existing premises\nwith renewable heat and renewable gas energy, while requiring no extra capital\noutlay of the customer.\n\nThe existing gas network allows distribution of gas energy over vast distances\nat a minimal cost in energy. Existing networks would allow biogas to be sourced\nfrom remote markets that are rich in low-cost biomass (Russia or Scandinavia\nfor example).\n\nThe UK National Grid believes that at least 15% of all gas consumed could be\nmade from sewage slurry, old sandwiches and other food thrown away by\nsupermarkets, as well as organic waste created by businesses such as\nbreweries.
