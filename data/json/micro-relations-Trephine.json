It can be of one of several dimensions and\n designs depending on what it is going to be used for. They may be specially\n designed for obtaining a cylindrically shaped core of bone that can be used for\n tests and bone studies, cutting holes in bones (i.e. the skull) or for cutting\n out a round piece of the cornea for eye surgery.\n\nA cylindrically shaped core of bone (or bone biopsy) obtained with a bone marrow\ntrephine is usually examined in the histopathology department of a hospital\nunder a microscope. It shows the pattern and cellularity of the bone marrow as\nit lay in the bone and is a useful diagnostic tool in certain circumstances such\nas bone marrow cancer and leukemia.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Trephine","recorded":1362510768,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surgical instruments","Cutting tools"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Ancientgreek_surgical.jpg/220px-Ancientgreek_surgical.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/Dr_John_Clarke_trepanning_a_skull_operation.jpg/220px-Dr_John_Clarke_trepanning_a_skull_operation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Filled_Syringe_icon.svg/30px-Filled_Syringe_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Trepanning","Harvard_Medical_School","Surgical_instrument","Cylindrical","Blade","Bone","Rochester_Bone_Biopsy_Trephine","Human_skull","Cornea","Eye_surgery","Biopsy","Histopathology","Microscope","Bone_marrow","Trepanning","Trepanation_in_Mesoamerica"]}
