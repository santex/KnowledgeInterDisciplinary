Aristotle defined it as the study of the\nstate. Oxford Dictionary of Politics: political science It deals\nextensively with the theory and practice of politics, and the analysis of\npolitical systems and political behavior. Political scientists \"see themselves\nengaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and\nconditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general\nprinciples about the way the world of politics\nworks.\" [http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/polisci.html Political\nScience]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1999-02-22).\nRetrieved on 2010-11-13. Political science intersects with other fields;\nincluding economics, law, sociology, history, anthropology, public\nadministration, public policy, national politics, international relations,\ncomparative politics, psychology, political organization, and political theory.\nAlthough it was codified in the 19th century, when all the social sciences were\nestablished, political science has ancient roots; indeed, it originated almost\n2,500 years ago with the works of Plato and Aristotle. Britannica Concise\nEncyclopedia: political science\n\nPolitical science is commonly divided into five distinct sub-disciplines which\ntogether constitute the field:\n* political theory\n* comparative politics\n* public administration\n* international relations\n* public law\n\nPolitical theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical\nthinkers such as Aristotle, Niccolo Machiavelli, Cicero, Plato and many others.\nComparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different\ntypes of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all\nof them from an intrastate perspective. International relations deals with the\ninteraction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational\norganizations.\n\nPolitical science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods\noriginating in social research. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism,\nrational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism,\nrealism, institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, as one of the\nsocial sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of\ninquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official\nrecords, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research,\nstatistical analysis, case studies, experimental research and model building.\n","linknr":658,"url":"Political_science","recorded":1362666194,"links":105,"instances":["sociology","social_science","social_sciences","chinese_philosophy","polity"],"pdf":["http://politicalscience.truman.edu/researchdesignhandbook.pdf"],"categories":["Political
