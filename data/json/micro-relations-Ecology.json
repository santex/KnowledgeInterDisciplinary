{"cursor":"180247","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{infobox\n| title = Ecology data1 = data2 = data3 = data4 = Ecology addresses the full\n| scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that span the entire planet.\n| Ecologists study many diverse and complex relations among species, such as\n| predation and pollination. The diversity of life is organized into different\n| habitats, from terrestrial (middle) to aquatic ecosystems.\n}}\n\n'Ecology' (from , \"house\"; -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, \"study of\") is the scientific study of the\nrelationships that living organisms have with each other and with their natural\nenvironment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition,\ndistribution, amount (biomass), number, and changing states of organisms within\nand among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts\nincluding organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components\nof their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production,\npedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities,\nregulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes\nare sustained by the biodiversity within them. Biodiversity refers to the\nvarieties of species in ecosystems, the genetic variations they contain, and the\nprocesses that are functionally enriched by the diversity of ecological\ninteractions.\n\nEcology is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology and Earth science.\nThe word \"ecology\" (\"Ãkologie\") was coined in 1866 by the German scientist Ernst\nHaeckel (1834â1919). Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and\nAristotle laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on natural history.\nModern ecology transformed into a more rigorous science in the late 19th\ncentury. Evolutionary concepts on adaptation and natural selection became\ncornerstones of modern ecological theory. Ecology is not synonymous with\nenvironment, environmentalism, natural history, or environmental science. It is\nclosely related to evolutionary biology, genetics, and ethology. An\nunderstanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function is an important\nfocus area in ecological studies. Ecologists seek to explain:\n\n*Life processes and adaptations *Distribution and abundance of organisms *The\nmovement of materials and energy through living communities *The successional\ndevelopment of ecosystems, and *The abundance and distribution of biodiversity\nin the context of the environment.\n\nEcology is a human science as well. There are many practical applications of\necology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management\n(agroecology, agriculture, forestry, agroforestry, fisheries), city planning\n(urban ecology), community health, economics, basic and applied science, and\nhuman social interaction (human ecology). Ecosystems maintain biophysical\nfeedback mechanisms that modulate metabolic rates and evolutionary dynamics\nbetween living (biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) components of the planet.\nEcosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce natural capital through\nthe regulation of continental climates, global biogeochemical cycles, water\nfiltration, soils, food, fibres, medicines, erosion control, and many other\nnatural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.\n","linknr":2857,"url":"Ecology","recorded":1362511830,"links":335,"instances":["ecologist","environmental","organism","biology","botanist","mathematics","ecology","zoology","experimental_ecosystem","biology","ecology","biology","biology","ecological","animal","ecology","biology","anatomy","biology","biology","biophysical","ecology","new_hampshire","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.earthobservations.com/documents/committees/uic/200809_8thUIC/07b-Health0Montira-Pongsiri-BON-Article-in-Science.pdf","http://www.earthobservations.com/documents/committees/uic/200809_8thUIC/07b-Health0Montira-Pongsiri-BON-Article-in-Science.pdf","http://www.botanischergarten.ch/BiodivVorles-2005WS/Nature-Insight-Biodiversity-2000.pdf","http://www.botanischergarten.ch/BiodivVorles-2005WS/Nature-Insight-Biodiversity-2000.pdf","http://www.ecostudies.org/reprints/Ostfeld_2009_Clin_Microbiol_Inf.pdf","http://www.ecostudies.org/reprints/Ostfeld_2009_Clin_Microbiol_Inf.pdf","http://www.uvm.edu/~bmitchel/Publications/Tierney_Forest_monitoring.pdf","http://www.uvm.edu/~bmitchel/Publications/Tierney_Forest_monitoring.pdf","http://epswww.unm.edu/facstaff/gmeyer/envsc330/CeballosEhrlichmammalextinct2002.pdf","http://epswww.unm.edu/facstaff/gmeyer/envsc330/CeballosEhrlichmammalextinct2002.pdf","http://research.usm.maine.edu/gulfofmaine-census/wp-content/docs/Palumbi-et-al-2009_Managing-for-ocean-biodiversity.pdf","http://research.usm.maine.edu/gulfofmaine-census/wp-content/docs/Palumbi-et-al-2009_Managing-for-ocean-biodiversity.pdf","http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/bio669/papers/Ch1_supp_readings/Whittaker1973.pdf","http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/bio669/papers/Ch1_supp_readings/Whittaker1973.pdf","http://www.csub.edu/~psmith3/Teaching/discussion3C.pdf","http://www.csub.edu/~psmith3/Teaching/discussion3C.pdf","http://163.238.8.180/~fburbrink/Courses/Seminar%20in%20Systematics/Wiens_Graha_m_AnnRev2005.pdf","http://163.238.8.180/~fburbrink/Courses/Seminar%20in%20Systematics/Wiens_Graha_m_AnnRev2005.pdf","http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf","http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/laboratorios/comunidades/pdf/pdf%20curso%20posgrado%20Elena/Tema%201/LevinsLewontinSynthese1980.pdf","http://theory.bio.uu.nl/rdb/te/Projects/Papers/Scheffer_pnas06_comments.pdf","http://theory.bio.uu.nl/rdb/te/Projects/Papers/Scheffer_pnas06_comments.pdf","http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/bio669/papers/Ch1_supp_readings/Palmer_White.pdf","http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/bio669/papers/Ch1_supp_readings/Palmer_White.pdf","http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2009/07/30/nature08059.pdf","http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2009/07/30/nature08059.pdf","http://www.mun.ca/biology/igamberdiev/PhotosRes_CO2review.pdf","http://www.mun.ca/biology/igamberdiev/PhotosRes_CO2review.pdf","http://people.nnu.edu/jocossel/BIOL4240/Anderson%20et%20al%202000.pdf","http://people.nnu.edu/jocossel/BIOL4240/Anderson%20et%20al%202000.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/skalski/classes/QERM597/papers/Johnson%20and%20Omland.pdf","http://faculty.washington.edu/skalski/classes/QERM597/papers/Johnson%20and%20Omland.pdf","http://www.mathstat.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/publications/25Clark1998B.pdf","http://www.mathstat.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/publications/25Clark1998B.pdf","http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/welsh/captured/psw_2004_welsh008.pdf","http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/welsh/captured/psw_2004_welsh008.pdf","http://karljaspers.org/files/tansley.pdf","http://karljaspers.org/files/tansley.pdf","http://www.esa.org/history/Awards/papers/ONeill_RV_MA.pdf","http://www.esa.org/history/Awards/papers/ONeill_RV_MA.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/71_Pimm_Lawton_Cohen_Nature.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/71_Pimm_Lawton_Cohen_Nature.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/McCann_2007_biostructure.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/McCann_2007_biostructure.pdf","http://www.esa.org/history/papers/Wilbur_HM_MA.pdf","http://www.esa.org/history/papers/Wilbur_HM_MA.pdf","http://www.ucc.ie/people/memmers/pdfs/Emmerson.Yearsley.Proc.Roy.Soc.B.2004.pdf","http://www.ucc.ie/people/memmers/pdfs/Emmerson.Yearsley.Proc.Roy.Soc.B.2004.pdf","http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/fulltext/2003/20030014.pdf","http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/fulltext/2003/20030014.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/hairston93AmNat.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/hairston93AmNat.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/polis96AmNat.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/polis96AmNat.pdf","http://myweb.dal.ca/br238551/thompson_hem_star_shur_ecology07.pdf","http://myweb.dal.ca/br238551/thompson_hem_star_shur_ecology07.pdf","http://www.tecni
