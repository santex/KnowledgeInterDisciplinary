Glial cells\nfunction to support neurons and in the PNS, also include satellite cells,\nolfactory ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory nerve\nendings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle. There are two types of Schwann cell,\nmyelinating and nonmyelinating. Myelinating Schwann cells wrap around axons of\nmotor and sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath.\n\nSchwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve\nbiologyâthe conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and\nregeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular\nmatrix, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic activity, and presentation of\nantigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-BarrÃ©\nsyndrome (GBS), schwannomatosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating\npolyneuropathy (CIDP) are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.\n","linknr":496,"url":"Schwann_cells","recorded":1362554494,"links":44,"instances":["electrical","glial"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neurophysiology","Glial cells"],"headings":["Description","Schwann cell lineage","Immunoreactivity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/400px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Cultured_schwann_cell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["satellite_cell","glial"],["insulator","electrical"]],"members":["insulator","satellite_cell"],"related":["Theodor_Schwann","Glia","Peripheral_nervous_system","Neurons","Satellite_cell_(glial)","Olfactory_ensheathing_cells","Pacinian_corpuscle","Myelin","Nerve","Action_potential","Axon","Nerve_regeneration","Neuron","Antigen","T-lymphocytes","Charcot-Marie-Tooth_disease","Guillain-Barré_syndrome","Schwannomatosis","Chronic_inflammatory_demyelinating_polyneuropathy","Peripheral_neuropathy","Germany","Theodor_Schwann","Glial_cell","Myelin","Nodes_of_Ranvier","Vertebrate","Nervous_system","Insulator_(electrical)","Capacitance","Action_potential","Saltatory_conduction","Electrical_conduction","Central_nervous_system","Oligodendrocyte","Nodes_of_Ranvier","Cell_membrane","Cytoplasm","Neurolemma","Histology","Schmidt-Lantermann_incisure","Remyelination","Multiple_sclerosis","Nerve_regeneration","Phagocytosis","Axon_guidance","Growth_cone","Neurotrophin","Neural_crest","Invagination","Neuromuscular_junction","Synapse","Immunohistochemistry","S-100_protein","Myelin_protein_zero","Myelin_basic_protein","Glial_fibrillary_acidic_protein","Electrophysiology","Hodgkin-Huxley_Model","Neurotransmission","Olfactory_ensheathing_cells","Schwannoma"]}
