The term is used to\ncontrast with computer hardware, the physical objects (processor and related\ndevices) that carry out the instructions. Hardware and software require each\nother; neither has any value without the other.\n\nFirmware is software that has been permanently stored in hardware (specifically\nin non-volatile memory). It thus has qualities of both software and hardware.\n\nSoftware is a general term. It can refer to all computer instructions in general\nor to any specific set of computer instructions. It is inclusive of both machine\ninstructions (the binary code that the processor understands) and source code\n(more human-understandable instructions that must be rendered into machine code\nby compilers or interpreters before being executed).\n\nOn most computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories:\n* System software is the basic software needed for a computer to operate (most\n  notably the operating system).\n* Application software is all the software that uses the computer system to\n  perform useful work beyond the operation of the computer itself.\n* Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems, devices\n  dedicated to a single use. In that context there is no clear distinction\n  between the system and application software.\n\nSoftware refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of\nthe computer. In other words, software is a set of programs, procedures,\nalgorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data\nprocessing system. Program software performs the function of the program it\nimplements, either by directly providing instructions to the digital electronics\nor by serving as input to another piece of software. The term was coined to\ncontrast to the term hardware (meaning physical devices). In contrast to\nhardware, software \"cannot be touched\".<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0 publisher = Princeton University,\n| Princeton, NJ url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software\n| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> Software is also sometimes used in a more\n| narrow sense, meaning application software only. Sometimes the term includes\n| data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film,\n| tapes, and records.<ref></ref>\n\nComputer software is so called to distinguish it from computer hardware, which\nencompasses the physical interconnections and devices required to store and\nexecute (or run) the software. At the lowest level, executable code consists of\nmachine language instructions specific to an individual processor. A machine\nlanguage consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions\nthat change the state of the computer from its preceding state. Programs are an\nordered sequence of instructions for changing the state of the computer in a\nparticular sequence. It is usually written in high-level programming languages\nthat are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to natural\nlanguage) than machine language. High-level languages are compiled or\ninterpreted into machine language object code. Software may also be written in\nan assembly language, essentially, a mnemonic representation of a machine\nlanguage using a natural language alphabet. Assembly language must be assembled\ninto object code via an assembler.\n","title":"software","headings":["History","Types of software","Software topics","Design and implementation","Industry and organizations","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["11: Application_software"," 6: Operating_system"," 4: Computer_program"," 3: Computer_hardware"," 3: Firmware"," 3: Compiler"," 3: System_software"," 3: Computer_system"," 3: Microsoft_Word"," 3: Microsoft_Windows"," 2: Computer_processor"," 2: Source_code"," 2: Interpreter"," 2: Assembly_language"," 2: Software_engineering"," 2: Information"," 2: Bill_Gates"," 2: Data_center"," 2: Software_patent"," 2: Linux"," 2: Device_driver"," 2: Integrated_development_environment"," 2: Microsoft_Office"," 2: Sun_Microsystems"," 2: Novell"," 2: Microsoft"," 1: Non-volatile_memory"," 1: Machine_code"," 1: Binary_code"," 1: Embedded_software"," 1: Embedded_systems"," 1: Digital_electronics"," 1: Terminology"," 1: High-level_programming_language"," 1: Natural_language"," 1: Mnemonic"," 1: Alan_Turing"," 1: Data"," 1: Computer_science"," 1: Moore's_law"," 1: Printed_circuit_board"," 1: Auto_industry"," 1: Software_industry"," 1: Prototype"," 1: Steve_Jobs"," 1: Henry_Ford"," 1: Louis_Chevrolet"," 1: Software_development"," 1: IBM_Personal_Computer"," 1: IBM"," 1: Philip_Don_Estridge"," 1: Crowd-sourcing"," 1: Original_equipment_manufacturer"," 1: Data_General"," 1: Digital_Equipment"," 1: Minicomputer"," 1: Pre-installed_software"," 1: Data_General_Nova"," 1: RDOS"," 1: Software_license"," 1: Supreme_Court"," 1: EMC_Corporation"," 1: Patent_troll"," 1: De_facto_standard"," 1: Spreadsheet"," 1: Software_development_methodology"," 1: Desktop_computer"," 1: Personal_computer_hardware"," 1: Programming_languages"," 1: Scripting_languages"," 1: Microcode"," 1: Field-programmable_gate_array"," 1: Web_pages"," 1: PHP"," 1: Perl"," 1: JavaServer_Pages"," 1: ASP.NET"," 1: Desktop_application"," 1: OpenOffice.org"," 1: C++"," 1: Objective-C"," 1: Smalltalk"," 1: Video_game"," 1: Logic"," 1: Automobile"," 1: Television"," 1: Consumer_electronics"," 1: Software_system"," 1: Programming_software"," 1: Computer_software"," 1: Software_utility"," 1: Window_system"," 1: Debugger"," 1: Text_editor"," 1: Embedded_system"," 1: Analog_computer"," 1: Supercomputer"," 1: Graphical_user_interface"," 1: Peripheral"," 1: Personal_computer"," 1: End-user_development"," 1: Word_processor"," 1: Computer_storage"," 1: Hard_drive"," 1: Computer_memory"," 1: Machine_language"," 1: Computation"," 1: Control_flow"," 1: Executable"," 1: Computer_configuration"," 1: Commercial_software"," 1: Software_bug"," 1: Software_testing"," 1: Unit_testing"," 1: Regression_testing"," 1: NASA"," 1: Free_software_license"," 1: Freeware"," 1: Shareware"," 1: Algorithm"," 1: Intellectual_property"," 1: Copyright_infringement"," 1: Microsoft_Notepad"," 1: Emacs"," 1: Microsoft_Visual_Studio"," 1: Application_programming_interface"," 1: GTK+"," 1: JavaBeans"," 1: Enterprise_application"," 1: Windows_Forms"," 1: Windows_Communication_Foundation"," 1: Web_service"," 1: Computer_programming"," 1: Concept"," 1: Quicksort"," 1: Hash_table"," 1: Array_data_type"," 1: Binary_tree"," 1: .NET_Framework"," 1: Software_library"," 1: Programmer"," 1: Software_engineer"," 1: Software_developer"," 1: Larry_Ellison"," 1: Oracle_database"," 1: Free_Software_Foundation"," 1: GNU_Project"," 1: Mozilla_Foundation"," 1: W3C"," 1: IETF"," 1: XML"," 1: HTML"," 1: HTTP"," 1: FTP"," 1: SAP_AG"," 1: Symantec"," 1: Adobe_Systems"," 1: Corel"," 1: List_of_software"]}
