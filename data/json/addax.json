It was first described by Henri de Blainville in 1816. As\nsuggested by its alternative name, this pale antelope has long, twisted horns\n- typically in females and in males. Males stand from at the shoulder, with\nfemales at . They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than\nmales. The colour of the coat depends on the season - in the winter, it is greyish-\nbrown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head,\nneck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or\nsandy blonde.\n\nThe addax mainly eats grasses and leaves of any available shrubs, leguminous\nherbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted to exist in their desert\nhabitat, as they can live without water for long periods of time. Addax form\nherds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led\nby the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target\nfor its predators: lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards.\nBreeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural\nhabitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.\n\nThe addax is a critically endangered species of antelope, as classified by the\nIUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting,\nit is quite common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa,\nnative to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya,\nSudan and western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"addax","recorded":1372152378,"links":[],"instances":["mammals","foot","genetics","anatomy","collector"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Grazing antelopes","Fauna of the Sahara","Mammals of Africa","Megafauna of Africa"],"headings":["Taxonomy and naming","Genetics","History and fossil record","Physical description","Behavior and ecology","Habitat and distribution","Threats and conservation","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["type","biology#syntype"],["william_bullock","collector"],["locus","genetics"],["horn","anatomy"],["sole","foot"],["pregnancy","mammals"]],"members":["pregnancy","sole","type","locus","horn","william_bullock"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Artiodactyla","Bovid","Hippotraginae","Charles_Léopold_Laurillard","Henri_Marie_Ducrotay_de_Blainville","Cretzschmar","Gaetano_Savi","John_Edward_Gray","Antelope","Sahara","Sexually_dimorphic","Critically_endangered","Antelope","IUCN","Species_description","Henri_Marie_Ducrotay_de_Blainville","Monotypic","Bovidae","William_Bullock_(collector)","Richard_Lydekker","Senegambia","Sahara","Tunisia","Arabic_language","Latin_language","Ungulate","Chromosome","Acrocentric","Autosome","Submetacentric","Locus_(genetics)","Hippotraginae","Caprinae","Bovinae","Arabia","Levant","Egypt","Sexually_dimorphic","Horn_(anatomy)","Hoof","Sole_(foot)","Dewclaw","Scent_gland","Scimitar_oryx","Nematode","Abomasum","Nocturnal","Dust_storm","Predation","Lions","Human","Lycaon_pictus","Cheetahs","Leopards","Caracals","Hyenas","Servals","Dehydration","Urine","Thermoregulation","Shrubs","Leguminous","Seeds","Sexually_mature","Blood_serum","Immunoassay","Luteal_phase","Estrous_cycle","Obstetric_ultrasonography","Ovarian_follicle","Corpus_luteum","Anovulatory_cycle","Ovulation","Estrous_cycle","Pregnancy_(mammals)","Arid","Semideserts","Deserts","Termit_Massif_Reserve","Air_Mountains","Equey","North_Africa","Chad","Mauritania","Niger","Algeria","Egypt","Libya","Sudan","Morocco","Tunisia","Algeria","Sudan","Roadkill","Droughts","Deserts","Habitat_destruction","Human_settlements","Agriculture","Termit_Massif_Reserve","Bodélé_Depression","Chad","Yotvata_Hai-Bar_Nature_Reserve","Sabratha","Giza_Zoo","Hoggar_Mountains","Tasilli","Algeria","Ténéré","Ouadi_Rimé-Ouadi_Achim_Faunal_Reserve","Wadi_Howar_National_Park","Bou_Hedma_National_Park","Souss-Massa_National_Park","Jebil_National_Park","Grand_Erg_Oriental"]}
