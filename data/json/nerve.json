A nerve provides a\ncommon pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along\neach of the axons to peripheral organs.\n\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as tracts.<ref\nname=Purves></ref><ref name=Marieb></ref> Neurons are sometimes called nerve\ncells, though this term is potentially misleading since many neurons do not form\nnerves, and nerves also include non-neuronal Schwann cells that coat the axons\nin myelin.\n\nEach nerve is a cordlike structure that contains many axons. These axons are\noften referred to as \"fibres\". Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a\nlayer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. The axons are bundled\ntogether into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer\nof connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is\nwrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium.\n","title":"nerve","headings":["Anatomy","Physiology","Clinical importance","Growth and stimulation","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Central_nervous_system","2: Nerve_impulse","2: Endoneurium","2: Perineurium","2: Epineurium","2: Muscle","1: Axon","1: Neuron","1: Peripheral_nervous_system","1: Electrochemical","1: Neural_tract","1: Schwann_cells","1: Myelin","1: Sensory_neuron","1: Mechanoreceptors","1: Skin","1: Motor_neuron","1: Gland","1: Sense","1: Spinal_column","1: Spinal_cord","1: Vertebra","1: Brain","1: Brainstem","1: Roman_numerals","1: Cranial_nerve_zero","1: Connective_tissue","1: Sensory_receptor","1: Glycocalyx","1: Collagen","1: Blood_vessels","1: Blood–brain_barrier","1: Cerebro-spinal_fluid","1: Edema","1: Magnetic_resonance_neurography","1: Action_potential","1: Myelinated","1: Synapse","1: Electrical_synapse","1: Chemical_synapse","1: Perineural_spread","1: Prostate_cancer","1: H&E_stain","1: Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","1: Guillain-Barré_syndrome","1: Neuritis","1: Diabetes","1: Pain","1: Paralysis","1: Referred_pain","1: Neurology","1: Physical_examination","1: Reflex","1: Walking","1: Proprioception","1: Somatosensory_system","1: Nerve_conduction_study","1: Electromyography","1: Multiple_sclerosis","1: Macrophage","1: Notch_signaling","1: Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system","1: Nerve_fiber","1: Nerve_injury","1: Neuropathy","1: Peripheral_nerve_injury","1: Peripheral_nerve_injury_classification"]}
