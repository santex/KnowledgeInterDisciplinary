{"cursor":"2883","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Arnarsaq' (ca. 1716 â fl. 1778), was an Inuit translator, interpreter and\nmissionary, assistant to Paul Egede, Hans Glahn, and J. Sverdrup from Greenland.\nShe and Hans Punngujooq translated the Bible into the Inuit language. She had an\nimportant position in the Danish missionary among the Inuit on Greenland in the\n18th century, and has also been portrayed in fiction.\n\nArnarsaq came to Paul Egede in 1736 and asked to be taught how to come to God;\nshe converted and was baptized in 1737, and was allowed to keep her original\nname instead of being given a name from the Bible at her baptism, which was\nunusual. She is described as a critical debate partner of Egede. In her Bible\ntranslation, she prevented censorship and was able to present it the way she saw\nit: her interpretation of Christianity is considered to have had a large impact\nupon the version of Christianity accepted by the Inuit. She followed Egede to\nDenmark in 1740. She visited the Danish royal court in 1740, where she was\npresented with an Inuit boy to the court as a curiosity. In 1741, she was sent\nas a missionary to Greenland, where she rivaled the missionaries of the Moravian\nChurch. In 1743, she retired to her home in the Disko area for twenty years. She\nwas not popular among the Inuit, lecturing them about how they should live\naccording to the Christian faith. She never married. From 1763, she was again\nthe interpreter and assistant to the Danish mission. She had an important and\ninfluential position among the missionaries, as she was the link between them\nand the Inuit, whose language they could not understand. The year of her death\nis unknown; the last year she is mentioned is 1778.\n\nArnarsaq is portrayed in the novel of B. S. Ingemann, Kunuk og Naja (1842),\nwhich was written with support of the reports of the missionaries: in the novel,\nshe is described as a religious old woman, pointed out by the Inuit as an\nIlisiitsoq; a witch.\n\nArnarsaq is one of a few Inuit, and the only female Inuit of her time, to be\nmentioned in Danish history.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Arnarsaq","recorded":1375071742,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Circa","/wiki/Floruit","/wiki/Inuit","/wiki/Translation","/wiki/Language_interpretation","/wiki/Missionary","/wiki/Paul_Egede","/w/index.php?title=Hans_Glahn&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Greenland","/wiki/Bible","/wiki/Inuit_languages","/wiki/God","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Denmark","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Denmark","/wiki/Moravian_Church","/wiki/Bernhard_Severin_Ingemann","/w/index.php?title=Ilisiitsoq&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Witchcraft","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=edit&section=2","http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1063/origin/170/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&oldid=550211685","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1716_births","/wiki/Category:Greenlandic_Inuit_people","/wiki/Category:Inuit_missionaries","/wiki/Category:Danish_Christian_missionaries","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_missing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arnarsaq&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arnarsaq","/wiki/Arnarsaq","/wiki/Talk:Arnarsaq","#","/wiki/Arnarsaq","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Arnarsaq","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Arnarsaq","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&oldid=550211685","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4569290","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Arnarsaq&id=550211685","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Arnarsaq","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Arnarsaq&oldid=550211685&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Arnarsaq&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnasaq","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnarsaq","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4569290#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnarsaq","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1716
