It is also the name for the\n[http://www.thresholdhouse.com/ official Coil website].\n\nThe label was initially a vanity label of sorts, as all releases were\nmanufactured and distributed by other labels, most prominently World Serpent\nDistribution. Following the bankruptcy of World Serpent,\nthe label continued independently.\n\nThe logo for Threshold House is a castle-like building, possibly what Coil have\nreferred to as \"The East Tower\" in past interviews, and a moon.
