{"cursor":"2763","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" from SeaWiFS]] for the period 1998 to 2006.]] 'SeaWiFS', 'Sea'-viewing 'Wi'de\n '''F'''ield-of-view 'S'ensor, was the only scientific instrument on GeoEye's\n OrbView-2 (AKA SeaStar) satellite, and was a follow-on experiment to the\n Coastal Zone Color Scanner on Nimbus 7.\n\nLaunched August 1, 1997 on an Orbital Sciences Pegasus small air-launched\nrocket, SeaWiFS began scientific operations on September 18, 1997 and stopped\ncollecting data on December 11, 2010. The sensor\nresolution is 1.1 km (LAC), 4.5 km (GAC). The sensor recorded\ninformation in the following optical bands:\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" !Band !Wavelength\n|- 1 402-422 nm - 2 433-453 nm - 3 480-500 nm - 4 500-520 nm - 5 545-565 nm - 6\n|660-680 nm - 7 745-785 nm - 8 845-885 nm }\n\nThe instrument was specifically designed to monitor ocean characteristics such\nas chlorophyll-a concentration and water clarity. It was able to tilt up to 20\ndegrees to avoid sunlight from the sea surface. This feature is important at\nequatorial latitudes where glint from sunlight often obscures water colour.\nSeaWiFS had used the Marine Optical Buoy for vicarious calibration.\n\nThe SeaWiFS Mission is an industry/government partnership, with NASA's Ocean\nBiology Processing Group at Goddard Space Flight Center having responsibility\nfor the data collection, processing, calibration, validation, archive and\ndistribution. The current SeaWiFS Project manager is Gene Carl Feldman.\n","linknr":203,"url":"SeaWiFS","recorded":1362505465,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Earth observation satellites","Satellite meteorology and remote sensing","NASA spin-off technologies","Oceanographic instrumentation"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Baikal-S1999276045323.png/220px-Baikal-S1999276045323.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/AYool_SEAWIFS_annual.png/220px-AYool_SEAWIFS_annual.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/US-Satellite.svg/40px-US-Satellite.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Field_of_view","Measuring_instrument","GeoEye","Satellite","Coastal_Zone_Color_Scanner","Nimbus_program","Orbital_Sciences","Rocket","Sensor_resolution","Optical","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Nanometre","Chlorophyll","NASA","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","Gene_Carl_Feldman"]}
