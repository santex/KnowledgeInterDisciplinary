Yeasts are unicellular,\nalthough some species with yeast forms may become multicellular through the\nformation of a string of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae, or\nfalse hyphae, as seen in most molds. Yeast size can vary\ngreatly depending on the species, typically measuring 3â4 Âµm in diameter,\nalthough some yeasts can reach over 40 Âµm. Most yeasts\nreproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by an asymmetric division\nprocess called budding.\n\nBy fermentation, the yeast species [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] converts\ncarbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols â for thousands of years the\ncarbon dioxide has been used in baking and the alcohol in alcoholic\nbeverages. It is also a centrally important model organism\nin modern cell biology research, and is one of the most thoroughly researched\neukaryotic microorganisms. Researchers have used it to gather information about\nthe biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology. Other species of yeast, such as [[Candida albicans]], are\nopportunistic pathogens and can cause infections in humans. Yeasts have recently\nbeen used to generate electricity in microbial fuel cells, and produce ethanol for the biofuel industry.\n\nYeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term yeast\nis often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their\nplacement in two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. The\nbudding yeasts (\"true yeasts\") are classified in the order\nSaccharomycetales.\n","linknr":1186,"url":"Yeasts","recorded":1362503434,"links":107,"instances":["biochemistry","yeast","cell_biology","biology","biology","genetics","biology","biology","chemistry","food","biochemistry","ethnic_group","food"],"pdf":["http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/purl/2035/Marine%20yeasts-a%20rewiew.pdf","http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/purl/2035/Marine%20yeasts-a%20rewiew.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060921160928/http://www.gwrdc.com.au/downloads/0506docs/researcher.pdf","http://www.reviberoammicol.com/2006-23/067074.pdf","http://www.reviberoammicol.com/2006-23/067074.pdf","http://www.brupharm.com.ua/files/bibliography/enterol/eng/enterol21.pdf","http://www.brupharm.com.ua/files/bibliography/enterol/eng/enterol21.pdf","http://www.sboulardii.com/Florastor_files/gd20051131228461.pdf","http://www.sboulardii.com/Florastor_files/gd20051131228461.pdf","http://biochemie.web.med.uni-muenchen.de/Yeast_Biol/10%20Yeast%20Growth%20and%20the%20Cell%20Cycle.pdf"],"categories":["Brewing
