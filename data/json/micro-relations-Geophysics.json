{"cursor":"37642","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{stack| }} 'Geophysics' () is the physics of the Earth and its environment in\nspace; also the study of the Earth using quantitative physical methods. The term\ngeophysics sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's shape;\nits gravitational and magnetic fields; its internal structure and composition;\nits dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of\nmagmas, volcanism and rock formation. However,\nmodern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the\nhydrological cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the\natmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and\nsolar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and\nother planets.\n\nAlthough geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th\ncentury, its origins go back to ancient history. The first magnetic compasses\ndate back to the fourth century BC and the first seismoscope was built in 132\nBC. Geophysical methods were developed for navigation; Isaac Newton applied his\ntheory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox; and\ninstruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity\nfield, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century,\ngeophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and\nthe ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the\ntheory of plate tectonics.\n\nGeophysics is applied to societal needs, such as mineral resources, mitigation\nof natural hazards and environmental protection. Geophysical\nsurvey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral\ndeposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the\nthickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.\n","linknr":1211,"url":"Geophysics","recorded":1362505518,"links":113,"instances":["deformation","electromagnetic","meteorology","geology","electromagnetic","journal","electrolytic","united_states","radio","geology","physics","lightning","astronomy","astronomer","geology","astronomy","physics","heat"],"pdf":["http://www.environmental-geophysics.co.uk/documents/ref_manual/TechRef.pdf"],"categories":["Applied
