For motion\nin one dimension, velocity can be defined as the slope of the position vs. time\ngraph of an object. Speed describes only how fast an object is moving, whereas\nvelocity gives both how fast and in what direction the object is moving.<ref>\nThis is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector\nphysics.</ref> If a car is said to travel at 60&nbsp;km/h, its speed has been\nspecified. However, if the car is said to move at 60&nbsp;km/h to the north, its\nvelocity has now been specified. To have a 'constant velocity', an object must\nhave a constant speed in a constant direction. Constant direction constrains the\nobject to motion in a straight path (the object's path does not curve). Thus, a\nconstant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant speed. If there\nis a change in speed, direction, or both, then the object is said to have a\nchanging velocity and is undergoing an [[acceleration]]. For example, a car\nmoving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant\nspeed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes.\nHence, the car is considered to be undergoing an acceleration.\n\nVelocity is a vector physical quantity; both magnitude and direction are\nrequired to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is\ncalled \"speed\", a quantity that is measured in metres per second (m/s or\nm⋅s<sup>−1</sup>) when using the SI (metric) system. For example, \"5 metres per\nsecond\" is a scalar (not a vector), whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a\nvector. The rate of change of velocity (in m/s) as a function of time (in s) is\n\"acceleration\" (in m/s<sup>2</sup> – stated \"metres per second per second\"),\nwhich describes how an object's speed and direction of travel change at each\npoint in time.\n",
