Thanissaro nevertheless notes\nthat, contrary to what is actually said in the Canon, such a notion is expressed\nby some modern scholars as if it were pan-Buddhist. Thanissaro further writes:\n\"This understanding of the khandhas isn't confined to scholars. Almost any\nmodern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar way.\nAnd it isn't a modern innovation. It was first proposed at the beginning of the\ncommon era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons â both the\nTheravadin and the Sarvastivadin, which formed the basis for Mahayana\nscholasticism.\" They serve as objects of clinging and bases for a sense of\nself. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Handful of Leaves Volume 2, 2nd edition 2006, page\n309. }} The Buddha teaches that nothing among them is really \"I\" or \"mine\".\n\nIn the Theravada tradition, suffering arises when one identifies with or clings\nto an aggregate. Suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to\naggregates.\n\nThe Mahayana tradition further puts forth that ultimate freedom is realized by\ndeeply penetrating the nature of all aggregates as intrinsically empty of\nindependent existence.\n","linknr":1067,"url":"Skandha","recorded":1362562516,"links":50,"instances":["buddhism","buddhism","fallacy","negative","philosophy","norm"],"pdf":["http://www.ocbs.org/research/SabhaavaN.pdf","http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Buddhism_in_China.pdf","http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Buddhism_in_China.pdf"],"categories":["Buddhist philosophical concepts","Buddhist terms"],"headings":["Etymology","Description in the Sutta Pitaka","Understanding in Theravada Abhidhamma","Understanding in the Mahayana-tradition","See also","Notes","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/100px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/16px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phenomenology","philosophy"],["āgama","buddhism"],["reification","fallacy"],["convention","norm"],["āgama","buddhism"],["mu","negative"],["atman","buddhism"]],"members":["āgama","atman","reification","mu","phenomenology","convention"],"related":["Buddhism","Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Soteriology","Sanskrit","Pāli","Thanissaro_Bhikkhu","Pali_Canon","Gautama_Buddha","Theravada","Dukkha","Upadana","Nibbana","Mahayana","Nirvana","Prajnaparamita","Shunyata","Svabhava","Sutta_Pitaka","Pali_Canon","Theravada","Rūpa","Vedanā","Saññā","Saṅkhāra","Viññāṇa","Samyutta_Nikaya","Bhikkhu_Bodhi","Theravada","Nikaya","Dhamma","Thanissaro_Bhikkhu","Samyutta_Nikaya","Dukkha","Four_Noble_Truths","Four_Noble_Truths","Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta","Gautama_Buddha","Four_Noble_Truths","Samyutta_Nikaya","Pāli_Canon","Āgama_(Buddhism)","Samyutta_Nikaya","Samyutta_Nikaya","Vipassana","Satipatthana_Sutta","Majjhima_Nikaya","Satipatthana_Sutta","Anapanasati_Sutta","Majjhima_Nikaya","Khuddaka_Nikaya","Visuddhimagga","Buddhaghosa","Anicca","Dukkha","Anatta","Samyutta_Nikaya","Reification_(fallacy)","Dependent_arising","Ontology","Convention_(norm)","Skandhas","Dukkha","Pre-sectarian_Buddhism","Sutta_Pitaka","Āgama_(Buddhism)","Early_Buddhist_schools","Abhidharma","Majjhima_Nikaya","Samyutta_Nikaya","Ayatana","Ayatana","Anatta","Tanha","Ayatana","Bāhirāni","Ayatana","Ajjhattikāni","Viññāṇa","Abhidhamma","Pali_literature","Sutta_Pitaka","Nibbana","Twelve_Nidanas","Mahayana","Sunyata","Bodhisattva","Prajnaparamita","Sunyata","Pratītyasamutpāda","Heart_Sutra","Heart_Sutra","Avalokiteshvara","Bodhisattva","Prajnaparamita","Svabhava","Svabhava","Pali","Shunyata","Middle_way","Mūlamadhyamakakārikā","Nagarjuna","Sarvastivada","Eight_consciousnesses","Tathāgatagarbha_Sutras","Buddha-nature","Tao","Sunyata","Mu_(negative)","Samvriti","Paramartha","Heart_Sutra","Daisetz_Teitaro_Suzuki","Tathāgatagarbha_Sutras","Mahayana_Mahaparinirvana_Sutra","Vajrayana","Mahamudra","Vajrayana","Chogyam_Trungpa","Avijja","Vidya","Dualistic","Tibetan_Book_of_the_Dead","Bardo","Anatta","Atman_(Buddhism)","Nagarjuna","Pratitya-samutpada","Samsara","Sankhāra","Schools_of_Buddhism","Shunyata","Tathagatagarbha_doctrine","Ti-lakkhana","Nyanaponika_Thera","Piyadassi_Thera","Thanissaro_Bhikkhu","Digha_Nikaya","Samyutta_Nikaya","Bhikkhu_Bodhi","Buddhist_Publication_Society","Buddhaghosa","Thich_Nhat_Hanh","D.T._Suzuki","Chögyam_Trungpa"]}
