Vacuoles are essentially enclosed compartments which are\nfilled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes\nin solution, though in certain cases they may contain solids which have been\nengulfed. Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and\nare effectively just larger forms of these. Brooker, Robert J, et al.\n(2007). Biology (First Edition), (McGraw-Hill, New York), p. 79 ISBN 0-07-326807-\n0. The organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies\naccording to the needs of the cell.\n\nThe function and importance of vacuoles varies greatly according to the type of\ncell in which they are present, having much greater prominence in the cells of\nplants, fungi and certain protists than those of animals and bacteria. In\ngeneral, the functions of the vacuole include:\n\n*Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell *Containing\nwaste products *Containing water in plant cells *Maintaining internal\nhydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell *Maintaining an acidic internal\npH *Containing small molecules *Exporting unwanted substances from the cell\n*Allows plants to support structures such as leaves and flowers due to the\npressure of the central vacuole *In seeds, stored proteins needed for\ngermination are kept in 'protein bodies', which are modified\nvacuoles. Matile, Phillipe (1993) Chapter 18: Vacuoles, discovery of\nlysosomal origin in Discoveries in Plant Biology: v. 1 (World Scientific\nPublishing Co Pte Ltd)\n\nVacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between\nbiogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and\ncell structures in certain organisms. They also aid in the lysis and recycling\nof misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell.

In protists, vacuoles have the additional function of storing food\nwhich has been absorbed by the organism and assisting in the digestive and waste\nmanagement process for the cell.\n","linknr":374,"url":"Vacuole","recorded":1362372931,"links":74,"instances":["biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organelles","Plant anatomy","Cell anatomy"],"headings":["Bacteria","Plants","Fungi","Animals","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Plant_cell_structure_svg_vacuole.svg/300px-Plant_cell_structure_svg_vacuole.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Biological_cell_vacuole.svg/300px-Biological_cell_vacuole.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Rhoeo_Discolor_-_Plasmolysis.jpg/220px-Rhoeo_Discolor_-_Plasmolysis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Plant_cell_showing_primary_and_secondary_wall_by_CarolineDahl.jpg/220px-Plant_cell_showing_primary_and_secondary_wall_by_CarolineDahl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["vesicle","biology"],["cell","biology"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","cell","morphology"],"related":["Biological_membrane","Organelle","Plant_cell","Fungi","Cell_(biology)","Protist","Animal","Bacteria","Enzymes","Solutes","Vesicle_(biology)","Hydrostatic_pressure","Turgor","Acid","PH","Autophagy","Biogenesis","Bacteria","Robert_B_Mellor","Genera","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Nitrate","Organelle","Cyanobacteria","Plant_cell","Cytoplasm","Proton","PH","Proton_motive_force","Degradative_enzyme","Meristems","Vascular_cambium","Turgor","Cell_wall","Aquaporins","Active_transport","Potassium","Ion","Osmosis","Cell_(biology)","Plasmolysis","Expansin","Chloroplasts","Herbivore","Alliin","Alliinase","Allicin","Syn-propanethial-S-oxide","Onion","Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","Morphology_(biology)","Homeostasis","Osmoregulation","Amino_acids","Polyphosphate","Strontium","Cobalt","Lead","Exocytosis","Endocytosis","Golgi_apparatus","Phagocytosis","Invagination","Pinocytosis","Lysosomes","Mammal"]}
