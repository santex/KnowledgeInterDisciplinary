{"cursor":"4167","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] In mechanics, 'compression' is the application of opposite \"pushing\" forces\nto a material or structure, that is, balanced forces directed so as to reduce\nits size in one or more directions. It is contrasted with tension or traction,\nthe application of balanced \"pulling\" forces.\n\nIn 'uniaxial compression' the forces are directed along one direction only, so\nthat they act towards decreasing the object's length along that direction. The\ncompressive forces may also be applied in multiple directions; for example\ninwards along the edges of a plate, acting to reduce its area, or inwards over\nthe entire surface of a body, acting to reduce its volume.\n\nTechnically, a material is under a state of compression, at some specific point\nand along a specific direction u , if the normal component of the\nstress vector across a surface with normal u is directed opposite\nto u . If the stress vector itself is opposite to u ,\nthe material is said to be under 'normal compression' or 'pure compressive\nstress' along u . In a solid, the amount of compression generally\ndepends on the direction u , and the material may be under\ncompression along some directions but under traction along others. If the\nstress vector is purely compressive and has the same magnitude for all\ndirections, the material is said to be under 'isotropic' or 'hydrostatic\ncompression' at that point.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Compression_(physical)","recorded":1362890852,"links":21,"instances":["engine","physics","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Continuum mechanics","Mechanical engineering"],"headings":["Explanation","In engines","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Compression_test.jpg/250px-Compression_test.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b774effe4a349c6dd82ad4f4f21d34c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tension","physics"],["stress","mechanics"],["stress","physics"],["tension","mechanics"],["cylinder","engine"]],"members":["cylinder","stress","tension"],"related":["Mechanics","Tension_(physics)","Area","Volume","Normal_stress","Stress_(mechanics)","Surface_normal","Materials_science","Physics","Structural_engineering","Stress_(physics)","Tension_(mechanics)","Compressive_strength","Modulus_of_elasticity","Scientist","Engineer","Internal_combustion_engine","Otto_cycle","Steam_engine","Cylinder_(engine)","Piston","Box_compression_test","Buckling","Compression_member","Longitudinal_wave","P-wave","Rarefaction","Strength_of_materials"]}
