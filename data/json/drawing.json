Instruments used include graphite\npencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoal,\nchalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals\n(such as silverpoint). An artist who practices or works in drawing may be called\na [[draftsman]] or\ndraughtsman.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/draftsman</ref>\n\nA small amount of material is released onto the two dimensional medium,\nleaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper,\nalthough other materials, such as cardboard, plastic, leather, canvas, and\nboard, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or\nwhiteboard or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and\nfundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of\nthe simplest and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.<ref\nname=SBTCModule6></ref> The wide availability of drawing instruments makes\ndrawing more common than other media.\n","title":"drawing","headings":["Overview","History","Materials","Technique","Tone","Form and proportion","Perspective","Artistry","Digital illustration","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Figure_drawing","2: Graphite","2: Charcoal","2: Pastel","2: Silverpoint","2: Chiaroscuro","2: Shading","2: Technical_drawing","2: Leonardo_da_Vinci","2: Ruler","2: Hatching","1: Louvre","1: Visual_art","1: Pencil","1: Pen_and_ink","1: Ink","1: Brush","1: Color_pencil","1: Crayon","1: Chalk","1: Marker_pen","1: Stylus","1: Paper","1: Paperboard","1: Leather","1: Canvas","1: Lumber","1: Blackboard","1: Whiteboard","1: Grisaille","1: List_of_artistic_mediums#Drawing","1: Underdrawing","1: Cartooning","1: Doodling","1: Surrealist_techniques#Entopic_graphomania","1: Museum_of_Modern_Art","1: Prehistoric","1: Silver","1: Paper#Papermaking_arrives_in_the_Middle_East","1: Albrecht_Dürer","1: Michelangelo","1: Raphael","1: Claude_Lorrain","1: Nicolas_Poussin","1: Rembrandt_Harmenszoon_van_Rijn","1: Guercino","1: Peter_Paul_Rubens","1: Jean-Honoré_Fragonard","1: Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo","1: Antoine_Watteau","1: Paul_Cézanne","1: Aubrey_Beardsley","1: Jacques_Louis_David","1: Pierre-Paul_Prud'hon","1: Edgar_Degas","1: Théodore_Géricault","1: Francisco_Goya","1: Jean_Ingres","1: Odilon_Redon","1: Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec","1: Honoré_Daumier","1: Vincent_van_Gogh","1: Käthe_Kollwitz","1: Max_Beckmann","1: Jean_Dubuffet","1: George_Grosz","1: Egon_Schiele","1: Arshile_Gorky","1: Paul_Klee","1: Oscar_Kokoschka","1: Alphonse_Mucha","1: M._C._Escher","1: André_Masson","1: Jules_Pascin","1: Pablo_Picasso","1: Pastels","1: Conté","1: Invisible_ink","1: Wood_pulp","1: Newsprint","1: Drawing_board","1: Pencil_sharpener","1: Eraser","1: Blotting_paper","1: Circle_compass","1: Set_square","1: Drafting_tape","1: Hatching_system","1: Stipple","1: Erasers","1: Frisket","1: Tortillon","1: Facial_tissue","1: Kneaded_eraser","1: Chamois_leather","1: Stippling","1: Straightedge","1: William-Adolphe_Bouguereau","1: Artistic_merit","1: Three-point_lighting","1: Negative_space","1: Computer_art","1: Digital_data","1: Graphics_tablet","1: Computer_mouse","1: Generative_art","1: Photo_manipulation","1: Academy_figure","1: Architectural_drawing","1: Color_theory","1: Diagram","1: Digital_illustration","1: Engineering_drawing","1: GPS_drawing","1: Graphic_design","1: Illustration","1: Multi-Sketch","1: Pen","1: Traditional_animation","1: Lettering_template"]}
