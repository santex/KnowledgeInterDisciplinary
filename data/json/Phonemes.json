The phoneme\ncan be described as \"The smallest contrastive linguistic unit which may bring\nabout a change of meaning\". In this way the difference in meaning\nbetween the English words kill and kiss is a result of the exchange of the\nphoneme /l/ for the phoneme /s/. Two words that differ in meaning through a\ncontrast of a single phoneme are called minimal pairs.\n\nWithin linguistics there are differing views as to exactly what phonemes are and\nhow a given language should be analyzed in phonemic terms. However, a phoneme is\ngenerally regarded as an abstraction of a set (or equivalence class) of speech\nsounds ([[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]) which are perceived as equivalent to each\nother in a given language. For example, in English, the \"k\" sounds in the words\nkit and skill are not identical (as described below), but they are\ndistributional variants of a single phoneme, . Different speech sounds\nrepresenting the same phoneme are known as allophones, and such variation may be\nconditioned, in which case a certain phoneme is realized as a certain allophone\nin particular phonological environments, or it may be free in which case it may\nvary randomly. In this way, phonemes are often considered to constitute an\nabstract underlying representation for words, while speech sounds make up the\ncorresponding phonetic realization, or surface form.\n","linknr":461,"url":"Phonemes","recorded":1362480827,"links":103,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","punctuation","linguistics","orthography","phonetics","linguistics","linguistics","sign_language","linguistics","phonetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orthography","Phonetics","Phonology"],"headings":["Notation","Assignment
