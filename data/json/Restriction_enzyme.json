{"cursor":"44615","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'restriction enzyme' (or 'restriction [[endonuclease]]') is an enzyme that\ncuts DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction\nsites. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into three types, which\ndiffer in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their\nrecognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one\nanother. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through\neach sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.\n\nThese enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and probably evolved to provide\na defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterium, the restriction enzymes\nselectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction; while host DNA\nis protected by a modification enzyme (a methylase) that modifies the bacterial\nDNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes form the restriction\nmodification system.\n\nOver 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more than 600 of\nthese are available commercially. These enzymes\nare routinely used for DNA modification and manipulation in laboratories, and\nare a vital tool in molecular cloning.\n","linknr":970,"url":"Restriction_enzyme","recorded":1362480576,"links":48,"instances":["biology","molecular_biology","scientist","biology","biology","biology","dna"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Biotechnology","Restriction enzymes|","EC 3.1"],"headings":["History","Recognition site","Types","Nomenclature","Applications","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/20px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/EcoRV_Restriction_Site.rsh.svg/220px-EcoRV_Restriction_Site.rsh.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg/90px-EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/SmaI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg/90px-SmaI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/1QPS.png/220px-1QPS.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["enzyme_substrate","biology"],["thomas_j._kelly","scientist"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["mechanism","biology"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["strain","biology"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["mechanism","complementarity","enzyme_substrate","strain","polymorphism","upstream_and_downstream"],"related":["Enzyme","DNA","Nucleotide","Restriction_sites","Enzyme_substrate_(biology)","Bacteria","Archaea","Virus","Methylase","DNA_methylation","Restriction_modification_system","Molecular_cloning","Lambda_phage","Salvador_Luria","Werner_Arber","Matthew_Meselson","Hamilton_O._Smith","Thomas_J._Kelly_(scientist)","HindII","Daniel_Nathans","Simian_virus_40","Polyacrylamide_gel_electrophoresis","Nobel_Prize_for_Physiology_or_Medicine","Recombinant_DNA","Insulin","Diabetes","Palindromic_sequence","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","EcoRI","5'_end","3'_end","DNA_end","Neoschizomer","Isoschizomer","Enzyme_cofactor","Translocation","S-Adenosyl_methionine","Adenosine_triphosphate","Magnesium","Ion","Methyl","Protein_dimer","EcoRI","DNA","Magnesium","Monomer","Homodimer","Nomenclature","Multimer","Allosteric_regulation","Protein_dimer","Prokaryote","Mechanism_(biology)","Protein","Methyltransferase","Enzyme","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Methylate","DNA_methyltransferase","Protein_motif","Sequence_motif","S-adenosyl-L-methionine","Catalytic","DNA_binding_domain","Nuclease","FokI","Zinc_finger_nucleases","Genetic_engineering","Gene_cloning","TAL_effector","Genus","Species","Strain_(biology)","EcoRI","Plasmid","Gene_cloning","Protein_expression","Multiple_cloning_site","DNA_ligase","Allele","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Genotype","Gene_sequencing","Gel_electrophoresis","Restriction_map","Genomic","Southern_blot","Paralogue","Mutation","Polymorphism_(biology)","Restriction_Fragment_Length_Polymorphism","EcoRI","EcoRII","BamHI","HindIII","TaqI","NotI","HinfI","Sau3A","PvuII","SmaI","HaeIII","HgaI","AluI","EcoRV","EcoP15I","KpnI","PstI","SacI","SalI","ScaI","SpeI","SphI","StuI","XbaI","EcoRI","HindIII","BglII","List_of_restriction_enzyme_cutting_sites","Homing_endonuclease","List_of_homing_endonuclease_cutting_sites","Isoschizomer","Star_activity","Molecular_weight_size_marker"]}
