{"cursor":"73884","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" aquatic and terrestrial food web. ]]\n\nA 'food web' (or 'food cycle') depicts feeding connections (what-eats-what) in\nan ecological community and hence is also referred to as a consumer-resource\nsystem. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories\ncalled trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain\ntheir bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter\nfrom inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon\ndioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the\nsun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from\nhydrothermal vents and hot springs. A gradient exists between trophic levels\nrunning from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from\nthe atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic\norganisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the\natmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter.\nThe linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where\nheterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other\nheterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods\nof feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are\ndifferent kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory,\ncarnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by\nheterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come\nin all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant\nredwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.\n\nCharles Elton pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size\nin his classical 1927 book \"Animal Ecology\"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced\nby 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Elton organized species into\nfunctional groups, which was the basis for Raymond Lindeman's classic and\nlandmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. Lindeman emphasized the important\nrole of decomposer organisms in a trophic system of classification. The notion\nof a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and\nhis terminology, including an \"entangled bank\", \"web of life\", \"web of complex\nrelations\", and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he\ntalked about \"the continued movement of the particles of earth\". Even earlier,\nin 1768 John Bruckner described nature as \"one continued web of life\".\n\nFood webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily\naggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups of\nspecies that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use\nthese simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical) models of trophic or consumer-\nresource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for\ngeneralized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have\nidentified non-random properties in the topographic structure of food webs.\nPublished examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with\nomissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the\nrise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using network theory had\nidentified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a\nrelationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels\nof species richness.\n","linknr":1264,"url":"Food_web","recorded":1362372955,"links":142,"instances":["food_chain","ecological","ecology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://eeb19.biosci.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/Proulx%20Promislow%20Phillips%20networks%20ecol%20evol.pdf","http://eeb19.biosci.arizona.edu/Faculty/Dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/Proulx%20Promislow%20Phillips%20networks%20ecol%20evol.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/71_Pimm_Lawton_Cohen_Nature.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/71_Pimm_Lawton_Cohen_Nature.pdf","http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf","http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN621/Spring2011/Azam%20et%20al_loop.pdf","http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/courses/OCN621/Spring2011/Azam%20et%20al_loop.pdf","http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/GIteam/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Uroz-TiM-2009.pdf","http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/GIteam/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Uroz-TiM-2009.pdf","http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~parker/bio840/pdfs/WilliamsMartinez2000.pdf","http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~parker/bio840/pdfs/WilliamsMartinez2000.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/post02TREE.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/post02TREE.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/12_Pimm_TPB_1979.pdf","http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/12_Pimm_TPB_1979.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/McCann_2007_biostructure.pdf","http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/McCann_2007_biostructure.pdf","http://myweb.dal.ca/br238551/thompson_hem_star_shur_ecology07.pdf","http://myweb.dal.ca/br238551/thompson_hem_star_shur_ecology07.pdf","http://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/ecocomunidades/Lindman_1942.pdf","http://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/ecocomunidades/Lindman_1942.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/hairston93AmNat.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/hairston93AmNat.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/fretwell_food_chain_dynamics_oikos.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/fretwell_food_chain_dynamics_oikos.pdf","http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/Polis_1996_AmerNat.pdf","http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/Polis_1996_AmerNat.pdf","http://www.nd.edu/~underc/east/publications/documents/Hoekman2010b.pdf","http://www.nd.edu/~underc/east/publications/documents/Hoekman2010b.pdf","http://www.cof.orst.edu/leopold/class-reading/Polis%202000.pdf","http://www.cof.orst.edu/leopold/class-reading/Polis%202000.pdf","http://nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_33/issue_4_part_2/0910.pdf","http://nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_33/issue_4_part_2/0910.pdf","http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/KooyAnde2004.pdf","http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/KooyAnde2004.pdf","http://people.math.gatech.edu/~weiss/pub/General_Mechanisms_Final.pdf","http://people.math.gatech.edu/~weiss/pub/General_Mechanisms_Final.pdf","http://www.rug.nl/biologie/onderzoek/onderzoekInstituten/cees/colloquia/pdf/elser_et_al2_2000.pdf","http://www.rug.nl/biologie/onderzoek/onderzoekInstituten/cees/colloquia/pdf/elser_et_al2_2000.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/pdfs/Koch%20papers/2009/Koch%20et%2009%20PSP%2015.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/pdfs/Koch%20papers/2009/Koch%20et%2009%20PSP%2015.pdf","http://www.bashanfoundation.org/gmaweb/pdfs/mangrovebalandra.pdf","http://www.bashanfoundation.org/gmaweb/pdfs/mangrovebalandra.pdf","http://www.nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_41/issue_7/1425.pdf","http://www.nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_41/issue_7/1425.pdf","http://www.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/May_2520_281988_29_1_.pdf","http://www.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/May_2520_281988_29_1_.pdf","http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/fulltext/2003/20030014.pdf","http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/pubs/fulltext/2003/20030014.pdf","http://www.biology.duke.edu/upe302/pdf%20files/Emily_BormannLikens1967.pdf","http://www.biology.duke.edu/upe302/pdf%20files/Emily_BormannLikens1967.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Fall2006/Papers/Polis_1997_Toward.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Fall2006/Papers/Polis_1997_Toward.pdf","http://ss1.webkreator.com.mx/4_2/000/000/00c/04a/Concepto%20de%20Ecosistema.pdf","http://ss1.webkreator.com.mx/4_2/000/000/00c/04a/Concepto%20de%20Ecosistema.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/Paine88Ecol.pdf","http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo955/Spring2005/food%20web%20seminar%20papers/Paine88Ecol.pdf","http://www.unifr.ch/biol/ecology/bersier/publications/Ecology_Banasek-Richter_2009_withAppendices.pdf","ht
