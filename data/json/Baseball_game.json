Players on\nthe batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team,\nwhich tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A\nplayer on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a\nteammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding\nwhenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team\nconstitutes an inning and nine innings make up a professional game. The team\nwith the most runs at the end of the game wins.\n\nEvolving from older bat-and-ball games, an early form of baseball was being\nplayed in England by the mid-eighteenth century. This game was brought by\nimmigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late\nnineteenth century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the\nUnited States. Baseball is now popular in North America, parts of Central and\nSouth America and the Caribbean, and parts of East Asia.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams\nare divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with\nthree divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is\ndetermined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. Five teams make the\nplayoffs from each league: the three regular season division winners, plus two\nwild card teams. Baseball is the leading team sport in both Japan and Cuba, and\nthe top level of play is similarly split between two leagues: Japan's Central\nLeague and Pacific League; Cuba's West League and East League. In the National\nand Central leagues, the pitcher is required to bat, per the traditional rules.\nIn the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a\ndesignated hitter, who bats for the pitcher. Each top-level team has a farm\nsystem of one or more minor league teams.\n","linknr":2005,"url":"Baseball_game","recorded":1362479234,"links":266,"instances":["baseball","sportswriter","strategy","gaming","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","am","sports","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","cricket","baseball","sport","baseball","composer","baseball","original","shape","baseball","author","ball","baseball","writer","baseball","baseball","game","am","baseball","baseball","sportswriter","baseball","baseball","song","sports","baseball","19th_century","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball"],"pdf":["http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011323/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/09_the_umpire.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011326/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011324/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules//06_the_batter.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205082219/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090205011326/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb
