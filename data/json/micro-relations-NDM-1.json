{"cursor":"22780","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'', the bacterium in which NDM-1 was first identified.]] 'Metallo-beta-lactamase-\n1' ('NDM-1') is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to\na broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. These include the antibiotics of the\ncarbapenem family, which are a mainstay for the treatment of antibiotic-\nresistant bacterial infections. The gene for NDM-1 is one member of a large gene\nfamily that encodes beta-lactamase enzymes called carbapenemases. Bacteria that\nproduce carbapenemases are often referred to in the news media as \"superbugs\"\nbecause infections caused by them are difficult to treat. Such bacteria are\nusually susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline.\n\nNDM-1 was first detected in a [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]] isolate from a Swedish\npatient of Indian origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in India,\nPakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, {{cite news\n| url = http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2010/09/new_drug-resist.html\n| title = New drug-resistant 'superbug' arrives in Mass. author = Stephen\n| Smith work = The Boston Globe date = 13 September 2010 accessdate = 18\n| September 2010\n}} Canada, Japan {{cite news\n| title = Japan confirms first case of superbug gene author = Shino Yuasa agency\n| = Associated Press work = The Boston Globe date = 8 September 2010 accessdate\n| = 18 September 2010\n}} and Brazil. {{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20101010-\n296916/Drug-resistant-bacteria-kills-18-in-Brazil | title = Drug-resistant\nbacteria kills 18 in Brazil\n| agency = Agence France-Presse work = Inquirer date = 10 October 2010\n| accessdate = 21 October 2010\n}} The most common bacteria that make this enzyme are Gram-negative such\nas [[Escherichia coli]] and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but the gene for NDM-1 can\nspread from one strain of bacteria to another by horizontal gene transfer.\n","linknr":659,"url":"NDM-1","recorded":1362500810,"links":37,"instances":["india","genetics","editor"],"pdf":["http://medind.nic.in/iau/t04/i2/iaut04i2p75.pdf","http://medind.nic.in/iau/t06/i1/iaut06i1p20.pdf"],"categories":["Bacterial enzymes","Bacteriology","Beta-lactam antibiotics","EC 3.5.2","Antibiotic resistance"],"headings":["Enzyme function","Origin and spread","Phenotypic detection of NDM-1","Indian response","''The Lancet'' apology and aftermath","First death","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Klebsiella_pneumoniae_01.png/220px-Klebsiella_pneumoniae_01.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Carbapenem.svg/200px-Carbapenem.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Colistin.svg/220px-Colistin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ministry_of_health_and_family_welfare","india"],["richard_horton","editor"],["transduction","genetics"]],"members":["ministry_of_health_and_family_welfare","transduction","richard_horton"],"related":["Enzyme","Bacteria","Antibiotic_resistance","Beta-lactam_antibiotic","Carbapenem","Gene_family","Beta-lactamase","Enzyme","Antibiotic_resistance","Polymyxin","Tigecycline","Sweden","India","India","Pakistan","United_Kingdom","United_States","The_Boston_Globe","Canada","Japan","Associated_Press","The_Boston_Globe","Brazil","Agence_France-Presse","Inquirer","Gram-negative_bacteria","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Carbapenem","Cell_wall","Beta-lactamase","Carbapenemase","Enzyme","Hydrolysis","North_Carolina","USA","Interspecific_competition","New_Delhi","India","Sweden","Mumbai","Coventry","United_Kingdom","Dialysis","Tigecycline","Colistin","Enterobacteriaceae","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Chennai","United_Kingdom","Chennai","Haryana","Pakistan","Plasmid","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Beta-lactam_antibiotic","Quinolone","Aminoglycoside","Polymyxin","Colistin","Ontario","British_Columbia","Alberta","Chemical_compound","GSK_299423","Antibiotic","Metallo_beta_lactamase","EDTA","Modified_Hodge_Test","Re-Modified_Hodge_Test","Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare_(India)","Multinational_corporation","Bharatiya_Janata_Party","University_of_Madras","Richard_Horton_(editor)","Ajai_R._Singh","Mens_Sana_Monographs","Belgium","Pakistan","Colistin","Antibiotic_resistance","Nosocomial_infection","Medical_tourism","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Transduction_(genetics)"]}
