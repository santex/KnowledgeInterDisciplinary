{"cursor":"92650","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" delivery of designed shRNA's and the mechanism of RNA interference in\n mammalian cells.]]\n\n'RNA interference' ('RNAi') is a biological process in which RNA molecules\ninhibit gene expression, typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA\nmolecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression,\npost transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these\napparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that\nthey all described the RNAi phenomenon. In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello\nshared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA\ninterference in the nematode worm C. elegans, which they published in 1998.\n\nTwo types of small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules â microRNA (miRNA) and\nsmall interfering RNA (siRNA) â are central to RNA interference. RNAs are\nthe direct products of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity,\nfor example by preventing an mRNA from producing a protein. RNA interference has\nan important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide\nsequences â viruses and transposons â but also in directing\ndevelopment as well as gene expression in general.\n\nThe RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes including animals and is initiated\nby the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules\ninto short double stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotides that are called siRNAs.\nEach siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded (ss) ssRNAs, namely the passenger\nstrand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded, and the guide\nstrand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most\nwell-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when\nthe guide strand base pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA\nmolecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute, the catalytic component of the RISC\ncomplex. In some organisms, this process is known to spread systemically,\ndespite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.\n\nRNAi has become a valuable research tool, both in cell culture and in living\norganisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and\nrobustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi may be used for\nlarge-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which\ncan help identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or\nan event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in\nbiotechnology and medicine.\n","linknr":1720,"url":"RNAi","recorded":1362569279,"links":62,"instances":["evolution","molecular_biology","biology","chemistry","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","RNA
