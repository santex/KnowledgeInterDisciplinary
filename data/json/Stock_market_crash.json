{"cursor":"13234","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'stock market crash' is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a\nsignificant cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of\npaper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic\nfactors. They often follow speculative stock market bubbles.\n\nStock market crashes are social phenomena where external economic events combine\nwith crowd behavior and psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by\nsome market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally\nspeaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: Galbraith,\nJ. The Great Crash 1929, 1988 edition, Houghton Mifflin Co. Boston, p.xii-\nxvii a prolonged period of rising stock prices and excessive economic\noptimism, a market where P/E ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use\nof margin debt and leverage by market participants.\n\nThere is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term\ncommonly applies to steep double-digit percentage losses in a stock market index\nover a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets\nby panic selling and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Bear markets are periods\nof declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years. While\ncrashes are often associated with bear markets, they do not necessarily go hand\nin hand. The crash of 1987, for example, did not lead to a bear market.\nLikewise, the Japanese Nikkei bear market of the 1990s occurred over several\nyears without any notable crashes.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Stock_market_crash","recorded":1362484696,"links":33,"instances":["economic","finance","economics","1987"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stock market crashes|","Business failures"],"headings":["Wall Street Crash of 1929","Trading curbs","Mathematical theory and stock market crashes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg/200px-Crowd_outside_nyse.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["margin","economics"],["black_monday","1987"],["leverage","finance"],["crisis","economic"]],"members":["crisis","leverage","margin","black_monday"],"related":["Stock","Stock_market","Paper_wealth","Panic","Speculation","Stock_market_bubble","Social_phenomenon","Economy","Crowd_psychology","Positive_feedback","Optimism","P/E_ratio","Margin_(economics)","Stock_market_index","Bear_markets","Panic_selling","Black_Monday_(1987)","Nikkei_225","Roaring_Twenties","Electric_power_transmission","Radio_Corporation_of_America","General_Motors","Wall_Street","Mutual_fund","Investment_trust","Goldman_Sachs","Leverage_(finance)","Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average","Black_Thursday","Ticker_tape","Telephone_line","Margin_call","Great_Depression","Crisis_(economic)","Trading_curb","Trading_halt","France","Log-normal_distribution","Benoît_Mandelbrot","Non-linear","Chaos_theory","George_Soros","Robert_Prechter","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Power_law","Didier_Sornette","Self-organized_criticality","Random_walk","Lévy_flight","Computer_simulation","New_England_Complex_Systems_Institute","Complex_systems","Hindenburg_Omen","List_of_stock_market_crashes","Behavioral_finance","Business_cycle","Dot-com_bubble","Economic_bubble","Economic_collapse","Economic_history","Encilhamento","Financial_market","Financial_crisis","Flight-to-liquidity","Market_trend","Modeling_and_analysis_of_financial_markets","Stock_market","Stock_market_boom","Stock_market_bubble","Financial_crisis_of_2007–2012","Great_Depression","Meltdown_Monday","Subprime_mortgage_crisis","Flash_crash"]}
