{"cursor":"26678","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", for class room demonstrations]] An 'electrostatic generator', or\n'electrostatic machine', is a mechanical device that produces [[static\nelectricity]], or electricity at high voltage and low continuous current. The\nknowledge of static electricity dates back to the earliest civilizations, but\nfor millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon,\nwithout a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By\nthe end of the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of\ngenerating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic\nmachines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became\nfundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity.\nElectrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform\nmechanical work into electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop\nelectrostatic charges of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only\nelectric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry\nelectric charge to a high potential electrode. The charge is generated by one of\ntwo methods: either the triboelectric effect (friction) or electrostatic\ninduction.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Electrostatic_generator","recorded":1362485728,"links":27,"instances":["physicist","chemist","painter","chicago","electricity","inventor","material","benedictine"],"pdf":["http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Energy/ESMotors.pdf"],"categories":["Electrical generators","Electrostatics","Historical scientific instruments"],"headings":["Description","Fringe science and devices","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Van_de_graaff_generator_sm.jpg/220px-Van_de_graaff_generator_sm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Elektrisiermaschine.jpg/222px-Elektrisiermaschine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Electrostatic_generator_Teylers_Museum.jpg/222px-Electrostatic_generator_Teylers_Museum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Holtz_influence_machine.jpg/160px-Holtz_influence_machine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Electrostaticgenerator.JPG/220px-Electrostaticgenerator.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["andrew_gordon","benedictine"],["benjamin_wilson","painter"],["insulator","electricity"],["conductor","material"],["william_nicholson","chemist"],["john_read","inventor"],["giuseppe_belli","physicist"],["museum_of_science_and_industry","chicago"]],"members":["giuseppe_belli","william_nicholson","benjamin_wilson","museum_of_science_and_industry","insulator","john_read","conductor","andrew_gordon"],"related":["High_voltage","Continuous_current","Phenomenon","Electricity","Mechanical_work","Electric_energy","Electrostatic","Electrical_charge","Electric_potential","Electrode","Triboelectric_effect","Electrostatic_induction","Van_de_Graaff_generator","Pelletron","Triboelectric_effect","Electrostatic_induction","Van_de_Graaff_generator","Teylers_Museum","Friction","Otto_von_Guericke","Isaac_Newton","Opticks","Francis_Hauksbee","Hauksbee,_Francis","Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","Georg_Matthias_Bose","Leipzig","Jesse_Ramsden","Martin_van_Marum","Teylers_Museum","Jan_Ingenhousz","Carpue","Andrew_Gordon_(Benedictine)","Benjamin_Wilson_(painter)","John_Canton","Edward_Nairne","Georg_Ohm","Deutsches_Museum","Surface_charge","Contact_electrification","Triboelectric_effect","Insulator_(electricity)","Rubber","Plastic","Glass","Pith","Conductor_(material)","Electric_current","Corona_discharge","Electrostatic_induction","Alessandro_Volta","Capacitor","Electric_charge","Electrostatic_induction","Electroscope","Erasmus_Darwin","William_Nicholson_(chemist)","Tiberius_Cavallo","Cavallo_multiplier","John_Read_(inventor)","Jean_Nicolas_Pierre_Hachette","Bohnenberger_machine","Giuseppe_Belli_(physicist)","C.&nbsp;F._Varley","Lord_Kelvin","Mouse_mill","Siphon_recorder","Wilhelm_Holtz","Holtz_machine","August_Toepler","Schwedoff_machine","Kundt_machine","Carré_machine","Piche_machine","Bertsch_machine","Johann_Christian_Poggendorff","Francesco_Rossetti","Augusto_Righi","Friedrich_Kohlrausch","Éleuthère_Mascart","A._Roiti","E._Bouchotte","Righi's_electrometer","Leyser_machine","Robert_Voss","James_Wimshurst","Museum_of_Science_and_Industry_(Chicago)","M._L._Lebiez","Lebiez_machine","Voss_machine","Pidgeon_machine","W._R._Pidgeon","Inductor","Electrical_induction_effect","F._Tudsbury","Compressed_air","Carbon_dioxide","Electrical_insulation","Alfred_Wehrsen","Heinrich_Wommelsdorf","Wehrsen_machine","MIT","Nikola_Tesla","Pelletron","Fringe_science","George_Samuel_Piggott","Radiotelegraphy","Antigravity","Germany","Engineer","Methernitha","Electrostatic_motor","Electrometer","Electret","Static_electricity","Gottlieb_Christoph_Bohnenberger","William_Holtz","Johann_Poggendorff","Oleg_D._Jefimenko","Silvanus_P._Thompson","1911_encyclopedia","Lord_Kelvin","Bill_Beaty","Nikola_Tesla"]}
