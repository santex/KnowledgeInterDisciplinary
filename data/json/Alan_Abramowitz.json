Abramowitz' (born 1947) is an American political scientist and author,\nknown for his research and writings on American politics, elections, and\npolitical parties in political science.\n\nAbramowitz graduated with a B.A. with high honors in political science from the\nUniversity of Rochester in 1969. He attended graduate school at Stanford\nUniversity, completing an M.A. in 1972 and a PhD degree in 1976. Abramowitz'\ndissertation was entitled An Assessment of Party and Incumbent Accountability in\nMidterm Congressional Elections.\n\nAbramowitz taught at the College of William and Mary from 1976 to 1982, at Stony\nBrook University from 1982 to 1987, when he joined the faculty at Emory\nUniversity as a professor of political science. Abramowitz was awarded the Alben\nW. Barkley Distinguished Chair in Political Science at Emory University in 1993.\n\nAbramowitz has authored or co-authored five books. Probably his best known book,\nco-authored with Jeff Segal of Stony Brook University, Senate Elections, written\nin 1992, received two awards from political science associations and remains one\nof the seminal works in the study of senatorial elections to this day.\n\nAbramowitz has written extensively on many disparate topics in American\npolitics, including presidential, senate and house elections, activism,\npolarization, ideology, partisanship, ideological realignment, incumbency, and\nredistricting. Abramowitz often publishes a predictive model of elections based\non his \"time for change\" model, which has been very accurate in predicting\nelection outcomes since the 1980s.\n\nIn 2012, an investigation by [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] found that\nAbramowitz had failed to disclose several donations of $250 to Barack Obama's\n2008 presidential campaign, in media appearances during Obama's subsequent 2012\ncampaign for reelection.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Alan_Abramowitz","recorded":1375088743,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Political_scientist","/wiki/Author","/wiki/Research","/wiki/Book","/wiki/American_politics","/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Political_science","/wiki/Graduated","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/Political_science","/wiki/University_of_Rochester","/wiki/Graduate_school","/wiki/Stanford_University","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/wiki/PhD","/wiki/Teaching","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","/wiki/SUNY-Stony_Brook","/wiki/Faculty_(teaching_staff)","/wiki/Emory_University","/wiki/Professor","/wiki/Political_science","/wiki/Alben_W._Barkley","/wiki/Political_Science","/wiki/Emory_University","/wiki/Stony_Brook_University","/wiki/American_politics","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Elections","/wiki/Activism","/wiki/Polarization_(politics)","/wiki/Ideology","/wiki/Partisanship","/wiki/Realigning_election","/wiki/Incumbency","/wiki/Redistricting","/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)","/wiki/Barack_Obama","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/262157-professors-donate-to-obama-opine-about-election-in-news-articles","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit&section=3","http://polisci.emory.edu/faculty%20pages/abramowitz.htm","http://polisci.emory.edu/Curriculum%20Vita/Abramowitz11-2008.pdf","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/34536000","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&oldid=563044594","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_political_scientists","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:1947_births","/wiki/Category:Emory_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_Rochester_alumni","/wiki/Category:Stanford_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:College_of_William_%26_Mary_faculty","/wiki/Category:State_University_of_New_York_at_Stony_Brook_faculty","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alan+Abramowitz&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alan+Abramowitz","/wiki/Alan_Abramowitz","/wiki/Talk:Alan_Abramowitz","#","/wiki/Alan_Abramowitz","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alan_Abramowitz","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alan_Abramowitz","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&oldid=563044594","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4706051","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alan_Abramowitz&id=563044594","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alan+Abramowitz","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alan+Abramowitz&oldid=563044594&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Abramowitz&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4706051#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of
