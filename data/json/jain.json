The essence of\nJainism is concern for the welfare of every being in the universe.<ref></ref>\nPractitioners believe that non-violence and self-control are the means by which\nthey can obtain liberation from the cycle of reincarnations. Currently, Jainism\nis divided into two major sects-- Digambara and Śvētāmbara.\n\nJainism is one of the oldest religions in the world;<ref></ref> it represents\nthe [[Shramana|Śramaṇa]] tradition of ancient India and is connected by some to\nthe Indus Valley Civilisation. Jains traditionally trace their history through a\nsuccession of twenty-four propagators of their faith known as tirthankara with\nĀdinātha as the first tirthankara and Mahāvīra as the last. For long periods of\ntime Jainism was the state religion of Indian kingdoms and widely adopted in the\nIndian subcontinent. The religion has been in decline since the 8th century CE\ndue to the growth of, and oppression by, the followers of Hinduism and Islam.\n\nJainism is a religious minority in India, with 4.2 million followers, and there\nare small but notable immigrant communities in Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong,\nJapan, Singapore, and the United States.<ref></ref><!-- possible wrong reference\n--> Jains have the highest degree of literacy of any religious community in\nIndia,<ref name=\"pib\" /> and their manuscript libraries are the oldest in the\ncountry.<ref name=\"Dundas 2002 83\"></ref>\n","title":"Jainism","headings":["History","Literature","Art and architecture","Doctrine","Community","Customs and Practices","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Rishabha","2: Jain_Agamas","2: Sanskrit","2: Kannada","2: Digambara","2: Jainism_in_Canada","2: Jainism_in_Japan","2: Jainism_in_the_United_States","2: Udayagiri_and_Khandagiri_Caves","1: India","1: Belgium","1: Canada","1: Hong_Kong","1: Japan","1: Singapore","1: United_States","1: Prakrit","1: Tamil_language","1: Gujarati_language","1: Hindi","1: Tirthankara","1: Indian_religions","1: Svetambara","1: Indus_Valley_Civilization","1: MahÄvÄ«ra","1: Hinduism","1: Islam_and_Jainism","1: Jainism_in_Belgium","1: Jainism_in_Hong_Kong","1: Jainism_in_Singapore","1: Historical_Vedic_religion","1: Parsva","1: Pithunda","1: Champa","1: Mahapadma_Nanda","1: Mauryan_dynasty","1: Chandragupta_Maurya","1: Ashoka","1: Samprati","1: Ujjain","1: Kharvela","1: Mahameghavahana_dynasty","1: Indian_subcontinent","1: Hiuen_Tsang","1: Bhubaneswar","1: Chawda_dynasty","1: KumÄrila_Bhaá¹­á¹­a","1: Adi_Shankara","1: Sambandar","1: Appar","1: Shaivism","1: Pandya","1: Basava","1: Vaishnavism","1: Hoysala_Dynasty","1: Vishnuvardhana","1: Vishnu","1: Ramanuja","1: Mahmud_Ghazni","1: Mohammad_Ghori","1: Alauddin_Khilji","1: Akbar","1: Mughal_emperors","1: Purvas","1: Tamil_Nadu","1: Karnataka","1: Gujarat","1: Rajasthan","1: Sangam_period","1: Lingayatism","1: Adikavi_Pampa","1: Chalukya_dynasty","1: Rashtrakuta_Dynasty","1: Acharya_Hemachandra","1: Solanki","1: Kumarpal","1: Shauraseni_language","1: Jain_Prakrit","1: Rajendrasuri","1: Patan,_Gujarat","1: Jaisalmer","1: Patna","1: Ellora","1: Kirti_Stambh","1: Panch_Kalyanaka","1: Lotus_position","1: Indra","1: Bahubali","1: Chavundaraya","1: Seven_Wonders_of_India","1: Mathura","1: Anekantavada","1: Blind_men_and_an_elephant","1: Religion","1: Philosophy","1: Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi","1: Conditional_sentence","1: Ontology","1: Dogmatism","1: School_of_thought","1: Inference","1: Critical_philosophy","1: Metaphysics","1: Jain_texts","1: Bhadrabahu","1: Ahimsa","1: Parshva","1: Vegetarian","1: Lacto-vegetarianism","1: Veganism","1: List_of_root_vegetables","1: Satya","1: Asteya","1: Brahmacharya","1: Aparigraha","1: Celibacy","1: Major_religious_groups","1: Jainism_in_Maharashtra","1: Jainism_in_Rajasthan","1: Jainism_in_Gujarat","1: Jainism_in_Karnataka","1: Tamil_Jain","1: Jainism_in_Bundelkhand","1: Madhya_Pradesh","1: Jainism_in_Europe","1: American_Jainism","1: Antwerp","1: Sect","1: ÅvÄtÄmbara","1: MÄllÄ«nÄtha","1: Kundakunda","1: Kushan_Empire","1: Yapaniya","1: Sthanakavasi","1: Svetambar_Terapanth","1: Murtipujaka","1: Aniconic","1: Bisapanthi","1: Kanji_Swami","1: Taran_Panth","1: Digambar_Terapanth","1: Saman_Suttam","1: Navkar_Mantra","1: Paryushana","1: Mahavir_Jayanti","1: Amavasya","1: Acharya_Bhadrabahu","1: Samayika","1: Chaturmas"]}
