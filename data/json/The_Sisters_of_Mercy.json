After\nachieving early underground fame in UK, the band had their commercial\nbreakthrough in mid-1980s and sustained it until the early 1990s, when they\nstopped releasing new recorded output in protest against their record company.\nCurrently, the band is a touring outfit only.\n\nThe group has released three original studio albums, of which the last was\nreleased in 1990. Each album was recorded by a different line-up; singer and\nsongwriter Andrew Eldritch and the drum machine called Doktor Avalanche are the\nonly points of continuity among the line-ups. Eldritch and Avalanche were also\ninvolved in The Sisterhood, a side-project connected with Eldritch's dispute\nwith former members.\n\nThe group ceased recording activity in 1993, when they went on strike against\ntheir record company Time Warner, which they accused of withholding royalties\nand of incompetence. Although Time Warner eventually let the band go in 1997,\nthey have not signed to another label, and have chosen not to use an independent\nlabel, despite showcasing numerous new songs in their live sets.\n\nSince 1985, when the other original members left, The Sisters of Mercy has\nbecome the artistic vehicle of Andrew Eldritch. Former members of the group\nestablished the bands Ghost Dance and The Mission.\n","linknr":444,"url":"The_Sisters_of_Mercy","recorded":1362570391,"links":34,"instances":["band","band","band","band","band","keyboardist","musician","song","musician","band","guitarist","band","band","band","band","band","guitarist","sisters_of_mercy_song","band","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The
