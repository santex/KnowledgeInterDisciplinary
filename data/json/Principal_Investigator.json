It is often used as a synonym for \"head of\nthe laboratory\" or \"research group leader\", not just for a particular study.\n\nIn the context of USA federal funding from agencies such as the NIH or the NSF,\nthe PI is the person who takes direct responsibility for completion of a funded\nproject, directing the research and reporting directly to the funding\nagency. See e.g. NSF Grant Policy Manual 210f 'Definitions: Principal\nInvestigator', available: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02151/gpm2.jsp#210;\nNIAID (NIH) 'Glossary of Funding and Policy Terms and Acronyms', available:\nhttp://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/glossary/default5.htm#pi For small projects\n(which might involve 1-5 people) the PI is typically the person who conceived of\nthe investigation, but for larger projects the PI may be selected by a team to\nobtain the best strategic advantage for the project.\n\nIn the context of a clinical trial a PI may be an academic working with grants\nfrom NIH or other funding agencies, or may be effectively a contractor for a\npharmaceutical company working on testing the safety and efficacy of new\nmedicines.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Principal_Investigator","recorded":1362670655,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science occupations","Clinical research"],"headings":["Certification for principal investigator","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Scientist","Clinical_trial","Research_group_leader","USA","Federal_funding","NIH","National_Science_Foundation","NIH","Pharmaceutical_company"]}
