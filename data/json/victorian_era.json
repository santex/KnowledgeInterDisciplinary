It was a long period of\npeace, prosperity, refined sensibilities and national self-confidence for\nBritain. Some scholars date the beginning of the period in terms of\nsensibilities and political concerns to the passage of the Reform Act 1832. The\nera was preceded by the Georgian period and followed by the Edwardian period.\nThe latter half of the Victorian age roughly coincided with the first portion of\nthe [[Belle Ãpoque]] era of continental Europe and the [[Gilded Age]] of the\nUnited States.\n\nCulturally there was a transition away from the rationalism of the Georgian\nperiod and toward romanticism and mysticism with regard to religion, social\nvalues, and the arts. In international relations the era was a long\nperiod of peace, known as the [[Pax Britannica]], and economic, colonial, and\nindustrial consolidation, temporarily disrupted by the Crimean War in 1854. The\nend of the period saw the Boer War. Domestically, the agenda was increasingly\nliberal with a number of shifts in the direction of gradual political reform,\nindustrial reform and the widening of the voting franchise.\n\nTwo especially important figures in this period of British history are the prime\nministers Gladstone and Disraeli, whose contrasting views changed the course of\nhistory. Disraeli, favoured by the queen, was a gregarious Tory. His rival\nGladstone, a Liberal distrusted by the Queen, served more terms and oversaw much\nof the overall law-making of the era.\n\nThe population of England almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5\nmillion in 1901. [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fo-\nm2005/01_FOPM_Population.pdf The UK and future], statistics.gov.uk\nScotland's population also rose rapidly, from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million\nin 1901. Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2 million in 1841 to\nless than 4.5 million in 1901, mostly due to the Great Famine. At the\nsame time, around 15 million emigrants left the United Kingdom in the Victorian\nera and settled mostly in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

National Museum of Australia\n\nDuring the early part of the era, the House of Commons was headed by the two\nparties, the Whigs and the Tories. From the late 1850s onwards, the Whigs became\nthe Liberals; the Tories became the Conservatives. These parties were led by\nmany prominent statesmen including Lord Melbourne, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Derby,\nLord Palmerston, William Ewart Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, and Lord Salisbury.\nThe unsolved problems relating to Irish Home Rule played a great part in\npolitics in the later Victorian era, particularly in view of Gladstone's\ndetermination to achieve a political settlement. Indeed, these issues would\neventually lead to the Easter Rising of 1916 and the subsequent domino effect\nthat would play a large part in the fall of the empire.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"victorian_era","recorded":1371065236,"links":[],"instances":["polish","ireland","1878","british_style","uk","headgear","uk","british_political_faction","philanthropist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Victorian
