      "text" : "\n\n\nIn genetics, a 'mutation' is a change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome\nof an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal genetic element. Mutations result\nfrom unrepaired damage to DNA or to RNA genomes (typically caused by radiation\nor chemical mutagens), from errors in the process of replication, or from the\ninsertion or deletion of segments of DNA by mobile genetic elements.<ref\nname=Bertram></ref><ref name=\"transposition764\"></ref><ref name=Burrus></ref>\nMutations may or may not produce discernable changes in the observable\ncharacteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal\nand abnormal biological processes, including evolution, cancer, and the\ndevelopment of the immune system.\n\nMutation can result in several different types of change in sequences, Mutations\nin genes can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the\ngene from functioning properly or completely. Mutations can also occur in\nnongenic regions. One study on genetic variations between different species of\n[[Drosophila]] suggests that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene,\nthe result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid\npolymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or\nweakly beneficial.<ref name=\"Sawyer2007\"></ref> Due to the damaging effects that\nmutations can have on genes, organisms have mechanisms such as DNA repair to\nprevent or correct (revert the mutated sequence back to its original state)\nmutations.<ref name=Bertram/>\n",
