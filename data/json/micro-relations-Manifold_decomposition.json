{"cursor":"4051","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn topology, a branch of mathematics, a manifold M may be decomposed or split by\nwriting M as a combination of smaller pieces. When doing so, one must specify\nboth what those pieces are and how they are put together to form M.\n\nManifold decomposition works in two directions: one can start with the smaller\npieces and build up a manifold, or start with a large manifold and decompose it.\nThe latter has proven a very useful way to study manifolds: without tools like\ndecomposition, it is sometimes very hard to understand a manifold. In\nparticular, it has been useful in attempts to classify 3-manifolds and also in\nproving the higher dimensional PoincarÃ© conjecture.\n\nThe table below is a summary of the various manifold-decomposition techniques.\nThe column labeled \"M\" indicates what kind of manifold can be decomposed; the\ncolumn labeled \"How it is decomposed\" indicates how, starting with a manifold,\none can decompose it into smaller pieces; the column labeled \"The pieces\"\nindicates what the pieces can be; and the column labeled \"How they are combined\"\nindicates how the smaller pieces are combined to make the large manifold.\n\n\n\n{|frame=\"border\" border=\"1\" !Type of decomposition !M !How it is decomposed !The\npieces !How they are combined\n|-\n!Triangulation |Depends on dimension. In dimension 3, a theorem by Edwin E.\nMoise gives that every 3-manifold has a unique triangulation, unique up to\ncommon subdivision. In dimension 4, not all manifolds are triangulable. For\nhigher dimensions, general existence of triangulations is unknown.\n|\n|simplices |Glue together pairs of codimension-one faces\n|-\n!Jaco-Shalen/Johannson torus decomposition |Irreducible, orientable, compact 3-\nmanifolds |Cut along embedded tori |Atoroidal or Seifert-fibered 3-manifolds\n|Union along their boundary, using the trivial homeomorphism\n|-\n!Prime decomposition |Essentially surfaces and 3-manifold.
