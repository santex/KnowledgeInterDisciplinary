{"cursor":"35306","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The goal of most research on 'group development' is to learn why and how small\ngroups change over time. To do this, researchers examine patterns of change and\ncontinuity in groups over time. Aspects of a group that might be studied include\nthe quality of the output produced by a group, the type and frequency of its\nactivities, its cohesiveness, the existence of group conflict.\n\nA number of theoretical models have been developed to explain how certain groups\nchange over time. Listed below are some of the most common models. In some\ncases, the type of group being considered influenced the model of group\ndevelopment proposed as in the case of therapy groups. In general, some of these\nmodels view group change as regular movement through a series of \"stages,\" while\nothers view them as \"phases\" that groups may or may not go through and which\nmight occur at different points of a group's history. Attention to group\ndevelopment over time has been one of the differentiating factors between the\nstudy of ad hoc groups and the study of teams such as those commonly used in the\nworkplace, the military, sports and many other contexts.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Group_development","recorded":1362477174,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group processes","Social work","Human communication"],"headings":["Theories and Models","Further challenges","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg/75px-Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Output","Cohesiveness","Group_conflict","Theoretical","Scientific_modelling","Therapy","Team","Kurt_Lewin","Group_dynamics","Bruce_Tuckman","Bales","Forming-storming-norming-performing","Satisficing","Wilfred_Bion","Organization_development","Group_dynamics","Team_work","Team_building","Human_Systems_Intervention"]}
