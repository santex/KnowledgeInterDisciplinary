Fisheries can be marine (saltwater) or\nfreshwater. They can also be 'wild' or 'farmed'. This article is an overview of\nthe habitats occupied by the worlds' wild fisheries, and the human impacts on\nthose habitats.\n\nWild fisheries are sometimes called 'capture' fisheries. The aquatic life they\nsupport is not controlled in any meaningful way and needs to be \"captured\" or\nfished. Wild fisheries exist primarily in the oceans, and particularly around\ncoasts and continental shelves. They also exist in lakes and rivers. Issues with\nwild fisheries are overfishing and pollution. Significant wild fisheries have\ncollapsed or are in danger of collapsing, due to overfishing and pollution.\nOverall, production from the world's wild fisheries has levelled out, and may be\nstarting to decline.\n\nAs a contrast to wild fisheries, farmed fisheries can operate in sheltered\ncoastal waters, in rivers, lakes and ponds, or in enclosed bodies of water such\nas tanks. Farmed fisheries are technological in nature, and revolve around\ndevelopments in aquaculture. Farmed fisheries are expanding, and Chinese\naquaculture in particular is making many advances. Nevertheless, the majority of\nfish consumed by humans continues to be sourced from wild fisheries. As of the\nearly 21st century, fish is humanity's only significant wild food source.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Wild_fisheries","recorded":1372152681,"links":[],"instances":["environmental","spain","ecology","island","molecule","element","ecology","ocean"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fisheries"],"headings":["Marine
