Sets of fingers are handy; sets of\napples are preferred by textbooks.\"</ref>]]\n\n\n'Addition' is a mathematical operation that represents the total amount of\nobjects together in a collection. It is signified by the plus sign (+). For\nexample, in the picture on the right, there are 3 + 2 apples—meaning three\napples and two apples together, which is a total of 5 apples. Therefore, 3 + 2 =\n5. Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical\nand abstract quantities using different kinds of objects: negative numbers,\nfractions, irrational numbers, vectors, decimals, functions, matrices and more.\n\nAddition follows several important patterns. It is commutative, meaning that\norder does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more\nthan two numbers, order in which addition is performed does not matter (see\n[[Summation]]). Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting; addition of 0\ndoes not change a number. Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning\nrelated operations such as subtraction and multiplication. All of these rules\ncan be proven, starting with the addition of natural numbers and generalizing up\nthrough the real numbers and beyond. General binary operations that continue\nthese patterns are studied in abstract algebra.\n\nPerforming addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Addition of very\nsmall numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be\nperformed by infants as young as five months and even some animals. In\nprimary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system,\nstarting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult\nproblems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern\ncomputer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition\ncontinues to this day.\n","title":"Addition","headings":["Notation and terminology","Interpretations","Properties","Performing addition","Addition of natural and real numbers","Generalizations","Related operations","In literature","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Multiplication","3: Natural_number","3: Cardinal_number","2: Associativity","2: Counting","2: Subtraction","2: Real_number","2: Abstract_algebra","2: Decimal","2: Abacus","2: Computer","2: Latin","2: Binary_operation","2: Commutative","2: Set_theory","2: Rational_number","2: Disjoint_union","2: Category_theory","2: Additive_inverse","2: Logarithm","2: Quantum_mechanics","1: Plus_sign","1: Negative_number","1: Irrational_number","1: Euclidean_vector","1: Commutativity","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Binary_operations","1: Primary_education","1: Plus_and_minus_signs","1: Infix_notation","1: Equals_sign","1: Underline","1: Capital_sigma_notation","1: Renaissance","1: Commutative_property","1: English_language","1: Verb","1: Proto-Indo-European_root","1: Gerundive","1: Affix","1: Noun","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Leonard_of_Pisa","1: Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Boethius","1: Vitruvius","1: Sextus_Julius_Frontinus","1: Middle_English","1: Geoffrey_Chaucer","1: Rigor","1: Pie","1: Unary_operation","1: Order_of_operations","1: Identity_element","1: Additive_identity","1: Brahmagupta","1: Indian_mathematicians","1: BhÄskara_II","1: Units_of_measurement","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Habituation","1: Infant","1: Karen_Wynn","1: Mickey_Mouse","1: Toddler","1: Ping-pong","1: Primate","1: Eggplant","1: Rhesus_macaque","1: Cottontop_tamarin","1: Arabic_numerals","1: Common_Chimpanzee","1: Number_bond","1: Memorize","1: Rote_learning","1: Reform_mathematics","1: Analog_computer","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Lever","1: Axle","1: Pressure","1: Newton's_laws_of_motion","1: Piston","1: Voltage","1: Resistor","1: Electronic_circuit","1: Operational_amplifier","1: Blaise_Pascal","1: Adding_machine","1: Pascal's_calculator#Competing_designs","1: Pascal's_calculator","1: Pascal's_calculator#9's_complement","1: Giovanni_Poleni","1: Binary_arithmetic","1: Carry_bypass_adder","1: Floating_point","1: Memory_address","1: Control_flow","1: Parallel_algorithm","1: Carry_lookahead_adder","1: Ling_adder","1: Paper","1: Adding_board","1: Microprocessor","1: X86","1: 68k","1: High-level_programming_language","1: C++","1: Integer","1: Herbert_Enderton","1: Mathematics_education","1: Peano_axioms#Binary_operations_and_ordering","1: Recursion_Theorem","1: Poset","1: Descending_chain_condition","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Absolute_value","1: Positive_number","1: Negative_numbers","1: Grothendieck_group","1: Least_common_denominator","1: Dedekind_cut","1: Non-empty_set","1: Greatest_element","1: Richard_Dedekind","1: Cauchy_sequence","1: Georg_Cantor","1: Linear_algebra","1: Vector_space","1: Coordinate_vector","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Force","1: Modular_arithmetic","1: Boolean_logic","1: Exclusive_or","1: Geometry","1: Angle","1: Circle","1: Torus","1: Associative","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Commutative_monoid","1: Abelian_group","1: Ordinal_number","1: Transfinite","1: Coproduct","1: Inverse_function","1: Exponential_function","1: Mathematical_table","1: Slide_rule","1: Lie_group","1: Lie_algebra","1: Distributivity","1: Orders_of_magnitude","1: Taylor_series","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Round-off_error","1: Axiom_of_Choice","1: Tropical_geometry","1: Extended_real_number_line","1: Planck's_constant","1: Classical_limit","1: Primitive_recursive_function","1: Empty_sum","1: Differentiable_manifold","1: Manifold","1: Real_numbers","1: Complex_numbers","1: Mixed_strategy","1: Game_theory","1: Quantum_superposition","1: Quantum_state","1: Random_variable","1: Probability_distribution","1: Lewis_Carroll","1: George_Orwell"]}
