{"cursor":"6431","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Process manufacturing' is the branch of manufacturing that is associated with\nformulas and manufacturing recipes, and can be contrasted with discrete\nmanufacturing, which is concerned with bills of material and routing.\n\nThe simplest and easiest way to grasp the definition of process manufacturing is\nto recognize that, once an output is produced by this process, it cannot be\ndistilled back to its basic components. In other words, \"once you put it\ntogether, you cannot take it apart\". A can of soda cannot be returned to its\nbasic components such as carbonated water, citric acid, potassium benzoate,\naspartame, and other ingredients. Juice cannot be put back into an orange.A\nplastic card manufactured cannot be returned to its basic components like PVR\nsheets, transparent sheets. A car or computer, on the other hand, can be\ndisassembled and its components, to a large extent, returned to stock. Process\nmanufacturing is common in the food, beverage, chemical, pharmaceutical,\nconsumer packaged goods, and biotechnology industries. In process manufacturing,\nthe relevant factors are ingredients, not parts; formulas, not bill of\nmaterials; and bulk, not individual units. This is more than a subtle difference\nin terminology; the terms characterize distinct manufacturing approaches.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Process_Manufacturing","recorded":1362477415,"links":13,"instances":["ctp"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Manufacturing"],"headings":["Some process manufacturing vertical markets","Formulation","Packaging","Process manufacturing software"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chemicals,_tire,_and_process_industries","ctp"]],"members":[],"related":["Discrete_manufacturing","Citric_acid","Potassium_benzoate","Aspartame","Nutraceuticals","Cosmeceuticals","Chemicals,_Tire,_and_Process_Industries_(CTP)","Enterprise_Resource_Planning"]}
