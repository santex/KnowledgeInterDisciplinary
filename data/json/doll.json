Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals\n throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials like clay and\n wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest\n documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and\n Rome. Dolls being used as toys was documented in Greece around 100AD. They have\n been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern\n doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany going back to the 15th century.\n With industrialization and the appearance of new materials like porcelain and\n plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century dolls\n became increasingly popular as collectibles.\n",
