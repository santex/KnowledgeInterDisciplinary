In 1956-57,\nhe worked with Heinz Holter in Copenhagen (Denmark). In 1960, he obtained a\nfellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation and joined the group of Bob\nSinsheimer as a postdoc. At the California Institute of Technology Walter Fiers\nwas exposed to Molecular Biology, which was then just developing, studying viral\nDNA. He demonstrated the physical, covalently closed circularity of\nBacteriophage PhiX-174 DNA. Fiers, W., and R. L. Sinsheimer, The structure\nof the DNA of bacteriophage PhiX 174. III. Ultracentrifuge evidence for a ring\nstructure, J. Mol. Biol. 5:424-434, 1962 In 1962, Fiers moved to Madison,\nWisconsin, to work in the laboratory of future Nobel laureate, Gobind Khorana.\n\nAt the end of 1962, Fiers returned to Belgium and set up the Laboratory of\nMolecular Biology at the University of Ghent. His research involved\nBacteriophage MS2; he was the first to establish the complete nucleotide\nsequence of a gene (1972) and of a viral genome (bacteriophage\nMS2)(1976).
