An open system should be contrasted with the concept of\nan isolated system which exchanges neither energy, matter, nor information with\nits environment.\n\nThe concept of an \"open system\" was formalized within a framework that enabled\none to interrelate the theory of the organism, thermodynamics, and evolutionary\ntheory. Luhmann, Niklas. Social Systems. Stanford: Stanford University\nPress, 1995; pp. 6-7 This concept was expanded upon with the advent of\ninformation theory and subsequently systems theory. Today the concept has its\napplications in the natural and social sciences.\n\n\nIn the natural sciences an open system is one whose border is permeable to both\nenergy and mass. [http://www.maxwellian.demon.co.uk/faq/glossary.html\nGlossary] Maxwell Demon, 1998. In physics a closed system, by contrast, is\npermeable to energy but not to matter.\n\nOpen systems have a number of consequences. A closed system contains limited\nenergies. The definition of an open system assumes that there are supplies of\nenergy that cannot be depleted; in practice, this energy is supplied from some\nsource in the surrounding environment, which can be treated as infinite for the\npurposes of study. One type of open system is the so-called [[radiant energy]]\nsystem, which receives its energy from solar radiation â€“ an energy source\nthat can be regarded as inexhaustible for all practical purposes. why cant the\nopen system mineral not recycled\n\nThey are also known as OSM.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Open_system_(systems_theory)","recorded":1362476923,"links":31,"instances":["computing","geographer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cybernetics","Physical systems","Open methodologies|System"],"headings":["In the social sciences","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Basic_Open_System_Model.gif/320px-Basic_Open_System_Model.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg/220px-Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/4/354c808b3ac7ff5bd75faa26bcc36220.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/e/7/de71b72c4f62f20d117414dd2f33ca25.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/7/af7e8a85df47250ffab736b7a8807488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/e/2aede3b55c027fe4392429d6474ec397.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/c/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/8/888fa252e9cde41ef196d5154cd7219c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5206560a306a2e085a437fd258eb57ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/f/5/1f58273c4161e57f62a95804c2ae961a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/e/17eb927e31859ce116f5c64cbcc30d75.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/c/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/8/888fa252e9cde41ef196d5154cd7219c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5206560a306a2e085a437fd258eb57ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/7/af7e8a85df47250ffab736b7a8807488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/5/8153e779d69fe6c35dc2bc4dfb0f2a11.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/5/5758e3126ffd73977ec11d0c19d06692.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/7/5678e99000d8069acd323bb63d6376d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5205e29e7201a0b009466036b40a34a6.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_harvey","geographer"],["open_system","computing"]],"members":["open_system","david_harvey"],"related":["System","Isolated_system","Organismic_theory","Thermodynamics","Theory_of_Evolution","Information_theory","Systems_theory","Natural_sciences","Energy","Mass","Physics","Closed_system","Closed_system","Solar_radiation","Social_sciences","Kostas_Axelos","World-systems_theory","Praxis_intervention","Louis_Althusser","Overdetermination","David_Harvey_(geographer)","Foreign_direct_investment","Privatization","Accumulation_by_dispossession","Structural_functionalism_","Talcott_Parsons","Niklas_Luhmann","Business_process","Complex_system","Dynamical_system","Glossary_of_systems_theory","Isolated_system","Maximum_power_principle","Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics","Open_system_(computing)","Open_System_Environment_Reference_Model","Openness","Open_and_Closed_Systems_in_Social_Science","Phantom_loop","System_theory","Thermodynamic_system"]}
