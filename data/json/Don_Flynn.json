He\ngrew up in Tyler, Texas, lettering in baseball, basketball and football in high\nschool, he was awarded the MVP trophy his senior year at Tyler High School. He\nwas given a football scholarship to the University of Houston and was named an\nhonorable mention quarterback to the 1957 All-American team, as well as being\nselected for MVP again his senior year of college.\n\nFlynn graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in petroleum\nengineering and minored in geology. After college, Flynn served in the Army and\nplayed four years of professional football. Flynn played for the Dallas Texans,\nwho later became the Kansas City Chiefs, and the New York Titans, who later\nbecame the New York Jets. Flynn also played in the Canadian league for the\nEdmonton Eskimos. At the professional level, Flynn was a defensive back and\nquarterback, he started every game for both the Texans and the Titans.\n\nWhile playing in the NFL, Flynn made about $8,500 a year, and so after an injury\nto his knee, Flynn decided to take a job with Skelly Oil Company in Duncan,\nOklahoma. Flynn later relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma and went to work for White\nShield Oil and Gas Company. In 1972, Flynn formed Flynn Energy Corp. and by 1976\nthe company had been named Oklahoma's Stock of the Year by Oklahoma Business\nmagazine. Less than two years later, Flynn sold the oil-and gas firm for over\n$30 million. During the period from 1972â1978, the company drilled 342 wells in\nOklahoma, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, Arkansas\nand Colorado. During this period the company developed 80.3 BCF of Net\nEquivalent Gas Reserves having a Total Income of $152 MM. The Company went\npublic in February 1974 and was publicly traded, (OTC), until the assets were\nsold in December 1978, to Reserve Oil and Gas for a total cash consideration of\n$54 MM. This was an asset sale, and the Company was immediately reorganized\nafter the closing. The second Flynn Energy Corp. was established at that time.\nThis company was run much like the first, and between 1978-1989 the company\ndrilled 274 wells and earned $390 million dollars. Flynn went on to spend over\n40 years in the oil and gas industry, he founded and managed two successful\npublicly traded companies. Flynn also founded DMF Inc. which is a privately\nowned corporation. DMF Inc. holds interest in 19 producing wells in Michigan,\nOklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. Between Flynn Energy Corp. and DMF Inc., the net\nincome for both companies totaled $542 million.\n\nFlynn met his wife, Patricia Fenwick, while she was working as a flight\nattendant on a Braniff flight he was taking with one of his football teams. A\nyear later they were married and not long after that they had four children,\nBrett, Don, Kelly, and Michael.\n\nFlynn and his family lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma in Southern Hills, where he\nenjoyed playing golf. He also has four granddaughters Mallory Flynn-Hodges,\nLindsay Flynn, Samantha Wright, and Rebecca Flynn. Paramount in his life were\nlove of his family, his Christian faith, competitive sports, country-western\nmusic and regard and concern for this exceptional country.\n\nOn Wednesday April 14, 2010 Don Flynn died in the Intensive Care Unit of St.\nJohns Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was 75.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Don_Flynn","recorded":1375056750,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Durant,_Oklahoma","/wiki/All-American","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Soldier","/wiki/Businessman","/wiki/Tyler,_Texas","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player","/wiki/University_of_Houston","/wiki/Petroleum_engineering","/wiki/Geology","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/Dallas_Texans_(NFL)","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/New_York_Titans_(football)","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/Canadian_Football_League","/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos","/wiki/Skelly_Oil","/wiki/Duncan,_Oklahoma","/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma","/wiki/Oklahoma","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Michigan","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/West_Virginia","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/wiki/Arkansas","/wiki/Colorado","/wiki/Oil_and_gas_industry","/wiki/Flight_attendant","/wiki/Braniff_International_Airways","/wiki/Golf","/wiki/Country_and_western","/wiki/Intensive_care_unit","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.tulsaworld.com/ourlives/article.aspx?subjectid=58&articleid=20100417_11_A15_DonFly688371&rss_lnk=11","http://static.pfref.com/players/F/FlynDo20.htm","/wiki/Template:Houston_Cougars_quarterback_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:Houston_Cougars_quarterback_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Houston_Cougars_quarterback_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/Houston_Cougars_football","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Manichia&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Alan_Neveux&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Rogers_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Clatterbuck&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Jim_Dickey","/w/index.php?title=Sammy_Blount&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Lonnie_Holland&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Don_Sessions&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bo_Burris&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Dick_Woodall&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Bailey&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Rusty_Clark&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Gary_Mullins_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=D.C._Nobles&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Danny_Davis_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Delrick_Brown&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Lionel_Wilson_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Gerald_Landry&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=David_Dacus&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Andre_Ware","/wiki/David_Klingler","/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_Klingler&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chad_O%27Shea","/w/index.php?title=Chuck_Clements&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Jason_McKinley&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Kelly_Robertson_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Nick_Eddy_(quarterback)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kevin_Kolb","/w/index.php?title=Blake_Joseph&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Case_Keenum","/w/index.php?title=Terrance_Broadway&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=David_Piland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&oldid=505301533","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1934_births","/wiki/Category:2010_deaths","/wiki/Category:Dallas_Texans_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Edmonton_Eskimos_players","/wiki/Category:New_York_Titans_(AFL)_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Don+Flynn&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Don+Flynn","/wiki/Don_Flynn","/wiki/Talk:Don_Flynn","#","/wiki/Don_Flynn","/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Don_Flynn&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki
