He considered his time at both as \"lost\nyears\". Wright, p. 39.\n\nAfter a period as a journalist in Vienna, he returned to England to found the\npopular periodical [[New Writing]] (1936–1940) in book format, which\nproved a great influence on literature of the period and an outlet for writers\nsuch as Christopher Isherwood and W. H. Auden. Lehmann included many of these\nauthors in his anthology [[Poems for Spain]] which he edited with Stephen\nSpender. With the onset of the Second World War and paper rationing, New\nWriting's future was uncertain and so Lehmann wrote New Writing in Europe for\nPelican Books, one of the first critical summaries of the writers of the 1930s\nin which he championed the authors who had been the stars of New Writing - Auden\nand Spender - and also his close friend Tom Wintringham and Wintringham's ally,\nthe emerging George Orwell. Wintringham reintroduced Lehmann to Allen Lane of\nPenguin Books, who secured paper for [[The Penguin New Writing]] a monthly book-\nmagazine, this time in paperback. The first issue featured Orwell's essay\nShooting an Elephant. Occasional hardback editions combined with the magazine\nDaylight appeared sporadically, but it was as Penguin New Writing that the\nmagazine survived until 1950.\n\nAfter joining Leonard and Virginia Woolf as managing director of Hogarth Press\nbetween 1938 and 1946 he established his own publishing company, John Lehmann\nLimited, with his novelist sister Rosamond Lehmann (who had a nine-year affair\nwith one of Lehmann's contributing poets, Cecil Day Lewis). They published new\nworks by authors such as Sartre and Stendhal, and discovered talents like Thom\nGunn and Laurie Lee. He also published the first two books by the cookery writer\nElizabeth David, [[Elizabeth David bibliography#Mediterranean Food (1950)|A Book\nof Mediterranean Food]] and [[Elizabeth David bibliography#French Country\nCooking (1951)|French Country Cooking]].\n\nIn 1954 he founded [[The London Magazine]], remaining as editor until 1961,\nfollowing which he was a frequent lecturer and completed his three-volume\nautobiography, Whispering Gallery (1955), I Am My Brother (1960) and The Ample\nProposition (1966). In The Purely Pagan Sense (1976) is an autobiographical\nrecord of his homosexual life in England and pre-war Germany, discreetly written\nin the form of a novel. He also wrote the biographies Edith Sitwell (1952),\nVirginia Woolf and her World (1975), Thrown to the Woolfs (1978) and Rupert\nBrooke (1980).\n\nIn 1965 he published Christ the Hunter, a spiritual/autobiographical prose poem\nwhich had been broadcast in 1964 on the BBC Third Programme, In 1974 Lehmann\npublished a book of poems, The Reader at Night, hand-printed on handmade paper\nand hand-bound in an edition of 250 signed copies (Toronto, Basilike, 1974). An\nessay by Paul Davies about the creation of this book is included in Professor\nA.T. Tolley's collection, John Lehmann: a Tribute (Ottawa, Carleton University\nPress, 1987), which also includes pieces by Roy Fuller, Thom Gunn, Charles\nOsborne, Christopher Levenson, Jeremy Reed, George Woodcock, and others.\n\nLehmann died in London.\n","linknr":189,"url":"John_Lehmann","recorded":1374767771,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/John_Lehman","/wiki/Poet","/wiki/Man_of_letters","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/London_Magazine","/wiki/Bourne_End,_Buckinghamshire","/wiki/R._C._Lehmann","/wiki/Rosamond_Lehmann","/wiki/Beatrix_Lehmann","/wiki/Eton_College","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Vienna","/w/index.php?title=New_Writing&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Christopher_Isherwood","/wiki/W._H._Auden","/w/index.php?title=Poems_for_Spain&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Stephen_Spender","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Tom_Wintringham","/wiki/George_Orwell","/wiki/Allen_Lane","/wiki/Penguin_Books","/w/index.php?title=The_Penguin_New_Writing&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Leonard_Woolf","/wiki/Virginia_Woolf","/wiki/Hogarth_Press","/wiki/Rosamond_Lehmann","/wiki/Cecil_Day_Lewis","/wiki/Jean_Paul_Sartre","/wiki/Stendhal","/wiki/Thom_Gunn","/wiki/Laurie_Lee","/wiki/Elizabeth_David","/wiki/Elizabeth_David_bibliography#Mediterranean_Food_.281950.29","/wiki/Elizabeth_David_bibliography#French_Country_Cooking_.281951.29","/wiki/The_London_Magazine","/wiki/BBC_Third_Programme","/wiki/Roy_Fuller","/wiki/Thom_Gunn","/wiki/Charles_Osborne_(music_writer)","/wiki/Christopher_Levenson","/wiki/Jeremy_Reed_(writer)","/wiki/George_Woodcock","#Poets_in_Poems_from_New_Writing_1936.E2.80.931946_.281946.29","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Robert_Graves","/wiki/Bernard_Gutteridge","/wiki/Norman_Hampson","/wiki/Arthur_Harvey","/wiki/John_Heath-Stubbs","/wiki/Hamish_Henderson","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Hewett&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Gillian_Hughes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pierre_Jean_Jouve","/wiki/Laurie_Lee","/wiki/Alun_Lewis","/wiki/C._Day_Lewis","/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Little&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Federico_Garc%C3%ADa_Lorca","/w/index.php?title=David_Luke&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Joseph_Macleod","/wiki/Louis_MacNeice","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Mallalieu&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ewart_Milne","/wiki/Nicholas_Moore","/w/index.php?title=Vit%C4%95slav_Nezval&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/William_Plomer","/wiki/Pantelis_Prevelakis","/wiki/F._T._Prince","/wiki/Henry_Reed_(poet)","/wiki/Anne_Ridler","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Riviere&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Alan_Ross","/wiki/May_Sarton","/wiki/George_Seferis","/wiki/Jaroslav_Seifert","/wiki/Edith_Sitwell","/wiki/Stephen_Spender","/w/index.php?title=W._F._M._Stewart&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Randall_Swingler","/wiki/A._S._J._Tessimond","/wiki/Dunstan_Thompson","/wiki/Terence_Tiller","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Ferns_Waller&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Diana_Witherby&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=L._J._Yates&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Peter_Yates","/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=XdWHPDGHkNcC&dq=%22john+lehmann%22+%22new+writing%22&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=7Yb_8GnoTG&sig=UOW_zfsg8oNLOZ8K9UPFiHUdv3k","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ayerpub.com/Search/ByKeyword.asp?target=%22john+lehmann%22&submit1=+Search+","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&action=edit&section=4","http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/21524900","http://www.library.rdg.ac.uk/colls/special/hogarth.html","http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/index.asp?id=10","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56672392","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Lehmann&oldid=558253417","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1907_births","/wiki/Category:1987_deaths","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Trinity_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:Bloomsbury_Group","/wiki/Category:English_magazine_editors","/wiki/Category:English_memoirists","/wiki/Category:English_poets","/wiki/Category:Gay_writers","/wiki/Cat
