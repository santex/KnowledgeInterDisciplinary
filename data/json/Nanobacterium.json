{"cursor":"15163","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Nanobacterium' (, pl. nanobacteria ) is the unit or member name of a\nproposed class of living organisms, specifically cell-walled microorganisms with\na size much smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life (about 200\nnanometres for bacteria). Originally based on observed nano-scale structures in\ngeological formations (including one meteorite), the status of nanobacteria has\nbeen controversial, with some researchers suggesting they are a new class of\nliving organism capable of incorporating radiolabeled\nuridine, and others attributing to them a simpler, abiotic\nnature. One\nskeptic dubbed them \"the cold fusion of microbiology\", in reference to a\nnotorious episode of supposed erroneous science. Jack Maniloff, quoted in\n\"The Rise and Fall of Nanobacteria\", Young and Martel, Scientific American,\nJanuary 2010 The term \"calcifying nanoparticles\" (CNPs) has also been used\nas a conservative name regarding their possible status as a life form.\n\nResearch tends to agree that these structures exist, and appear to replicate in\nsome way. However, the idea that they are living entities has now\nlargely been discarded, and the particles are instead believed to be nonliving\ncrystallizations of minerals and organic molecules. \"The Rise and Fall of\nNanobacteria\", Young and Martel, Scientific American, January 2010 In\nmedicine, they have been implicated in the formation of both kidney stones and\narterial plaque.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Nanobacterium","recorded":1362483889,"links":26,"instances":["country"],"pdf":["http://garciaruiz.com/biomorphs/Science_2009_files/Morphogenesis%20of%20Self-Assembled%20Nanocrystalline_JM_science_2009_1.pdf","http://garciaruiz.com/biomorphs/Science_2009_files/Morphogenesis%20of%20Self-Assembled%20Nanocrystalline_JM_science_2009_1.pdf"],"categories":["Bacterial diseases","Geomicrobiology"],"headings":["1981–2000","2001–present","See also","References","Additional reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/ALH84001_structures.jpg/220px-ALH84001_structures.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turkey","country"]],"members":["turkey"],"related":["Organism","Cell_wall","Microorganisms","Nanometre","Allan_Hills_84001","Uridine","Abiotic","Cold_fusion","Ultramicrobacteria","Travertine","Viterbo","Scanning_electron_microscope","Geological_Society_of_America","David_S._McKay","ALH84001","Calcification","Apatite","Kidney_stone","Finland","Olavi_Kajander","Turkey_(country)","Neva_Ciftcioglu","University_of_Kuopio","Self-replication","Microbiological_culture","DNA","National_Institutes_of_Health","John_Cisar","Crystal_structure","Mayo_Clinic","Artery","Kidney_stone","NASA","Cell_culture","Life","Plant_propagation","Fetuin","Witherite","Megavirus","Archaeum","Nanobe","Protobiont","Parvovirus","Prion","Ultramicrobacteria"]}
