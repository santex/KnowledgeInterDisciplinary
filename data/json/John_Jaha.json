He played for the Milwaukee Brewers and\n  Oakland Athletics, playing in both the American League and National League. He\n  was elected to the American League All-Star team in 1999.\n\nJohn Jaha graduated from David Douglas High School in Portland, Oregon in 1984.\nHe still holds most offensive baseball records for the school. Jaha was drafted\nby the Milwaukee Brewers in 1984 and made his Major League debut with the\nBrewers on July 9, 1992. He also had great success playing with the Daikyo\nDolphins in the Australian Baseball League in 1991 and 1992 alongside Brewers\nand 1999 All-Star team mate, Dave\nNilsson. [http://www.pflintoff.com/USMajors.htm Flintoff and Dunn\nAlamanac] Earlier in 1992, while playing for Brewers Triple-A affiliate\nDenver, Jaha became only the second player (after Joey Meyer) to hit a ball into\nthe upper deck at Mile High Stadium. He is often considered the greatest Brewers\nfirst baseman in the 1990s, and was noted for his physical comparisons to Uncle\nFester of Addams Family fame.\n\nAfter an injury plagued Major League career with the Brewers, John Jaha signed a\nminor-league contract with the Oakland Athletics in 1999. Although Jaha wasn't\nexpected to make the team - in fact, he was left out of the team's media guide\nthat spring - he turned in a remarkable comeback season. Earning his first All-\nStar berth along the way, he finished the season with 35 home runs (tying Dave\nKingman for most by an Oakland designated hitter) and 111 RBIs and was named the\nAmerican League Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nIt was his last season of significant productivity. Jaha played in just 33 games\nin 2000, fewer the following year. An enormously popular figure in the Oakland\nAthletics clubhouse, he drew a standing ovation from his A's teammates when he\nfinally announced his retirement on June 30, 2001.\n\nJaha is of Lebanese descent.\n","linknr":187,"url":"John_Jaha","recorded":1375058800,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Portland,_Oregon","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Daikyo_Dolphins","/wiki/1991_in_baseball","/wiki/1992_in_baseball","/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers","/wiki/1992_in_baseball","/wiki/1998_in_baseball","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/1999_in_baseball","/wiki/2001_in_baseball","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/1999_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game","/wiki/AL_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year","/wiki/Portland,_Oregon","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/All-Star","/wiki/Daikyo_Dolphins","/wiki/Australian_Baseball_League_(1989-1999)","/wiki/Dave_Nilsson","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Denver_Bears","/wiki/Joey_Meyer_(baseball_player)","/wiki/Mile_High_Stadium","/wiki/Uncle_Fester","/wiki/Addams_Family","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Dave_Kingman","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/RBI","/wiki/Lebanon","/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.pflintoff.com/USMajors.htm","/wiki/Bret_Saberhagen","/wiki/MLB_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award","/wiki/Frank_Thomas_(AL_baseball_player)","/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jahajo01.shtml","/wiki/Template:AL_Comeback_Players_of_the_Year","/wiki/Template_talk:AL_Comeback_Players_of_the_Year","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:AL_Comeback_Players_of_the_Year&action=edit","/wiki/The_Sporting_News_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award","/wiki/Norm_Cash","/wiki/Boog_Powell","/wiki/Dean_Chance","/wiki/Ken_Harrelson","/wiki/Tony_Conigliaro","/wiki/Clyde_Wright","/wiki/Norm_Cash","/wiki/Luis_Tiant","/wiki/John_Hiller","/wiki/Ferguson_Jenkins","/wiki/Boog_Powell","/wiki/Dock_Ellis","/wiki/Eric_Soderholm","/wiki/Mike_Caldwell_(baseball)","/wiki/Willie_Horton_(baseball)","/wiki/Matt_Keough","/wiki/Richie_Zisk","/wiki/Andre_Thornton","/wiki/Alan_Trammell","/wiki/Dave_Kingman","/wiki/Gorman_Thomas","/wiki/John_Candelaria","/wiki/Bret_Saberhagen","/wiki/Storm_Davis","/wiki/Bert_Blyleven","/wiki/Dave_Winfield","/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Guzm%C3%A1n","/wiki/Rick_Sutcliffe","/wiki/Bo_Jackson","/wiki/Jose_Canseco","/wiki/Tim_Wakefield","/wiki/Kevin_Elster","/wiki/David_Justice","/wiki/Bret_Saberhagen","/wiki/Frank_Thomas_(designated_hitter)","/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Sierra","/wiki/Tim_Salmon","/wiki/Gil_Meche","/wiki/Paul_Konerko","/wiki/Jason_Giambi","/wiki/Jim_Thome","/wiki/Carlos_Pe%C3%B1a","/wiki/Cliff_Lee","/wiki/Aaron_Hill_(baseball)","/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero","/wiki/Jacoby_Ellsbury","/wiki/Adam_Dunn","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Portland,_Oregon","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&oldid=556873761","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1966_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:American_League_All-Stars","/wiki/Category:Milwaukee_Brewers_players","/wiki/Category:Oakland_Athletics_players","/wiki/Category:Tri-Cities_Triplets_players","/wiki/Category:Denver_Zephyrs_players","/wiki/Category:Stockton_Ports_players","/wiki/Category:Beloit_Brewers_players","/wiki/Category:Helena_Gold_Sox_players","/wiki/Category:New_Orleans_Zephyrs_players","/wiki/Category:Beloit_Snappers_players","/wiki/Category:Modesto_A%27s_players","/wiki/Category:Sacramento_River_Cats_players","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_Oregon","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_Lebanese_descent","/wiki/Category:David_Douglas_High_School_alumni","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Jaha&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Jaha","/wiki/John_Jaha","/wiki/Talk:John_Jaha","#","/wiki/John_Jaha","/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Jaha&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/sea
