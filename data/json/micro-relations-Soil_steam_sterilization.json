Pests of plant\ncultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced\nhot steam which causes their cell structure to physically degenerate.\nBiologically, the method is considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-\nresistant, spore-forming bacteria survive and revitalize the soil after cooling\ndown. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances\nblocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker\ngrowth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the\napplication of hot steam is considered the best and most effective way to\ndisinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. It is being used as an\nalternative to bromomethane, whose production and use was curtailed by the\nMontreal Protocol. \"Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to\nlevels that cause protein coagulation or enzyme inactivation.\" [http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/casestudies/volume3/steam3.html EPA]\nSteam as an Alternative to Methyl Bromide in Nursery Crops\n","linknr":213,"url":"Soil_steam_sterilization","recorded":1362671493,"links":21,"instances":["microbiology"],"pdf":["http://www.soil-steaming-steam-boiler-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/steaming-research-results_dlr2010.pdf","http://www.soil-steaming-steam-boiler-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/research_dlr_soil-fatigue_tree-nursery.pdf"],"categories":["Boilers","Organic food","Soil science","Steam power"],"headings":["Benefits of soil steaming","Steaming with superheated steam","Surface Steaming","Container / Stack steaming","History","Application of hot steam","Sources and notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg/220px-Maler_der_Grabkammer_des_Sennudem_001.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Farmer_plowing_in_Fahrenwalde%2C_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern%2C_Germany.jpg/32px-Farmer_plowing_in_Fahrenwalde%2C_Mecklenburg-Vorpommern%2C_Germany.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Daempfen.jpg/220px-Daempfen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Haube.jpeg/220px-Haube.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sandwichdaempfung.jpg/220px-Sandwichdaempfung.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["sterilization"],"related":["Farming","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Soil","Steam","Bromomethane","Montreal_Protocol","Protein","Enzyme","Nematodes","Celsius","Nematode","Fungi","Weed","Polypropylene","Plough"]}
