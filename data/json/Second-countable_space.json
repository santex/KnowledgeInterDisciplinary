{"cursor":"4759","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In topology, a 'second-countable space', also called a 'completely separable\nspace', is a topological space satisfying the 'second [[axiom of\ncountability]]'. A space is said to be second-countable if its topology has a\ncountable base. More explicitly, this means that a topological space\nT is second countable if there exists some countable collection\n\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_i\\}_{i=1}^\\infty of open subsets of\nT such that any open subset of T can be written as a\nunion of elements of some subfamily of \\mathcal{U} . Like other\ncountability axioms, the property of being second-countable restricts the number\nof open sets that a space can have.\n\nMost \"well-behaved\" spaces in mathematics are second-countable. For example,\nEuclidean space ('R' n) with its usual topology is second-countable.\nAlthough the usual base of open balls is not countable, one can restrict to the\nset of all open balls with rational radii and whose centers have rational\ncoordinates. This restricted set is countable and still forms a basis.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Second-countable_space","recorded":1362477251,"links":19,"instances":["topology","topology","topology","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["General topology","Properties of topological spaces"],"headings":["Properties","Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/e/74e1d07fb8e6e54dbeae016d78d1fb5c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/e/b9ece18c950afbfa6b0fdbfa4ff731d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/7/e/e7e62356c0efc1c755aa8b68155265a0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/6/3f68d5bf6424ac8e76f82816a2f7a566.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","topology"],["dense","topology"],["image","mathematics"],["subspace","topology"]],"members":["subspace","base","dense","image"],"related":["Topology","Topological_space","Countable","Base_(topology)","Open_set","Well-behaved","Mathematics","Euclidean_space","Open_ball","Rational_number","First-countable_space","Local_base","Separable_space","Dense_(topology)","Lindel√∂f_space","Open_cover","Lower_limit_topology","Metric_space","Compact_space","Pavel_Samuilovich_Urysohn","Metrization_theorem","Regular_space","Metrizable","Completely_normal_space","Paracompact","Open_map","Image_(mathematics)","Subspace_(topology)","Quotient_space","Product_space","Cardinality","Cardinality_of_the_continuum"]}
