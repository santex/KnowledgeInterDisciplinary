{"cursor":"2427","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, a 'cyclic compound' is a compound in which a series of atoms is\nconnected to form a loop or ring. While the vast majority of cyclic\ncompounds are organic, a few inorganic substances form cyclic compounds as well,\nincluding sulfur, silanes, phosphanes, phosphoric acid, and triboric acid.\nCyclic compounds may or may not be aromatic. Benzene is aromatic while\ncyclohexane is not. The term \"polycyclic\" is used when more than one ring is\nformed in a single molecule for instance in naphthalene, and the term macrocycle\nis used for a ring containing more than a dozen atoms.\n\n Image:cycloheptane sticks.png|Cycloheptane, a non-aromatic cyclic\ncompound.

The common names\nresemble the IUPAC names.
