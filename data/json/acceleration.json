As described by Newton's\nSecond Law, acceleration is caused by a net force; the force, as a vector, is\nequal to the product of the mass of the object being accelerated (scalar) and\nthe acceleration (vector). The SI unit of acceleration is the meter per second\nsquared (m/s<sup>2</sup>).\n\nFor example, an object such as a car that starts from standstill, then travels\nin a straight line at increasing speed, is accelerating in the direction of\ntravel. If the car changes direction at constant speedometer reading, there is\nstrictly speaking an acceleration although it is often not so described;\npassengers in the car will experience a force pushing them back into their seats\nin linear acceleration, and a sideways force on changing direction. If the speed\nof the car decreases, it is usual and meaningful to speak of 'deceleration';\nmathematically it is acceleration in the opposite direction to that of motion.\n","title":"acceleration","headings":["Definition and properties","Tangential and centripetal acceleration","Special cases","Relation to relativity","Conversions","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Velocity","2: Meter_per_second_squared","2: Newton's_Second_Law","2: Force","2: International_System_of_Units","2: Time","2: Metre_per_second_squared","2: Proper_acceleration","2: Circular_motion","2: Centripetal_force","1: Physics","1: Euclidean_vector","1: Infinitesimal","1: Derivative","1: Time_in_physics","1: Rectilinear_motion","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Length","1: Accelerometer","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Newton's_laws_of_motion","1: Speed_of_light","1: Special_relativity","1: Differential_geometry_of_curves#Tangent_vector","1: Chain_rule","1: Differential_geometry_of_curves#Normal_or_curvature_vector","1: Osculating_circle#Mathematical_description","1: Tangential_acceleration","1: Frenetâ€“Serret_formulas","1: Free_fall","1: Gravitational_field","1: Galileo","1: Speed","1: Angular_velocity","1: Centrifugal_force","1: Pseudo_force","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Linear_momentum","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Asymptotically","1: Gravity","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Principle_of_equivalence","1: 0_to_60_mph","1: 0_to_100_km/h","1: Angular_acceleration","1: Equations_of_motion","1: Foot_per_second_squared","1: Four-vector","1: Gravitational_acceleration","1: Kinematics","1: Shock_and_vibration_data_logger","1: Specific_force","1: Standard_gravity","1: Uniform_acceleration"]}
