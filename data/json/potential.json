In either case, it is a field\ndefined in space, from which many important physical properties may be derived.\n**Leading examples are the gravitational potential and the electric potential,\nfrom which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be\nobtained. **Specific forces have associated potentials, including the Coulomb\npotential, the van der Waals potential, the Lennard-Jones potential and the\nYukawa potential. **In electrochemistry there are Galvani potential, Volta\npotential, electrode potential, standard electrode potential. **In\nThermodynamics potential refers to thermodynamic potential.\n","title":"potential","headings":["See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: Irrealis_mood#Potential","1: Mathematic","1: Potential_theory","1: Harmonic_function","1: Manifold","1: Irrotational","1: Laplacian","1: Physics","1: Scalar_potential","1: Vector_potential","1: Gravitational_potential","1: Electric_potential","1: Coulomb_potential","1: Van_der_Waals_potential","1: Lennard-Jones_potential","1: Yukawa_potential","1: Electrochemistry","1: Galvani_potential","1: Volta_potential","1: Electrode_potential","1: Standard_electrode_potential","1: Thermodynamics","1: Thermodynamic_potential","1: Potential_difference","1: Potential_energy"]}
