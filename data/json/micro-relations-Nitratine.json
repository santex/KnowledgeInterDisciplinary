Chemically it is the Na-\nanalogue of niter. Nitratine crystallizes in the trigonal system, but rarely\noccurs as well formed crystals. It is isostructural with calcite. It is quite\nsoft and light with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and a specific gravity of 2.24\nto 2.29. Its refractive indices are nÏ=1.587 and nÎµ=1.336. Nesse, W,\nintroduction to Optical Mineralogy, Fourth Edition (Oxford, New York, Oxford\nUniversity Press) 2013. appendix II, B.3\n\nThe typical form is as coatings of white, grey to yellowish brown masses. The\nrare crystals when found typically have the scalenohedral form of the calcite\nstructure. It is found only as an efflorescence in very dry environments. It\nis very soluble in water such that it is deliquescent and will absorb water\nout of the air and turn into a puddle of sodium nitrate solution when exposed\nto humid air.\n\nNitratine was once an important source of nitrates for fertilizer and other\nchemical uses including fireworks. It has since been replaced by fixed nitrogen\nfrom the air as the main source of nitrogen. It has been known since 1845 from\noccurrences in the Confidence Hills, Southern Death Valley, California and the\nAtacama Desert, Chile.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Nitratine","recorded":1362482281,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sodium minerals","Nitrate minerals"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Topaze_Br%C3%A9sil2.jpg/40px-Topaze_Br%C3%A9sil2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nitrate_mineral","Ångstrom","Trigonal","Uniaxial","Sodium_nitrate","Niter","Rhombohedral_crystal_system","Calcite","Mohs_hardness","Specific_gravity","Refractive_index","Calcite","Deliquescent","Death_Valley","California","Atacama_Desert","Chile"]}
