Crohn's disease is caused by interactions between environmental,\nimmunological and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible\nindividuals. This results in a chronic\ninflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the\ngastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. Crohn's disease has wrongly\nbeen described as an autoimmune disease in the past; recent investigators have\ndescribed it as an immune deficiency state. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-\n6736%2810%2960282-6/fulltext What's in a name? The (mis)labelling of Crohn's as\nan autoimmune disease Defective IL-1A expression in patients with\nCrohn's disease is related to attenuated MAP3K4\nsignaling.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22732089 Revisiting\nCrohn's disease as a primary immunodeficiency of macrophages\nhttp://jem.rupress.org/content/206/9/1839.full\n\nThere is a genetic association with Crohn's disease, primarily with variations\nof the [[NOD2]] gene and its protein, which senses bacterial cell walls.\nSiblings of affected individuals are at higher risk.\n Males and females are equally affected. Smokers are two times more likely\nto develop Crohn's disease than nonsmokers. Crohn's\ndisease affects between 400,000 and 600,000 people in North America. Prevalence estimates for Northern Europe have ranged from\n27â48 per 100,000. Crohn's disease tends to present\ninitially in the teens and twenties, with another peak incidence in the fifties\nto seventies, although the disease can occur at any age. There is no known pharmaceutical or surgical cure for Crohn's\ndisease. Treatment options are restricted to controlling symptoms, maintaining\nremission, and preventing relapse. The disease was named after\ngastroenterologist Burrill Bernard Crohn, who, in 1932, together with two other\ncolleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, described a series of patients\nwith inflammation of the terminal ileum, the area most commonly affected by the\nillness.\n","linknr":1956,"url":"Crohn's_disease","recorded":1362510717,"links":100,"instances":["cellular","mood","epidemiology","medicine","medicine","biochemistry","anatomy","medicine","nutrition","medical","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/CrohnsDiseaseinAdults.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/CrohnsDiseaseinAdults.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080406030552/http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://www.paratuberculosis.info/web/images/proc11/108.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out38_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out38_en.pdf","http://www.plos.org/media/press/2012/PLoS_%20HMP_Collection_Manuscript_Summaries.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080406030552/http://www.carj.ca/issues/2005-Feb/25/pg25.pdf","http://www.carj.ca/issues/2005-Feb/25/pg25.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080406030552/http://www.carj.ca/issues/2005-Feb/25/pg25.pdf","http://gut.bmj.com/content/55/suppl_1/i36.full.pdf","http://gut.bmj.com/content/55/suppl_1/i36.full.pdf"],"categories":["Abdominal
