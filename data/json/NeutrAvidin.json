{"cursor":"1992","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'NeutrAvidin' protein is a deglycosylated version of avidin, with a mass of\napproximately 60,000 daltons. As a result of carbohydrate removal, lectin\nbinding is reduced to undetectable levels, yet biotin binding affinity is\nretained because the carbohydrate is not necessary for this activity. Avidin has\na high pI but NeutrAvidin has a near-neutral pI (pH 6.3), minimizing non-\nspecific interactions with the negatively charged cell surface or with DNA/RNA.\nNeutravidin still has lysine residues that remain available for derivatization\nor conjugation.\n\nLike avidin itself, NeutrAvidin is a tetramer with a strong affinity for biotin\n(K d = 10 -15 M). In biochemical applications, streptavidin,\nwhich also binds very tightly to biotin, may be used interchangeably with\nNeutrAvidin.\n\nAvidin immobilized onto solid supports is also used as purification media to\ncapture biotin-labelled protein or nucleic acid molecules. For example, cell\nsurface proteins can be specifically labelled with membrane-impermeable biotin\nreagent, then specifically captured using a NeutrAvidin support.\n","linknr":95,"url":"NeutrAvidin","recorded":1362503128,"links":15,"instances":["pharmacology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["affinity","pharmacology"]],"members":["affinity"],"related":["Glycosylated","Avidin","Atomic_mass_unit","Carbohydrate","Lectin","Affinity_(pharmacology)","Isoelectric_point","Lysine","Derivatization","Conjugated_system","Tetrameric_protein","Biotin","Biochemical","Streptavidin","Biotinylation","Nucleic_acid","Membrane_proteins","Reagent"]}
