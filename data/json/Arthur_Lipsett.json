His father remarried without\nconsulting Arthur and his daughter, Marian. Despite his difficult past, Lipsett\nexcelled as a student at the Ãcole des beaux-arts de MontrÃ©al, where his mentor,\nArthur Lismer, recommended him to the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).\nLipsett joined the NFB in 1958 as an editor.\n\nLipsett's particular passion was sound. He collected pieces of sound from a\nvariety of sources and fit them together to create an interesting auditory\nsensation. After playing one of these creations to friends, they suggested that\nLipsett combine images with the sound collage. The result is a 7 minute long\nfilm [[Very Nice, Very Nice]] which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best\nShort Subject, Live Action Subjects in 1962. Despite not winning the Oscar, this\nfilm brought Lipsett considerable praise from critics and directors. Stanley\nKubrick was one of Lipsett's fans, and asked him to create a trailer for his\nupcoming movie [[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the\nBomb|Dr. Strangelove]]. Lipsett declined Kubrick's offer. Kubrick went on to\ndirect the trailer himself; however, Lipsett's influence on Kubrick is clearly\nvisible in the released trailer.\n\nLipsett's meticulous editing and combination of audio and visual montage was\nboth groundbreaking and influential. His film [[21-87]] was a profound influence\non director George Lucas, who used thematic approaches from 21â87 in [[THX\n1138]], his [[Star Wars]] films and also [[American Graffiti]]. Lucas has said\nthat his use of the term the \"The Force\" in Star Wars was \"an echo of that\nphrase in 21-\n87\". [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/lucas.html?pg=3&topic=lucas&-\ntopic_set=%20Life%20After%20Darth Wired 13.05: Life After Darth] Lucas\nnever met Lipsett, but tributes to 21â87 appear in several places in Star Wars.\nFor example, the holding cell of Princess Leia in [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New\nHope]] on the [[Death Star]] is cell No. 2187.\n\nIn 1965, Lipsett completed [[A Trip Down Memory Lane]], utilizing newsreel\nfootage from over a fifty year period, and intended as a kind of cinematic time\ncapsule.\n\nLipsett's success allowed him some freedom at the NFB, but as his films became\nmore bizarre, this freedom quickly disappeared. In his later years, he suffered\nfrom psychological problems, including bipolar disorder, which progressed in\nseverity. Lipsett committed suicide in 1986, two weeks before his 50th\nbirthday.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Arthur_Lipsett","recorded":1375082954,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Arthur_Lipsett.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/Arthur_Lipsett.jpg/150px-Arthur_Lipsett.jpg","/wiki/Montreal","/wiki/Montreal","/wiki/Film_editor","/wiki/Cinema_of_Canada","/wiki/Avant-garde","/wiki/Collage_film","/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_beaux-arts_de_Montr%C3%A9al","/wiki/Arthur_Lismer","/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada","#cite_note-focusbio-1","/wiki/Very_Nice,_Very_Nice","/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick","/wiki/Trailer_(film)","/wiki/Dr._Strangelove_or:_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_the_Bomb","/wiki/21-87","/wiki/George_Lucas","/wiki/THX_1138","/wiki/Star_Wars","/wiki/American_Graffiti","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Princess_Leia","/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope","/wiki/Death_Star","#cite_note-CBC-3","/wiki/A_Trip_Down_Memory_Lane","/wiki/Time_capsule","#cite_note-Kashmere-4","/wiki/Bipolar_disorder","#cite_note-CBC-3","#cite_note-Larissa-5","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Remembering_Arthur","/wiki/Bravo!","/wiki/TVOntario","#cite_note-remembering-6","#cite_note-gaucher-7","/wiki/Lipsett_Diaries","/wiki/Theodore_Ushev","/wiki/Chris_Robinson_(writer)","#cite_note-diaries-8","http://arthurlipsett.weebly.com","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-focusbio_1-0","http://www3.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/filmmakers/Arthur-Lipsett/biography.php","#cite_ref-2","http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/lucas.html?pg=3&topic=lucas&topic_set=%20Life%20After%20Darth","#cite_ref-CBC_3-0","#cite_ref-CBC_3-1","http://www.cbc.ca/arts/features/starwars/","#cite_ref-Kashmere_4-0","http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/04/lipsett.html","/wiki/Senses_of_Cinema","/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number","//www.worldcat.org/issn/1443-4059","#cite_ref-Larissa_5-0","http://www.ottawacitizen.com/health/Genie+Awards+Finding+crazy+manic+sides/4414021/story.html#ixzz1GXELGIXa","/wiki/Ottawa_Citizen","#cite_ref-remembering_6-0","http://www.nfb.ca/film/remembering_arthur/","#cite_ref-gaucher_7-0","http://www.nfb.ca/film/arthur_lipsett_project_a_dot_on_the_histomap/","#cite_ref-diaries_8-0","http://films.nfb.ca/lipsett-diaries/","/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada","http://web.archive.org/web/20101010042342/http://films.nfb.ca/lipsett-diaries/","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit&section=3","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0513750/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www3.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/filmmakers/Arthur-Lipsett/overview.php","http://www.nfb.ca/explore-by/director/Arthur-Lipsett","/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada","http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/lipsett/","http://www.siegelproductions.ca/filmfanatics/arthurlipsett.htm","http://www.public-pictures.com","http://www.lipsettdiaries.net","/wiki/Template:Arthur_Lipsett","/wiki/Template_talk:Arthur_Lipsett","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Arthur_Lipsett&action=edit","/wiki/Very_Nice,_Very_Nice","/wiki/21-87","/wiki/A_Trip_Down_Memory_Lane","/wiki/Remembering_Arthur","/wiki/Lipsett_Diaries","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Montreal","/wiki/Montreal","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Lipsett&oldid=551171707","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1936_births","/wiki/Category:1986_deaths","/wiki/Category:Film_directors_from_Montreal","/wiki/Category:Film_directors_who_committed_suicide","/wiki/Category:Canadian_experimental_filmmakers","/wiki/Category:Anglophone_Quebec_people","/wiki/Category:National_Film_Board_of_Canada_people","/wiki/Category:People_with_bipolar_disorder","/wiki/Category:Canadian_animators","/wiki/Category:Collage_filmmakers","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_of_Ukrainian-Jewish_descent","/wiki/Category:Use_mdy_dates_from_June_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arthur+Lipsett&type=signup","/w/index
