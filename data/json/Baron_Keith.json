He was the fifth son of Charles Elphinstone, 10th Lord\nElphinstone (see Lord Elphinstone for earlier history of the Elphinstone family)\nby his wife Lady Clementine, daughter of John Fleming, 6th Earl of Wigtown and\nLady Mary, daughter of William Keith, 8th Earl Marischal (see Earl Marischal for\nearlier history of the Keith family). The first creation came in the Peerage of\nIreland in 1797 when he was made 'Baron Keith', of Stonehaven Marrischal, with\nremainder in default of issue male of his own to his daughter and only child\nfrom his first marriage, Margaret Mercer Elphinstone, and the heirs male of her\nbody. On 15 December 1801 he was created 'Baron Keith', of Stonehaven Marischal\nin the County of Kincardine, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with normal\nremainder to heirs male. In 1803 he was made 'Baron Keith', of Banheath in the\nCounty of Dumbarton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to his\ndaughter and only child from his first marriage, Margaret Mercer Elphinstone and\nthe heirs male of her body. In 1814 Lord Keith was further honoured when he was\nmade 'Viscount Keith' in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with normal\nremainder to heirs male.\n\nHe died on 10 March 1823, when the viscountcy and barony of 1801 became extinct\nas he had no sons, while the baronies of 1797 and 1803 passed according to the\nspecial remainders to his daughter, the second Baroness. She was married to the\nFrench aristocrat Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut. In 1837 she also succeeded\nher cousin as 7th Lady Nairne although she was not recognised in the title. Lady\nKeith was a prominent society hostess in both London and Paris. She had five\ndaughters but no sons and on her death in 1867 the baronies of 1797 and 1803\nbecame extinct as well. She was succeeded in the Scottish lordship of Nairne by\nher eldest daughter Emily Petty-Fitzmaurice, Marchioness of Lansdowne, who\nbecame the 8th Lady Nairne (see Lord Nairne for further history of this title).\n\nThe title Lord Keith of Inverury was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1677.\nFor more information on this creation, see Earl of Kintore. Three life peers\nhave taken the title Baron Keith in United Kingdom, two Law Lords under the\nAppellate Jurisdiction Act 1876: Baron Keith of Avonholm (1953), Baron Keith of\nKinkel (1977) and a third life peerage under the Life Peerages Act 1958, Baron\nKeith of Castleacre (1980).\n","linknr":113,"url":"Baron_Keith","recorded":1363830387,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:1st_Viscount_Keith.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/1st_Viscount_Keith.jpg/200px-1st_Viscount_Keith.jpg","/wiki/File:1st_Viscount_Keith.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/George_Keith_Elphinstone,_1st_Viscount_Keith","/wiki/Lord_Elphinstone","/wiki/Earl_Marischal","/wiki/Peerage_of_Ireland","/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Charles_Joseph,_comte_de_Flahaut","/wiki/Lord_Nairne","/wiki/London","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Emily_Petty-Fitzmaurice,_Marchioness_of_Lansdowne","/wiki/Lord_Nairne","/wiki/Peerage_of_Scotland","/wiki/Earl_of_Kintore","/wiki/Life_peer","/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Law_Lord","/wiki/Appellate_Jurisdiction_Act_1876","/wiki/Baron_Keith_of_Avonholm","/wiki/Baron_Keith_of_Kinkel","/wiki/Life_Peerages_Act_1958","/wiki/Baron_Keith_of_Castleacre","#Barons_Keith.3B_First_and_third_creations_.281797.2F1803.29","#Barons_Keith.3B_Second_creation_.281801.29","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/George_Keith_Elphinstone,_1st_Viscount_Keith","/wiki/Margaret_Keith,_2nd_Baroness_Keith","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/George_Keith_Elphinstone,_1st_Viscount_Keith","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Lord_Elphinstone","/wiki/Earl_Marischal","/wiki/Lord_Nairne","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit&section=4","http://www.leighrayment.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&oldid=506713501","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baronies_in_the_Peerage_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Extinct_baronies_in_the_Peerage_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_February_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Keith&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Baron+Keith","/wiki/Baron_Keith","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Baron_Keith&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Baron_Keith","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Baron_Keith","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Baron_Keith","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&oldid=506713501","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Baron_Keith&id=506713501","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Baron+Keith","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Baron+Keith&oldid=506713501&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Baron_Keith&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Keith","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/p
