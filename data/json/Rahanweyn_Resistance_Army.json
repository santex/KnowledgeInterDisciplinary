It was the first Reewin armed faction to emerge during\nthe Somali civil war. The stated goal of the RRA is the creation and recognition\nof an independent state of Southwestern Somalia, currently led by Hasan Muhammad\nNur Shatigadud. It is currently under the authority of the Transitional Federal\nGovernment.\n\nThe RRA was found in a shir assembly at Jhaffey, west of \"Baidoa\", on 13 October\n1995. Col. Hassan Mohamed Nur, \"Shaargaduud\" (Red Shirt) was elected chair, and\nan executive committee composed of officers, traditional and religious leaders,\nand intellectuals was established. The formation of the RRA was triggered by the\ninvasion of Baidoa by Hussein Mohamed Farrah's militia on 17 September 1995,\nwhich overthrew the local government, The Digil-Mirifle Supreme Governing\nCouncil, which was established in March 1995. Aideed completed the occupation of\nReewin land by capturing Huddur in the Bakool Region.\n\nThe RRA's first major task was to recruit, train, and arm young Reewin men and\nwomen. Former officers supervised the training and all Reewin clans contributed\nmen, arms, and money. Early in 1996, the RRA attacked the more important\ninstallations held by Aideed in Huddur and Baidoa. When reconciliation efforts,\nespecially the Sodere Declaration and Cairo Accords, failed after the death of\nAidid in a street fight and the succession of his son, \"Aideed Junior,\" the RRA\ninsisted that it would not negotiate with those who occupied Reewin land.\n\nIn October 1998, the RRA liberated Huddur and, by early November, Aideed's\nmilitia had retreated to Baidoa. This victory consolidated the RRA's military\nand political status locally and internationally. On 6 June 1999, the RRA\nliberated Baidoa and continued to fight against Aideed forces in the Lower\nShabelle region. However, the Arta Reconciliation Conference of MayâAugust,\n2000, which established a transitional national government, suspended further\nRRA military action. However, within a few months, the RRA broke away from\nthe Arta agreements and began to work towards the establishment of an\nautonomous state.\n\nUnder Shatigadud's leadership, the RRA planted landmines in many areas under its\ncontrol in the war, as did many factions in the Civil War. {{cite news |title=LM Report 2002\n|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2002/somalia.html |publisher=Landmine Monitor\n|date=August 2002 |accessdate=2007-02-04 }} It was also a participant,\nalong with fifteen other factions of the civil war, in the November 11, 2002\nDeed of Commitment to ban landmines. {{cite web\n|title=LM Report 2005 |url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/2005/somalia.html\n|publisher=Landmine Monitor |date=October 2005 |accessdate=2007-02-04 }}\n\nInternal disputes in the RRA erupted in 2002 between Shatigadud, who wished to\nsupport the new Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC) and his\ntwo deputies, Sheikh Aden Madobe and Muhammad Ibrahim Habsade, who wished to\ncontinue to support the Transitional National Government (TNG). The conflict\nresulted in many deaths and calls for Shatigadud to step down as President. {{cite news |title=Baidoa uneasy as RRA leaders

being part of the nascent national government. {{cite news |title=SOMALIA: RRA\nleaders in talks with TNG

RRA\nwere eventually reconciled and, though conflicts periodically erupted\nthereafter, all joined the Transitional Federal Government at its formation.\n\nIn June 2006 Botan Ise Alin's militia that was allied to Alliance for the\nRestoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism has surrendered to RRA after the\nSecond Battle of Mogadishu by Islamic Court Union forces.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army","recorded":1375082207,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Somali_Civil_War","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Southwestern_Somalia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Flag_of_Southwestern_Somalia.svg/200px-Flag_of_Southwestern_Somalia.svg.png","/wiki/Southwestern_Somalia","/wiki/Hasan_Muhammad_Nur_Shatigadud","/wiki/Sheikh","/wiki/Adan_Mohamed_Nuur_Madobe","/wiki/Muhammad_Ibrahim_Habsade","/wiki/Rahanweyn","/wiki/Baidoa","/wiki/Bay,_Somalia","/wiki/Bakool","/wiki/Southwestern_Somalia","/wiki/Transitional_Federal_Government","/wiki/Transitional_National_Government","/wiki/Somalia_Reconciliation_and_Restoration_Council","/wiki/Transitional_Federal_Government","/wiki/Ethiopia","/wiki/Somali_National_Alliance","/wiki/Somalia_Reconciliation_and_Restoration_Council","/wiki/Somali_Patriotic_Movement","/wiki/Islamic_Courts_Union","/wiki/Template:Campaignbox_Somali_Civil_War","/wiki/Template_talk:Campaignbox_Somali_Civil_War","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Campaignbox_Somali_Civil_War&action=edit","/wiki/Somali_Civil_War","/wiki/Somali_Rebellion","/wiki/Unified_Task_Force","/wiki/Consolidation_of_states_within_Somalia_(1998%E2%80%932006)","/wiki/Advance_of_the_Islamic_Courts_Union","/wiki/War_in_Somalia_(2006%E2%80%9309)","/wiki/War_in_Somalia_(2009%E2%80%93present)","/wiki/Somalia","/wiki/Bay,_Somalia","/wiki/Bakool","/wiki/Somali_civil_war","/wiki/Southwestern_Somalia","/wiki/Hasan_Muhammad_Nur_Shatigadud","/wiki/Transitional_Federal_Government","/w/index.php?title=Jhaffey&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Baidoa","/wiki/Hussein_Mohamed_Farrah","/wiki/Huddur","/wiki/Bakool","/wiki/Hussein_Aidid","/wiki/Lower_Shabelle","/wiki/Arta,_Djibouti","#cite_note-LM-REPORT-2002-1","#cite_note-LM-REPORT-2005-2","/wiki/Somalia_Reconciliation_and_Restoration_Council","/wiki/Sheikh","/wiki/Aden_Madobe","/wiki/Muhammad_Ibrahim_Habsade","/wiki/Transitional_National_Government","#cite_note-BAIDOA-UNEASY-3","#cite_note-SOMALIA-RRA-LEADERS-IN-TALKS-WITH-TNG-4","/wiki/Transitional_Federal_Government","/wiki/Botan_Ise_Alin","/wiki/Alliance_for_the_Restoration_of_Peace_and_Counter-Terrorism","/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Mogadishu","/wiki/Islamic_Court_Union","/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-LM-REPORT-2002_1-0","http://www.icbl.org/lm/2002/somalia.html","/w/index.php?title=Landmine_Monitor&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-LM-REPORT-2005_2-0","http://www.icbl.org/lm/2005/somalia.html","/w/index.php?title=Landmine_Monitor&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-BAIDOA-UNEASY_3-0","http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=28534","/wiki/IRIN","#cite_ref-SOMALIA-RRA-LEADERS-IN-TALKS-WITH-TNG_4-0","http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=29653&SelectRegion=Horn_of_Africa&SelectCountry=SOMALIA","/wiki/IRIN","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&oldid=557173528","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1995_establishments_in_Somalia","/wiki/Category:Rebel_groups_in_Somalia","/wiki/Category:Secession_in_Somalia","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rahanweyn+Resistance+Army&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Rahanweyn+Resistance+Army","/wiki/Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army","/wiki/Talk:Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army","#","/wiki/Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army","/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Rahanweyn_Resistance_Army&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Con
