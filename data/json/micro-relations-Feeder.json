The\nband was formed in 1994 under the name of \"Reel\" by the\nremaining members Grant Nicholas and Jon Lee of electroacoustic group\nRaindancer, after the departure of guitarist John Canham, although Simon\nBlight departed in 1994 to make way for Taka Hirose. Feeder's lineup after\nsigning with The Echo Label in 1994 consisted of Grant Nicholas\n(guitar/vocals), Jon Lee (drums) and Taka Hirose (bass). In January 2002, Jon\nLee took his own life in his Miami home before former Skunk Anansie drummer\nMark Richardson, began to record and play with the band before being made an\nofficial member. In May 2009 he parted company with Feeder to return to a\nreformed Skunk Anansie. Since Mark's departure, Feeder have employed drummer\nKarl Brazil, although for sessions and touring commitments for [[Renegades\n(Feeder album)|Renegades]] (2010) they employed Australian Damon Wilson and\nformer Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter. Feeder has released eight studio\nalbums, three compilations, two EP's and 34 singles.\n\nFeeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles,\nincluding The Police, Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins. The band's sound was\nradically changed from that of Rain Dancer on their debut release the [[Two\nColours EP]] (1995), but has since introduced more acoustic aspects to their\nmusic, including elements of pianos and string orchestras.\n\nFeeder garnered media attention for their fourth album, [[Comfort in Sound]]\n(2002), while the tragedy of Jon Lee's death before the recording sessions\nwere noted. The album touched on many themes of loss and coming to terms with\ndeath, although it also explored themes of positivity. Comfort in Sound is\nFeeder's most successful release to date, selling over 503,706 copies in the\nUnited Kingdom between October 2002 and April 2012. Although Feeder have never\nto date gained a #1 release on any major chart, they have nonetheless garnered\na dedicated cult following, which enabled them to become one of a few artists\nto chart at least one album on the UK top 20 charts in at least three\ndifferent decades, while collecting a total of 102 chart weeks combined from\n10 charted releases.\n\nFeeder won two Kerrang! Awards in 2001 (Best British Live Act), after releasing\ntheir breakthrough album [[Echo Park (album)|Echo Park]] and in 2003 (Best\nBritish Band), when the band were promoting Comfort in Sound alongside their\nthen upcoming debut arena tour. They also feature in the book [[The Xfm Top 1000\nSongs of All Time]]. Feeder's most recent studio album, [[Generation Freakshow\n(album)|Generation Freakshow]], was released on April 23, 2012.\n","linknr":1259,"url":"Feeder","recorded":1362485449,"links":60,"instances":["feeder_song","song","magazine","song","feeder_song","feeder_song","band","musician","british_record_producer","feeder_song","feeder_song","feeder_song","australia","charity","song","feeder_song","feeder_song","feeder_album","band","feeder_song","song","band","record_label","band","feeder_song","song","drummer","producer","band","feeder_song"],"pdf":["http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2003.pdf","http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2003.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/1073315660fullreport.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/1073315660fullreport.pdf","http://www.chartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2004.pdf","http://www.chartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2004.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/00%20Annual%20Report%202005.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/00%20Annual%20Report%202005.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/Chrysalis%20Group%20Full%20Annual%20Report.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/Chrysalis%20Group%20Full%20Annual%20Report.pdf","http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20060620-0000/issue848.pdf","http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20060620-0000/issue848.pdf","http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2006.pdf","http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2006.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/Chrysalis%20Group%20Full%20Annual%20Report.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/Chrysalis%20Group%20Full%20Annual%20Report.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/news_db/2008_Preliminary_results.pdf","http://www.chrysalis.com/news_db/2008_Preliminary_results.pdf"],"categories":["Musical groups established in 1991","Welsh rock music groups","Post-Britpop groups","Echo Records artists","Kerrang!
