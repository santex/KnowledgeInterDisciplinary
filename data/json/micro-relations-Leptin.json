It is one of the most important adipose-\nderived hormones. The Ob(Lep) gene (Ob for obese,\nLep for leptin) is located on chromosome 7 in humans. It functions by binding to the leptin receptor.\n","linknr":1113,"url":"Leptin","recorded":1362485103,"links":47,"instances":["neuroanatomy","symptom"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptide hormones","Mutated genes","Obesity"],"headings":["Discovery","Biosynthesis","Function","Clinical significance","Mechanism of action","Metreleptin","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Leptin.png/250px-Leptin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/PBB_GE_LEP_207092_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_LEP_207092_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/PDB_1ax8_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1ax8_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fatmouse.jpg/220px-Fatmouse.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["anorexia","symptom"],["nucleus","neuroanatomy"]],"members":["nucleus","anorexia"],"related":["Atomic_mass_unit","Protein","Hormone","Appetite","Metabolism","Adipose_derived_hormones","Chromosome_7","Leptin_receptor","Mutant","Ob/ob_mouse","Jackson_Laboratory","Hyperphagic","Jeffrey_M._Friedman","Rockefeller_University","Douglas_L._Coleman","White_adipose_tissue","Brown_adipose_tissue","Placenta","Ovaries","Skeletal_muscle","Stomach","Mammary_gland","Epithelial_cell","Bone_marrow","Pituitary","Liver","Gastric_chief_cell","P/D1_cell","Neuropeptide_Y","Anandamide","THC","Α-MSH","Cholecystokinin","PYY3-36","Fasting","Very-low-calorie_diet","Melatonin","Melatonin","Insulin","Insulin","Adiposity","Adipose_tissue","Central_nervous_system","Blood_plasma","Hypothalamus","Amylin","Neuropeptide_Y","Arcuate_nucleus","Appetite","Metabolism","Neurons","Agouti-related_peptide","Neurons","Α-melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Anorexia_(symptom)","Gene","Obesity","Homozygous","T_cell","Angiogenesis","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Fetal","PTHrP","Fertility","Mammals","Placenta","Hyperemesis_gravidarum","Morning_sickness","Polycystic_ovary_syndrome","Stature","Oestrogen","Epiphyses","Bone_metabolism","Cancellous_bone","Cortical_bone","Neuropeptides","Neurotransmitters","Adrenaline","Noradrenaline","Serotonin","Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","Neuropeptide_Y","Blood–brain_barrier","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Fasting","Obstructive_sleep_apnea","Continuous_positive_airway_pressure","Sleep_deprivation","Emotional_stress","Testosterone","Estrogen","Physical_exercise","Training","Inflammation","Cytokines","Interleukin_6","Protein_family","Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal_axis","Hypertension","Metabolic_syndrome","Cardiovascular_disease","Hypertrophy","Hyperplasia","Adipocytes","Acipimox","Lipolysis","Type_2_diabetes","Insulin_resistance","Insulin","Adipose","Lectin","Fructose","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Insulin_resistance","Fructose","Triglyceride","Leptin_receptor","Intracellular","JAK-STAT_signaling_pathway","MAPK","Signal_transduction_pathways","Hypothalamus","Blood–brain_barrier","Median_eminence","Nucleus_(neuroanatomy)","Choroid_plexus","Endocannabinoids","Paracrine","Metreleptin","Hypertriglyceridemia","Lipodystrophy","Amylin_Pharmaceuticals","Orphan_drug_designation","Juvenile_Diabetes_Research_Foundation","Amylin_Pharmaceuticals","Type_1_diabetes","Teleost_leptins","Ghrelin","NAPEs"]}
