The\noriginal Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without\nreference to character,<ref></ref> bearing no pejorative connotation during the\nArchaic and early Classical periods, though it was clearly a bad word to Plato,\nand on account of the decisive influence of political philosophy its negative\nconnotations only increased down into the Hellenistic period, becoming\nsynonymous with \"Authenteo\" - another term which carried authoritarian\nconnotations around the turn of the first century A.D.\n\nPlato and Aristotle define a tyrant as, \"one who rules without law, looks to his\nown advantage rather than that of his subjects, and uses extreme and cruel\ntactics&mdash;against his own people as well as others\".<ref>Glad, B. (2002,\nMarch). Why Tyrants Go Too Far: Malignant Narcissism and Absolute Power.\nPolitical Psychology, 33. Retrieved May 15, 2010, from JSTOR database.</ref>\nDuring the seventh and sixth centuries BC, tyranny was often looked upon as an\nintermediate stage between narrow oligarchy and more democratic forms of polity.\nHowever, in the late fifth and fourth centuries, a new kind of tyrant, the\nmilitary dictator, arose, specifically in Sicily.\n",
