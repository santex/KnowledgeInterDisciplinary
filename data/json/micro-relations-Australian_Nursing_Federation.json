The ANF is\nthe national union for nurses, midwives and assistants in nursing and the\nlargest professional nursing organisation in Australia. The ANF has had\nsignificant membership growth over the last ten years and has recently announced\nthat they have reached [http://anf.org.au/news/entry/anf-membership-milestone1\n250,000 members nationally] and is the [http://anf.org.au/news/entry/anf-is-now-the-largest-health-and-aged-care-\nunion largest health and aged care union] in Australia. The ANF's core business\nis the political, industrial and professional representation of nurses, midwives\nand assistants in nursing through the activities of a national office and\nbranches in every State and Territory.\n\nThe ANF's '220,000'+ members are employed in a wide range of enterprises in\nurban, rural and remote locations in both in the public and private sectors,\nincluding hospitals, health and community services, schools, universities, the\narmed forces, statutory authorities, local government, offshore territories\nand industry.\n\nThe [http://anf.org.au/pages/our-healthcare-challenges ANF advocates for nurses,\nmidwives and assistants in nursing] who face challenges on every shift. Right\nacross Australia there is a frustration with the health system, not enough\nmoney, underfunded hospitals, not enough nurses, midwives or beds, and not\nenough time to spend with patients and residents. Safe patient care is a\npriority for the Australian Nursing Federation.\n\nThe ANF is a Federally Registered Organisation [http://www.e-airc.gov.au/145v/]\nthat has branches in each State and Territory. Most branches also have a 'State\nRegistered Union' operating as the state entity in the state system. For nurses\nthis system is dominated by public hospitals run by the various Australian\nstate governments. For example, the ANF Western Australia Branch operates as\nthe Australian Nursing Federation, Industrial Union of Workers Perth, the ANF\nQueensland Branch operates as the Queensland Nurses' Union and the ANF New\nSouth Wales Branch operates as the NSW Nurses' Association in their respective\nstate systems.\n\nThe ANF has a range of national policies, guidelines and position statements\nrelating to nursing, health and social justice issues, for the guidance of\nmembers in their practice and at their workplaces.\n\nThe ANF represents Australian nursing internationally through links with other\nnational and international nursing organisations, professional associations and\nthe International Labour Organisations. The ANF is a member of the Commonwealth\nNurses Federation and the South Pacific Nurses Forum and is affiliated to the\nACTU, International Centre for Trade Union Rights and Union Aid Abroad - APHEDA\n(Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad) which is the\noverseas aid agency of the trade union movement.\n\nNationally, the ANF initiates activities to raise political awareness, and\npolitical action if necessary, among members and the general public in the\npursuit of improved public policy on health and related issues\n","linknr":122,"url":"Australian_Nursing_Federation","recorded":1364209238,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:ANF_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/ANF_logo.png","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/ACTU","http://anf.org.au/pages/lee-thomas","http://www.qnu.org.au/news/your-leadership-team/secretary","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)","http://www.anf.org.au","/wiki/Trade_union","/wiki/Nursing","/wiki/Midwifery","/wiki/Nurse_assistant","/wiki/Australia","http://anf.org.au/news/entry/anf-membership-milestone1","http://anf.org.au/news/entry/anf-is-now-the-largest-health-and-aged-care-union","/wiki/Urban_area","/wiki/Rural","/wiki/Remote","/wiki/Public_sector","/wiki/Private_sector","/wiki/Hospitals","/wiki/Schools","/wiki/Universities","/wiki/Armed_forces","/wiki/Local_government","http://anf.org.au/pages/our-healthcare-challenges","http://www.e-airc.gov.au/145v/","/wiki/Western_Australia","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Queensland_Nurses%27_Union","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/NSW_Nurses%27_Association","/wiki/ACTU","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=edit&section=1","http://www.anf.org.au%20www.anf.org.au%5D","http://www.nswnurses.asn.au/","http://www.qnu.org.au/home%20Queensland%20Nurses%20Union","http://www.anfvic.asn.au%20ANF%20Victorian%20Branch","http://www.anfiuwp.org.au/","http://www.anmfsa.org.au/","http://www.anftas.org/","http://www.anfnt.org.au/","/wiki/File:Syndicalism.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Syndicalism.svg/28px-Syndicalism.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Organized_labour","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&oldid=535972450","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Trade_unions_in_Australia","/wiki/Category:Nursing_organizations","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_1924","/wiki/Category:Medicine_and_healthcare_trade_unions","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_reliable_references_from_December_2006","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_reliable_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Australian+Nursing+Federation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Australian+Nursing+Federation","/wiki/Australian_Nursing_Federation","/wiki/Talk:Australian_Nursing_Federation","#","/wiki/Australian_Nursing_Federation","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Australian_Nursing_Federation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Australian_Nursing_Federation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&oldid=535972450","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Australian_Nursing_Federation&id=535972450","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Australian+Nursing+Federation","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Australian+Nursing+Federation&oldid=535972450&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Australian_Nursing_Federation&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_Licen
