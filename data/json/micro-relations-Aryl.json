The tolyl group, CH 3C 6H 4, is derived\nfrom toluene (methylbenzene). The xylyl group,\n(CH 3) 2C 6H 3, is derived from xylene\n(dimethylbenzene), while the naphthyl group, C 10 H7 , is\nderived from naphthalene.\n\n'Arylation' is a chemical process in which an aryl group is attached to a\nsubstrate.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Aryl","recorded":1362371425,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aryl groups|*","Substituents"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Phenyl-group.png/250px-Phenyl-group.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Benzene-3D-vdW.png/40px-Benzene-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Functional_group","Substituent","Aromatic_ring","Phenyl","Naphthyl","Thiophene","Indole","IUPAC_nomenclature","Phenyl","Benzene","Toluene","Xylyl","Xylene","Naphthyl","Naphthalene","Alkyl","Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor","Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds","Arene_compound"]}
