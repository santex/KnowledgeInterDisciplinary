It is considered part of the [[Classical era]], epoch, or [[History by\nperiod|historical period]].\n\nDuring this period Europe, North Africa and the Near East fell under increasing\ndomination by the Roman Empire, which continued expanding, most notably\nconquering Britain under the emperor Claudius (43). The reforms introduced by\nAugustus during his long reign stabilized the empire after the turmoil of the\nprevious century's civil wars. Later in the century the Julio-Claudian dynasty,\nwhich had been founded by Augustus came to an end with the death of Nero in 68.\nThere followed the famous Year of Four Emperors, a brief period of civil war and\ninstability, which was finally brought to an end by Vespasian, 9th Roman\nemperor, and founder of the Flavian dynasty.\n\nChina continued to be dominated by the Han Dynasty, despite a 14-year\ninterruption by the Xin dynasty under Wang Mang. Han rule was restored in 23;\nWang Mang's rule represents the watershed between the Western/Former Han and the\nEastern/Later Han. The capital was also moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.\n","linknr":1006,"url":"1st_century","recorded":1362571503,"links":124,"instances":["han_dynasty","colosseum","daughter_of_herod_agrippa_i"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1st century|","1st
