The\nslope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the\nmarked point.]]\n\nIn calculus, a branch of mathematics, the 'derivative' is a measure of how a\nfunction changes as its input changes. Loosely speaking, a derivative can be\nthought of as how much one quantity is changing in response to changes in some\nother quantity; for example, the derivative of the position of a moving object\nwith respect to time is the object's instantaneous velocity.\n\nThe derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the best linear\napproximation of the function near that input value. Informally, the derivative\nis the ratio of the infinitesimal change of the output over the infinitesimal\nchange of the input producing that change of output. For a real-valued function\nof a single real variable, the derivative at a point equals the slope of the\ntangent line to the graph of the function at that point. In higher dimensions,\nthe derivative of a function at a point is a linear transformation called the\nlinearization.<ref>Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a\nvery well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources.\nAlmost all of the material in this article can be found in Apostol 1967,\nApostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.</ref> A closely related notion is the\ndifferential of a function.\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called 'differentiation'. The reverse\nprocess is called [[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]. The fundamental\ntheorem of calculus states that antidifferentiation is the same as integration.\nDifferentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-\nvariable calculus.\n",
