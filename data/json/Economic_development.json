Economic development can also be referred to as the\nquantitative and qualitative changes in the economy. Such actions can involve\nmultiple areas including development of human capital, critical infrastructure,\nregional competitiveness, environmental sustainability, social inclusion,\nhealth, safety, literacy, and other initiatives. Economic development differs\nfrom economic growth. Whereas economic development is a policy intervention\nendeavor with aims of economic and social well-being of people, economic growth\nis a phenomenon of market productivity and rise in GDP. Consequently, as\neconomist Amartya Sen points out: âeconomic growth is one aspect of the process\nof economic development.â Sen, A.\n(1983). Development: Which Way Now?
