It was\nbuilt in 1929 and is one of five reservoirs on the Ruhr.\n\nThe reservoir is about long and has an average width of . It begins near the\npoint where the Lenne flows into the Ruhr, and ends with the weir and\nhydroelectric plant of Hengsteysee. The Klusenberg, a hill that is part of the\nArdey range, is located just north of the Hengsteysee. There is also a pumped-\nstorage plant on this reservoir, named Koepchenwerk after Arthur Koepchen.\n\nHengsteysee fulfills the following four functions:\n\n*functions as the lower reservoir of the Koepchenwerk pumped-storage plant\n*performs biological purification of water from the Lenne *deposit of sediment\nfrom the Lenne *venue for water sports and tourism\n","linknr":104,"url":"Hengsteysee","recorded":1362557507,"links":18,"instances":["water","river"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Reservoirs in Germany"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Hengsteysee_Panorama.jpg/220px-Hengsteysee_Panorama.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Coat_of_arms_of_North_Rhine-Westfalia.svg/30px-Coat_of_arms_of_North_Rhine-Westfalia.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reservoir","water"],["ruhr","river"]],"members":["reservoir","ruhr"],"related":["Germany","Reservoir_(water)","Ruhr_(river)","Hagen","Dortmund","Herdecke","North_Rhine-Westphalia","Germany","Lenne","Weir","Hydroelectric_plant","Klusenberg","Ardey_Hills","Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity","Koepchenwerk","Arthur_Koepchen","Water_sport"]}
