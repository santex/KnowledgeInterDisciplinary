Adapted from Miller, George A (2003). \"The cognitive revolution: a\nhistorical perspective\". TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences '7'. ]]\n\n'Cognitive science' is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and\nits processes. It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works. It\nincludes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how\ninformation is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as\nperception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems\n(human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science\nconsists of multiple research disciplines, including psychology, artificial\nintelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-\nscience/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008\nEdition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). It spans many levels of analysis, from\nlow-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning;\nfrom neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of\ncognitive science is \"that thinking can best be understood in terms of\nrepresentational structures in the mind and computational procedures that\noperate on those structures.\"\n","linknr":701,"url":"Cognitive_science","recorded":1362667201,"links":76,"instances":["academic_field","sense","abstract","linguistics","philosophy_of_mind","professor","psychologist","cognitive_architecture","psychologist"],"pdf":["http://chil.rice.edu/byrne/Pubs/cogsci96.pdf"],"categories":["Cognitive
