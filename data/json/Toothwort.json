They are parasitic plants on the\nroots of other plants, and are completely lacking chlorophyll. They are\nclassified in the family Orobanchaceae. In addition, [[Cardamine concatenata]]\nis also called toothwort.\n\nThe toothwort is a protocarnivorous plant. Most of the plant consists of a\nbranched whitish underground stem closely covered with thick fleshy colourless\nleaves, which are bent over so as to hide the under surface; irregular cavities\ncommunicating with the exterior are formed in the thickness of the leaf. On the\ninner walls of these chambers are stalked hairs, which when stimulated by the\ntouch of an insect send out delicate filaments by means of which the insect is\nkilled and digested.

It differs in the dark purple flowers being produced one on each\n  stem. Purple Toothwort grows in Middle and South Europe: Western Belgium,\n  Western and Central France and Northern Spain, and locally in Central Italy.
