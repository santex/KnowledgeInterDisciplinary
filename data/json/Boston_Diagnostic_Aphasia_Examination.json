{"cursor":"4226","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination' or 'BDAE' is a test used to evaluate\nadults suspected of having aphasia, and is currently in its third\nedition. It was created by Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. The\nBDAE evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual,\nand gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving),\nand response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation).\nAdministration time ranges from 35 to 45 minutes. Many other tests are sometimes\nused by neurologists and speech language pathologists on a case-by-case basis,\nand other comprehensive tests exist like the Western Aphasia Battery.\n\nBoston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination\n\nPurpose: Designed as a comprehensive measure of aphasia.\n\nPopulation: Adults.\n\nScore: Percentiles or standard scores for the subtests.\n\nTime: (180) minutes.\n\nAuthors: Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan.\n\nPublisher: The Psychological Corporation.\n\nDescription: The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is a comprehensive,\nmultifactorial battery designed to evaluate a broad range of language\nimpairments that often arise as a consequence of organic brain dysfunction. The\nExamination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia\ninto the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to\nunderlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various\nperceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing\nfunctions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response\nmodalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows\nfor the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills\nand abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a\ncomprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to\nneuropathologic conditions.\n\nScoring: The manual provides clear statements and rules for scoring protocols.\n\nReliability: Reliability of the subtests was studied by selecting protocols of\n34 patients with a degree of severity of aphasia ranging from slight to severe.\nKuder-Richardson reliability coefficients for subtests ranged from .68 to .98,\nwith about two-thirds of the coefficients reported ranging from .90 upwards.\nSince test-retest reliability is difficult if not impossible to attain with\npatients suffering from aphasic symptoms, the current reliability coefficients\ndemonstrate very good internal consistency in terms of what the items within the\nsubtests are measuring.\n\nValidity: A discriminant analysis comparing \"unambiguous exemplars of a single\nsyndrome\" was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Brocaâs aphasia,\nWernickeâs aphasia, conduction aphasia, and anomic aphasia were selected. Ten\nvariables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data.\nFrom these, five variables were selected for the discriminant analysis (body\npart identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal\nparaphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This\nclassification yielded no misclassifications.\n\nNorms: Standardization of the revised Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is\nbased on a normative sample of 242 patients with aphasic symptoms tested at the\nBoston VA Medical Center between 1976-1982. It is important to consider that\nthis sample includes only male, presumably English-speaking patients and is thus\nhighly selected.\n\nSuggested Uses: Designed for the assessment of aphasia for inpatient or\noutpatient populations.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","recorded":1374861467,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Aphasia","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Harold_Goodglass","/wiki/Edith_Kaplan","/wiki/Neurology","/wiki/Speech-language_pathology","/wiki/Western_Aphasia_Battery","/wiki/Standard_score","/wiki/Test_score","/wiki/Reliability_(psychometric)","/wiki/Test_validity","/wiki/Conduction_aphasia","/wiki/Anomic_aphasia","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-514075-3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&oldid=512478863","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Medical_tests","/wiki/Category:Aphasias","/wiki/Category:Communication_disorders","/wiki/Category:Neurological_disorders","/wiki/Category:Alexia_(condition)","/wiki/Category:Language_disorders","/wiki/Category:Symptoms_and_signs:_Speech_and_voice","/wiki/Category:Neuropsychological_tests","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boston+Diagnostic+Aphasia+Examination&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Boston+Diagnostic+Aphasia+Examination","/wiki/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","/wiki/Talk:Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","#","/wiki/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&oldid=512478863","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4947881","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&id=512478863","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Boston+Diagnostic+Aphasia+Examination","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Boston+Diagnostic+Aphasia+Examination&oldid=512478863&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4947881#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/
