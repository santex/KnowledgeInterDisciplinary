The vesicles contain the juice of the\nfruit. The pulp is usually removed from the juice by filtering it out. The\njuiciness of the pulp depends on the species, variety, season, and even the\ntree on which it grew.\n\nPulp cells often have thin membranes, and they are less regular in shape than\nother plant cells. They are also very large and protect the seeds of the fruit.\nThe color of the pulp is variable, depending on the species and the ripening\nstage. Usually, it has the color of the outer peel (exocarp).\n","linknr":106,"url":"Juice_vesicles","recorded":1362560043,"links":24,"instances":["botany","biology_and_chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Citrus"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Citrus_pulp1.JPG/400px-Citrus_pulp1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Cutlime.jpg/40px-Cutlime.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vesicle","biology_and_chemistry"],["variety","botany"]],"members":["variety","vesicle"],"related":["Citrus","Fruit","Endocarp","Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)","Juice","Filtration","Species","Variety_(botany)","Species","Exocarp"]}
