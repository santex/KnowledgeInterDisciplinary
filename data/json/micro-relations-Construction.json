{"cursor":"27668","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in Melbourne, cranes are essential.]] In the fields of architecture and civil\n engineering, 'construction' is a process that consists of the building or\n assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale\n construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a\n project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer,\n construction engineer or project architect.\n\nFor the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential.\nInvolved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must\nconsider the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling,\nbudgeting, construction site safety, availability of building materials,\nlogistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and\nbidding, etc.\n","linknr":663,"url":"Construction","recorded":1362510150,"links":94,"instances":["technical_standard","production_processes","accident","chicago","dwelling","machine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Construction"],"headings":["Types
