Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of\nrhyolitic lava flows known as 'obsidian flows', where the chemical composition\n(high silica content) induces a high viscosity and polymerization degree of the\nlava. The inhibition of atomic diffusion through this highly viscous and\npolymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Obsidian is hard and\nbrittle; it therefore fractures with very sharp edges, which had been used in\nthe past in cutting and piercing tools, and has been used experimentally as\nsurgical scalpel blades.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Obsidian","recorded":1372152366,"links":[],"instances":["country","mineral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Volcanic rocks","Felsic rocks","Vitreous rocks","Volcanology","Lithics","Gemstones","Glass in nature","Amorphous solids"],"headings":["Origin and properties","Occurrence","Historical use{{anchor|historical use}}","Current use","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["inclusion","mineral"],["georgia","country"],["washington","u.s._state"],["sierra_nevada","u.s."]],"members":["georgia","sierra_nevada","inclusion","washington"],"related":["Conchoidal","Vitreous_lustre","Smooth;_glassy","Translucent","Volcanic_glass","Extrusive","Igneous_rock","Felsic","Lava","Volcano","Rhyolite","Silicon_dioxide","Scalpel","Pliny_the_Elder","Obsius","Lava","Perlite","Tektite","Moon","Mineral","Crystal","Mineraloid","Mafic","Basalt","Felsic","Silicon_dioxide","Granite","Rhyolite","Metastability","Cretaceous","Iron","Magnesium","Inclusion_(mineral)","Cristobalite","Iridescence","Argentina","Armenia","Azerbaijan","Canada","Chile","Georgia_(country)","Greece","El_Salvador","Guatemala","Iceland","Italy","Japan","Kenya","Mexico","New_Zealand","Peru","Scotland","United_States","Hiking","Newberry_Volcano","Medicine_Lake_Volcano","Cascade_Range","Inyo_Craters","California","Yellowstone_National_Park","Mammoth_Hot_Springs","Norris_Geyser_Basin","Arizona","Colorado","New_Mexico","Texas","Utah","Washington_(U.S._state)","Oregon","Idaho","Virginia","Pennsylvania","Lipari","Pantelleria","Palmarola","Monte_Arci","Colin_Renfrew","Melos","Giali","Acigöl","Göllü_Dağ","Kariandusi","Acheulian","Tell_Brak","Stone_Age","Flint","Conchoidal_fracture","Mirror","Archaeologists","Relative_dating","Obsidian_hydration_dating","Ubaid_period","5th_millennium_BC","Turkey","Ancient_Egypt","Red_Sea","Yaxchilán","Archeological","Chumash_people","Casa_Diablo,_California","Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)","Pre-Columbian","Mesoamerica","Obsidian_use_in_Mesoamerica","Tool","Sword","Volcano","Melos","Nisyros","Yiali","Aegean_Sea","Chaitén_Volcano","Chan-Chan","Easter_Island","Moai","US_Food_and_Drug_Administration","Scalpel","Nanometer","Microscope","Scanning_electron_microscope","Granulation_tissue","Don_Crabtree","Surgery","Gemstone","Apache_tears","Perlite","Plinth","Phonograph","Knapping","Stone_tools","Obsidian_hydration_dating","Yaxchilan_Lintel_24","Mayor_Island_/_Tuhua","Libyan_desert_glass","Hyaloclastite","Tachylite","Basaltic"]}
