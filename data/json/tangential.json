A similar definition applies to\nspace curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet,\ncalled the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\"\nas the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at\nthat point.\n\nSimilarly, the 'tangent plane' to a surface at a given point is the plane that\n\"just touches\" the surface at that point.
