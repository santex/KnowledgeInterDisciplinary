{"cursor":"4187","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Willis Leonard Holman' (born May 21, 1927), known also as 'Bill Holman', is an\nAmerican composer/arranger, conductor, saxophonist, and songwriter working\nprimarily in the jazz idiom.\n\nAlthough he has performed and recorded as a tenor saxophonist, Holman is best\nknown as an arranger. Through his\nacquaintance with Gene Roland, Holman was auditioned by Stan Kenton and hired as\na tenor sax player around 1951.\n\nKenton was apparently attracted to Holman's ability to integrate counterpoint\nand dissonance in subtle yet distinctive ways, and for his knack for making the\nusually unswinging Kenton band \"swing\" in its own particular fashion. Holman\nbecame Kenton's chief arranger, and wrote much of Kenton's 1950s repertoire;\nincluding one of Kenton's finest albums, Contemporary Concepts. He continued to\nwrite for Kenton, on and off, throughout the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn addition to his work for Kenton, Holman has provided charts for Woody Herman,\nDoc Severinsen, Buddy Rich, Terry Gibbs, Count Basie, Gerry Mulligan's Concert\nJazz Band and others. He formed his own California-based band in 1975 and\ncontinues to perform with it in the U.S. and worldwide. His 1997 recording\nBrilliant Corners/The Music of Thelonious Monk won a Grammy award.\n\nin 1969, Ella Fitzgerald recorded \"Give Me the Simple Life\" with Holman's\narrangement on her live album [[Sunshine of Your Love (album)|Sunshine of\nYour Love]].\n\nBill Holman is also credited with brass arrangements on The Fifth Dimension's\n1969 album, [[The Age of Aquarius (album)|The Age of Aquarius]].\n\nHe received his honorary doctorate through Elmhurst College of Illinois.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Bill_Holman_(musician)","recorded":1375067360,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Arranger","/wiki/Conducting","/wiki/Saxophonist","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Jazz","#cite_note-Allmusic-1","#cite_note-Jazz.com-2","/wiki/Gene_Roland","/wiki/Stan_Kenton","#cite_note-Allmusic-1","/wiki/Woody_Herman","/wiki/Doc_Severinsen","/wiki/Buddy_Rich","/wiki/Terry_Gibbs","/wiki/Count_Basie","/wiki/Gerry_Mulligan","#cite_note-All_About_Jazz-3","/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald","/w/index.php?title=Give_Me_the_Simple_Life&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sunshine_of_Your_Love_(album)","/wiki/The_Fifth_Dimension","/wiki/The_Age_of_Aquarius_(album)","#Recordings","#As_leader","#As_composer","#As_arranger","#As_sideman","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Maynard_Ferguson","/wiki/Dimensions_(Maynard_Ferguson_album)","/wiki/Maynard_Ferguson_Octet","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Lalo_Schifrin","/wiki/The_Cincinnati_Kid_(soundtrack)","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/List_of_jazz_arrangers","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-Allmusic_1-0","#cite_ref-Allmusic_1-1","/wiki/Scott_Yanow","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p6761/biography","/wiki/Allmusic","#cite_ref-Jazz.com_2-0","http://www.jazz.com/music/2007/11/8/bill-holman-donna-lee","#cite_ref-All_About_Jazz_3-0","http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=7704","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/93729533","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Jazzstubartwork.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Jazzstubartwork.svg/20px-Jazzstubartwork.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-jazz-musician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-jazz-musician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-jazz-musician-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&oldid=542922425","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1927_births","/wiki/Category:American_conductors_(music)","/wiki/Category:American_music_arrangers","/wiki/Category:Grammy_Award-winning_artists","/wiki/Category:Jazz_arrangers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Big_bands","/wiki/Category:American_jazz_musician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Holman+%28musician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bill+Holman+%28musician%29","/wiki/Bill_Holman_(musician)","/wiki/Talk:Bill_Holman_(musician)","#","/wiki/Bill_Holman_(musician)","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bill_Holman_(musician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bill_Holman_(musician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&oldid=542922425","/w/index.php?title=Bill_Holman_(musician)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q348471","/w/index.ph
