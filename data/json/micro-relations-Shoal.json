{"cursor":"10666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n and Gugh on the Isles of Scilly, off the coast of Cornwall]] , Fiji]] A\n 'shoal', 'sandbar' (or just 'bar' in context), 'sandbank' or 'gravelbar' is a\n somewhat linear landform within or extending into a body of water, typically\n composed of sand, silt or small pebbles. A '[[Spit (landform)|spit]]' or\n 'sandspit' is a type of shoal. Shoals are characteristically long and narrow\n (linear) and develop where a stream or ocean current promotes deposition of\n granular material, resulting in localized shallowing ('shoaling') of the water.\n Shoals can appear in the sea, in a lake, or in a river. Alternatively a bar may\n separate a lake from the sea, as in the case of an ayre. They are typically\n composed of sand, although could be of any granular matter that the moving\n water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt,\n gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material\n comprising a bar is related to the size of the waves or the strength of the\n currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by\n waves and currents is also important.\n\nThe term bar can apply to landform features spanning a considerable range in\nsize, from a length of a few metres in a small stream to marine depositions\nstretching for hundreds of kilometres along a coastline, often called\n'barrier islands'.\n\nIn a nautical sense, a bar is a shoal, similar to a reef: a shallow formation of\n(usually) sand that is a navigation or grounding hazard, with a depth of water\nof or less. It therefore applies to a silt accumulation that shallows the\nentrance to the course of a river or creek.\n","linknr":431,"url":"Shoal","recorded":1362565059,"links":55,"instances":["geography","grain_size","geology","sediment","environmental","topography","landform","landform","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Barrier islands|","Coastal and oceanic landforms","Coastal geography","Fluvial landforms","Hydrology","Physical oceanography","Sandbanks|"],"headings":["Shoaling","Sandbars and longshore bars","Harbour and river bars","Shoals as geological units","Specific geology","Human habitation","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/GughSandbar.JPG/220px-GughSandbar.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/WayaWayasewa.jpg/220px-WayaWayasewa.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Amanohashidate_view_from_Kasamatsu_Park01s3s4410.jpg/220px-Amanohashidate_view_from_Kasamatsu_Park01s3s4410.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Hibokwhiteisl.jpg/220px-Hibokwhiteisl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/SandbarLongIsland1.jpg/220px-SandbarLongIsland1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/DoomBarRiverCamelCornwall2jpg.jpg/220px-DoomBarRiverCamelCornwall2jpg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Mississippi_River-sand_bars.jpg/220px-Mississippi_River-sand_bars.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Accreting_coast_Image6.svg/140px-Accreting_coast_Image6.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Fernando_noronha.jpg/140px-Fernando_noronha.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["deposition","sediment"],["ayre","landform"],["cobble","geology"],["particle_size","grain_size"],["bank","geography"],["trough","geology"],["spit","landform"],["spit","landform"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["ocean_bank","topography"]],"members":["bank","particle_size","cobble","deposition","hypoxia","ocean_bank","ayre","spit","trough"],"related":["Gugh","Cornwall","Fiji","Linear","Landform","Water","Sand","Silt","Pebble","Stream","Ocean_current","Deposition_(sediment)","Granular_material","Sea","Lake","River","Ayre_(landform)","Sand","Soil","Silt","Gravel","Cobble_(geology)","Shingle_beach","Boulder","Particle_size_(grain_size)","Landform","Coast","Nautical","Reef","Navigation","Ship_grounding","Silt","River","Stream","Ocean_surface_waves","Wave_height","Wavelength","Breaking_wave","Diffraction","Bank_(geography)","Miyazu,_Kyoto","Kyoto_Prefecture","Japan","Camiguin","Long_Island","New_York","Trough_(geology)","River_Camel","Cornwall","Harbour","River_mouth","Sediment","Tide","Suspended_load","Bed_load","Coastal_erosion","Hydraulic_head","Arkansas","Mississippi","Beach","Spit_(landform)","Ria","Tombolo","Isthmus","Island","Mainland","East_Coast_of_the_United_States","Gulf_of_Mexico","Belize","Coast","Inlet","Cove","Longshore_drift","Spit_(landform)","Lagoon","Salt_marsh","IOS_Press","Barrier_island","Shoreface","Lagoon","Tidal_flat","Bioturbation","Fossil","Upper_shoreface","Sedimentary_structure","Foreshore","Cross_bedding","Backshore","Berm","Dune","Aeolian_processes","Lagoon","Tidal_flat","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Prehistoric","Adam's_Bridge","Coastal_Barrier_Resources_Act","Ocean_bank_(topography)"]}
