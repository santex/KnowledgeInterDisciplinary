Muslim beliefs regarding God are\nsummed up in chapter 112 of the Qur'an, [[al-Ikhlas]], \"the chapter of\npurity\".\n*\n*  Muslims also believe that Islam is the complete and universal version\n  of a primordial faith that was revealed at many times and places before,\n  including through the prophets Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muslims maintain that previous messages and revelations have been\n  partially changed or corrupted over time, See: * Accad\n  (2003): According to Ibn Taymiyya, although only some Muslims accept the\n  textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of\n  most of it. * Esposito (1998), pp.6,12* Esposito (2002b), pp.4â5* F. E. Peters\n  (2003), p.9* *  but consider the Qur'an to be both unaltered and the\n  final revelation from GodâFinal Testament. Submission.org, Quran: The\n  Final Testament, Authorized English Version with Arabic Text, Revised Edition\n  IV,ISBN 0-9729209-2-7, p. x.\n\nMost Muslims accept as a Muslim anyone who has publicly pronounced the\n[[Shahadah]] (declaration of faith) which states, \"I testify that there is no\ngod except for the God, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.\"\nThey also believe that Muhammad is the Seal of the Prophets and the final\nprophet. Their basic religious practices are enumerated in the Five Pillars of\nIslam, which, in addition to Shahadah, consist of daily prayers (salat), fasting\nduring Ramadan (sawm), almsgiving (zakat), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at\nleast once in a lifetime.\n\nThe majority of Muslims are Sunni, being over 75â90% of all Muslims.
