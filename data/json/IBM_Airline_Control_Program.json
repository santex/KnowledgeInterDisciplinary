In contrast to previous airline transaction processing\nsystems, the most notable aspect of ACP is that it was designed to run on most\nmodels of the IBM System/360 mainframe computer family. This departed from the\nearlier model in which each airline would have a different, machine-specific\ntransaction system.\n\nDevelopment began with [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]] (Semi-Automatic\nBusiness Research Environment), Deltamatic, and PANAMAC. From these [[Programmed\nAirline Reservations System]] (PARS) was developed. In 1969 the control program,\nACP was separated from PARS; PARS keeping the functions for processing airline\nreservations and related data.\n\nIn December 1979, ACP became known as ACP/TPF and then just TPF (Transaction\nProcessing Facility) {{cite web\n|url=http://www.blackbeard.com/tpf/tpfhist.htm |title=A Short History TPF |arch-\niveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041204030934/http://www.blackbeard.com/tpf/-\ntpfhist.htm |archivedate=2004-12-04 |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=May 14,\n2002}} as the transaction operating system became more widely implemented\nby businesses other than the major airlines, such as online credit card\nprocessing, hotel and rental car reservations, police emergency response\nsystems, and package delivery systems.\n\nSee also ''IBM Airline Control System (ALCS)'', a variant of TPF specially\ndesigned to provide all the benefits of TPF (very high speed, high volume, high\navailability transaction processing) but with the advantages such as easier\nintegration into the data center offered by running on a standard IBM operating\nsystem platform.\n","linknr":150,"url":"IBM_Airline_Control_Program","recorded":1362540443,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/162/ibmsj1602H.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/162/ibmsj1602H.pdf","http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/370/ACP_TPF/GH20-2140-1_Airline_Control_Program_Transaction_Processing_Facility_General_Information_May79.pdf"],"categories":["History of aviation","IBM mainframe operating systems|Airline Control Program","1960s software"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Copland_organization.svg/50px-Copland_organization.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["IBM","IBM","System/360","Transaction_Processing_Facility","Programmed_Airline_Reservations_System","Programmed_Airline_Reservation_System","English_language","Operating_system","IBM","Airline","Transaction_processing_system","IBM","System/360","Airline","Transaction_Processing_Facility","ALCS_transaction_monitor","Timeline_of_operating_systems"]}
