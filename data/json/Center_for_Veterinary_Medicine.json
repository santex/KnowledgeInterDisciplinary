These include animals\nfrom which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pets\nor companion animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food\nadditives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus\nmillions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. (Minor animal\nspecies include animals other than cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys, horses,\ndogs, and cats.)\n\nCVM monitors the safety of animal foods and medications. Much of the center's\nwork focuses on animal medications used in food animals to ensure that\nsignificant drug residues are not present in the meat or other products from\nthese animals.\n\nDr. Bernadette Dunham, D.V.M., Ph.D., is the current Director of the CVM.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Center_for_Veterinary_Medicine","recorded":1362688777,"links":15,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Food and Drug Administration","United States Department of Health and Human Services"],"headings":["Sources","Further information"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Center_for_Veterinary_Medicine_logo.png/220px-Center_for_Veterinary_Medicine_logo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/30px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["orders_of_magnitude","numbers#106"],["orders_of_magnitude","numbers#106"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude","food_and_drug_administration"],"related":["Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Compound_feed","Drugs","Food","Compound_feed","Pets","Companion_animals","Medical_devices","Compound_feed","Companion_animals","Poultry","Cattle","Swine","Animal_species","Animal_species","Cattle","Swine","Chickens","Turkeys","Horses","Dogs","Cats","Bernadette_Dunham"]}
