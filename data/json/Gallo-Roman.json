For the\npolitical history of the brief \"Gallic Empire\" of the third century, see\n[[Gallic Empire]]. ]]\n\nThe term 'Gallo-Roman' describes the Romanized culture of Gaul under the rule of\nthe Roman Empire. This was characterized by the Gaulish adoption or adaptation\nof Roman mores and way of life in a uniquely Gaulish context. A recent\nsurvey is G. Woolf, Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in\nGaul (Cambridge University Press) 1998. The well-studied meld of\ncultures Modern interpretations are revising the earlier dichotomy of\n\"Romanization\" and \"resistance\", especially as viewed, under the increased\ninfluence of archaeology, through the material remains of patterns of everyday\nconsumption, as in Woolf 1998:169-205, who emphasised the finds at\nVesontio/BesanÃ§on. in Gaul gives historians a model against which to\ncompare and contrast parallel developments of Romanization in other, less-\nstudied Roman provinces.\n\n[[Interpretatio romana]] offered Roman names for Gaulish deities such as the smith-\ngod Gobannus, J Pollini, Gallo-Roman Bronzes and the Process of\nRomanization: The Cobannus Hoard, in series Monumenta Graeca et Romana, '9'\n(Leiden:Brill) 2002. but of Celtic deities only the horse-patroness Epona\npenetrated Romanized cultures beyond the confines of Gaul.

Heinzelmann, M. Heinzelmann, \"The 'affair' of Hilary of Arles (445)\nand Gallo-Roman identity in the fifth century\" in Drinkwater and Elton\n2002.\n\nInto the seventh century, Gallo-Roman culture would persist particularly in the\nareas of Gallia Narbonensis that developed into Occitania, Gallia Cisalpina and\nto a lesser degree, Aquitania. The formerly Romanized north of Gaul, once it had\nbeen occupied by the Franks, would develop into Merovingian culture instead.\nRoman life, centered on the public events and cultural responsibilities of urban\nlife in the [[res publica]] and the sometimes luxurious life of the self-\nsufficient rural villa system, took longer to collapse in the Gallo-Roman\nregions, where the Visigoths largely inherited the status quo in 418. Gallo-\nRoman language persisted in the northeast into the Silva Carbonaria that formed\nan effective cultural barrier with the Franks to the north and east, and in the\nnorthwest to the lower valley of the Loire, where Gallo-Roman culture interfaced\nwith Frankish culture in a city like Tours and in the person of that Gallo-Roman\nbishop confronted with Merovingian royals, Gregory of Tours. The Gallo-Roman\nlanguage eventually evolved into the modern Romance languages of France,\nincluding standard French, FrancoprovenÃ§al, and Occitan.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Gallo-Roman","recorded":1372152284,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","religion","cultural","building","ancient_rome"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ancient Roman culture","Roman Gaul"],"headings":["Politics","Religion","Gallo-Roman art","Gallo-Roman sites","Sites, restorations, museums","See also","Notes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["romanization","cultural"],["romanization","cultural"],["romanization","cultural"],["cult","religion"],["mercury","mythology"],["imperial_cult","ancient_rome"],["cult","religion"],["odeon","building"]],"members":["mercury","cult","romanization","odeon","imperial_cult"],"related":["Romanization_(cultural)","Gaul","Roman_Empire","Romanization_(cultural)","Material_culture","Besançon","Romanization_(cultural)","Gobannus","Epona","Migration_Period","Hilary_of_Arles","Gallia_Narbonensis","Occitania","Cisalpine_Gaul","Aquitania","Franks","Merovingian","Roman_villa","Visigoth","Silva_Carbonaria","Loire","Tours","Gregory_of_Tours","Romance_languages","Languages_of_France","French_language","Francoprovençal","Occitan_language","Hotel_de_la_Monnaie","Diocletian","Roman_provinces","Roman_citizenship","Constitutio_Antoniniana","Torc","Crisis_of_the_Third_Century","Postumus","Roman_Britain","Hispania","Trier","Aurelian","Tetricus_I","Syncretism","Cult_(religion)","Interpretatio_Romana","Lenus_Mars","Grannus","Mercury_(mythology)","Rosmerta","Epona","Mystery_religion","Orpheus","Mithras","Cybele","Isis","Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)","Augustus","Lugdunum","Sarcophagus","Rignieux-le-Franc","Ain","Louvre_Museum","Gregory_of_Tours","Decius","Pope_Felix","Gatianus_of_Tours","Trophimus_of_Arles","Paul_of_Narbonne","Saturnin","Denis","Saint_Martial","Austromoine","Clermont-Ferrand","Bishop","Paganism","Vandal","Goths","Cult_(religion)","Saint_Caesarius_of_Arles","Metropolitan_bishop","Arles","Gallia_Aquitania","Louvre","Hoard","Roman_road","Via_Domitia","Nîmes","Pyrenees","Via_Augusta","Col_de_Panissars","Via_Aquitania","Narbonne","Toulouse","Bordeaux","Trier","Lyon","Metz","Périgueux","Lyon","Odeon_(building)","Lugdunum","Christian_era","Emperor_Claudius","Metz","Gaul","Museums_of_Metz","Martigny,_Switzerland","Valais","Fondation_Pierre_Gianadda","Arles","Alyscamps","Necropolis","Autun","Mediomatrici","Metz","Basilica_of_Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains","Thermae","Glanum","Saint-Rémy-de-Provence","Narbonne","Nîmes","Maison_Carrée","Orange,_France","Tongeren","Vaison-la-Romaine","Arelate","Arles","Grand,_Vosges","Lugdunum","Lyon","Nemausus","Nîmes","Lutetia","Mediolanum_Santonum","Saintes,_Charente-Maritime","Amphitheatre","List_of_Roman_amphitheatres","Pont_du_Gard","Barbegal_aqueduct","Culture_of_Ancient_Rome","Sidonius_Apollinaris","Syagrius","Via_Domitia","Roman_road","Pillar_of_the_Boatmen","Thraco-Roman","Loupian_Roman_villa","Gallo-Romance_languages","Gallo_language","Ausonius","Venantius_Fortunatus","Hilary_of_Arles","Roman_villas_in_northwestern_Gaul","Romano-British_culture","Illyro-Roman"]}
