The changes in these regions between summer and\nwinter are generally relatively moderate, rather than extreme hot or cold.\n\nHowever, in certain areas, such as Asia and central North America, the\nvariations between summer and winter can be extreme because these areas are far\naway from the sea, causing them to have a continental climate. In regions\ntraditionally considered tropical, localities at high altitudes (e.g. parts of\nthe Andes) may have a temperate climate.\n\nThe 'north temperate zone' extends from the Tropic of Cancer (at about 23.5\ndegrees north latitude) to the Arctic Circle (at approximately 66.5 degrees\nnorth latitude). The 'south temperate zone' extends from the Tropic of Capricorn\n(at approximately 23.5 degrees south latitude) to the Antarctic Circle (at\napproximately 66.5 degrees south latitude). \n\nIn a very broad sense, temperate climate also includes a '[[subtropical\nclimate]]', variants: subtropical semidesert/desert, humid subtropical,\noceanic subtropical and Mediterranean climate. However, a typical temperate\nclimate is one of the four climate zones in the world, beside polar regions\n(subarctic climate, arctic climate, tundra climate, ice cap climate) and the\nsubtropics, tropics.\n\nThe '[[maritime climate]]' is affected by the oceans, which help to sustain\nsomewhat stable temperatures throughout the year. In temperate zones the\nprevailing winds are from the west, thus the western edge of temperate\ncontinents most commonly experience this maritime climate. Such regions include\nWestern Europe, and western North America at latitudes between 40Â° and 60Â° north\n(65Â°N in Europe).\n\n'[[Continental climate|Continental]]', '[[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]' and\n'[[arid climate|arid]]' are usually situated inland, with warmer summers and\ncolder winters. Heat loss and reception are aided by extensive land mass. In\nNorth America, the Rocky Mountains act as a climate barrier to the maritime air\nblowing from the west, creating a semi-arid and continental climate to the\neast. In Europe, the maritime climate is able\nto stabilize inland temperature, because the major mountain range â the\nAlps â is oriented east-west (the area east of the long Scandinavian\nmountain range is an exception).\n\nThe vast majority of the world's human population resides in temperate zones,\nespecially in the northern hemisphere because of the mass of land.\n\nFor the history of the term, see [[geographical zone]]\n","linknr":291,"url":"Temperate","recorded":1362482713,"links":68,"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Climate"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cloud.jpg/32px-Cloud.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Koppen_classification_worldmap_C.png/220px-Koppen_classification_worldmap_C.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["habitat","ecology"]],"members":["habitat"],"related":["Geography","Latitude","Globe","Tropics","Polar_region","Summer","Winter","Asia","North_America","Continental_climate","Altitude","Andes","Climate","Tropic_of_Cancer","Arctic_Circle","Tropic_of_Capricorn","Antarctic_Circle","Polar_region","Subarctic_climate","Arctic_climate","Tundra_climate","Ice_cap_climate","Subtropics","Tropics","Ocean","Western_Europe","Rocky_Mountains","Europe","Alps","Scandinavian_Mountains","Northern_hemisphere","Geographical_zone","Mid-latitudes","Middle_latitudes","Habitat_(ecology)","Polar_circle","Subtropics"]}
