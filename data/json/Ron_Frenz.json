He is well\nknown for his 1980s work on Amazing Spider-Man, and more recently, for his\nwork on [[Spider-Girl]] (who he co-created with writer Tom DeFalco). Frenz\nalso co-created the New Warriors in the pages of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The\nMighty Thor]].\n\nFrenz's other work includes such titles as The Mighty Thor, [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-\nZar the Savage]], [[Indiana Jones comic books|The Further Adventures of Indiana\nJones]], [[Star Wars (comics)|Star Wars]], Marvel Saga, [[Thunderstrike (Eric\nMasterson)|Thunderstrike]] and [[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman]].\n\nFrenz has a history of working on books where the characters were not in their\noriginal costumes/identities. Spider-Man wore his black costume, Thor took on a\nnew secret identity and look, and Superman changed costumes and powers all while\nFrenz was the regular artist on their titles.\n\nFrenz is known for his frequent collaborations with writer DeFalco, including\nthe short-lived series [[A-Next]]. Several of Frenz's creations/co-creations\nhave gone on to be featured in regular or limited series at both Marvel and DC,\nincluding [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]], [[New Warriors]] and\n[[Strange Visitor]]. His characters for Marvel's MC2 line have produced series\nfeaturing A-Next, J2, Dark Devil, The Buzz and the only female character to\nreach one hundred consecutive issues at Marvel, Spider-Girl.\n\nDeFalco has called Frenz one of his favorite collaborators, and the creative\nteam of DeFalco, Frenz and inker Josef Rubinstein produced one of the most\nacclaimed runs on The Amazing Spider-Man. Frenz replaced John Romita, Jr. as the\nregular artist on The Amazing Spider-Man in 1984 and the memorable stories he\npencilled (written initially by Roger Stern and then mainly by DeFalco) included\n\"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in issue #248, the\nfirst appearance of Spider-Man's black costume in issue #252, most of the\noriginal stories featuring The Hobgoblin, and Spider-Man's battle with Firelord\nin issues #269-270. It was Frenz and Defalco that made the \"black suit\" a\nsymbiote and were indirectly responsible for the character Venom.\n\nFrenz's lean, quirky rendition of Spider-Man/Peter Parker was closer to the\nstylings of original Spider-Man artist Steve Ditko than most of the post-Ditko\nartists (who typically followed the model of John Romita, Sr.). Jim Owsley,\neditor of the Spider-Man titles at the time, has noted that \"Frenz was\npassionate about Spider-Man, verging on fanatical.\" Priest,\nChristopher. [http://phonogram.us/comics/adventures/spidey.htm \"Chapter Two:\nOswald: Why I Never Discuss Spider-Man,\" Digital-Priest.com.] Accessed Mar. 11,\n2009.\n\nIn 1986, Frenz and DeFalco were removed from The Amazing Spider-Man by Owsley,\nacting under the orders of Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. Frenz has returned sporadically since to pencil Spider-Man stories, including\nthe 1996 mini-series Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives, written by Roger Stern.\n\nRon has worked with Marvel's Spider-Girl as penciler, and illustrated the \"This\nHappened to Me\" feature in the magazine [[Outdoor Life]]. He is also a\ncontributing editor to Charlton Spotlight magazine.\n\nOn June 4, 2009 Ron Frenz was the recipient of the 2009 Nemo Award for\nExcellence in the Cartoon Arts.
