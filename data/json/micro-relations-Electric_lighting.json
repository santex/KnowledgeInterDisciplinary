{"cursor":"15489","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'electric light' is a device that produces light by the flow of electric\ncurrent. It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to\nmodern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for\nevening and nighttime activities. Most electric lighting is powered by centrally\ngenerated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby\nelectric generators or battery systems. Battery-powered lights, usually called\n\"flashlights\" or \"torches\", are used for portability and as backups when the\nmain lights fail. The two main families of electric light are [[incandescent\nlight bulb|incandescent lamp]]s, which produce light by a filament heated white-\nhot by electric current, and [[gas-discharge lamp]]s, which produce light by an\nelectric arc through a gas. The energy efficiency of electric lighting has\nincreased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the\nincandescent light bulb of the 19th century. Modern electric light sources come\nin a profusion of types and sizes adapted to a myriad of applications.\n","linknr":284,"url":"Electric_lighting","recorded":1362485499,"links":23,"instances":["element","electricity","electrical","architecture","inventor","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lighting"],"headings":["Types","Lamp life expectancy","Vendors","Public lighting","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Earthlights_dmsp.jpg/650px-Earthlights_dmsp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["lumen","unit"],["mercury","element"],["ventilation","architecture"],["ballast","electrical"],["mercury","element"],["ballast","electrical"],["henry_woodward","inventor"]],"members":["mercury","battery","ballast","ventilation","henry_woodward","lumen"],"related":["Light","Electric_current","Artificial_lighting","Battery_(electricity)","Flashlight","Electrical_filament","Electric_arc","Arc_lamp","Light_bulb","Electricity","Incandescent_light_bulb","Arc_lamp","Gas_discharge_lamp","Fluorescent_light","Compact_fluorescent_lamp","Neon_lamp","Metal_halide_lamp","Photographic_flash","Laser","Light-emitting_diode","Organic_light-emitting_diode","Sulfur_lamp","Luminous_efficiency","Color_temperature","Optical_spectrum","Lighting_efficiency","Lumen_(unit)","Watt","MTTF","Color_temperature","Kelvin","Color","Color_rendering_index","Incandescent_light_bulb","Continuous_spectrum","Halogen_lamp","Fluorescent_lamp","Mercury_(element)","Phosphor","Metal_halide_lamp","Sulfur_lamp","Sodium_vapor_lamp","Sodium_vapor_lamp","Light_emitting_diode","Black_body","Monochromatic","Light_pollution","Electrical_filament","Ventilation_(architecture)","Air_conditioning","Fingerprint","Fluorescent_lighting","Linear","Compact_fluorescent_lamp","Ballast_(electrical)","Pink","Arbitrary","Color_temperature","Color_rendering_index","Light-emitting_diodes","Luminous_efficacy","Light-emitting_diodes","Cost-effective","Nightlight","Flashlight","Light-emitting_diodes","Light-emitting_diodes","Electrode","Electrical_ballast","Electric_arc","Ultra-violet","Electrode","Neon","Argon","Xenon","Sodium","Metal_halide","Mercury_(element)","Ballast_(electrical)","Sodium_vapor_lamp","GE","Osram","Philips","Street_light","Light_pollution","Astronomy","Daylighting","List_of_light_sources","Henry_Woodward_(inventor)","Solar_lamp"]}
