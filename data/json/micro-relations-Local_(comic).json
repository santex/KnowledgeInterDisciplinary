Each issue is intended to be a stand-alone\nshort story, taking place in a different town across North America. A recurring\ncharacter, Megan, provides a thread for readers who follow the series in\nsequence. Megan is the main character in some issues, while in others she is a\nspectator or background figure.\n\nLocal resembles a previous series of Wood's, [[Demo (comics)|Demo]] (published\nby AiT/Planet Lar), which also spanned twelve issues, each of which was a self-\ncontained story. As Local went on, it became more of a coming of age story for\nthe lead character.\n\nThe first issue was released in November 2005, and the series concluded in\nJune 2008.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Local_(comic)","recorded":1362574100,"links":11,"instances":["comics","illustrator"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2005 comic debuts"],"headings":["Issues","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Local08_coverfile.jpg/250px-Local08_coverfile.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brian_wood","illustrator"],["ryan_kelly","comics"],["brian_wood","illustrator"],["ryan_kelly","comics"]],"members":["ryan_kelly","brian_wood"],"related":["Oni_Press","2005_in_comics","Brian_Wood_(illustrator)","Ryan_Kelly_(comics)","Oni_Press","Comic_book","Limited_series","Brian_Wood_(illustrator)","Ryan_Kelly_(comics)","AiT/Planet_Lar","Coming_of_age","2005_in_comics","Portland,_Oregon","Minneapolis,_Minnesota","Richmond,_Virginia","Missoula,_Montana","Halifax_Urban_Area","Brooklyn,_New_York","Tempe,_Arizona","Wicker_Park,_Chicago","Norman,_Oklahoma","Austin,_Texas","Toronto,_Ontario","Vermont"]}
