This blood is normally oxygenated, exceptions made for the pulmonary and\numbilical arteries. The Effective Arterial Blood Volume (EABV) is that\nextracellular fluid (ECF) which fills the arterial system.\n\nThe circulatory system is extremely important for sustaining life. Its proper\nfunctioning is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all\ncells, as well as the removal of carbon dioxide and waste products, maintenance\nof optimum pH, and the mobility of the elements, proteins and cells of the\nimmune system. In developed countries, the two leading causes of death,\nmyocardial infarction and stroke, each may directly result from an arterial\nsystem that has been slowly and progressively compromised by years of\ndeterioration.
