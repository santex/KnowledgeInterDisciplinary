When used as a direct form of address,\nspoken or written, it takes the form \"Your Royal Highness\". When used as a third\nperson reference, it is gender-specific (Her Royal Highness or His Royal\nHighness, both abbreviated HRH) and, in plural, Their Royal Highnesses (TRH).\n\nHolders of the style Royal Highness generally rank below holders of the style\n[[Imperial Highness]], but above those addressed as [[Grand Ducal Highness]],\n[[Highness]], [[Serene Highness]] and some other styles.\n","title":"Royal%20Highness","headings":["Origin","African usage","United Kingdom","Denmark","Sweden","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Royal_family","2: British_prince","2: Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","2: Prince_Carl_Philip,_Duke_of_Värmland","2: Princess_Madeleine,_Duchess_of_Hälsingland_and_Gästrikland","1: Abbreviation","1: Queen_consort","1: Grammatical_person","1: Nobility","1: Denis_Diderot","1: Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria","1: Philip_III_of_Spain","1: Victor_Amadeus_I,_Duke_of_Savoy","1: Gaston,_Duke_of_Orléans","1: Henry_IV_of_France","1: Brussels","1: Grandchildren_of_France","1: Continental_Europe","1: Holy_Roman_Emperor","1: King_of_Poland","1: Danubian_Principalities","1: Prince_of_Orange","1: Prince-elector","1: Grand_duke","1: African","1: Courtesy_title","1: Reign","1: Tribal_chief","1: Sovereign_state","1: Constituent_state","1: Nigerian_traditional_rulers","1: Yoruba_people","1: Yoruba_language","1: King","1: Zulu_people","1: Great_Royal_Wife","1: British_monarchy","1: British_princess","1: Duke","1: British_Royal_Family","1: United_Kingdom","1: Letters_patent","1: Royal_Family","1: Charles,_Prince_of_Wales","1: Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York","1: Denmark","1: Crown_prince","1: Highness","1: Princess_Elisabeth_of_Denmark","1: Victoria,_Crown_Princess_of_Sweden","1: Duke_of_Västergötland","1: Princess_Lilian,_Duchess_of_Halland","1: Storkyrkan","1: Royal_Order_of_the_Seraphim","1: Christopher_O'Neill","1: Prince_Daniel,_Duke_of_Västergötland","1: Svante_Lindqvist","1: New_York","1: Swedish_Royal_Family","1: Roman_Catholicism","1: Lutheranism","1: Forms_of_address_in_the_United_Kingdom","1: Royal_and_noble_styles","1: Table_of_Ranks","1: Use_of_courtesy_titles_and_honorifics_in_professional_writing"]}
