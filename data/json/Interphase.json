In preparation for cell division, it increases\nits size and makes a copy of its DNA, which is made during the S phase.\nInterphase is also considered to be the 'living' phase of the cell, in which the\ncell obtains nutrients, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other \"normal\" cell\nfunctions. The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in\ninterphase. Interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting but is\nrather an active preparation for cell division. A common misconception is that\ninterphase is the first stage of mitosis. However, since mitosis is the division\nof the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage.

Somatic cells,\nor normal diploid cells of the body, go through mitosis in order to reproduce\nthemselves through cell division, whereas diploid germ cells (i.e., primary\nspermatocytes and primary oocytes) go through meiosis in order to create haploid\ngametes (i.e., sperm and ova) for the purpose of sexual reproduction.\nChromosomes are copied.\n","linknr":259,"url":"Interphase","recorded":1362481128,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mitosis","Cell biology"],"headings":["Stages of interphase","Interphase within sequences of cellular processes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Interphase.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Interphase_and_part_of_Telophase_of_HT1080.PNG/159px-Interphase_and_part_of_Telophase_of_HT1080.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cytoplasm","Telophase","Mitosis","Cell_cycle","Cell_division","DNA","Eukaryotic_cells","Mitosis","Cell_nucleus","Prophase","Mitosis","Meiosis","Somatic_cell","Diploid","Germ_cell","Spermatocyte","Oocyte","Gametes","Sperm","Ovum","Cell_cycle_checkpoint","G1_phase","S_phase","Semiconservative_replication","G2_phase","G0_phase","G1","Mammal","Mitosis","Cytokinesis","Daughter_cell","Cell_cycle","Telophase","Cytokinesis","Cell_division","G0_phase","Prophase","Preprophase","Gamete","Meiosis","Programmed_cell_death","Apoptosis"]}
