{"cursor":"1900","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language', or 'KQML', is a language and\nprotocol for communication among software agents and knowledge-based systems. It\nwas developed in the early 1990s part of the DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort,\nwhich was aimed at developing techniques for building large-scale knowledge\nbases which are shareable and reusable. While originally conceived of as an\ninterface to knowledge based systems, it was soon repurposed as an Agent\ncommunication language.\n\nWork on KQML was led by Tim Finin of the University of Maryland, Baltimore\nCounty and Jay Weber of EITech and involved contributions from many researchers.\n\nThe KQML message format and protocol can be used to interact with an intelligent\nsystem, either by an application program, or by another intelligent system.\nKQML's \"performatives\" are operations that agents perform on each other's\nknowledge and goal stores. Higher-level interactions such as contract nets and\nnegotiation are built using these. KQML's \"communication facilitators\"\ncoordinate the interactions of other agents to support knowledge sharing.\n\nExperimental prototype systems support concurrent engineering, intelligent\ndesign, intelligent planning, and scheduling.\n\nKQML is superseded by FIPA-ACL.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Knowledge_Query_and_Manipulation_Language","recorded":1362574581,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Knowledge representation languages","Multi-agent systems"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DARPA_knowledge_Sharing_Effort","Agent_communication_language","Tim_Finin","University_of_Maryland,_Baltimore_County","Application_program","Contract_nets","Multi-agent_system","FIPA-ACL","Agent_Communications_Language","Knowledge_Interchange_Format","FIPA"]}
