{"cursor":"1442","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In lithic reduction, 'termination type' is a characteristic indicating the\nmanner in which the distal end of a lithic flake detaches from a core (Andrefsky\n1998:18). Common types include:\n\n* 'Step/snap termination' â these occur when a flake snaps or breaks during\n  removal, resulting in an abrupt right-angle break.\n* 'Hinge termination' â results when the applied force rolls away from the core\n  or objective piece, creating a rounded or blunted distal end.\n* 'Overshot/outrepasse/plunging termination' - occurs when the applied force\n  dips and removes a section of the opposite margin of the artifact or the\n  distal end of the core. Also referred to as a reverse hinge termination.\n* 'Perverse termination' - \"twisting\" breaks resulting from when the applied\n  force is redirected through the material in a helical fashion;\n* 'Feather/monotomic termination' â a smooth termination that results in a\n  feathered distal end. The distal ends of these flakes are only a few molecules\n  thick, are extremely sharp, and indicate a flawless detachment. These are the\n  intended results of some lithic reduction techniques, and are very desirable\n  for opportunistic tool use that does not require retouching or sharpening.\n","linknr":72,"url":"Termination_type","recorded":1362486649,"links":10,"instances":["lithics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lithics"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["retouch","lithics"]],"members":["retouch"],"related":["Lithic_reduction","Lithic_flake","Lithic_core","Helical","Retouch_(lithics)"]}
