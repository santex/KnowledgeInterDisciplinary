A sensory system consists\nof sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in\nsensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision,\nhearing, somatic sensation (touch), taste and olfaction (smell). In short,\nsenses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind where we\ninterpret the information, creating our perception of the world around\nus. John Krantz.

For instance, the part of the world an eye can see,\nis its receptive field; the light that each rod or cone can see, is its\nreceptive field.
