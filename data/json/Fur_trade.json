{"cursor":"49744","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (before 1906)]] The 'fur trade' is a worldwide industry dealing in the\n acquisition and sale of animal fur. Since the establishment of a world fur\n market in the early modern period, furs of boreal, polar and cold temperate\n mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade had a large\n impact on the exploration and colonization of Siberia, northern North America\n and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands. Today the importance of the\n fur trade has diminished and is currently centered around fur farms and\n authorized wildlife hunting, but remains controversial due to the cruelty\n involved and conflicts with the tourism industry. Several animal rights\n organizations oppose the fur trade, while supporters often cite their methods\n as not being cruel, that the animal populations are abundant, and their rights\n to practice a traditional lifestyle should be respected. The use of fur has\n been partly substituted by synthetic imitations. fur trader in the 1890s.]]\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fur_trade","recorded":1372152444,"links":[],"instances":["kanawha_river","ship","island","explorer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fur trade|*","History of the American West","History of Canada","Animal welfare"],"headings":["Russian fur trade","North American fur trade","Maritime fur trade","See also","Footnotes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["newfoundland","island"],["nonsuch","ship"],["new_river","kanawha_river"],["simon_fraser","explorer"]],"members":["new_river","nonsuch","newfoundland","simon_fraser"],"related":["Animal_fur","Early_modern_period","Boreal_ecosystem","Siberia","North_America","South_Shetland_Islands","South_Sandwich_Islands","Animal_rights","Early_Middle_Ages","Baltic_Sea","Black_Sea","Leipzig","Marten","Beaver","Wolf","Fox","Squirrel","Hare","Siberia","Arctic_fox","Lynx","Sable","Sea_otter","Ermine","Sea_otter","Northern_fur_seal","Imperial_Russia","Alaska","Siberia","Russian_Far_East","Russian_colonization_of_the_Americas","Sverdlovsk_Oblast","Novosibirsk_Oblast","Tyumen_Oblast","Irkutsk_Oblast","Oblast","Felt","Novgorod_Republic","Volga_River","Vychegda_River","Komi_peoples","Pechora_River","Yugra","Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow","Russian_Far_East","Siberia","Tatars","Ivan_the_Terrible","Khanate_of_Kazan","Ural_Mountains","Kama_River","Komi_peoples","Khanate_of_Sibir","Cossacks","Yermak_Timofeyevich","Feodor_I_of_Russia","Voivode","Khanate_of_Sibir","Yenisei_River","Altai_Mountains","Ottoman_Empire","Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow","European_colonization_of_the_Americas","European-American","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","First_Nations","Newfoundland_(island)","New_France","Monopoly","Henry_IV_of_France","Saguenay_River","Tadoussac,_Quebec","Coureur_des_bois","Étienne_Brûlé","Samuel_de_Champlain","Pierre-Esprit_Radisson","René-Robert_Cavelier,_Sieur_de_La_Salle","Pierre-Charles_Le_Sueur","Amerindians","Adriaen_Block","Mohawks","Mohicans","Dutch_people","New_Amsterdam","Fort_Orange","Plymouth_Colony","Sir_David_Kirke","Bay_of_Fundy","Pierre-Esprit_Radisson","Médard_des_Groseilliers","Nonsuch_(ship)","Hudson's_Bay_Company","Deerskin_trade","Charleston,_South_Carolina","Musket","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","John_Jacob_Astor","Pacific_Fur_Company","American_Fur_Company","Indigenous_people_of_the_Americas","United_States","Indian_Intercourse_Act","Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs","Indian_Territory","Mississippi_River","Mountain_man","Mexico","Abraham_Wood","New_River_(Kanawha_River)","Simon_Fraser_(explorer)","Fraser_River","Canada","Sea_otter","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Pacific_Northwest_Coast","Alaska_Natives","Kamchatka","Aleutian_Islands","British_Columbia_Coast","Hudson's_Bay_Company","Hudson's_Bay_Company","Russian-American_Company","North_West_Company","American_Fur_Company","Pacific_Northwest","International_trade","Capitalism","Colonialism","Triangular_trade","Hawaiian_Islands","Western_world","New_England","Aleut_people","Tlingit_people","Haida_people","Nuu-chah-nulth_people","Chinook_people","Potlatch","Epidemic","Totem","Chinook_Jargon","Native_Hawaiian","Textile_manufacturing","Slavery_in_the_United_States","Plantation_system","Deep_South","Sea_otter","Columbia_River","Cook_Inlet","Local_extinction","Guangzhou","Canton_System","Mongolia","Kyakhta","Treaty_of_Kyakhta","Beaver_Wars","The_Coalition_to_Abolish_the_Fur_Trade","Fur_brigade","Harold_Innis_and_the_fur_trade","History_of_Siberia","List_of_fur_trading_post_and_forts_in_North_America","Sally_Ainse","Manuel_Lisa","Pierre_Gaultier_de_Varennes,_sieur_de_La_Vérendrye","René_Auguste_Chouteau","Rocky_Mountain_Fur_Company","Science_and_technology_in_Canada","Animal_trapping","Trading_post","LeRoy_R._Hafen","University_of_Massachusetts_Press","William_J._Eccles"]}
