The songs are remixes of their songs recorded between\n1998 and early 1999.\n\nMost of the songs are extended mixes. Several had been previously released on\n12\" promo singles, cd singles but some are completely remade.\n\n[[The Independent on Sunday]] noted that some remixes were made by different\nacts : \"This is the pick of a crop that includes Howie B., Witchman and The\nBeloved, plus newer artists such as Icarus or Dr Psyche. While there are some\nchunky beats and catchy loops, it's better suited to home listening rather than\nthe dancefloor\". \"Hybrids by The Creatures [album review]\". The Independent\non Sunday. November 1999.\n\n[[Q (magazine)]]'s Victoria Segal said : \"So Howie B takes a knife to the\nsexually watchful 'Prettiest Thing'; Black Dog unbolt the beats of 'Guillotine'\ninto disjunctive abstraction, and Witchman has his evil way with 'Say'. Twice.\nRunning its finger along the cutting edge, Hybrids is a bravely bloody genetic\nexperiment.\" \"Hybrids by The Creatures [album review]\". Q Magazine.
