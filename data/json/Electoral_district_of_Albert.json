Albert\nis named for the Albert River, which runs through the electorate and separates\nLogan City from Gold Coast City. It was first created in a redistribution in\n1887 ahead of the 1888 state election and continued to exist (with various\nboundary alterations) until 1949, when the Darlington and Southport electorates\nwere created. In 1959, the electorate was established again and exists to this\nday. The 1971 and 1977 redistributions greatly reduced the area of the\nelectorate and minor changes were made in 1991, including the loss of Carbrook\nin the north and coastal areas below Paradise Point in the south.\n\nIts consistently changing boundaries together with its existence in a high-\ngrowth area do not provide consistent political leanings over time, although it\nhas shown more inclination towards the Labor Party over time than any other Gold\nCoast seat.\n\nThe present Member, Mark Boothman, was first elected in the 2012 election.\n","linknr":285,"url":"Electoral_district_of_Albert","recorded":1374521521,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Albert&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Albert&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Queensland_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/File:QLD_-_Albert_2008.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/QLD_-_Albert_2008.png","/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Mark_Boothman","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Australia","/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland","/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Queensland","/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_Queensland","/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia","/wiki/Queensland","/wiki/Albert_River_(Queensland)","/wiki/Logan_City","/wiki/Gold_Coast_City","/w/index.php?title=Queensland_state_election,_1888&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Darlington_(Queensland)","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Southport","/wiki/Carbrook,_Queensland","/wiki/Paradise_Point,_Queensland","#cite_note-qp-1","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Mark_Boothman","/wiki/Queensland_state_election,_2012","#History","#Members_for_Albert","#Election_results","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Albert&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/John_Appel","/wiki/Second_Kidston_Ministry","/wiki/Denham_Ministry","/wiki/Queensland_Farmers%27_Union","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","#cite_note-qgg-3","/wiki/Gold_Coast_City","/wiki/Beaudesert,_Queensland","/wiki/Jimboomba,_Queensland","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Fassifern","/wiki/Logan_City","/wiki/Redland_City","/wiki/North_Stradbroke_Island","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Wynnum","/wiki/Queensland_state_election,_1950","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Darlington","/wiki/Redland_City","/wiki/Logan_City","/wiki/Coomera,_Queensland","/w/index.php?title=Tamborine,_Queensland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Southport","#cite_note-qgg-3","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Queensland_state_election,_1960","/wiki/Electoral_district_of_South_Coast","#cite_note-qgg-3","/wiki/Queensland_state_election,_2009","/wiki/Pacific_Motorway_(Ewingsdale%E2%80%93Brisbane)","/wiki/Mount_Warren_Park,_Queensland","/wiki/Windaroo,_Queensland","/wiki/Coomera,_Queensland","/wiki/Oxenford,_Queensland","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Albert&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Electoral_results_for_the_district_of_Albert","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Plunkett,_senior&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Collins_(Queensland_politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Plunkett,_senior&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Appel","/wiki/Queensland_Farmers%27_Union","/wiki/Nationalist_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Queensland_United_Party&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Country_and_Progressive_National_Party","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Flood_Plunkett&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Country_and_Progressive_National_Party","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/w/index.php?title=Cec_Carey&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Bill_Heatley","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Bill_D%27Arcy","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Ivan_Gibbs","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/John_Szczerbanik","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Bill_Baumann","/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia","/wiki/Margaret_Keech","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Mark_Boothman","/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland","/w/index.php?title=Electoral_district_of_Albert&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Electoral_results_for_the_district_of_Albert","/wiki/Queensland_state_election,_2012","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland","/wiki/Mark_Boothman","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Margaret_Keech","/wiki/Katter%27s_Australian_Party","/wiki/Family_First_Party","/wiki/Australian_Greens","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland","/wiki/Mark_Boothman","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/Margaret_Keech","/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland","/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party","/wiki/
