{"cursor":"8326","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nFor the British alternative rock band, see [[Felt (band)]].\n\n felt yurt]]\n\n grand piano key]] ]]\n\n\n'Felt' is a non-woven cloth that is produced by matting, condensing and\npressing woollen fibres. While some types of felt are very soft, some are tough\nenough to form construction materials. Felt can be of any colour, and made into\nany shape or size.\n\nMany cultures have legends as to the origins of feltmaking. Sumerian legend\nclaims that the secret of feltmaking was discovered by Urnamman of Lagash.\nThe story of Saint Clement and Saint Christopher relates that while fleeing\nfrom persecution, the men packed their sandals with wool to prevent blisters.\nAt the end of their journey, the movement and sweat had turned the wool into\nfelt socks.\n\nFeltmaking is still practised by nomadic peoples (Altaic people) in Central\nAsia and northern parts of East Asia (Mongols), where rugs, tents and clothing\nare regularly made. Some of these are traditional items, such as the classic\nyurt (Gers), while others are designed for the tourist market, such as\ndecorated slippers. In the Western world, felt is widely used as a medium for\nexpression in textile art as well as design, where it has significance as an\necological textile.\n","linknr":568,"url":"Felt","recorded":1362552016,"links":63,"instances":["element","hat","textile_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nonwoven fabrics","Building materials","Animal hair products"],"headings":["Construction","Uses","See also","External links","",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Felt_cloth.jpg/220px-Felt_cloth.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Kazah_jurta.jpg/220px-Kazah_jurta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Colored_felt_cloth.jpg/220px-Colored_felt_cloth.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Steinway-Fl%C3%BCgel.jpg/220px-Steinway-Fl%C3%BCgel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Felt_hat.jpg/220px-Felt_hat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Wool_Felt_Sheets.jpg/220px-Wool_Felt_Sheets.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Jute_nahtlos.png/120px-Jute_nahtlos.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Batik_Indonesia.jpg/120px-Batik_Indonesia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/MacLachlan_hunting_tartan_%28D._W._Stewart%29.svg/120px-MacLachlan_hunting_tartan_%28D._W._Stewart%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Marquetry_Mezuzah.jpg/120px-Marquetry_Mezuzah.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["blocking","textile_arts"],["homburg","hat"]],"members":["mercury","homburg","blocking"],"related":["Yurt","Non-woven","Wool","Sumer","Urnamman","Lagash","Clement_of_Metz","Saint_Christopher","Nomadic_people","Central_Asia","East_Asia","Carpet","Tent","Clothing","Yurt","Textile","Wool","Steam_roller","Rotating","Steam_roller","India","Clothing","Mercury_(element)","Mercuric_nitrate","Blocking_(textile_arts)","Mercury_poisoning","Hatter","Mad_as_a_hatter","Automotive_industry","Home_construction","Damper","Car_bra","Bass_drum","Accordion","Ukulele","Plectrum","Puppet","Josef_Beuys","Fedora","Trilby","Homburg_(hat)","Bowler_hat","Fuzzy_felt","Nuno_felting","Roofing_felt","Valenki"]}
