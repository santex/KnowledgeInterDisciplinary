{"cursor":"28168","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s have an anodized aluminium surface that has been dyed; they are made in\nmany colors.]]\n\n'Anodizing' (also spelled 'Anodising', particularly in the UK) is an\nelectrolytic passivation process used to increase the thickness of the natural\noxide layer on the surface of metal parts.\n\nThe process is called \"anodizing\" because the part to be treated forms the anode\nelectrode of an electrical circuit. Anodizing increases corrosion resistance and\nwear resistance, and provides better adhesion for paint primers and glues than\ndoes bare metal. Anodic films can also be used for a number of cosmetic effects,\neither with thick porous coatings that can absorb dyes or with thin transparent\ncoatings that add interference effects to reflected light.\n\nAnodizing is also used to prevent galling of threaded components and to make\ndielectric films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly\napplied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium,\nzinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel\nmetal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline microelectrolytic\nconditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually \"ferric hydroxide\" or hydrated iron\noxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic\nsurface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating\nthe underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel\nwith high carbon content (high carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an\nelectrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are\ncommonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid, or by treatment with red\nfuming nitric acid, to form hard black ferric oxide. This oxide remains\nconformal even when plated on wire and the wire is bent.\n\nAnodization changes the microscopic texture of the surface and changes the\ncrystal structure of the metal near the surface. Thick coatings are normally\nporous, so a sealing process is often needed to achieve corrosion resistance.\nAnodized aluminium surfaces, for example, are harder than aluminium but have low\nto moderate wear resistance that can be improved with increasing thickness or by\napplying suitable sealing substances. Anodic films are generally much stronger\nand more adherent than most types of paint and metal plating, but also more\nbrittle. This makes them less likely to crack and peel from aging and wear, but\nmore susceptible to cracking from thermal stress.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Anodization","recorded":1362375016,"links":34,"instances":["color","materials_science","technical_standard","wave_propagation","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ecmjournal.org/journal/supplements/vol005supp01/pdf/vol005supp01a18.pdf","http://www.gwp-ag.com/media/www.gwp-ag.com/org/med_645/1563_hard-anodizing-alloys.pdf"],"categories":["Coatings","Corrosion prevention","Electrolysis","Metallurgical processes"],"headings":["History","Anodized aluminium","Other widely used specifications","Other metals","Dyeing","Printing","Sealing","Cleaning","Environmental impact","Mechanical considerations","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Cheap_carabiners.JPG/220px-Cheap_carabiners.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Anodized_titanium_colors.svg/200px-Anodized_titanium_colors.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/IPod_mini.png/175px-IPod_mini.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["passivation","chemistry"],["interference","wave_propagation"],["specification","technical_standard"],["dissolution","chemistry"],["substrate","materials_science"],["champagne","color"]],"members":["champagne","substrate","specification","interference","dissolution","passivation"],"related":["Electrolyte","Passivation_(chemistry)","Oxide","Anode","Electrical_circuit","Corrosion","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Galling","Electrolytic_capacitor","Aluminium_alloy","Titanium","Zinc","Magnesium","Niobium","Zirconium","Hafnium","Tantalum","Carbon_steel","Iron_oxide","Ferric_hydroxide","Hydrated_iron_oxide","Rust","Sulfate","Chloride","High_carbon_steel","Cast_iron","Ferrous_metals","Nitric_acid","Red_fuming_nitric_acid","Ferric_oxide","Crystal_structure","Corrosion_resistance","Duralumin","Seaplane","Chromic_acid","Specification_(technical_standard)","Plastic","Powder_coating","Dyeing","Lubrication","Adhesion","Non-conductor","Amorphous","Aluminium_oxide","Nanometer","Copper","Iron","Silicon","Aluminium_alloy","Mp3_players","Multi-tool","Flashlight","Cookware","Camera","Sporting_goods","Window_frame","Roof","Thermal_stress","Îœm","Sodium_hydroxide","Sodium_gluconate","Ammonium_bifluoride","Intermetallic","Direct_current","Hydrogen","Cathode","Oxygen","Alternating_current","Pulsed_current","Acid","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Substrate_(materials_science)","Micrometre","United_States_Military_Standard","SAE_International","ASTM_International","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Chromic_acid","Hard_anodizing","Sulfuric_acid","PTFE","Malic_acid","Oxalic_acid","Sulfonated","Aromatic_compounds","Sulfosalicylic_acid","Borate","Tartrate","Plasma_electrolytic_oxidation","Voltages","Dental_implants","Costume_jewelry","Wedding_rings","Titanium_nitride","Sodium_silicate","International_Lead_Zinc_Research_Organization","Ammonium_phosphate","Chromate","Fluoride","Sodium_silicate","Jewelry","Commemorative_coin","Tantalum_capacitor","Inorganic","Ferric_ammonium_oxalate","Lightfastness","Tin","Champagne_(color)","Black","Bronze","Architecture","Organic_acids","Sulfuric","Airbrush","Paintbrush","Deionized_water","Hydrated","Teflon","Nickel_acetate","Dichromate","Panel_Edge_Staining","Heavy_metals","Halogen","Volatile_organic_compound","Aluminium_hydroxide","Aluminium_sulfate","Industrial_wastewater_treatment","Screw_thread","Screw","Taps_and_dies"]}
