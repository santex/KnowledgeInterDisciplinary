Retrieved 2009-09-15. He discovered\nthe wreck July 20, 1985. The estimated $450 million cache recovered, known as\n\"The Atocha Motherlode,\" included 40 tons of gold and silver; there were some\n114,000 of the Spanish silver coins known as \"pieces of eight\", gold coins,\nColombian emeralds, gold and silver artifacts, and 1000 silver ingots. Large as it was,\nthis was only roughly half of the treasure that went down with the Atocha. The\nwealthiest part of the ship, the stern castle, is yet to be found. \"Investor\nRelations \"Introduction\" (http://www.melfisher.com/Investors/InvHome.asp)\".\nRetrieved 2009-09-15. Still missing are 300 silver bars and 8 bronze\ncannons, among other things. In addition to the Atocha, Fisher's company,\nSalvors Inc., found remains of several shipwrecks in Florida waters, including\nthe Atocha's sister galleon the Santa Margarita, lost in the same year, and the\nremains of a slave ship known as the [[Henrietta Marie]].  Key West,\nFlorida]] The site of the wreckage of the Atocha, called \"The Bank of Spain\", (a\nsandy area 22 feet deep and within 200 yards of the anchor location), is still being worked on and treasures are slowly being\nrecovered. The emeralds from the Atocha are some of the finest emeralds in the\nworld. They come from the Muzo Mine in Colombia. The emeralds of Muzo are\nrenowned for their color and are the world standard by which all emeralds are\njudged. \"Investor Relations \"The Value of Emeralds\"\n(http://www.melfisher.com/Investors/InvHome.asp)\". Retrieved 2009-09-15.\n\nFisher was an Indiana-born former chicken farmer who eventually moved to\nCalifornia and opened the first diving shop in the state. He attended Purdue\nUniversity and was a member of The Delta Chi Fraternity. In 1953, he married\nDolores (Deo) Horton who became his business partner. She was one of the first\nwomen to learn how to dive and set a women's record by staying underwater for 50\nhours. Mel and Deo had four children: sons Dirk, Kim and Kane, and daughter\nTaffi. On July 13, 1975 Mel's oldest son Dirk, his wife Angel, and diver Rick\nGage died after their boat capsized during their quest for treasure. Mel\nstruggled through decades of hard times treasure hunting in the Florida Keys\nwith the motto Today's the Day.\n\nMel Fisher hired Duncan Mathewson as chief archaeologist during the Atocha\nperiod, and Salvors, Inc. became experts in recovery and conservation of\nunderwater artifacts, remaining active as of 2009. Fisher blended private and\npublic interests when it came to underwater cultural resources. The Supreme\nCourt of the United States confirmed Fisher's ownership to recovered treasure\nwith a provision that Mel's company donates 20% of the artifacts to the state.\nConcern in the U.S., and Florida specifically, for protection of submerged\narchaeological sites contributed to the 2001 adoption of the UNESCO Convention\non the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Mel_Fisher","recorded":1363138264,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Treasure_hunting","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Galleon","/wiki/Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_de_Atocha","#cite_note-http:.2F.2Fwww.melfisher.com-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Spanish_dollar","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Colombia","/wiki/Emerald","/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)","#cite_note-http:.2F.2Fwww.melfisher.com-1","#cite_note-MEL.27S_STORY-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Cannon","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/Henrietta_Marie","/wiki/File:Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum.jpg/220px-Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum.jpg","/wiki/File:Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum","/wiki/Key_West,_Florida","#cite_note-ATcompany-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Indiana","/wiki/California","/wiki/Purdue_University","/wiki/Florida_Keys","#cite_note-MEL.27S_STORY-3","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/UNESCO_Convention_on_the_Protection_of_the_Underwater_Cultural_Heritage","#cite_note-MEL.27S_STORY-3","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mel_Fisher","/wiki/Mel_Fisher_Maritime_Heritage_Museum","/wiki/Mel_Fisher%27s_Treasure_Museum","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-http:.2F.2Fwww.melfisher.com_1-0","#cite_ref-http:.2F.2Fwww.melfisher.com_1-1","http://www.melfisher.com","#cite_ref-2","http://www.melfisher.org/1622.htm","#cite_ref-MEL.27S_STORY_3-0","#cite_ref-MEL.27S_STORY_3-1","#cite_ref-MEL.27S_STORY_3-2","http://www.melfisher.org/melstory.htm","http://www.melfisher.org/melstory.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.melfisher.com/Investors/InvHome.asp","#cite_ref-ATcompany_5-0","http://www.atochatreasures.com/1622_spanish_treasure_fleet_by_r.htm","http://www.atochatreasures.com/1622_spanish_treasure_fleet_by_r.htm","#cite_ref-6","http://www.melfisher.com/Investors/InvHome.asp","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit&section=3","http://www.melfisher.com/","http://www.melfisher.org/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&oldid=542486967","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1922_births","/wiki/Category:1998_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Monroe_County,_Florida","/wiki/Category:Treasure_hunters","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_template_with_no_category_set","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mel+Fisher&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Mel+Fisher","/wiki/Mel_Fisher","/wiki/Talk:Mel_Fisher","#","/wiki/Mel_Fisher","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Mel_Fisher","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mel_Fisher","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&oldid=542486967","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Mel_Fisher&id=542486967","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Mel+Fisher","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Mel+Fisher&oldid=542486967&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Mel_Fisher&printable=yes","//fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%8
