{"cursor":"8666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In statistics, 'identifiability' is a property which a model must satisfy in\norder for inference to be possible. We say that the model is 'identifiable' if\nit is theoretically possible to learn the true value of this modelâs underlying\nparameter after obtaining an infinite number of observations from it.\nMathematically, this is equivalent to saying that different values of the\nparameter must generate different probability distributions of the observable\nvariables. Usually the model is identifiable only under certain technical\nrestrictions, in which case the set of these requirements is called the\n'identification conditions'.\n\nA model that fails to be identifiable is said to be 'non-identifiable' or\n'unidentifiable'. In some cases, even though a model is non-identifiable, it is\nstill possible to learn the true values of a certain subset of the model\nparameters. In this case we say that the model is 'partially identifiable'. In\nother cases it may be possible to learn the location of the true parameter up to\na certain finite region of the parameter space, in which case the model is set\nidentifiable.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Identifiability","recorded":1362668549,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Estimation theory"],"headings":["Definition","Examples","Software","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/3/6439704fd9f1b88b53d3e5ecba9abc96.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/1/4b15230fdcd368b598ea11f6ceab6662.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/9/0e94cfb4c25ca3f539150c79c57599e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/8/a1804a9a2c3f9deec2c31c1b95ce979b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/c/e2ca7aa3b1367203b73e28166acd4a59.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/4/564c658d09a000d7447479a7244fca9b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Statistics","Statistical_model","Statistical_inference","Probability_distribution","Set_identifiable","Statistical_model","Bijection","Probability_density_function","Lebesgue_measure","Strong_law_of_large_numbers","Indicator_function","Normal_distribution","Location-scale_family","Linear_regression_model","Transpose","Errors-in-variables","Linear_model","Set_identifiability","Ordinary_least_squares","PottersWheel","Parameter_identification_problem"]}
