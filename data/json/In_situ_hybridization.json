{"cursor":"7713","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'In situhybridization (ISH)' is a type of hybridization that uses a labeled\ncomplementary DNA or RNA strand (i.e., probe) to localize a specific DNA or RNA\nsequence in a portion or section of tissue ([[in situ]]), or, if the tissue is\nsmall enough (e.g. plant seeds, [[Drosophila]] embryos), in the entire tissue\n(whole mount ISH), in cells and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This is\ndistinct from immunohistochemistry, which usually localizes proteins in tissue\nsections. DNA ISH can be used to determine the structure of chromosomes.\nFluorescent DNA ISH (FISH) can, for example, be used in medical diagnostics to\nassess chromosomal integrity. RNA ISH (RNA in situ hybridization) is used to\nmeasure and localize RNAs (mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs) within tissue sections,\ncells, whole mounts, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In situ hybridization\nwas invented by Joseph G. Gall.\n","linknr":149,"url":"In_situ_hybridization","recorded":1362481362,"links":21,"instances":["biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory techniques","Biological techniques and tools"],"headings":["Process","Basic steps for digoxigenin-labeled probes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/RNA_in_situ_hybridization_in_FFPE_samples.jpg/220px-RNA_in_situ_hybridization_in_FFPE_samples.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Multiplex_ViewRNA_FISH_Assay_in_Jurkat_and_HeLa_cells.jpg/220px-Multiplex_ViewRNA_FISH_Assay_in_Jurkat_and_HeLa_cells.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Hunchback_in_situ.jpg/220px-Hunchback_in_situ.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybridisation","molecular_biology"],["tissue","biology"]],"members":["tissue","hybridisation"],"related":["Hybridisation_(molecular_biology)","Complementary_DNA","RNA","Hybridization_probe","Tissue_(biology)","Immunohistochemistry","Gene_mapping","Fluorescent_in_situ_hybridization","Joseph_G._Gall","Histochemistry","Complementary_DNA","RNA","Riboprobe","Digoxigenin","Autoradiography","Fluorescence_microscopy","Immunohistochemistry","Branched_DNA_assay","Proteinase_K","Chromogenic_in_situ_hybridization"]}
