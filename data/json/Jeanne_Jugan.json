Jeanne grew up during the political\nand religious upheavals of the French Revolution. Four years after she was born,\nher father was lost at sea. Her mother struggled to provide for Jeanne and her\nsiblings, while also providing them secretly with religious instruction amid the\nanti-Catholic persecutions of the day.\n\nJeanne worked as a shepherdess; and when she was 16, she took a job as the\nkitchen maid of the Viscountess de la Choue. The viscountess, a devout\nChristian, had Jeanne accompany her when she visited the sick and the poor. At\nage 18, and again six years later, she declined two marriage proposals from the\nsame man. She told her mother that God had other plans, and was calling her to\nâa work which is not yet founded.â At age 25, the young woman joined the Third\nOrder of St. John Eudes, a religious association for laypersons founded during\nthe 17th century. Jeanne also worked as a nurse in the town hospital of Saint-\nServan. She worked hard at this physically demanding job but after six years,\nshe left the hospital due to health issues. She then worked for 12 years as the\nservant of a fellow member of the third order, until the woman's death in 1835.\nIn the course of Jeanne's duties, the two women recognized a similar Catholic\nspirituality and began to teach catechism to youngsters and care for the poor\nand other unfortunates.\n\nIn 1837, Jeanne and a 72-year old woman (FranÃ§oise Aubert) rented part of a\nsmall cottage and were joined by Virginie Tredaniel, a 17-year old orphan. These\nthree women then formed a Catholic community of prayer, devoted to teaching the\ncatechism and assisting the poor.\n\nIn the winter of 1839, Jeanne encountered Anne Chauvin, an elderly woman who was\nblind, partially paralyzed, and had no one to care for her. Jeanne carried Anne\nhome to her apartment and took her in from that day forward, letting the woman\nhave her bed while Jeanne slept in the attic. She soon took in two more old\nwomen in need of help, and by 1841 she had rented a room to provide housing for\na dozen elderly people. The following year, she acquired an unused convent\nbuilding that could house 40 of them. From this act of charity, with the\napproval of her colleagues, Jeanne then focused her attention upon the mission\nof assisting abandoned elderly women, and from this beginning arose a community\ncalled The Little Sisters of the Poor. Jeanne wrote a simple rule for this new\ncommunity of women, and they daily went door-to-door requesting food, clothing\nand money for the women in their care. This was Jeanne's life work, and she\nperformed this mission for the next four decades.\n\nDuring the 1840s, many other young women joined Jeanne in her mission of service\nto the elderly poor. By begging in the streets, the foundress was able to\nestablish four more homes for their beneficiaries by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1847 based on the request of Leo Dupont (known as the Holy Man of Tours) she\nestablished a house in Tours. She was much sought after when ever problems arose\nand worked with religious and civil authorities to seek help for the\npoor. Michel Lafon, 2009 15 Days of Prayer with Saint Jeanne Jugan New City\nPress ISBN 1-56548-329-4 page 20 By 1850, over 100 women had joined the\ncongregation that had become known as the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nHowever, Jeanne Jugan â known in religious life as Sister Mary of the Cross â\nhad been forced out of her leadership role by Father Auguste Le Pailleur, the\npriest who had been appointed superior general of the congregation. In an\napparent effort to suppress her true role as foundress, the superior general\nordered her into retirement and a life of obscurity for 27 years. During these\nyears, she served the order through her prayers and by accepting the trial\npermitted by God.\n\nBy 1879, the community Jeanne founded had 2,400 Little Sisters and had spread\nacross Europe and to North America. That year, Pope Leo XIII approved the\nconstitutions for the Little Sisters of the Poor. At the time of her death on\nAug. 29, 1879, she was not known to have founded the order. Fr. Le Pailleur,\nhowever, was eventually investigated and disciplined, and St. Jeanne Jugan came\nto be acknowledged as their foundress. Jeanne was buried in the graveyard at the\nmotherhouse at Saint-Pern. She was beatified in Rome by Pope John Paul II on\nOctober 3, 1982, and canonized on October 11, 2009, by Pope Benedict\nXVI.

ValparaÃ­so, Chile, from which it expanded later on.\n\nToday, pilgrims can visit the house where she was born (Cancale), the House of\nthe Cross at Saint-Servan and the motherhouse where she lived her last 23 years\nat La Tour Saint Joseph in
