It may also\nbe used to apply to water that originates with snowmelt that enters the\nstormwater system. Stormwater that does not soak into the ground becomes surface\nrunoff, which either flows directly into surface waterways or is channeled into\nstorm sewers, which eventually discharge to surface waters.\n\nStormwater is of concern for two main issues: one related to the volume and\ntiming of runoff water (flood control and water supplies) and the other related\nto potential contaminants that the water is carrying, i.e. water pollution.\n\nStormwater is also a resource and ever growing in importance as the world's\nhuman population demand exceeds the availability of readily available water.\nTechniques of stormwater harvesting with point source water management and\npurification can potentially make urban environments self-sustaining in\nterms of water.\n","linknr":372,"url":"Stormwater","recorded":1362372257,"links":26,"instances":["hydrology","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/0510029.pdf","http://epa.gov/region09/water/tribal/pdf/tribalswmgmt.pdf","http://www.ksre.ksu.edu/library/h20ql2/MF2814.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental soil science","Hydrology and urban planning","Water"],"headings":["History","Stormwater pollution","Stormwater runoff as a source of pollution","Stormwater management","Integrated water management","Regulation in the United States","Public education campaigns","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Drain_runoff_in_Kharkiv.jpg/220px-Drain_runoff_in_Kharkiv.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Natural_%26_impervious_cover_diagrams_EPA.jpg/400px-Natural_%26_impervious_cover_diagrams_EPA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/eb/Water_runoff.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Stormwater_Filtration_System.jpg/220px-Stormwater_Filtration_System.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/7sigma_RainGarden_66.JPG/220px-7sigma_RainGarden_66.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Trounce_Pond.jpg/220px-Trounce_Pond.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Silt_fence_EPA.jpg/220px-Silt_fence_EPA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["infiltration","hydrology"]],"members":["infiltration","precipitation"],"related":["Storm_drain","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Surface_runoff","Surface_water","Storm_sewer","Flood","Water_pollution","Stormwater_harvesting","Bronze_Age","Impervious_surface","Human_settlement","Greece","Archaeological","Minoan_civilization","Phaistos","Crete","Surface_runoff","Impervious_surfaces","Parking_lot","Road","Building","Soil_compaction","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Streams","Rivers","Flooding","Storm_sewer","Drainage_basin","Groundwater","Baseflow","Road","Lawn","Roof","Farm","Rains","Irrigation","Water","River","Lake","Ocean","Attenuation","Human","Coastal","Surface_runoff","Drainage_basin","Evapotranspiration","Erosion","Seattle","Puget_Sound","Retention_pond","Bioswale","Constructed_wetland","Water_quality","Low_impact_development","United_States","Water_Sensitive_Urban_Design","Australia","Infiltration_basin","Bioretention","Rain_gardens","Bioswale","Pervious_concrete","Biofilter","United_States","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Regulation","Clean_Water_Act","Wastewater","Sewage","Regulation","NPDES","United_States_Congress","Storm_sewer","Municipality","Construction","U.S.","Municipality","Construction","School_district","Effluent_guidelines","Erosion_control","Sediment_control","Pollution_prevention","Watershed_central","Sediment_control","Maryland","CAFO","Nonpoint_source_pollution","Natural_Resources_Conservation_Service","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Rain_garden","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Clean_Water_Action","Antecedent_soil_moisture","CPESC","Detention_basin","Retention_basin","First_flush","Line_source","Nationwide_Urban_Runoff_Program","Permeable_paving","Sanitary_sewer_overflow","Stormwater_detention_vault","Treatment_wetland","Volumetric_flow_rate"]}
