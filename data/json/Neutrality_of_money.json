{"cursor":"9155","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Neutrality of money' is the idea that a change in the stock of money affects\nonly nominal variables in the economy such as prices, wages, and exchange rates,\nwith no effect on real (inflation-adjusted) variables, like employment, real\nGDP, and real consumption.\n\nNeutrality of money is an important idea in classical economics and is\nrelated to the classical dichotomy. It implies that the central bank does not\naffect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, the\namount of real investment) by printing money. Instead, any increase in the\nsupply of money would be offset by a proportional rise in prices and wages.\nThis assumption underlies some mainstream macroeconomic models (e.g., real\nbusiness cycle models) while others like monetarism view money as being\nneutral in the long-run.\n\n'Superneutrality of money' is a stronger property than neutrality of money. It\nholds that not only is the real economy unaffected by the level of the money\nsupply but also that the rate of money supply growth has no effect on real\nvariables. In this case, nominal wages and prices remain proportional to the\nnominal money supply not only in response to one-time permanent changes in the\nnominal money supply but also in response to permanent changes in the growth\nrate of the nominal money supply. Typically superneutrality is addressed in the\ncontext of long-run models.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Neutrality_of_money","recorded":1362543060,"links":18,"instances":["economics","finance","economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monetary economics","Inflation","Economics terminology"],"headings":["History of the concept","Views","Reasons for departure from superneutrality","Evidence","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"],["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"],["consumption","economics"],["sticky","economics"],["credit","finance"],["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"]],"members":["sticky","credit","consumption","real_versus_nominal_value"],"related":["Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Price","Exchange_rates","Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Real_GDP","Consumption_(economics)","Classical_economics","Classical_dichotomy","Central_bank","Employment","Real_business_cycle_theory","Monetarism","Don_Patinkin","David_Hume","Friedrich_Hayek","Keynes","Monetary-disequilibrium_theory","Money_supply","Sticky_(economics)","Menu_costs","Bounded_rationality","Search_theory","Floor_function","Psychological","Money_illusion","New_Keynesian_economics","Monetary_policy","Post-Keynesian_economics","Monetary_circuit_theory","Credit_(finance)","Bank_money","Debt-deflation","Money_demand","Inventory","Physical_capital","Interest_rate","Loanable_funds","Durable_good","National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research","International_Monetary_Fund","Olivier_Blanchard","New_Keynesian_economics","Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Money_illusion","Veil_of_money","Classical_dichotomy","Quantity_theory_of_money","Don_Patinkin","Friedrich_Hayek","Friedrich_Hayek","David_Laidler"]}
