      "text" : "]] An 'animal product' is any material derived from the body of an animal.\nExamples are fat, flesh, blood, milk, eggs, and lesser known products such as\nisinglass and rennet.<ref>Unklesbay, Nan. World Food and You. Routledge, 1992,\np. 179ff.</ref>\n\nAnimal by-products are carcasses and parts of carcasses from slaughterhouses,\nanimal shelters, zoos and veterinarians, and products of animal origin not\nintended for human consumption, including catering waste (all waste food from\nrestaurants, catering facilities, central kitchens, slaughterhouses and\nhousehold kitchens). These products may go through a process known as\n\"rendering\" to be made into human and non-human foodstuffs, fats, and other\nmaterial that can be sold to make commercial products such as cosmetics, paint,\ncleaners, polishes, glue, soap and ink. The sale of animal by-products allows\nthe meat industry to compete economically with industries selling sources of\nvegetable protein.<ref>Ockerman, Herbert and Hansen, Conly L. Animal by-product\nprocessing & utilization. Technomic Publishing Company Inc., 2000, p. 1.</ref>\n\nGenerally, products made from fossilized or decomposed animals, such as\npetroleum formed from the ancient remains of marine animals, are not considered\nanimal products. Crops grown in soil fertilized with animal remains are rarely\ncharacterized as animal products.\n\nSeveral diets prohibit the inclusion of some animal products, including\nvegetarian, kosher, and halaal. Other diets, such as veganism and the raw vegan\ndiet, exclude any material of animal origin.<ref>Stepaniak, Joanne. Being Vegan:\nLiving with Conscience, Conviction, and Compassion. McGraw-Hill Professional,\n2000, p. 7.</ref>\n",
