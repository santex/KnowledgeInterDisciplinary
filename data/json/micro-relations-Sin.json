Gundry\n - 1996 \"The other is 'deliberate violation of God's known will\" Sin can\n also be viewed as anything within individuals that violates the ideal\n relationship between them and God. Augustine eventually (after the Pelagian\n controversy) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a\n disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love\n (see Augustine On Grace and Free Will in Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, trans.\n P.Holmes, vol.5, 30-31 [14-15]).\n\nSome crimes are regarded as sins and some sins are regarded as greater than\nothers. In this nuanced concept of sin, sins fall in a spectrum from minor\nerrors to deadly misdeeds. Catholicism regards the least corrupt sins as venial\nsinsâwhich are part of human living and carry little divine consequence.\nConversely, sins of great evil are mortal sinsâwhich bring the dire consequence\nof going to Hell if unrepented for.\n\nSins of careless living are considered destructive and lead to greater sins\naccording to the Seven Deadly Sins. Another concept of sin deals with things\nthat exist on Earth but not in Heaven. Food, for example, while a necessary good\nfor the (health of the temporal) body, is not of (eternal) transcendental living\nand therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin.
