The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family,\nhaving a body length of and a body weight of . Its grayish coat mostly consists\nof dense underfur which insulates against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's\nmost distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial\nmask, which are themes in the mythology of several Native American tribes.\nRaccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are\nable to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years. The diet of the\nomnivorous raccoon, which is usually nocturnal, consists of about 40%\ninvertebrates, 33% plant foods, and 27% vertebrates.\n\nThe original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due\nto their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas,\ncoastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be\npests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th\ncentury, raccoons are now also distributed across the European mainland, the\nCaucasus region and Japan.\n\nThough previously thought to be solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons\nengage in gender-specific social behavior. Related females often share a common\narea, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to\nmaintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and\nother potential invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares (7\nacres) for females in cities to 50 km 2 (20 sq mi) for\nmales in prairies. After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young,\nknown as \"kits\", are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their\nmother until dispersion in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known\nto live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to\n3.1 years. In many areas, hunting and vehicular injury are the two most\ncommon causes of death.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Raccoon","recorded":1372152496,"links":[],"instances":["tribe","eye","sense","biology","enclosure","vision","tooth","organism","food","animal","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animals
