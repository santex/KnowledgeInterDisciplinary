Frequencies at which the response\namplitude is a relative maximum are known as the system's 'resonant\nfrequencies', or 'resonance frequencies'. At these frequencies, even small\nperiodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the\nsystem stores vibrational energy.\n\nResonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy\nbetween two or more different storage modes (such as kinetic energy and\npotential energy in the case of a pendulum). However, there are some losses from\ncycle to cycle, called damping. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is\napproximately equal to the natural frequency of the system, which is a frequency\nof unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant\nfrequencies.\n\nResonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or waves: there is\nmechanical resonance, acoustic resonance, electromagnetic resonance, nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) and resonance of quantum\nwave functions. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a\nspecific frequency (e.g. musical instruments), or pick out specific frequencies\nfrom a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g. filters).\n\nResonance was recognized by Galileo Galilei with his investigations of pendulums\nand musical strings beginning in 1602. {{cite book\n | title = Thus spoke Galileo: the great scientist's ideas and their relevance\n | to the present day author = Andrea Frova and Mariapiera Marenzana publisher =\n | Oxford University Press year = 2006 isbn = 978-0-19-856625-0 pages = 133â137\n | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=1P6fF-\n | bE4CAC&pg=PA133&dq=Galileo+pendulum+resonance#v=onepage&q=Galileo%20pendulum-\n | %20resonance&f=false\n }} {{cite book\n | title = Essays on Galileo and the history and philosophy of science author =\n | Stillman Drake, Noel M.
