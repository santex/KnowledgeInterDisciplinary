{"cursor":"15570","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn chemistry, a 'ketone' () is an organic compound with the structure RC(=O)R',\nwhere R and R' can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents. Ketones\nfeature a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two other carbon atoms. Many\nketones are known and many are of great importance in industry and in biology.\nExamples include many sugars (ketoses) and the industrial solvent acetone.\n","linknr":464,"url":"ketones","recorded":1362565958,"links":63,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functional groups","Organic compounds","Ketones|"],"headings":["Nomenclature and etymology","Structure and properties","Characterization","Synthesis","Reactions","Biochemistry","Applications","Toxicity","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Ketone-group-2D-skeletal.svg/150px-Ketone-group-2D-skeletal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Aceton.svg/150px-Aceton.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Acetone-3D-balls.png/150px-Acetone-3D-balls.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/KetoneVarietyPack.png/600px-KetoneVarietyPack.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Keto_enol_tautomerism.svg/250px-Keto_enol_tautomerism.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury(ii_sulfate"],["derivative","chemistry"]],"members":["derivative"],"related":["Chemistry","Organic_compound","Carbonyl_group","Acetone","IUPAC_nomenclature","Alkane","Acetone","Benzophenone","Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen","IUPAC","Functional_group","Functional_group","Oxaloacetic_acid","Krebs_Cycle","Acetylacetone","Cyclohexanone","Muscone","Tetracycline","Aldehyde","Carbon_skeleton","Functional_group","Carboxylic_acid","Ester","Amide","Polar_molecule","Nucleophilic","Electrophilic","Hydrogen_bond","Alcohol","Carboxylic_acid","Molecular_weight","Benzophenone","Acetophenone","Stereochemistry","Prochiral","Diacetyl","Popcorn","Acetylacetone","Coordination_chemistry","Methyl_vinyl_ketone","Robinson_annulation","Cyclopropanone","Nylon","Isophorone","Muscone","Pheromone","Cyclobutanone","Alpha-hydrogen","Keto-enol_tautomerization","Enol","Alkyne","Acid_dissociation_constant","Enolate_ion","Infrared_spectroscopy","Wavenumber","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","Chemical_shift","Brady's_test","Tollens'_reagent","Fehling's_solution","Iodoform_test","Organic_reaction","Oxidation","Cyclohexanone","Cyclohexane","Cumene_process","Organic_synthesis","Organic_oxidation","Potassium_permanganate","Chromium","Dess-Martin_periodinane","Swern_oxidation","Geminal_halide_hydrolysis","Hydration_reaction","Alkyne","Enol","Mercury(II)_sulfate","Weinreb_ketone_synthesis_","Friedel-Crafts_acylation","Houben-Hoesch_reaction","Fries_rearrangement","Ozonolysis","Alkene","Kornblumâ€“DeLaMare_rearrangement","Ruzicka_cyclization","Dicarboxylic_acid","Nef_reaction","Fukuyama_coupling","Acid_chloride","Organocadmium_compound","Organocopper_compound","Dakin-West_reaction","Nitrile","Carboxylic_anhydride","Reductive_dehalogenation_of_halo_ketones","Ketonic_decarboxylation","Organic_reaction","Nucleophilic_addition","Geminal_diol","Acetylide","Hydroxyalkyne","Ammonia","Primary_amine","Imine","Secondary_amine","Enamine","Grignard_reagent","Organolithium_reagent","Tertiary_alcohol","Alcohol","Alkoxide","Hemiketal","Diol","Ketal","Sodium_amide","Electrophilic_addition","Electrophile","Wittig_reaction","Alkene","Thiol","Thioacetal","Hydrazine","Derivative_(chemistry)","Hydrazone","Metal_hydride","Alcohol","Ketone_reduction","Halogen","Haloketone","Enol","Haloform_reaction","Heavy_water","Deuteration","Norrish_reaction","Oxazoles","Robinson-Gabriel_synthesis","Willgerodt_reaction","Hydroxylamine","Oxime","Photosynthesis","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate","Ketose","Fructose","Hemiketal","Fatty_acid_synthesis","Acetoacetate","Krebs_cycle","Acetone","Beta-hydroxybutyrate","Ketone_bodies","Carbohydrate","Fatty_acid","Amino_acid","Vertebrate","Blood","Urine","Starvation","Hypoglycemia","Hyperinsulinemic_hypoglycemia","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Ketoacidosis","Diabetes_mellitus","Type_1_diabetes","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Acetone","Methylethyl_ketone","Cyclohexanone","Methyl_vinyl_ketone","Thioketone","Ketone_bodies"]}
