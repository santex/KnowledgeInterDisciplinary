{"cursor":"1570","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn electronics, a 'limiter' is a circuit that allows signals below a specified\ninput power to pass unaffected while attenuating the peaks of stronger signals\nthat exceed this input power.\n\nAn FM radio receiver usually has at least one stage of amplification for this\npurpose. It provides a constant level of signal to the FM demodulator stage,\nreducing the effect of signal level changes in the output. If two or more\nsignals are received at the same time, a high performance limiter stage can\ngreatly reduce the effect of the weaker signals on the output. This is commonly\nreferred to as the FM capture effect.\n\nGenerally, FM demodulators are not affected by amplitude variations, since the\nbaseband is contained in the frequency deviations. Some detectors, including the\nRatio Detector, inherently limit gain by a nature of the circuit design. In AM\nradio, the intelligence is located in the amplitude variations, and distortion\ncan occur due to spurious signals that could cause the baseband to be\nmisrepresented.\n\nMastering engineers often use limiting combined with make-up gain to increase\nthe perceived loudness of an audio recording during the audio mastering process.\n\nSee also\n\n* Dynamic range compression\n* Flow limiter\n* Limiting\n* Negative feedback\n* Voltage-controlled amplifier\n","linknr":99,"url":"Limiter","recorded":1362484257,"links":18,"instances":["electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic circuits","Dynamics processing"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["attenuator","electronics"],["detector","radio#ratio_detector"]],"members":["detector","attenuator"],"related":["Electronics","Attenuator_(electronics)","FM_radio","Demodulator","Capture_effect","AM_radio","Mastering_engineer","Loudness","Audio_mastering","Dynamic_range_compression","Flow_limiter","Limiting","Negative_feedback","Voltage-controlled_amplifier"]}
