Of particular use to this application\nof inference are anomalies and symbols. Inference, in this sense, does not draw\nconclusions but opens new paths for inquiry. (See second set of Examples.) In\nthis definition of inference, there are two types of inference: inductive\ninference and deductive inference. Unlike the definition of inference in the\nfirst paragraph above, meaning of word meanings are not tested but meaningful\nrelationships are articulated.\n\nHuman inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied\nwithin the field of cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers\ndevelop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.
