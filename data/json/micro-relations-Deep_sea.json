Little or no light penetrates this part of the ocean and most of the\norganisms that live there rely for subsistence on falling organic matter\nproduced in the photic zone. For this reason scientists once assumed that life\nwould be sparse in the deep ocean but virtually every probe has revealed that,\non the contrary, life is abundant in the deep ocean. From the time\nof Pliny until the expedition in the ship Challenger between 1872 and 1876 to\nprove Pliny wrong; its deep-sea dredges and trawls brought up living things from\nall depths that could be reached. Yet even in the twentieth century scientists\ncontinued to imagine that life at great depth was insubstantial, or somehow\ninconsequential. The eternal dark, the almost inconceivable pressure, and the\nextreme cold that exist below one thousand meters were, they thought, so\nforbidding as to have all but extinguished life. The reverse is in fact\ntrue....(Below 200 meters) lies the largest habitat on earth. Tim Flannery, 'Where Wonders Await Us', New York Review of Books,\nDecember 2007\n\nIn 1960 the Bathyscaphe Trieste descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench\nnear Guam, at 35,798 feet or 6.77 miles (10,911 meters), the deepest spot in\nany ocean. If Mount Everest were submerged there, its peak would be more than a\nmile beneath the surface. At this great depth a small flounder-like fish was\nseen moving away from the bathyscaphe's spotlight. The Trieste was retired and\nfor a while the Japanese remote-operated vehicle (ROV) KaikÅ was the only\nvessel capable of reaching this depth. It was lost at sea in 2003. In May and\nJune 2009, the hybrid-ROV (HROV) [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]\nreturned to the Challenger Deep for a series of three dives to depths exceeding\n10900 meters.\n\nIt has been suggested that more is known about the Moon than the deepest parts\nof the ocean. Until the late 1970s little was known about\nthe extent of life on the deep ocean floor but the discovery of thriving\ncolonies of shrimps and other organisms around hydrothermal vents changed that.\nBefore the discovery of the undersea vents, it had been accepted that almost all\nlife on earth obtained its energy (one way or another) from the sun. The new\ndiscoveries revealed groups of creatures that obtained nutrients and energy\ndirectly from thermal sources and chemical reactions associated with changes to\nmineral deposits. These organisms thrive in completely lightless and anaerobic\nenvironments, in highly saline water that may reach 300 Â°F (150 Â°C), drawing\ntheir sustenance from hydrogen sulfide, which is highly toxic to almost all\nterrestrial life. The revolutionary discovery that life can exist under these\nextreme conditions changed opinions about the chances of there being life\nelsewhere in the universe. Scientists now speculate that Europa, one of\nJupiter's moons, may be able to support life beneath its icy surface, where\nthere is evidence {{cite book |title=Magnetic Fields and\nWater on Europa |month=February |year=2004 |publisher=SETI Institutes Center for\nthe Study of Life in the Universe\n|url=http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_phillips_europa_040226.html\n|id=MagEuropa}} of a global ocean of liquid water.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Deep_sea","recorded":1362582110,"links":33,"instances":["moon","unit"],"pdf":["https://www.nwdc.navy.mil/Documents/NTRP_1-02.pdf","https://www.nwdc.navy.mil/Documents/NTRP_1-02.pdf"],"categories":["Oceanography"],"headings":["Environmental characteristics","Biology","Exploration","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Wfm_pelagic.png/220px-Wfm_pelagic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Photostomias2.jpg/220px-Photostomias2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["europa","moon"],["atmosphere","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"]],"members":["europa","atmosphere"],"related":["United_States_Navy","Ocean","Thermocline","Seabed","Fathom","Photic_zone","Pliny_the_Elder","Challenger_expedition","Habitat","New_York_Review_of_Books","Bathyscaphe_Trieste","Mariana_Trench","Guam","Mount_Everest","Kaikō","Challenger_Deep","Hydrothermal_vent","Hydrogen_sulfide","Europa_(moon)","Jupiter","SETI_Institutes_Center_for_the_Study_of_Life_in_the_Universe","Mesopelagic","Photosynthesis","Plants","Autotroph","Photic_zone","Pressure","Atmosphere_(unit)","Metazoan","Salinity","Homogeneous","Epipelagic_zone","Isothermal","Pelagic_zone","Primary_production","Aphotic_zone","Marine_snow","Glycosaminoglycan","Squid","Ammonium_chloride","Metabolism","Muscle","Skeleton","Hermaphrodite","Rod_cell","Prey_fish","Predation","Camouflage","Bioluminescence","Photophore","Night_vision","Retroreflector","Retina","Flashlight_fish","Photophore","Tapetum_lucidum","Tapetum_lucidum","Whale_fall","Scavengers","Marine_bacteriophage","Hydrothermal_vents","Chemosynthesis","Ecosystems","Sunlight","Remotely_operated_vehicle","Atmosphere_(unit)","Deep_sea_fish","Deep_ocean_water","Submarine_landslide","The_Blue_Planet"]}
