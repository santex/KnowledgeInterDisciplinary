{"cursor":"22363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":": \"Burning\" redirects here. For combustion without external ignition, see\n: [[spontaneous combustion]]. For the vehicle engine, see [[internal combustion\n: engine]]. For other uses, see [[Burning (disambiguation)]] and [[Combustion\n: (disambiguation)]].\ns caused as a result of a fuel undergoing combustion (burning)]] 'Combustion' ()\nor 'burning' is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and\nan oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical\nspecies. The release of heat can produce light in the form of either glowing or\na flame. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially\nhydrocarbons) in the gas, liquid or solid phase.\n\nIn a complete combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing element,\nsuch as oxygen or fluorine, and the products are compounds of each element in\nthe fuel with the oxidizing element. For example:\n\n:{{chem + 2 {{chem â {{chem + 2 H 2O + energy\n\nA simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, which is\na commonly used reaction in rocket engines:\n\n:2 {{chem + {{chem â 2 H 2O(g) + heat\nThe result is water vapor.\n\nComplete combustion is almost impossible to achieve. In reality, as actual\ncombustion reactions come to equilibrium, a wide variety of major and minor\nspecies will be present such as carbon monoxide and pure carbon (soot or ash).\nAdditionally, any combustion in atmospheric air, which is 78 percent nitrogen,\nwill also create several forms of nitrogen oxides.\n","linknr":444,"url":"Combustion_gas","recorded":1362508719,"links":74,"instances":["physics","rocket","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Combustion|"],"headings":["Types","Chemical
