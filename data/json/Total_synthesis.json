{"cursor":"5061","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In organic chemistry, a 'total synthesis' is, in principle, the complete\nchemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler pieces, usually\nwithout the aid of biological processes. In\npractice, these simpler pieces are commercially available in bulk and semi-bulk\nquantities, and are often petrochemical precursors. Sometimes bulk natural\nproducts (e.g. sugars) are used as starting materials and it is assumed that\nthese have or can be synthesised from their constituent elements. The target\nmolecules can be natural products (biomolecules), medicinally important active\ningredients, or organic compounds of theoretical interest in chemistry or\nbiology. A new route for synthesis is developed in the course of the\ninvestigation, and the route may be the first one to be developed for the\nsubstance.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Total_synthesis","recorded":1362371731,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.scripps.edu/chem/nicolaou/images/pdfs/MS456.pdf","http://www.scripps.edu/chem/nicolaou/images/pdfs/MS456.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical synthesis","Total synthesis"],"headings":["History","Formal synthesis","Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Chemical_synthesis","Organic_compound","Molecule","Petrochemical","Biomolecules","Friedrich_WÃ¶hler","Urea","Gustaf_Komppa","Camphor","Vital_force","Stereochemistry","Cholesterol_total_synthesis","Cortisone","Strychnine_total_synthesis","Lysergic_acid","Reserpine","Chlorophyll","Colchicine","Vitamin_B12_total_synthesis","Prostaglandin","Nobel_Prize","Robert_Burns_Woodward","Quinine_total_synthesis","Elias_James_Corey","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Retrosynthetic_analysis","Aflatoxin_total_synthesis","Oseltamivir_total_synthesis"]}
