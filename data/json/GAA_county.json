{"cursor":"4359","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (yellow), All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (blue), or both (green);\n however almost all counties contest both the National Football League and the\n National Hurling League]]\n\nA 'Gaelic Athletic Association county' is a geographic region within the Gaelic\nAthletic Association (GAA), controlled by a 'county board' and originally based\non the 32 counties of Ireland as they were in 1884. While the administrative\ngeography of Ireland has since changed, with several new counties created and\nthe six that make up Northern Ireland superseded by 26 local government\ndistricts, the GAA counties have remained largely unchanged.\n\nHowever, the GAA county does not always and everywhere cover precisely the same\nterritory as the traditional county. Particularly in the first 50 years of the\nAssociation but also in more recent times, there are many examples of clubs\nbased in one of the administrative counties being allowed to participate in the\nleagues or championships of a neighbouring county. There are also instances\nwhere the official county boundary does not coincide precisely with the GAA\ncounty, for example where a club is based on a parish that crosses the county\nborder. While in most cases the name of the GAA county is the same as that of\nthe current or former administrative county, there have been exceptions: Derry\nhas never used the official county name of Londonderry, and the Board of the\ncounty then officially known as Queen's County changed its name in 1907 to Leix\nand Ossary, later becoming Laois. Each county board is responsible for\norganising GAA club fixtures within the county, and for the promotion and\ndevelopment of Gaelic games and the other objectives of the Association.\n\nThe GAA county can also refer to the inter-county teams fielded by each county\nboard. While in general any GAA county, and only a county, is eligible to\ncompete in the provincial and national championships and leagues, and almost all\ndo so, again there can be anomalies: in the National Hurling League, for\nexample, a team representing Fingal - a sub-region of the GAA county of Dublin,\ncorresponding to the modern administrative county of Fingal - competes against\nGAA counties.\n\nSince the inception of the county system, there have been changes to the\nrespective regions of control of the overseas units. In Ireland the concept of\nthe county is very strong and changing the county boundary is extremely\ncontroversial. In 2002 a proposal to divide Dublin in two was quickly and\nstrongly opposed.\n","linknr":212,"url":"GAA_county","recorded":1375073811,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=GAA_county&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gaelic_Games_County_Map.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Gaelic_Games_County_Map.svg/150px-Gaelic_Games_County_Map.svg.png","/wiki/File:Gaelic_Games_County_Map.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship","/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship","/wiki/National_Football_League_(Ireland)","/wiki/National_Hurling_League","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Derry_GAA","/wiki/County_Londonderry","/wiki/Queen%27s_County","/wiki/Laois_GAA","/wiki/Gaelic_games","/wiki/Inter_county","/wiki/National_Hurling_League","/wiki/Fingal_hurling_team","/wiki/Fingal","/wiki/Dublin_GAA","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Scotland_GAA","/wiki/British_GAA","/wiki/Hertfordshire_GAA","/wiki/Gloucestershire_GAA","/wiki/Warwickshire_GAA","/wiki/Australasia_GAA","/wiki/Canadian_GAA","/wiki/North_American_GAA","/wiki/Europe_GAA","/wiki/Asian_GAA","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Gaelic_games_county_colours","/wiki/List_of_GAA_county_nicknames","/w/index.php?title=Gaelic_Athletic_Association_county&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/1785651.stm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/overseas/Overseas_Booklet_100110233815.pdf","/wiki/Template:GAA_bodies","/wiki/Template_talk:GAA_bodies","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:GAA_bodies&action=edit","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/GAA_Provincial_council","/wiki/Connacht_GAA","/wiki/Leinster_GAA","/wiki/Munster_GAA","/wiki/Ulster_GAA","/wiki/British_GAA","/wiki/Connacht_GAA","/wiki/Galway_GAA","/wiki/Leitrim_GAA","/wiki/Mayo_GAA","/wiki/Roscommon_GAA","/wiki/Sligo_GAA","/wiki/Leinster_GAA","/wiki/Carlow_GAA","/wiki/Dublin_GAA","/wiki/Kildare_GAA","/wiki/Kilkenny_GAA","/wiki/Laois_GAA","/wiki/Longford_GAA","/wiki/Louth_GAA","/wiki/Meath_GAA","/wiki/Offaly_GAA","/wiki/Westmeath_GAA","/wiki/Wexford_GAA","/wiki/Wicklow_GAA","/wiki/Munster_GAA","/wiki/Clare_GAA","/wiki/Cork_GAA","/wiki/Kerry_GAA","/wiki/Limerick_GAA","/wiki/Tipperary_GAA","/wiki/Waterford_GAA","/wiki/Ulster_GAA","/wiki/Antrim_GAA","/wiki/Armagh_GAA","/wiki/Cavan_GAA","/wiki/Derry_GAA","/wiki/Donegal_GAA","/wiki/Down_GAA","/wiki/Fermanagh_GAA","/wiki/Monaghan_GAA","/wiki/Tyrone_GAA","/wiki/British_GAA","/wiki/Gloucestershire_GAA","/wiki/Hertfordshire_GAA","/wiki/Lancashire_GAA","/wiki/London_GAA","/wiki/Scotland_GAA","/wiki/Warwickshire_GAA","/wiki/Yorkshire_GAA","/wiki/Asian_GAA","/wiki/Australasia_GAA","/wiki/Canadian_GAA","/wiki/Europe_GAA","/wiki/New_York_GAA","/wiki/North_American_GAA","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_Congress","/wiki/F%C3%A9ile_na_nGael","/wiki/Higher_Education_GAA","/wiki/Games_Administration_Committee","/wiki/Sc%C3%B3r","/wiki/GAA_Handball","/wiki/Camogie_Association","/wiki/Ladies%27_Gaelic_Football_Association","/wiki/Irish_Collegiate_Handball_Association","/wiki/Structure_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Template:Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Template_talk:Gaelic_Athletic_Association","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Gaelic_Athletic_Association&action=edit","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Glossary_of_Gaelic_games_terms","/wiki/Hayes%27_Hotel","/wiki/Croke_Park","/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_Congress","/wiki/President_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/History_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/Rule_21","/wiki/Rule_42","/wiki/GAA_125","/wiki/Category:Gaelic_games-related_lists","/wiki/List_of_non-Gaelic_games_played_in_Croke_Park","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association","/wiki/List_of_Gaelic_Athletic_Association_stadiums","/
