Funding is\nprovided by voluntary donations by EU member states. The EDF is\nsubject to its own financial rules and procedures, and is managed by the\nEuropean Commission (EC) and the European Investment Bank.\n\nArticles 131 and 136 of the 1957 Treaty of Rome provided for its creation with a\nview to granting technical and financial assistance to African countries that\nwere still colonised at that time and with which certain countries had\nhistorical links.\n\nUsually lasting 6 years, each EDF lays out EU assistance to both individual\ncountries and regions as a whole. The EU is currently on its 10th EDF from 2008-\n2013 with a budget of â¬22.7 billion. Mikaela Gavas 2010.

This one-year extension compared to the 10th EDF\nallows the end of the 11th EDF to coincide with the expiration of the Cotonou\nPartnership Agreement in 2020 and the EU budget period.

Maastricht: European Centre for Development Policy\nManagement (ECDPM) The EDF has to date been funded outside the EU budget\nby the EU Member States on the basis of financial payments related to specific\ncontribution shares, or âkeysâ. The Member State contributions keys are subject\nto negotiation. The EDF is currently the only EU policy instrument that is\nfinanced through a specific key that is different from the EU budget key, and\nwhich reflects the comparative interests of individual Member States.\n\nThere is currently a debate on whether to 'budgetise' the EDF.\nHowever, in the Communication âA budget for Europe 2020â, the European\nCommission underlined that it was not appropriate at present time to propose\nthat the EDF be integrated into the EU budget. The perceived\nadvantages include :\n* contributions would be based on GNI and this may increase the currently\n  voluntary contributions\n* the harmonisation of EU budget and EDF administration might decrease\n  administration costs and increase effectiveness of the aid\n* 20% of aid to the ACP countries already originates from the EU budget\n* an all-ACP geographic strategy is no longer relevant as programmes are more\n  localised to regions or country-level\n* there would be increase democratic control and parliamentary scrutiny The\n  perceived disadvantages are that :\n* 90% of EDF resources reach low-income countries as opposed to less than 40% of\n  aid from the EU budget development instruments\n* a loss of aid predictability and aid quality as the EU budget is annual,\n  unlike the 6-year budget of the EDF\n\nIn 2005, the EU and its Member States agreed to achieve a collective level of\nODA of 0.7% of GNI by 2015 and an interim target of 0.56% by 2010, with\ndifferentiated intermediate targets for those EU Member States which had\nrecently joined the Union. On the 23rd of May 2011, EU ministers responsible for\ndevelopment cooperation gathered to take stock of progress made and concluded\nthat additional efforts would be needed to close an estimated gap of â¬50 billion\nto reach the self-imposed collective EU target of 0.7% by 2015.\n","linknr":347,"url":"European_Development_Fund","recorded":1362477556,"links":32,"instances":["ecdpm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["European Commission projects"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/European_stars.svg/110px-European_stars.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Eurozone.svg/100px-Eurozone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/EP_Groups_1979-2009.png/100px-EP_Groups_1979-2009.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/EP-constituencies.svg/100px-EP-constituencies.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/22px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/European_flag_outside_the_Commission.jpg/100px-European_flag_outside_the_Commission.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/30px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["european_centre_for_development_policy_management","ecdpm"],["the_courier","acp-eu"]],"members":["the_courier","european_centre_for_development_policy_management"],"related":["European_Union","Africa","Caribbean","Pacific","African,_Caribbean_and_Pacific_Group_of_States","Special_member_state_territories_and_their_relations_with_the_European_Union","Treaty_of_Rome","Overseas_Development_Institute","European_Centre_for_Development_Policy_Management_(ECDPM)","GNI","Development_Cooperation_Instrument","ACP-EU_Development_Cooperation","ACP-EU_Joint_Parliamentary_Assembly","EuropeAid_Co-Operation_Office","The_Courier_(ACP-EU)"]}
