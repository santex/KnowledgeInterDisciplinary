An\nAlphavirus of the family Togaviridae, the WEE virus is an arbovirus (arthropod-\nborne virus) transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera [[Culex]] and\n[[Culiseta]]. WEE is a recombinant virus between two\nother closely related yet distinct encephalitis viruses. There have been under\n700 confirmed cases in the U.S. since 1964.\n\n\n\nIn the U.S. WEE is seen primarily in states west of the Mississippi River. The\ndisease is also seen in countries of South America. WEE is commonly a\nsubclinical infection; symptomatic infections are uncommon. However, the disease\ncan cause serious sequelae in infants and children. Unlike Eastern equine\nencephalitis, the overall mortality of WEE is low (approximately 4%) and is\nassociated mostly with infection in the elderly. There is no vaccine for WEE and\nthere are no licensed therapeutic drugs in the U.S. for this infection.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Western_equine_encephalitis_virus","recorded":1362501606,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Viral infections of the central nervous system","Animal virology","Biological weapons","Viral encephalitis","Horse diseases"],"headings":["Use as a biological weapon","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Alphavirus","Togaviridae","Arbovirus","Mosquitoes","Recombinant_virus","Encephalitis","Mississippi_River","South_America","Eastern_equine_encephalitis","Middlebury_College","Eastern_equine_encephalitis_virus"]}
