(See:\n\"[http://www.slate.com/id/2128630/ Big Ben]\", Slate, October 24, 2005; see also\nhttp://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/nominations/106.html) (,\n; See [http://inogolo.com/query.php?qstr=Ben+Bernanke&search=Search+Names\nInogolo: pronunciation of Ben Bernanke]. born December 13, 1953) is an\nAmerican economist and currently chairman of the Federal Reserve, the central\nbank of the United States. During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke has overseen\nthe Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis. Before\nbecoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton\nUniversity and chaired the department of economics there from 1996 to September\n2002, when he went on public service leave. From 2002 until 2005, he was a\nmember of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the\nBernanke Doctrine, and first discussed \"the Great Moderation\"âthe theory that\ntraditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades\nthrough structural changes that have occurred in the international economy,\nparticularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations,\ndiminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.\n\nBernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of\nEconomic Advisers before President Bush appointed him on February 1, 2006, to be\nchairman of the United States Federal Reserve. Bernanke was confirmed for a\nsecond term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being re-nominated by\nPresident Barack Obama.\n","linknr":889,"url":"Ben_Bernanke","recorded":1362668574,"links":72,"instances":["attraction","economist","united_states","united_states","executive","united_states"],"pdf":["http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/29839/1/05915220.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110604212307/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/29839/1/05915220.pdf","http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/29839/1/05915220.pdf","http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/apr/pdfs/BofAmergLetter.pdf","http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/apr/pdfs/BofAmergLetter.pdf","http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100407a.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110725002054/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf"],"categories":["1953
