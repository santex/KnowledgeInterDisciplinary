Sometimes, sounds may be elided for euphonic effect.\n\nIn Native English, elision comes naturally, and it is often described as\n\"slurred\" or \"muted.\" Often, elision is deliberate. It is a common misconception\nthat contractions automatically qualify as elided words, which comes from slack\ndefinitions. Not all elided words are contractions and not all contractions are\nelided words (for example, 'going to' -> 'gonna': an elision that is not a\ncontraction; 'can not' -> 'cannot': a contraction that is not an elision).\n\nIn French, elision is mandatory in certain contexts, as in the clause [[List of\nFrench words and phrases used by English speakers#C|C'est la vie]] (elided from\n*Ãa est la vie / *Ce est la vie).\n\nIn Spanish, elision occurs less frequently but is common in certain dialects. Of\nparticular interest is the word para, which becomes pa'. Multiple words can be\nelided together, as in pa'trabajar for para trabajar and pa'delante or even\npa'lante for para adelante.\n\nAn example of deliberate elision occurs in Latin poetry as a stylistic device.\nUnder certain circumstances, such as one word ending in a vowel and the\nfollowing word beginning in a vowel, the words may be elided together. Elision\nwas a common device in the works of Catullus. For example, the opening line of\nCatullus 3 is: Lugete, O Veneres Cupidinesque, but would be read as Luget'o'\nVeneres Cupidinesque.\n\nA synonym for elision is [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], though the latter term\nis most often associated with the elision of vowels between consonants (e.g.,\nLatin tabula â Spanish tabla). Another form of elision is [[Apheresis\n(linguistics)|apheresis]], which means elision at the beginning of a word\n(generally of an unstressed vowel).\n\nSome morphemes take the form of elision. See disfix.\n\nThe opposite of elision is epenthesis, whereby sounds are inserted into a word\nto ease pronunciation.\n\nA special form of elision called ecthlipsis is used in Latin poetry when a word\nending in the letter \"m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, e.g.,\n\"...et mutam nequiquam adloquerer cinerem.\" = \"...et mutam nequiquadloquerer\ncinerem.\" - Catullus 101.\n\nThe omission of a word from a phrase or sentence is not elision but ellipsis or,\nmore accurately, elliptical construction.\n","linknr":485,"url":"Elision","recorded":1362897208,"links":38,"instances":["french","poetry","linguistics","linguist","linguistics","phonology","linguistics","phonetics","grammar"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Figures of speech","Phonology","Poetic devices","Prosody (linguistics)"],"headings":["Written representation","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["slur","phonology"],["contraction","grammar"],["contraction","grammar#french"],["elision","french"],["0","number"],["syncope","phonetics"],["hiatus","linguistics"],["dactyl","poetry"],["contraction","grammar"],["liaison","linguistics"],["elision","french"],["lacuna","linguistics"],["terry_crowley","linguist"]],"members":["elision","dactyl","lacuna","terry_crowley","hiatus","slur","liaison","syncope","contraction"],"related":["Vowel","Consonant","Syllable","Euphony","Slur_(phonology)","Contraction_(grammar)","Stylistic_device","Catullus","Synonym","Morpheme","Disfix","Epenthesis","Ellipsis","Elliptical_construction","Poetry","Theatre","Eye_dialect","Latin_alphabet","Apostrophe","John_Steinbeck","Apostrophe","Elision_(French)","Vowel","Compensatory_lengthening","Schwa","Icelandic_language","Japanese_language","Basilect","Dialects_of_Japanese_language","Kagoshima_dialect","Dinar","People","Cousin","Coolness","Stupidity","Whore","Afro","Motherfucker","MoFo","Yoghurt","Curd","Love","Stone","Peach","Token","Autumn","Sugar","Coffee","Vegetable","Kilogram","Magazine","Stock","Stack","Refrigerator","Sex","Logarithm","Queer","Indus","Sind","Amazon","Coffee","0_(number)","Piano","Latin","Romance_language","Syncope_(phonetics)","Spanish_language","Dissimilation","Lenition","Epenthesis","Crasis","Hiatus_(linguistics)","Andalusian_Spanish","Flamenco","Hypercorrection","Stockfish","Real_Academia_Española","Tamil_language","Phoneme","Partitive_case","Paragoge","Euphony","Dactyl_(poetry)","Apocope","Sandhi","Synalepha","Relaxed_pronunciation","Contraction_(grammar)","Crasis","Liaison_(linguistics)","Elision_(French)","Lacuna_(linguistics)","Terry_Crowley_(linguist)"]}
