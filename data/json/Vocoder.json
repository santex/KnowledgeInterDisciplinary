{"cursor":"27515","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/Elo_blue_sky.ogg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Vocoder_demo.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'vocoder' (, short for voice encoder) is an analysis/synthesis system, used to\nreproduce human speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband\nfilter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control\nsignals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder\napplies these (amplitude) control signals to corresponding filters in the\nsynthesizer. Since the control signals change only slowly compared to the\noriginal speech waveform, the bandwidth required to transmit speech can be\nreduced. This allows more speech channels to share a radio circuit or submarine\ncable. By encoding the control signals, voice transmission can be secured\nagainst interception.\n\nThe vocoder was originally developed as a speech coder for telecommunications\napplications in the 1930s, the idea being to code speech for transmission.\nTransmitting the parameters of a speech model instead of a digitized\nrepresentation of the speech waveform saves bandwidth in the communication\nchannel; the parameters of the model change relatively slowly, compared to the\nchanges in the speech waveform that they describe. Its primary use in this\nfashion is for secure radio communication, where voice has to be encrypted and\nthen transmitted. The advantage of this method of \"encryption\" is that no\n\"signal\" is sent, but rather envelopes of the bandpass filters. The receiving\nunit needs to be set up in the same channel configuration to resynthesize a\nversion of the original signal spectrum. The vocoder as both hardware and\nsoftware has also been used extensively as an electronic musical instrument.\n\nWhereas the vocoder analyzes speech, transforms it into electronically\ntransmitted information, and recreates it, '[[The Voder]]' (from Voice Operating\nDemonstrator) generates synthesized speech by means of a console with fifteen\ntouch-sensitive keys and a pedal, basically consisting of the \"second half\" of\nthe vocoder, but with manual filter controls, needing a highly trained\noperator.\n|right|thumb]]\n","linknr":441,"url":"Vocoder","recorded":1362477711,"links":39,"instances":["1978","signal_processing","band","electronics","engineer","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Audio
