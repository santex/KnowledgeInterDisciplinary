{"cursor":"85377","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Rastafari movement', or 'Rasta', is a spiritual movement that arose in the\n1930s in Jamaica. Its adherents worship Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia\n(ruled 1930â1974), some as Jesus incarnate, the Second Advent, or the\nreincarnation of Jesus, others as God the Father. Members of the Rastafari\nmovement are known as Rastas, or Rastafari. The movement is sometimes referred\nto as \"Rastafarianism\", but this term is considered derogatory and offensive by\nsome Rastas, who, being highly critical of \"isms\" (which they see as a typical\npart of \"Babylon culture\"), dislike being labelled as an \"ism\"\nthemselves. Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions p. 263 by\nStephen D. Glazier, 2001\n\nThe name Rastafari is taken from Ras Tafari, the pre-regnal title of Haile\nSelassie I, composed of Amharic Ras (literally \"Head\", an Ethiopian title\nequivalent to Duke), and Haile Selassie's pre-regnal given name, Tafari.\nRastafari are generally distinguished for asserting the doctrine that Haile\nSelassie I, the former and final Emperor of Ethiopia, is another incarnation of\nthe Christian God, called Jah. Jah the Rasta name for God incarnate, from a\nshortened form of [[Jehovah]] found in in the King James Version of the\nBible Most see Haile Selassie I as Jah or Jah Rastafari, who is the second\ncoming of Jesus Christ onto the earth, but to others he is simply God's chosen\nking on earth.\n\nMany elements of Rastafari reflect its origins in Jamaica, a country with a\npredominantly Christian culture where 98% of the people were the black African\ndescendants of slaves. The Rastafari\nmovement encompasses themes such as the spiritual use of cannabis Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN 0-435-98650-\n3 The Ganja Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana by Ansley Hamid\n(2002) and the rejection of western society, called Babylon (from the\nmetaphorical Babylon of the Christian New Testament). It proclaims Africa (also\n\"Zion\") as the original birthplace of mankind, and from the beginning of the\nmovement the call to repatriation to Africa for the descendants of those slaves\nforced into exile in the West by the Atlantic slave trade has been a central\ntheme. Rasta also embraces various Afrocentric and Pan-African social\nand political aspirations, such as\nthe sociopolitical views and teachings of Jamaican publicist, organizer, and\nblack nationalist Marcus Garvey (also often regarded as a prophet). Another\ntheme is Royalty, with Rastas seeing themselves as African royalty and using\nhonorifics such as Prince or King in order to give royalty to their names.\n\nRastafari is not a highly organized religion; it is a movement and an ideology.\nMany Rastas say that it is not a \"religion\" at all, but a \"Way of\nLife\". Many Rastas do not claim any sect or denomination, and thus\nencourage one another to find faith and inspiration within themselves, although\nsome do identify strongly with one of the \"mansions of Rastafari\" â the\nthree most prominent of these being the Nyahbinghi, the Bobo Ashanti and the\nTwelve Tribes of Israel.\n\nToday, awareness of the Rastafari movement has spread throughout much of the\nworld, largely through interest generated by reggae music, especially the major\ninternational success of Jamaican singer/songwriter Bob Marley (1945â1981). By\n1997, there were, according to one estimate, around one million Rastafari\nfaithful worldwide. Chanting Down Babylon p. 1 In the 2001 Jamaican\ncensus, 24,020 individuals (less than 1 percent of the population) identified\nthemselves as Rastafarians. Other sources have\nestimated that in the 2000s they formed \"about 5 percent of the population\" of\nJamaica, Reuters AlertNet (Reuters Foundation):[http://www.alertnet.org/the-\nfacts/countryprofiles/216645.htm?v=details Jamaica] (citing \"NI World Guide\n2003/2004\"); The world guide: a view from the south, New Internationalist\nPublications, 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=1ETNTK_bCtTNjAevpqzXBw&ct-\n=result&id=qertAAAAMAAJ&q=rastafarians+per+cent#search_anchor p. 312]\n(\"Rastafarians 5 per cent\") or have conjectured that \"there are perhaps as\nmany as 100,000 Rastafarians in Jamaica\".
