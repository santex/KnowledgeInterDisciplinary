{"cursor":"36714","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'United States House of Representatives Page Program' was a program run by the\nUnited States House of Representatives, under the office of the Clerk of the\nHouse, in which appointed high school juniors acted as non-partisan federal\nemployees in the House of Representatives, providing supplemental administrative\nsupport to House operations in a variety of capacities in Washington, D.C. at\nthe United States Capitol. Pages reported to \"Chief Pages\", commonly\nreferred to as work bosses (or \"House Page Work Supervisors\") on the Democratic\nand Republican sides of the House of Representatives Floor. As was the practice\nin Middle Ages, pages were used as a messaging service for the four main House\nOffice Buildings (Rayburn, Longworth, Cannon, and Ford) as well as inside of the\nCapitol. Other Page responsibilities included: taking statements from members of\ncongress after speeches (for the Congressional Record), printing and delivering\nvote reports to various offices, tending members' personal needs while on the\nfloor of the House, managing phones in the cloakrooms, and ringing the bells for\nvotes. Pages were nominated by representatives based upon a highly competitive\napplication process. Congressional Pages had served within the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives for almost 180 years.\n\nOn August 8, 2011, Speaker of the House John Boehner and House Minority Leader\nNancy Pelosi announced that the House Page program would end due to costs and\nthe technological advancements that have rendered the program no longer\nessential.
