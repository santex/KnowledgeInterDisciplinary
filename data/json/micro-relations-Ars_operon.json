It is required for the detoxification of arsenate, arsenite,\nand antimonite. This system transports arsenite\nand antimonite out of the cell. The pump is composed of two polypeptides, the\nproducts of the arsA and arsB genes. This two-subunit enzyme produces resistance\nto arsenite and antimonite. Arsenate, however, must first be reduced to arsenite\nbefore it is extruded. A third gene, arsC, expands the substrate specificity to\nallow for arsenate pumping and resistance. ArsC is an approximately 150-residue\narsenate reductase that uses reduced glutathione (GSH) to convert arsenate to\narsenite with a redox active cysteine residue in the active site. ArsC forms an\nactive quaternary complex with GSH, arsenate, and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1). The\nthree ligands must be present simultaneously for reduction to occur.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Ars_operon","recorded":1362510027,"links":11,"instances":["medicine","chemistry","chemistry","biology","chemistry","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein families"],"headings":["ArsA and ArsB","ArsC","ArsD and ArsR","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/PDB_1rw1_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1rw1_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["residue","chemistry"],["residue","chemistry"],["homology","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["stress","medicine"],["vicinal","chemistry"],["dissociation","chemistry"]],"members":["stress","residue","vicinal","homology","dissociation","transcription","cell"],"related":["Operon","Bacteria","Detoxification","Cell_(biology)","Genes","Enzyme","Redox","Enzyme_substrate","Reductase","Redox","Glutathione","Redox","Cysteine","Residue_(chemistry)","Active_site","Protein_complex","Glutaredoxin","Ligands","Redox","Protein","Hydrophobic","Secondary_structure","Thioredoxin","Protein_folding","Beta-sheet","Alpha_helix","Residue_(chemistry)","Conserved_sequence","Homology_(biology)","Protein","Gram-positive","Bacterial","Transcription_factor","Transcriptional_regulation","Transcription_(genetics)","Gene","Stress_(medicine)","Vicinal_(chemistry)","Cysteine","Binding_site","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Homodimer","Base_pair","Bacteria","Operon","Trans-acting","Repressor","Protein"]}
