Nguyen, D.T., Orgill D.P., Murphy G.F. (2009). [h-\nttp://cs5937.userapi.com/u11728334/docs/ea74e26d38fa/D_Orgill_Biomaterials_for_-\nTreating_Skin_Loss.pdf#page=39 Chapter 4: The Pathophysiologic Basis for Wound\nHealing and Cutaneous Regeneration]. Biomaterials For Treating Skin Loss.\nWoodhead Publishing (UK/Europe) & CRC Press (US), Cambridge/Boca Raton, p. 25-\n57. (ISBN 978-1-4200-9989-9/ISBN 978-1-84569-363-3) In normal skin, the\nepidermis (outermost layer) and dermis (inner or deeper layer) exists in a steady-\nstate equilibrium, forming a protective barrier against the external\nenvironment. Once the protective barrier is broken, the normal (physiologic)\nprocess of wound healing is immediately set in motion. The classic model of\nwound healing is divided into three or four sequential, yet overlapping, phases: (1) hemostasis (not considered a phase by some\nauthors), (2) inflammatory, (3) proliferative and (4) remodeling. Quinn, J.V. (1998). Tissue Adhesives in Wound Care. Hamilton, Ont.\nB.C. Decker, Inc. Electronic book. Upon injury to the skin, a set of\ncomplex biochemical events takes place in a closely orchestrated cascade to\nrepair the damage. Within minutes post-injury,\nplatelets (thrombocytes) aggregate at the injury site to form a fibrin clot.\nThis clot acts to control active bleeding (hemostasis). The speed of wound\nhealing can be impacted by many factors, including the bloodstream levels of\nhormones such as oxytocin.\n\nIn the inflammatory phase, bacteria and debris are phagocytosed and removed, and\nfactors are released that cause the migration and division of cells involved in\nthe proliferative phase.\n\nThe proliferative phase is characterized by angiogenesis, collagen deposition,\ngranulation tissue formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction. In angiogenesis, new blood vessels are formed by vascular\nendothelial cells. In fibroplasia and granulation tissue\nformation, fibroblasts grow and form a new, provisional extracellular matrix\n(ECM) by excreting collagen and fibronectin. Concurrently,\nre-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which epithelial cells\nproliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new\ntissue. Garg, H.G. (2000). Scarless Wound Healing. New York\nMarcel Dekker, Inc. Electronic book.\n\nIn contraction, the wound is made smaller by the action of myofibroblasts, which\nestablish a grip on the wound edges and contract themselves using a mechanism\nsimilar to that in smooth muscle cells. When the cells' roles are close to\ncomplete, unneeded cells undergo apoptosis.\n\nIn the maturation and remodeling phase, collagen is remodeled and realigned\nalong tension lines and cells that are no longer needed are removed by\napoptosis.\n\nHowever, this process is not only complex but fragile, and susceptible to\ninterruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds.\nFactors which may contribute to this include diabetes, venous or arterial\ndisease, old age, and infection.

(2004).\nCellular, molecular and biochemical differences in the pathophysiology of\nhealing between acute wounds, chronic wounds and wounds in the elderly.\nWorldwidewounds.com.\n\n. with faded
