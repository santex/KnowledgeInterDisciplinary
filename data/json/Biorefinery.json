A biorefinery could, for example, produce\none or several low-volume, but high-value, chemical or nutraceutical products\nand a low-value, but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as biodiesel or\nbioethanol (see also alcohol fuel).

At the same time\ngenerating electricity and process heat, through combined heat and power (CHP)\ntechnology, for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the\nlocal utility. The high-value products increase profitability, the high-volume\nfuel helps meet energy needs, and the power production helps to lower energy\ncosts and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traditional power plant\nfacilities. Although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries,\nthe bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized. Future biorefineries may play a\nmajor role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced\nfrom petroleum.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Biorefinery","recorded":1362500123,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.cpbis.gatech.edu/research/findings/AdaptableBiorefineryMFarmerTAPPI2005.pdf","http://www.wisbiorefine.org/proc/apr.pdf"],"categories":["Biofuels","Sustainable technologies","Oil refineries"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sugarcane_field.jpg/120px-Sugarcane_field.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biomass","Petroleum_refinery","Petroleum","International_Energy_Agency","Nutraceutical","Biodiesel","Bioethanol","Alcohol_fuel","National_Non-Food_Crops_Centre","Combined_heat_and_power","Greenhouse_gas","Petroleum","Blue_Marble_Energy","Tobacco","Flax","Straw","Bioethanol","Chemrec","Black_liquor","Gasification","Second_generation_biofuels","Biomethanol","Dimethyl_ether","Pulp_mill","Sulfate_process","Sulfite_process","Biofuels","Biomass","Bioplastic","Carbon_neutrality","Combined_heat_and_power","Gasification","Renewable_energy_commercialization"]}
