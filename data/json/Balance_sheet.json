{"cursor":"17358","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn financial accounting, a 'balance sheet' or 'statement of financial position'\nis a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship, a business\npartnership, a corporation or other business organization, such as an LLC or an\nLLP. Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date,\nsuch as the end of its financial year. A balance sheet is often described as a\n\"snapshot of a company's financial condition\". Of the four basic\nfinancial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a\nsingle point in time of a business' calendar year.\n\nA standard company balance sheet has three parts: assets, liabilities and\nownership equity. The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and\ntypically in order of liquidity. Assets are followed by the\nliabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as\nequity or the net assets or the net worth or 'capital' of the company and\naccording to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus\nliabilities. Williams, p.50\n\nAnother way to look at the same equation is that assets equals liabilities plus\nowner's equity. Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were\nfinanced: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money\n(owner's equity). Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one\nsection and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections\n\"balancing.\"\n\nA business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the\nentire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand. However,\nmany businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and\nthey acquire buildings and equipment. In other words: businesses have assets and\nso they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the\nend of each period. Often, these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax\nauthorities, and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and\nprofits at the end of each period. In other words businesses also have\nliabilities.\n","linknr":407,"url":"Balance_sheet","recorded":1362669039,"links":64,"instances":["behavior","accounting","finance","business","accounting","finance","finance","accounting","accounting"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080307003615/http://www.state.co.us/oed/sbdc/business/pbs.pdf","http://www.state.co.us/oed/sbdc/business/pbs.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080307003615/http://www.state.co.us/oed/sbdc/business/pbs.pdf","http://www.comptroller.state.al.us/pdfs/ChartofAccts/bacc.pdf"],"categories":["Financial statements","Accounting terminology"],"headings":["Types","Public Business Entities balance sheet structure","Balance sheet substantiation","Sample balance sheet","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["liability","financial_accounting"],["liability","financial_accounting"],["liability","accounting"],["provision","accounting"],["reserve","accounting"],["share","finance"],["option","finance"],["transparency","behavior"],["goodwill","accounting"],["consolidation","business"],["consolidation","business"],["goodwill","accounting"],["provision","accounting"],["security","finance"],["provision","accounting"]],"members":["transparency","provision","share","consolidation","reserve","security","option","goodwill","liability"],"related":["Financial_accounting","Sole_proprietorship","Partnership","Corporation","Limited_liability_company","LLP","Asset","Liability_(financial_accounting)","Ownership_equity","Financial_year","Financial_statements","Liquidity","Net_assets","Net_worth","Accounting_equation","Asset","Liability_(financial_accounting)","Annual_report","Checking_account","Savings_account","Common_stock","Real_estate","Loan","Mortgage_loan","Mortgage","Market_value","Historical_cost","Cost_basis","Net_worth","Accounts_receivable","Inventory","Intangible_asset","Patent","Accounts_payable","Contingent_liabilities","Warranties","International_Accounting_Standards_Board","Current_asset","Cash_and_cash_equivalents","Accounts_receivable","Inventory","Prepaid_expenses","Fixed_asset","Property,_plant_and_equipment","Real_estate","Intangible_asset","Accounts_receivables","Cash_equivalents","Equity_method","Liability_(accounting)","Accounts_payable","Provision_(accounting)","Promissory_note","Corporate_bond","Tax","Deferred_tax","Shareholders'_equity","Reserve_(accounting)","Parent_company","Minority_interest","Double-entry_bookkeeping","Share_(finance)","Par_value","Treasury_share","Subsidiary","Option_(finance)","Contract","Accounting","Business","System_of_record","SAP_ERP","Oracle_Database","Bank_reconciliation","Certification","Balance_sheet","Spreadsheet","Email","Software","Process_automation","Standardization","Transparency_(behavior)","SOX_404_top-down_risk_assessment","IFRS","Goodwill_(accounting)","Consolidated_financial_statement","Cash_and_Cash_Equivalents","Accounts_Receivable","Inventory","Prepaid_Expense","Consolidation_(business)","Property,_Plant_and_Equipment","Available_for_sale","Consolidation_(business)","Associate_company","Intangible_assets","Goodwill_(accounting)","Deferred_Tax","Finance_lease","Accounts_Payable","Tax","Provision_(accounting)","Loan","Security_(finance)","Deferred_Tax","Provision_(accounting)","Finance_lease","Share_Capital","Ordinary_Shares","Preference_Shares","Share_Premium","Balance_sheet_substantiation","Cash_flow_statement","Income_statement","Minority_interest","Model_audit","National_accounts","Off-balance-sheet","Reformatted_balance_sheet","Statement_of_retained_earnings","Statement_of_changes_in_equity"]}
