While butter is derived from milk fat, margarine is mainly\nderived from plant oils and fats and may contain some skimmed milk. In some\nlocales it is colloquially referred to as 'oleo', short for 'oleomargarine'.\n\nMargarine, like butter, consists of a water-in-fat emulsion, with tiny droplets\nof water dispersed uniformly throughout a fat phase which is in a stable\ncrystalline form. Margarine has a minimum fat content of\n80%, the same as butter, but unlike butter reduced-fat varieties of margarine\ncan also be labelled as margarine. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://www.codexalimentarius.org/input/download/standards/10742/CXS_256e.pdf\n|title = CODEX STAN 256-2007 STANDARD FOR FAT SPREADS AND BLENDED SPREADS |date\n= 2007 |work = |publisher = Codex Alimentarius |accessdate = 2012/12/10 }}\n\nMargarine can be used both for spreading or for baking and cooking. It is also\ncommonly used as an ingredient in other food products, such as pastries and\ncookies, for its wide range of functionalities. Ian P.
