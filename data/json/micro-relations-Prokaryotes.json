{"cursor":"21171","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, one of the two domains of prokaryotic life.]]\n\nThe 'prokaryotes' (, or , ) are a group of organisms whose cells lack a cell\nnucleus (karyon). The organisms whose cells do have a nucleus are called\neukaryotes. Most prokaryotes are unicellular organisms, although a few such as\nmyxobacteria have multicellular stages in their life cycles or create\nlarge colonies like cyanobacteria. The word prokaryote comes from the Greek ÏÏÏ-\n(pro-) \"before\" + ÎºÎ±ÏÏÏÎ½ (karyon) \"nut or kernel\". Campbell, N.\n\"Biology:Concepts & Connections\". Pearson Education. San Francisco: 2003.\nProkaryotes do not have a nucleus, mitochondria, or any other membrane-bound\norganelles. In other words, all their intracellular water-soluble components\n(proteins, DNA and metabolites) are located together in the same area enclosed\nby cell membrane, rather than separated in different cellular compartments.\n\nThe division to prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects two distinct levels of\ncellular organization rather than biological classification of species.\nProkaryotes include two major classification domains: the bacteria and the\narchaea. Archaea were recognized as a domain of life in 1990. These organisms\nwere originally thought to live only in inhospitable conditions such as\nextremes of temperature, pH, and radiation but have since been found in all\ntypes of habitats.\n","linknr":750,"url":"Prokaryotes","recorded":1362484332,"links":92,"instances":["biology","biology","shape","planet","biology","fruit","evolution","biology"],"pdf":["http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf","http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SS/Lowe_J/group/PDF/annrev2006.pdf","http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf","http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf"],"categories":["Prokaryotes|"],"headings":["Relationship to eukaryotes","Sociality","Reproduction","Structure","Morphology of prokaryotic cells","Environment","Evolution of prokaryotes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg/300px-Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Relative_scale.svg/300px-Relative_scale.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Phylogenetic_Tree_of_Life.png/450px-Phylogenetic_Tree_of_Life.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colony","biology"],["nut","fruit"],["domain","biology"],["translation","biology"],["co-operation","evolution"],["bacillus","shape"],["life_on_mars","planet"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["colony","kingdom","bacillus","life_on_mars","domain","nut","translation"],"related":["Organism","Cell_nucleus","Eukaryote","Unicellular","Myxobacteria","Multicellular_organism","Biological_life_cycle","Colony_(biology)","Cyanobacteria","Greek_language","Nut_(fruit)","Seed","Mitochondrion","Cell_membrane","Cellular_compartment","Taxonomy","Bacteria","Archaea","Domain_(biology)","Temperature","PH","Radiation","Habitat","Cell_nucleus","DNA","Ribosomes","Mitochondria","Chloroplast","Endosymbiotic_theory","Genome","DNA","Protein","Cytosol","Nucleoid","Nuclear_envelope","Chromosome","Plasmid","Mitochondrion","Chloroplast","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Photosynthesis","Cell_membrane","Prokaryotic_cytoskeleton","Planctomycetes","RNA","Protein","Ribosome","Translation_(biology)","Surface-area-to-volume_ratio","Metabolic_rate","Carl_Woese","Bacteria","Archaea","Three-domain_system","Two-empire_system","Biofilms","Gene_expression","Cell_signaling","Quorum_sensing","Circulatory_system","Programmed_cell_death","Biological_dispersal","Co-operation_(evolution)","Evolution_of_multicellularity","Inclusive_fitness","Hamilton's_rule","Bacterial_conjugation","Asexual_reproduction","Binary_fission","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Bacterial_conjugation","Cytoskeleton","MreB","FtsZ","Flagellum","Flagellin","Chemotaxis","Photosynthesis","Chemolithotrophy","Bacterial_microcompartment","Carboxysome","Thiomargarita_namibiensis","Flagellum","Cell_membrane","Cell_wall","Mycoplasma","Cytoplasm","Ribosome","Nucleoid","Glycocalyx","Cytoplasmic_inclusion","Cocci","Bacillus_(shape)","Spirochaete","Vibrio","Extremophile","Plankton","Symbiotic","Origin_of_life","Protobiont","Fossil","Endosymbiotic_theory","Carl_Woese","J_Peter_Gogarten","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Photosynthesis","Organic_compound","Inorganic_compound","Hydrogen_sulfide","Antarctica","Hydrothermal_vent","Hot_spring","Archaea","Bacteria","Monera","Kingdom_(biology)","Bacterial_cell_structure","List_of_sequenced_archaeal_genomes","List_of_sequenced_bacterial_genomes","Nanobe","Virus","Prion","Nanobacterium","Symbiogenesis","Eukaryote"]}
