Cuvier was a major figure in natural sciences research in the early\n19th century, and was instrumental in establishing the fields of comparative\nanatomy and paleontology through his work in comparing living animals with\nfossils. He is well known for establishing extinction as a fact, being the most\ninfluential proponent of catastrophism in geology in the early 19th century\n, and opposing the evolutionary theories of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck\nand Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. His most famous work is Le RÃ¨gne Animal (1817;\nEnglish: The Animal Kingdom). In 1819, he was created a peer for life in honor\nof his scientific contributions. Thereafter he was known as Baron\nCuvier. He died in Paris, during an epidemic of cholera.\n","linknr":646,"url":"Georges_Cuvier","recorded":1362483124,"links":79,"instances":["gesner","school","geologist"],"pdf":["http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k38572.pdf","http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3858c.pdf","http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3859p.pdf","http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1106958.pdf"],"categories":["1769
