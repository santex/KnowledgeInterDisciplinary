It may also include members of\n[[Kenyanthropus]], [[Ardipithecus]], and [[Praeanthropus]]. The term comes from\na former classification as members of a distinct subfamily, the\nAustralopithecinae. They are now classified by some within the\n'Australopithecina' subtribe of the Hominini tribe. Member of Australopithecus\nare sometimes referred to as the \"gracile australopithecines\", while\nParanthropus are called the \"robust australopithecines\".\n\nThe australopithecines occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene era, and were bipedal\nand dentally similar to humans, but with a brain size not much larger than that\nof modern apes, with lesser encephalization than in the genus [[Homo]]. Humans\n(genus Homo) may have descended from australopithecine ancestors, while the\ngenus [[Ardipithecus]] is a possible ancestor of the australopithecines.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Australopithecine","recorded":1372152263,"links":[],"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human evolution","Pliocene","Hominini"],"headings":["Phylogeny","Physical characteristics","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["tribe","biology"]],"members":["tribe"],"related":["Pliocene","Pleistocene","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Eutheria","Primate","Hominidae","Homininae","Hominini","Genus","Genus","Hominini","Tribe_(biology)","Plio-Pleistocene","Bipedal","Ape","Encephalization","Human","Bipedal_locomotion","Sexual_dimorphism","Brain_size","Cubic_centimetre","Human_taxonomy"]}
