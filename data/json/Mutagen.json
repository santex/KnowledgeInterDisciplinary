{"cursor":"29149","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In genetics, a 'mutagen' (Latin, literally origin of change) is a physical or\nchemical agent that changes the genetic material, usually DNA, of an organism\nand thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural background\nlevel. As many mutations cause cancer, mutagens are therefore also likely to be\ncarcinogens. Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called \"spontaneous\nmutations\" occur due to spontaneous hydrolysis, errors in DNA replication,\nrepair and recombination.\n","linknr":628,"url":"Mutagen","recorded":1362480590,"links":68,"instances":["genetics","author","comics","information_theory","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/m/hjm-1927a.pdf","http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/m/hjm-1927a.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/22/10/579.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/22/10/579.pdf","http://potency.lbl.gov/pdfs/MutatRes88.pdf","http://potency.lbl.gov/pdfs/MutatRes88.pdf","http://mutage.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/3/455.full.pdf","http://mutage.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/3/455.full.pdf","http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/lt_rpts/tr389.pdf","http://www.glutathioneexperts.com/pdfs/glutathione-heavy-metal-1.pdf","http://www.glutathioneexperts.com/pdfs/glutathione-heavy-metal-1.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf"],"categories":["Mutagens|","Mutation","Radiation health effects","Radioactivity"],"headings":["Discovery of mutagens","Effects of mutagens","Types of mutagens","Protection against mutagens","Mutagen test systems","Use of mutagen in anti-cancer therapy","Mutagens in fiction","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Benzopyrene_DNA_adduct_1JDG.png/200px-Benzopyrene_DNA_adduct_1JDG.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Fruits_veggies.png/220px-Fruits_veggies.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_hill","author"],["benzo(apyrene"],["deletion","genetics"],["deletion","genetics"],["redundancy","information_theory"],["benzo(apyrene"],["intercalation","chemistry"],["inhumans","comics"]],"members":["deletion","john_hill","inhumans","redundancy","intercalation"],"related":["Genetics","Latin","DNA","Organism","Mutation","Cancer","Carcinogen","Hydrolysis","DNA_error","DNA_replication","Genetic_recombination","Carcinogen","Cancer","Tumor","Chromosome","DNA","Greece","Physician","Hippocrates","Paracelsus","Radon","John_Hill_(author)","Snuff","Percivall_Pott","Chimney_sweep","Soot","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Benzo(a)pyrene","Hermann_Joseph_Muller","X-ray","Drosophila_melanogaster","Phenotype","Drosophila","Genetics","Gene","Lewis_Stadler","Ultraviolet","Charlotte_Auerbach","J._M._Robson","Mustard_gas","Mutation","Ames_test","Bruce_Ames","Sodium_Azide","Chromosomal_translocation","Deletion_(genetics)","Chromosomal_inversion","Clastogen","Nucleic_acid","Nucleotide","Base-pair","Insertional_mutation","Deletion_(genetics)","Protein","Silent_mutation","Amino-acid","Redundancy_(information_theory)","Codon","Aneuploidy","Ionizing_radiation","X-rays","Gamma_ray","Alpha_particle","Ultraviolet","Pyrimidine_dimers","Radioactive_decay","Carbon-14","Nitrogen","Benzo(a)pyrene","Tobacco_smoking","Reactive_oxygen_species","Superoxide","Hydroxyl_radicals","Hydrogen_peroxide","Electron_transport_chain","Lipid_peroxidation","Deamination","Nitrous_acid","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Alkylation","Ethylnitrosourea","Nitrosamine","Vinyl_chloride","Aromatic_amines","Ludwig_Rehn","2-Acetylaminofluorene","Alkaloid","Vinca","Bromine","Sodium_azide","Psoralen","Benzene","Base_analog","Intercalation_(chemistry)","Ethidium_bromide","Proflavine","Frameshift_mutation","Daunorubicin","Arsenic","Cadmium","Chromium","Nickel","Histone","Transposon","Virus","Peyton_Rous","Rous_sarcoma_virus","Bacteria","Antioxidant","Anticarcinogenic","Fruit","Vegetables","Vitamin_A","Carotenoid","Vitamin_C","Vitamin_E","Polyphenol","Beta-Carotene","Carrot","Tomatoes","N-nitroso","Flavonoid","Epigallocatechin_gallate","Green_tea","Selenium","Sulforaphane","Broccoli","Prostate_cancer","Indole-3-carbinol","Cruciferous_vegetables","Resveratrol","Melanoma","Richard_Doll","Richard_Peto","Mycotoxin","Aflatoxins","Heterocyclic_amine","Cured_meat","Bacon","Vitamin_C","Alcohol_and_cancer","Acetaldehyde","Cytochrome_P450","Histidine","8-Azaguanine","Tryptophan","6-thioguanine","Rodents","Animal_testing_on_rodents","Feeding_tube","Uterine_horns","Shuttle_vector","Blue-white_screen","Cyclophosphamide","Cisplatin","Daunorubicin","Doxorubicin","Radiation_therapy","Science_fiction","Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles","Comic_book","Marvel_Comics","Inhumans_(comics)","Carcinogen","DNA_repair","Genetics","Genotoxicity","Mutation","Pesticide","Teratology","Ethyl_methanesulfonate"]}
