Electrical signals travelling down this\nabnormal pathway (known as the 'bundle of Kent') may stimulate the ventricles to\ncontract prematurely, resulting in a unique type of supraventricular tachycardia\nreferred to as an atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology --> The incidence of WPW is between 0.1% and 0.3% in the\ngeneral population.<ref name=Rosner1999></ref><ref name=Sorbo1995></ref><ref\nname=Munger1993></ref> Sudden cardiac death in people with WPW is rare\n(incidence of less than 0.6%), and is usually caused by the propagation of an\natrial tachydysrhythmia (rapid and abnormal heart rate) to the ventricles by the\nabnormal accessory pathway.<ref name=Munger1993/><ref\nname=Fitzsimmons2001></ref>\n","title":"Wolff%E2%80%93Parkinson%E2%80%93White%20syndrome","headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Treatment","History","Notable cases","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: PR_interval","2: Accessory_pathway","2: Right_atrium","2: Atrial_fibrillation","2: Ebstein's_anomaly","2: Electrophysiology_study","1: Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","1: Heart","1: Pre-excitation_syndrome","1: Supraventricular_tachycardia","1: Supraventricular_tachycardia#Types","1: Cardiac_dysrhythmia#Tachycardias","1: Palpitation","1: Dizziness","1: Dyspnea","1: Electrocardiography","1: Cardiac_action_potential","1: Sinoatrial_node","1: Atrioventricular_node","1: Bundle_of_His","1: Purkinje_fibers","1: Endocardium","1: Cardiac_muscle","1: Atrial_flutter","1: Pulse","1: QRS_complex","1: Millisecond","1: Cardiogenic_shock","1: Cardiac_dysrhythmia","1: Ventricular_fibrillation","1: Protein_kinase","1: Enzyme","1: Gene","1: Left_atrium","1: Left_ventricle","1: Right_ventricle","1: Electrical_network","1: Torsades_de_pointes","1: Sinus_rhythm","1: ST_segment","1: T_wave","1: Leber's_hereditary_optic_neuropathy","1: Mitochondrial_disease","1: Palpitations","1: Cardiac_electrophysiology","1: Tachydysrhythmias","1: Cardioversion","1: Hypotension","1: Altered_level_of_consciousness","1: Pharmacology","1: Amiodarone","1: Procainamide","1: Diltiazem","1: Verapamil","1: Calcium_channel_blocker","1: Beta_blocker","1: Catheter_ablation","1: Cardiology","1: Louis_Wolff","1: Paul_Dudley_White","1: LaMarcus_Aldridge","1: Basketball","1: Nathan_Eagleton","1: Australian_rules_football","1: Jessie_J","1: Marilyn_Manson","1: Meat_Loaf","1: Montel_Vontavious_Porter","1: WWE","1: Michael_Rupp","1: Ice_hockey","1: Mitch_Hurwitz","1: Jeff_Garlin","1: Cooper_Taylor","1: Dan_Hardy","1: UFC","1: Claire_Dunphy","1: Modern_Family","1: Lyndrome","1: Re-entry_ventricular_arrhythmia","1: United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine"]}
