{"cursor":"15063","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\ns]]\n\n'Topography' (from Greek ÏÏÏÎ¿Ï topos, \"place\", and Î³ÏÎ¬ÏÏ graphÅ, \"write\") is a\nfield of planetary science comprising the study of surface shape and features of\nthe Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons,\nand asteroids. It is also the description of such surface shapes and features\n(especially their depiction in maps). The topography of an area can also mean\nthe surface shape and features themselves.\n\nIn a broader sense, topography is concerned with local detail in general,\nincluding not only relief but also natural and artificial features, and even\nlocal history and culture. This meaning is less common in America, where\ntopographic maps with elevation contours have made \"topography\" synonymous with\nrelief. The older sense of topography as the study of place still has currency\nin Europe.\n\nTopography specifically involves the recording of relief or terrain, the three-\ndimensional quality of the surface, and the identification of specific\nlandforms. This is also known as geomorphometry. In modern usage, this involves\ngeneration of elevation data in electronic form. It is often considered to\ninclude the graphic representation of the landform on a map by a variety of\ntechniques, including contour lines, hypsometric tints, and relief shading.
