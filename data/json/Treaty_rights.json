{"cursor":"2241","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Treaty rights' are certain rights that were reserved by indigenous peoples when\nthey signed treaties with settler societies in the wake of European\ncolonization. This applies to the rights of Native Americans and Alaska Natives\nin the United States and First Nations in Canada.\n\nBy signing treaties, tribes traded vast amounts of their land and resources in\nexchange for reserved areas of land (Indian reservations) and things like\nprotection (from attacks on their lands), health care, education, sovereignty\nand religious freedom, protection of hunting and fishing rights, and sometimes\nsome monies as well. Because Article Six of the United States Constitution\ndeclares treaties to be the supreme law of the land, treaties are just as valid\ntoday as they were the day they were signed, and treaty rights are still legally\nbinding as well.\n\nIt is a common misperception that treaty rights are \"special\" rights given to\nnative people by the government because of their racial status, but this is not\nthe case. The government does not \"give\" treaty rights to anyone â native people\nreserved them when they signed treaties in a government-to-government\nrelationship.\n\nTreaty rights are frequently subject to public debate, particularly hunting and\nfishing rights. Many Native nations have reserved rights to hunt and fish in\ntheir accustomed places, which are often land that was given up at the treaty\nsigning, or \"ceded land\". This leads to conflict with sports and commercial\nhunters and fishers, who are competing for the same limited resource in the\nsame place.\n\nAnother common source of conflict is management decisions about the land or\nrivers on which Native people have rights. Things like dams and logging have\nhuge effects on fish and wildlife populations, but Native people are rarely\nconsulted when it comes to the management process of these lands and rivers,\neven though many tribes still depend on hunting and fishing for subsistence.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Treaty_rights","recorded":1375090166,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples","/wiki/Settler_societies","/wiki/European_colonization","/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Alaska_Natives","/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada","/wiki/Indian_reservation","/wiki/Health_care","/wiki/Freedom_of_religion","/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples","/wiki/Resource","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&oldid=531152002","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Native_American_law","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Treaty+rights&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Treaty+rights","/wiki/Treaty_rights","/wiki/Talk:Treaty_rights","#","/wiki/Treaty_rights","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Treaty_rights","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Treaty_rights","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&oldid=531152002","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7837326","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Treaty_rights&id=531152002","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Treaty+rights","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Treaty+rights&oldid=531152002&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Treaty_rights&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7837326#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_rights","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Native
