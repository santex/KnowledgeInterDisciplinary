The area is\narid and most water is pumped from bores, though Stephen Creek runs through the\nproperty and has semi-permanent wayer-holes. The property is composed of gibber\nplains, large areas of saltbush and mulga and sandy creek beds surrounded by\ncoolibah trees. The old station homestead is now he site of\nthe Broken Hill Royal Flying Doctor Service.\n\nThe station was established around 1863 by the Barrier Ranges Company which\nincluded George Urquhart who owned neighbouring Kinchega Station. The property\ntakes it's name from Mount Gibbs that was named by Charles Sturt during his\nexpedition of 1844. Mount Gipps was the first established station in\nthe Barrier Range area and one of the first settle west of the Darling\nRiver.\n\nThe run was taken up in 1866 by McCredie and Cunningham an occupied and area of\nincluding an outstation at Stephens Creek, the pair later sold it to James\nMcCulloch. His nephew, George McCulloch, later became manager and amongst his\nemployees was a young Sidney Kidman who was employed at Mount Gipps as a\nroustabout and bullock driver. \n\nBy 1877 the property encompassed about and supported a flock of 71,000\nsheep.\n\nIn 1883 a boundary rider from Mount Gipps named Charles Rasp who, along six\nfellow workers, formed the Syndicate of Seven and pegged out the mining claim\nfor the one of the world's richest lode of silver, lead and zinc at Broken Hill\nin the Barrier Range forming the company Broken Hill
