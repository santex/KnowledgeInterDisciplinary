As with cities, depending on various cultural definitions,\nwhat is considered a forest may vary significantly in size and have different\nclassifications according to how and of what the forest is composed.<ref>Lund,\nH. Gyde (coord.) 2006. 'Definitions of Forest, Deforestation, Afforestation, and\nReforestation'. Gainesville, VA: Forest Information Services. Available from:\n[http://home.comcast.net/~gyde/DEFpaper.htm ComcastNet-gyde].</ref> A forest is\nusually an area filled with trees but any tall densely packed area of vegetation\nmay be considered a forest, even underwater vegetation such as kelp forests, or\nnon-vegetation such as fungi,<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Stamets first = Paul authorlink = Paul_Stamets title = Mycelium\n  | Running publisher = Ten Speed Press year = 2005 page = 35 isbn = 1-58008-579-\n  | 2}}</ref> and bacteria. Tree forests cover approximately 9.4 percent of the\n  | Earth's surface (or 30 percent of total land area), though they once covered\n  | much more (about 50 percent of total land area). They function as habitats\n  | for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators, and soil conservers, constituting\n  | one of the most important aspects of the biosphere.\n\nA typical tree forest is composed of the overstory (canopy or upper tree layer)\nand the understory. The understory is further subdivided into the shrub layer,\nherb layer, and also the moss layer and soil microbes. In some complex forests,\nthere is also a well-defined lower tree layer. Forests are central to all human\nlife because they provide a diverse range of resources: they store carbon, aid\nin regulating the planetary climate, purify water and mitigate natural hazards\nsuch as floods. Forests also contain roughly 90 percent of the world's\nterrestrial biodiversity.<ref></ref>\n",
