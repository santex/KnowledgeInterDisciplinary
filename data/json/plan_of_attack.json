It was promoted as \"a behind-the-scenes account of how\nand why President [George W.] Bush decided to go to war against Iraq\" <ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19691-\n2004Apr17.html?g</ref>\n\nThe book's chief contention, which provides the rationale for its title, is that\nPresident Bush planned from early in his presidency to remove Saddam Hussein\nfrom power by force, rather than making any serious effort to use diplomacy or\nother means. The book describes White House deliberations implying that if\nSaddam were removed from power without a military invasion, Iraq would need a\nforeign-implemented regime change. It focuses mainly on President Bush, Vice\nPresident of the United States Dick Cheney, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald\nRumsfeld, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, U.S. Secretary of\nState Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and CIA Director George Tenet, as well\nas Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair. Other fixtures are White\nHouse advisers such as Karen Hughes and Karl Rove.\n",
