Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the originator of the\ncosmogenic theory of the four Classical elements. He also proposed powers called\nLove and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and\nseparation of the elements. These physical speculations were part of a history\nof the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life.\nInfluenced by the Pythagoreans, he supported the doctrine of reincarnation.\nEmpedocles is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to record his\nideas in verse. Some of his work survives, more than in the case of any other\nPresocratic philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers,\nand has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.\n","linknr":939,"url":"Empedocles","recorded":1362372191,"links":85,"instances":["volcano","scholar","philosophy","historian","historian","religion","gods","classical_element","physiology","classical_element","classical_element","poetry","classical_element"],"pdf":[],"categories":["490
