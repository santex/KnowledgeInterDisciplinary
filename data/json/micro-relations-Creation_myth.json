Creation myths develop through oral traditions and\ntherefore typically have multiple versions.\" While in popular usage the\nterm \"myth\" is often thought to refer to false or fanciful stories, creation\nmyths are by definition stories which cultures take to be true to varying\ndegrees. \"In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs\nthat are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic\nmythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell\nus are impossible. Nevertheless, all cultures celebrate such myths and attribute\nto them various degrees of literal or symbolic truth.\" () Creation myths\ndevelop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions; and they are the most common form of myth, found throughout\nhuman culture. In the society in which it\nis told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths,\nmetaphorically, symbolically and sometimes even in a historical or literal\nsense. They are commonly, although not always,\nconsidered [[cosmogonical]] mythsâthat is they describe the ordering of the\ncosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness. See:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n* \n\nCreation myths often share a number of features. They often are considered\nsacred accounts and can be found in nearly all known religious traditions. They are all stories with a plot and characters who are\neither deities, human-like figures, or animals, who often speak and transform\neasily. See: * * * * They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past,\nwhat historian of religion Mircea Eliade termed in illo tempore (\"at that\ntime\"). Also, all creation myths speak to\ndeeply meaningful questions held by the society that shares them, revealing of\ntheir central worldview and the framework for the self-identity of the culture\nand individual in a universal context.
