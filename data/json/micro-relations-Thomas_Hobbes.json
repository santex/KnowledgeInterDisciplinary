His 1651 book [[Leviathan\n(book)|Leviathan]] established the foundation for most of Western political\nphilosophy from the perspective of social contract theory. . Retrieved 11\nMarch 2009.\n\nHobbes was a champion of absolutism for the sovereign but he also developed some\nof the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual;\nthe natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order\n(which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the\nview that all legitimate political power must be \"representative\" and based on\nthe consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves\npeople free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid. Pierre\nManent, An Intellectual History of Liberalism (1994) pp 20â38\n\nHe was one of the founders of modern political philosophy. His\nunderstanding of humans as being matter and motion, obeying the same physical\nlaws as other matter and motion, remains influential; and his account of human\nnature as self-interested cooperation, and of political communities as being\nbased upon a \"social contract\" remains one of the major topics of political\nphilosophy.\n\nIn addition to political philosophy, Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array\nof other fields, including history, geometry, the physics of gases, theology,\nethics, and general philosophy.\n","linknr":1029,"url":"Thomas_Hobbes","recorded":1362485269,"links":115,"instances":["philosophy","philosopher","academic","publisher","publisher","polity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1588
