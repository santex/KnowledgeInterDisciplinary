{"cursor":"8239","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'therapeutic effect' is a consequence of a medical treatment of any kind, the\nresults of which are judged to be desirable and beneficial. This is true\nwhether the result was expected, unexpected, or even an unintended consequence\nof the treatment. An adverse effect, on the other hand, is a harmful and\nundesired effect.\n\nWhat constitutes a therapeutic effect versus a side effect is a matter of both\nthe nature of the situation in which a treatment is used and the goals of\ntreatment. There is no inherent difference between therapeutic and undesired\nside effects; both responses are behavioral/physiologic changes which occur as a\nresponse to the treatment strategy or agent. The most common nominal reason for\npreferring certain effects is avoiding death. However, those changes which are\nviewed as desirable, given the situation, are called therapeutic; those\nundesirable for the situation are viewed as harmful.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Therapeutic_effect","recorded":1362478788,"links":13,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical treatments","Pharmacology","Medical statistics"],"headings":["Scope of treatments","Pharmacology example","Reducing complexity","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","biochemistry"]],"members":["dose"],"related":["Medical_treatment","Unintended_consequence","Adverse_effect","Behavioral","Physiologic","Medication","Drug","Dietary_supplement","Pharmacology","Placebo","Surgery","Physical_therapy","Psychotherapy","Faith_healing","Hypnosis","Conscious","Placebo_effect","Dehydration","Water_intoxication","Pulmonary_edema","Diphenhydramine","Nasal_congestion","Mucous_membrane","Drowsiness","Insomnia","Mucous_membrane","Drowsiness","Dose_(biochemistry)","Prescription_drug","Pharmaceutical","Therapeutic_index"]}
