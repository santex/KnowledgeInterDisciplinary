{"cursor":"4329","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn relational databases and flat file databases, a 'table' is a set of data\nelements (values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns (which are\nidentified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a\nrow and column intersect. . A table has a specified number of columns,\nbut can have any number of rows . Each row is identified by the values appearing\nin a particular column subset which has been identified as a unique key index.\n\nTable is another term for relations; although there is the difference in that a\ntable is usually a multiset (bag) of rows whereas a relation is a set and does\nnot allow duplicates. Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have\nassociated with them some metadata, such as constraints on the table or on the\nvalues within particular columns.|\n\nThe data in a table does not have to be physically stored in the database. Views\nare also relational tables, but their data are calculated at query time. Another\nexample are , which represent a pointer to a table in another database.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Table_(database)","recorded":1362478801,"links":30,"instances":["information","sql","database","database","database","database","database","sql"],"pdf":[],"categories":["SQL","Data modeling","Relational database management systems"],"headings":["Comparisons with other data structures","Tables versus relations","Table types","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["column","database"],["row","database_"],["cell","database"],["relation","database"],["view","database"],["relation","database"],["order_by","sql"],["select","sql"],["relation","database"],["row","database"],["column","database"],["table","information"]],"members":["table","order_by","row","view","relation","cell","column","select"],"related":["Relational_database","Flat_file_database","Column_(database)","Row_(database)_","Cell_(database)","Unique_key","Relation_(database)","Multiset","Metadata","Check_constraint","View_(database)","Hierarchical_model","Computer_file","Spreadsheet","Datatype","Logical_schema","SQL","SQLite","Relational_model","Relation_(database)","SQL","Tuple","Order_by_(SQL)","Select_(SQL)","Relational_table","Relational_database","Object_table","Relation_(database)","Row_(database)","Column_(database)","Table_(information)"]}
