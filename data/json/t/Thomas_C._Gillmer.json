Gillmer' (1911â2009) was a naval architect and the author of books\nabout modern and historical naval architecture. He was born in Warren, Ohio on\nJuly 17, 1911. At his family's summer cottage near Lake Erie in Ohio, he learned\nto sail a 14-foot sloop by himself. He graduated from Warren High School, then\nattended the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nAfter graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935, he served aboard the light\ncruisers USS Raleigh (CL-7) and USS Savannah (CL-42) in the Pacific and\nMediterranean.\n\nIn 1941, he joined the Marine Engineering Department at the Naval Academy.\nDuring World War II, he served as an instructor of Ship Construction and Damage\nControl at the U.S. Naval Academy. He resigned his commission with the Navy in\n1946 to join the Academy's faculty as a professor and became chairman of the\nFirst Class Committee of the Marine Engineering department. (Note: The Marine\nEngineering Department became the Division of Engineering and Weapons in 1970\nwhich contained the Naval Systems Engineering Department. Naval Systems later\nbecame the current Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department.) During\nthe 1950s, Professor Gillmer established the Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory in\nIsherwood Hall which consisted of an 85' Ã 6' Ã 4' towing tank, an 18' Ã 22' Ã\n4' intact and damaged stability demonstration tank and a small circulating\nwater channel.\n\n\nAfter retiring from the Naval Academy in 1967, Gillmer continued living in\nAnnapolis, where he pursued a career as the architect of sailing vessels and an\nauthor on the subject. In 1969, he established the engineering firm Thomas\nGillmer, Naval Architect, Inc. in Annapolis. His\ndesigns included modern yachts and replicas of historic sailing ships. He worked with artist Melbourne Smith on the design\nof the Pride of Baltimore in 1976, the Pride of Baltimore II in 1986, and the\nKalmar Nyckel in 1997. The Navy hired Gillmer to evaluate the\ncondition of the USS Constitution prior to the vessel's restoration in 1997.\n\nThe Allied Seawind Ketch, designed by Gillmer in 1962, was the first fiberglass-\nhulled yacht to circumnavigate the Earth.\n\nGillmer designed and built his own house in Annapolis in 1947, where he lived\nfor more than 60 years. He was married for 62 years to the former Anna Derge.\nAfter her death in 1999, he married Ruth Newsome, who was his wife until he died\non December 16, 2009.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Thomas_C._Gillmer","recorded":1374962973,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Pride_of_Baltimore","/wiki/Kalmar_Nyckel","/wiki/Naval_architecture","/wiki/Warren,_Ohio","/wiki/Lake_Erie","/wiki/Ohio","/wiki/Sloop","/wiki/U.S._Naval_Academy","#cite_note-Sun_Obituary-1","/wiki/U.S._Naval_Academy","/wiki/Light_cruiser","/wiki/USS_Raleigh_(CL-7)","/wiki/USS_Savannah_(CL-42)","#cite_note-Sun_Obituary-1","/wiki/Naval_architecture","/wiki/Ship_Construction","/wiki/Damage_Control","/wiki/Ocean_Engineering","/wiki/Hydromechanics","/wiki/File:PrideofBaltimore1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/PrideofBaltimore1.jpg/220px-PrideofBaltimore1.jpg","/wiki/File:PrideofBaltimore1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-Sun_Obituary-1","/wiki/Yacht","#cite_note-Privateer_26-2","/wiki/Pride_of_Baltimore","/wiki/Kalmar_Nyckel","#cite_note-3","/wiki/USS_Constitution","#cite_note-Sun_Obituary-1","#cite_note-Sailboat_Data-4","#cite_note-Sun_Obituary-1","#cite_note-5","#Bibliography","#Books","#Video","#Vessel_designs","#Historic_sailing_ship_replicas","#Sailboats","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/United_States_Naval_Institute","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0877420254","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0870213180","/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay_Maritime_Museum","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0877423091","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0877423466","/wiki/Special:BookSources/007023616X","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0070245649","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Pride_of_Baltimore","/wiki/Schooner","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Pungy","/wiki/Kalmar_Nyckel","/wiki/Full_rigged_pinnace","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-Sailboat_Data-4","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-Sun_Obituary_1-0","#cite_ref-Sun_Obituary_1-1","#cite_ref-Sun_Obituary_1-2","#cite_ref-Sun_Obituary_1-3","#cite_ref-Sun_Obituary_1-4","http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/obituaries/bal-md.ob.ar.gillmer25dec25,0,570586.story","#cite_ref-Privateer_26_2-0","http://www.privateer26.org/aboutgillmer.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/aboutshipspecs.asp","#cite_ref-Sailboat_Data_4-0","#cite_ref-Sailboat_Data_4-1","http://sailboatdata.com/view_DESIGNER.asp?DESIGNER_ID=2","#cite_ref-5","http://www.hometownbowie.com/obituaries/2009/12/3662/Thomas-C-Gillmer.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.livingclassrooms.org/Facilities/LadyMD.html","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit&section=8","http://www.kalmarnyckel.org/","http://www.pride2.org/","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/112008179","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&oldid=556953644","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Naval_architects","/wiki/Category:American_naval_historians","/wiki/Category:1911_births","/wiki/Category:2009_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+C.+Gillmer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+C.+Gillmer","/wiki/Thomas_C._Gillmer","/wiki/Talk:Thomas_C._Gillmer","#","/wiki/Thomas_C._Gillmer","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_C._Gillmer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Fundrais
