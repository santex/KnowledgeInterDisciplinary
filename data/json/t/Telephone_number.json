{"cursor":"20327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'telephone number' or 'phone number' is a sequence of digits used to call from\none telephone line to another in a public switched telephone network. When\ntelephone numbers were invented, they were short â as few as one, two or three\ndigits â and were given orally to a switchboard operator. As phone systems have\ngrown and interconnected to encompass the world, telephone numbers have become\nlonger. In addition to telephones, they now access other devices, such as\ncomputers and fax machines.\n\nThe number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended\nendpoint for the telephone call. Each such endpoint must have a unique number\nwithin the public switched telephone network. Most countries use fixed length\nnumbers (for normal lines at least) and therefore the number of endpoints\ndetermines the necessary length of the telephone number. It is also possible for\neach subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often\nused. These \"shorthand\" or \"speed calling\" numbers are automatically translated\nto unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected. Some special\nservices have their own short numbers (e.g., 1-1-9, 9-1-1, 0-0-0, 9-9-9, 1-1-1,\nand 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China, Japan, South Korea,\nTaiwan and Sri Lanka; Canada and the United States; Australia; the United\nKingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Poland, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,\nMorocco, Macao, Bahrain, Qatar, Bangladesh, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Hong Kong,\nMalaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Trinidad, Tobago; New Zealand; Kuwait\nand the European Union, respectively.)\n\nMany systems also allow calls within a local area to be made without dialing\nthe local area code. For example, a phone number in North America will start\nwith three numbers (such as 661), which is the area code, followed by seven\ndigits split into sections of three and four (such as 550-1212), which is the\nlocal number. Some areas now have mandatory ten-digit dialing in place, even\nfor local calls.\n\nMost telephone networks today (exceptions being private intercom and secure\nphone networks) are interconnected in the international telephone network, where\nthe format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T in the recommendation\nE.164. This specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter, and\nbegin with a country prefix. For most countries, this is followed by an area\ncode or city code and the subscriber number, which might consist of the code for\na particular telephone exchange. ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to\nrepresent an international telephone number in writing or print, starting with a\nplus sign (\"+\") and the country code. When calling an international number from\na fixed line phone, the + must be replaced with the international call prefix\nchosen by the country the call is being made from. Some mobile phones allow the\n+ to be entered directly.\n\nThe format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nation's\nrespective government, either directly or by sponsored organizations (such as\nNANPA overseen by NeuStar Inc.).\n\nBefore a telephone call is connected, the telephone number must be dialed by the\ncalling party or Caller. The called party might have equipment that presents\ncaller ID before the call is answered.\n","linknr":701,"url":"Telephone_number","recorded":1362374547,"links":52,"instances":["emergency_telephone_number","telephony"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Telephone numbers|","Identifiers"],"headings":["US phone number history","United Kingdom","Intercepted number","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Star_Hair_Stylists_1399_Queen_W_Toronto.jpg/220px-Star_Hair_Stylists_1399_Queen_W_Toronto.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["999","emergency_telephone_number"],["party_line","telephony"]],"members":["999","party_line"],"related":["Telephone_line","Public_switched_telephone_network","Switchboard_operator","Telephone","Computers","Fax_machines","Telephone_call","Public_switched_telephone_network","1-1-9","9-1-1","000_emergency","999_(emergency_telephone_number)","1-1-1","1-1-2","Emergency_telephone_number","Ten-digit_dialing","ITU-T","E.164","Country_calling_codes","Telephone_exchange","ITU-T","E.123","List_of_international_call_prefixes","NANPA","NeuStar_Inc.","Telephone_call","Dial","Calling_party","Called_party","Caller_ID","American_Telephone_&_Telegraph_Company","Western_Union","Subscription","Telephone_switchboard","Telephone_exchange","Switchboard_operator","Lowell,_Massachusetts","Moses_Greeley_Parker","New_England_Telephone_and_Telegraph_Company","Ringdown","Party_line_(telephony)","Ring_cadence","North_America","Telephone_exchange_names","Director_telephone_system","555_telephone_number","Telephone_exchange_names","Area_Code","New_York_City","United_States","World_War_II","Los_Angeles,_California","Bell_System","American_Broadcasting_Company","Wichita_Falls,_Texas","United_States","Rotary_dial","Strowger_switch","555_telephone_number","Directory_assistance","Tommy_Tutone","867-5309/Jenny","Philadelphia","EBay","USD","Glenn_Miller_Orchestra","Pennsylvania_6-5000","Hotel_Pennsylvania","New_York_City","Morgan_Freeman","Jim_Carrey","Universal_Studios","Buffalo,_New_York","Martin_Scorsese","United_Kingdom","United_Kingdom","Director_telephone_system","Intercept_message","Geographic_number","List_of_country_calling_codes","Local_conventions_for_writing_telephone_numbers","Long_distance_calling","Area_code","MSISDN","Number_translation_service","Phonewords","Telephone_numbering_plan","Voice_over_IP","Zenith_number","Caller_ID","Automatic_number_identification","Automatic_number_announcement_circuit","Dialed_Number_Identification_Service","Loop_around","Carrier_access_code","Carrier_identification_code"]}
