{"cursor":"1775","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is shown returning his first regular season interception for the Tampa Bay\n Buccaneers on September 16, 2007.]] In American football, a 'turnover' occurs\n when the team with the ball loses possession of the ball, which is then gained\n by the other team. The two events that are officially classified as \"turnovers\"\n are fumbles (accidental physical loss of a live ball a player has possession\n of) or interceptions (passes intended for a member of the passing team, but\n caught by a member of the opposing team).\n\nThe term \"turnover\" is also used to refer to a turnover on downs, when a team\nattempts to gain a first down or touchdown on a fourth down play (known as a\nfourth down conversion), but is unsuccessful. When this occurs, the opposing\nteam automatically gains possession at the spot to which the ball was advanced\nat the end of the play, unless a penalty has occurred (every defensive penalty,\nif accepted, results either in an automatic first down or a replay of down). The\nteam that has lost possession is not permitted any opportunity to advance the\nball any further.\n\nMoreover, although all three are classified as \"turnovers,\" the NFL game\nstatistics recording turnovers only include lost fumbles and intercepted passes;\nturnovers on downs are not included (e.g., a team whose only turnovers are\nturnovers on downs is credited with having \"no turnovers\").\n","linknr":301,"url":"Turnover_(gridiron_football)","recorded":1362554907,"links":16,"instances":["football","american_football"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American football terminology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/20070916_Cato_June%27s_first_interception_as_a_Buccaneer.jpg/220px-20070916_Cato_June%27s_first_interception_as_a_Buccaneer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Football_Template_USA.svg/32px-Football_Template_USA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interception","football"],["penalty","american_football"]],"members":["interception","penalty"],"related":["Interception","Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers","American_football","Fumble","Interception_(football)","Turnover_on_downs","First_down","Touchdown","Fourth_down_conversion","Penalty_(American_football)"]}
