It forms a center from which other roots sprout laterally.<ref>[http://www.hcs.ohio-\n  state.edu/mg/manual/botany.htm Botany Manual: Ohio State University]</ref>\n  Plants with taproots are difficult to transplant. The presence of a taproot is\n  why dandelions are hard to uprootâ€”the top is pulled, but the long taproot\n  stays in the ground, and resprouts.\n\nThe 'taproot system' contrasts with the fibrous root system with many\nbranched roots.\n",
