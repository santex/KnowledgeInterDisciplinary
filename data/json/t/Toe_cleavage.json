Manolo\n Blahnik himself opined that \"the secret of toe cleavage, a very important part\n of the sexuality of the shoe\" is that \"You must only show the first two\n cracks.\". Shoe designer Christian Louboutin takes a more provocative\n view of toe cleavage and states \"The point is, it's more provocative to show a\n low toe cleavage than it is wearing sandals that reveal all. In flip-flops you\n see everything but that is not at all sexy.\" He takes this further by relating\n \"The curved inside part of the foot, the instep, is the most sexy part so I\n like to close the heel and reveal the arch.\" \"According to fashion\n insiders, \"toe-cleavage shoes sans stockings\" are part of the \"unwritten dress\n code\" of the \"Voguette\", as dictated by the magazine's longtime editor in chief\n Anna Wintour -- \"even in the bitter New York winter\". {{cite book\n |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CfGhPz7bn4YC |title=Front Row: Anna\n Wintour, the Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor in Chief |author=Jerry\n Oppenheimer |year=2005 |publisher=Vogue |quote=A ... candidate for a ...\n features editor job ... had been well-briefed by a friend, a Voguette already\n safely ensconced in the elite fold, as to the toe-cleavage shoes sans\n stockings.

A\npump (court shoe) with a \"slightly low vamp for a hint of toe cleavage\" should\nnot be \"too racy for a conservative office\". {{cite book\n|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xa0xH28Ujn0C |title=The Pocket Stylist:\nBehind-the-Scenes Expertise from a Fashion Pro on Creating Your Own Look\n|author=Kendall Farr |year=2004 |publisher=Gotham Books |isbn=1-59240-041-\n8}} Financial guru Suze Orman says it is \"the only cleavage that should be\nshown around an office\". {{cite book\n|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wTfnTYVIJGEC |title=FabJob Guide to Become\na Personal Shopper |author=Laura Harrison McBride |others=Peter J Gallanis\n|year=2004 |publisher=FabJob.com |isbn=1-894638-55-7}}\n\nThe implied sexual aspects also come into play for some.
