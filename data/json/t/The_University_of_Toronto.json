It was founded by\nroyal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher\nlearning in Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the\nuniversity assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution.\nAs a collegiate university, it comprises twelve colleges that differ in\ncharacter and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and\ninstitutional affairs.\n\nAcademically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and\ncurricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as\nthe Toronto School. The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell\nresearch, and was the site of the first practical electron microscope, the\ndevelopment of multi-touch technology, the identification of Cygnus X-1 as a\nblack hole, and the theory of NP completeness. By a significant margin, it\nreceives the most annual research funding of any Canadian university. It is one\nof two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the\nUnited States.\n\nThe Varsity Blues are the athletic teams representing the university in\nintercollegiate league matches, with particularly long and storied ties to\ngridiron football and ice hockey. The university's Hart House is an early\nexample of the North American student centre, simultaneously serving cultural,\nintellectual and recreational interests within its large Gothic-revival complex.\n\nThe University of Toronto has educated two Governors General and four Prime\nMinisters of Canada, four foreign leaders, fourteen Justices of the Supreme\nCourt, and has been affiliated with ten Nobel laureates. The university ranks\n21st in the world in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, 27th\nin the Academic Ranking of World Universities and 19th in the QS World\nUniversity Rankings.\n","linknr":2187,"url":"The_University_of_Toronto","recorded":1362557134,"links":138,"instances":["company","actor","architecture","ttc","moon","toronto","sport","artists","university_of_toronto","moon","university_of_toronto","toronto","ice_hockey","politician","ttc","toronto","universities","ttc","ttc","ttc","toronto"],"pdf":["http://www.finance.utoronto.ca/Assets/Finance+Digital+Assets/reports/endow/2012.pdf","http://www.finance.utoronto.ca/Assets/Finance+Digital+Assets/reports/endow/2012.pdf","http://www.utoronto.ca/__shared/assets/UofT_2010_FactsFiguresReport4316.pdf","http://www.utoronto.ca/__shared/assets/UofT_2010_FactsFiguresReport4316.pdf","http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Policies/uoftact.pdf","http://www.finance.utoronto.ca/Assets/Finance+Digital+Assets/reports/financial/2010.pdf","http://www.finance.utoronto.ca/Assets/Finance+Digital+Assets/reports/financial/2010.pdf","http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Emmanuel/The+History+of+Victory+University+and+Emmanuel+College.pdf","http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Emmanuel/The+History+of+Victory+University+and+Emmanuel+College.pdf","http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstat08.pdf","http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstat08.pdf","http://www.library.utoronto.ca/library/aboutlibraries/annualreport/2007/complete-report06-07.pdf","http://www.library.utoronto.ca/library/aboutlibraries/annualreport/2007/complete-report06-07.pdf","http://www.utac.utoronto.ca/images/Documents/Malcove%20Collection_Object%20List.pdf","http://www.utac.utoronto.ca/images/Documents/Malcove%20Collection_Object%20List.pdf","http://www.utac.utoronto.ca/images/ut%20and%20uc%20collections%20for%20web.pdf","http://www.utac.utoronto.ca/images/ut%20and%20uc%20collections%20for%20web.pdf","http://www.researchinfosource.com/media/2011Top50Listsup.pdf","http://www.researchinfosource.com/media/2011Top50Listsup.pdf","http://www.research.utoronto.ca/about/pdf/annualreport_2006.pdf","http://www.research.utoronto.ca/about/pdf/annualreport_2006.pdf","http://www.research.utoronto.ca/about/pdf/annualreport_2007.pdf","http://www.research.utoronto.ca/about/pdf/annualreport_2007.pdf","http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/pdf/osm_aviation.pdf","http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/pdf/osm_aviation.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040925085820/http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~williams/History_web_site/World+map+first+page/Canada/a2004.pdf","http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~williams/History_web_site/World%20map%20first%20page/Canada/a2004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040925085820/http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~williams/History_web_site/World+map+first+page/Canada/a2004.pdf","http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/pdf/1998_masui.pdf","http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/pdf/1998_masui.pdf","http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2008/080508/pdf/nj7192-252a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2008/080508/pdf/nj7192-252a.pdf","http://varsityblues.ca.ismmedia.com/ISM2//Football/2008%20UofT%20Football%20Media%20Guide.pdf","http://varsityblues.ca.ismmedia.com/ISM2//Football/2008%20UofT%20Football%20Media%20Guide.pdf","http://www.varsityblues.ca/documents/2008/12/17/2008-09%20Men's%20Hockey%20Brochure.pdf","http://www.varsityblues.ca/documents/2008/12/17/2008-09%20Men's%20Hockey%20Brochure.pdf","http://www.varsityblues.ca/documents/2008/12/17/2008-09%20Men's%20Basketball%20Brochure.pdf","http://www.varsityblues.ca/documents/2008/12/17/2008-09%20Men's%20Basketball%20Brochure.pdf"],"categories":["University
