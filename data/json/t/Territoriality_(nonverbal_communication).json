{"cursor":"3624","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Territoriality' is a term associated with nonverbal communication that refers\nto how people use space to communicate ownership/occupancy of areas and\npossessions . The anthropological concept branches from the observations of\nanimal ownership behaviors. We can consider that this personal space is like a\nbubble that one doesn't want invaded.\n\nAn example of demonstrating territoriality might be the car size. Driving a\nlarge truck like the Ford F350 might be communicating that a value of owning a\nlot of space on the highway. However, driving a small car like the Ford Pinto,\nthen might be communicating no need to occupy so much space. Another example is\nstudents as they sit in class. Some students like to spread their backpack and\nbooks out in a way to let other students know that they don't want others to sit\nnext to them. These students obviously value having a lot of space that they\ndon't have to share. On the other hand, some students keep their books and bags\nclose to them, making others aware that they don't have a problem sharing the\nspace around them with other students.\n\nTerritoriality can also be associated with states or nations. Government and\nsocial ideas are also associated with Territoriality. A nation state can\nestablish common ideals amongst its citizens which lead to territoriality.\nNationalism is an example of this. National pride, common religious practices,\nand politics all play a role in a state's territoriality.\n\nAn example of this would be the conflict in Northern Ireland. Ireland is a\ncatholic nation and England is a Protestant one. Many Irishman don't want\nNorthern Ireland to be a part of a non-catholic nation. Territory disputes in\nthis area have been justified by religion. This is an example of how religion\ncan play a strong role in territoriality.\n\nAccording to author Julia T. Wood, \"men go into women's spaces more than women\nenter men's spaces\" . With this in mind, we can understand that men typically\nhave a stronger sense of ownership and are more likely to challenge others'\nboundaries. People respond to invasion of territory in different ways depending\non what their comfort norms are. Wood (2007) presents three common responses:\n\n# When someone moves too close for comfort, you might step away, giving up your\n# territory. This reaction is typical of feminine people. When people have to\n# fit into close spaces, they often look down as a submissive way of showing\n# that they are not trying to invade others' territories. When someone moves too\n# close, you might refuse to give up your territory. This reaction is typical of\n# masculine people.\n\nThe term stimulated Edward T. Hall to create the word proxemics, which refers to\nhow people use space, but not necessarily how people communicate ownership
