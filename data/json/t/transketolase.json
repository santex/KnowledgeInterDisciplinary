It catalyzes two important\nreactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the\nfirst reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine\ndiphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-\nP), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a\n7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-\nP yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle,\ntransketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-\nP and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose\nD-xylulose-5-P.\n\nThe second reaction catalyzed by transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway\ninvolves the same thiamine diphosphate-mediated transfer of a 2-carbon fragment\nfrom D-xylulose-5-P to the aldose erythrose-4-phosphate, affording fructose 6-\nphosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P. Again, in the Calvin cycle exactly the same\nreaction occurs, but in the opposite direction. Moreover, in the Calvin cycle\nthis is the first reaction catalyzed by transketolase, rather than the second.\n\nIn mammals, transketolase connects the pentose phosphate pathway to glycolysis,\nfeeding excess sugar phosphates into the main carbohydrate metabolic pathways.\nIts presence is necessary for the production of NADPH, especially in tissues\nactively engaged in biosyntheses, such as fatty acid synthesis by the liver and\nmammary glands, and for steroid synthesis by the liver and adrenal glands.\nThiamine diphosphate] is an essential cofactor, along with calcium.\n\nTransketolase is abundantly expressed in the mammalian cornea by the stromal\nkeratocytes and epithelial cells and is reputed to be one of the corneal\ncrystallins.\n","linknr":378,"url":"transketolase","recorded":1362580921,"links":20,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photosynthesis","EC 2.2.1"],"headings":["Species distribution","Structure","Mechanism","Role in disease","Diagnostic use","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/E4P_in_Transketolase_Active_Site.jpg/220px-E4P_in_Transketolase_Active_Site.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Transketolase_Mechanism_using_TPP.jpg/350px-Transketolase_Mechanism_using_TPP.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/R_Groups_in_Transketolase_Mechanism.png/350px-R_Groups_in_Transketolase_Mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor","substrate"],"related":["Enzyme","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Calvin_cycle","Photosynthesis","Thiamine_diphosphate","D-xylulose-5-P","D-ribose-5-P","Sedoheptulose-7-P","Glyceraldehyde-3-P","Erythrose-4-phosphate","Fructose_6-phosphate","Glycolysis","NADPH","Liver","Mammary_glands","Steroid","Liver","Adrenal_glands","Calcium","Cornea","Corneal_keratocyte","Crystallin","Active_site","Arginine","Histidine","Serine","Aspartate","Glutamate","Phosphate","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Monosaccharide","Keto","Fructose","Ribose","Hydroxyl","Ketose","Aldose","Proton","Fructose_6-phosphate","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Thiamin_pyrophosphate","Erythrose-4-phosphate","Deprotonation","Aldehyde","Hydrogen_bonds","Ionic_bond","Chemical_polarity","Salt_bridge","Carbanion","Carbonyl","Amino_acids","Mutant","Malnutrition","Beriberi","Wernicke-Korsakoff_syndrome","Erythrocyte","Thiamine","Wernicke's_encephalopathy"]}
