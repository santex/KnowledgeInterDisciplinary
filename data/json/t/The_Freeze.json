Hanger, Clif (2005). \"I Hate\nTourists, Tourists SUCK, It's only their daughters I wanna fuck\" in \"I Hate\nTourists\"[Record Liner Notes]. Hamilton: Schizophrenic Records. The band's first release was the \"I Hate\nTourists / Don't forget me Tommy\" 7 inch which was released in 1980. The\nFreeze had nine songs appear on the important New England punk rock compilation\n\"This is Boston Not LA\" in 1981. They have recorded many full length albums\nincluding \"Land of the Lost\", \"Rabid Reaction\", \"Misery Loves Company\" and\narguably their greatest album, \"Freak Show\" which was released in the early\n1990s. The Freeze's last studio album entitled \"One False Move\" was released in\n1999. The album's cover art was drawn by the late American artist, writer, and\nCape Cod resident Edward Gorey.\n\nThe band is known for their dark lyrics, original punk rock melodies, and their\nlongevity. A lot of their early lyrics deal with alienation, drug-use/abuse and\nparanoia [especially of the government and especially of the Reagan-Bush years].\nA constant theme or thread regarding apathetic observers or people willing to\ngive up their freedoms for fear of losing their \"security\" is also apparent in\ntheir work.\n\nA major amount of the bands creativity seems to spring from the constant\nfriction between founding members Hangar and Close, who have had a legendarily\ntumultuous on-again off-again musical relationship.\n\nDr. Strange Records is in the process of releasing all of The Freeze's extensive\nback catalog. Band founder, songwriter, and vocalist Clif Hangar is the only\nmember that has been in every incarnation of the band which has seen many line-\nup changes in its past. Guitarist Bill Close has been in many of the line-ups\nover the years.\n\nAs of 2005, a newly reformed Freeze began playing occasional shows in the\nBoston area. In 2009, they toured Europe. In 2011, they released an EP, Blood\nFlows Home.\n","linknr":133,"url":"The_Freeze","recorded":1362893107,"links":16,"instances":["freeze","freeze_album","freeze_album"],"pdf":["http://www.bostonpunk.org/stuff/Issue%202.pdf"],"categories":["American punk rock groups","Hardcore punk groups from Massachusetts","Musical quintets","Musical groups established in 1978"],"headings":["Discography","Members","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lost_and_found(de"],["land_of_the_lost","freeze_album"],["misery_loves_company","freeze"],["one_false_move","freeze_album"]],"members":["misery_loves_company","land_of_the_lost","one_false_move"],"related":["Guitar","Vocals","Bass_guitar","Drumkit","Hardcore_punk","Punk_rock","Modern_Method_Records","Taang!","Lost_And_Found(DE)","Doctor_Strange","Schitzophrenic","Beer_City","Cape_Cod","Edward_Gorey","Bill_Close","This_Is_Boston,_Not_L.A.","Land_of_the_Lost_(Freeze_Album)","Rabid_Reaction","Misery_Loves_Company_(Freeze)","One_False_Move_(Freeze_album)"]}
