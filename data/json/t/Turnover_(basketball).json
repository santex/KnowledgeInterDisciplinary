{"cursor":"1287","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In basketball, a 'turnover' occurs when a player loses possession to the\nopposing team. This can result from the ball being stolen, the player making\nmistakes such as stepping out or throwing the ball out of bounds, or committing\na violation (such as traveling) or committing an offensive foul.\n\nSome players are prone to turnovers because of having poor court vision or\nmaking mental mistakes. Also, many superstars average more turnovers than\nanybody on their team as they will often be handling the ball. It is unusual for\nthe best player of a team to have zero turnovers. Also, a point guard may often\nhave the most turnovers because they are usually the player that possesses the\nball most for their respective team.\n\nTurnovers were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1977â78 season\nand ABA during the 1967â68 season.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Turnover_(basketball)","recorded":1362554906,"links":16,"instances":["basketball","basketball","basketball"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Basketball terminology","Basketball statistics"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Basketball.png/120px-Basketball.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["steal","basketball"],["traveling","basketball"],["foul","basketball"]],"members":["steal","foul","traveling"],"related":["Basketball","Steal_(basketball)","Traveling_(basketball)","Foul_(basketball)","Point_guard","1977-78_NBA_season","1967-68_ABA_season","List_of_National_Basketball_Association_career_turnovers_leaders"]}
