{"cursor":"14767","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Thermal mass' is a concept in building design that describes how the mass of\nthe building provides \"inertia\" against temperature fluctuations, sometimes\nknown as the 'thermal flywheel effect'. [http://www.theyellowhouse.org.uk/eco-\nprin/princip.html Principles of eco-design] For example, when outside\ntemperatures are fluctuating throughout the day, a large thermal mass within the\ninsulated portion of a house can serve to \"flatten out\" the daily temperature\nfluctuations, since the thermal mass will absorb thermal energy when the\nsurroundings are higher in temperature than the mass, and give thermal energy\nback when the surroundings are cooler, without reaching thermal equilibrium.\nThis is distinct from a material's insulative value, which reduces a building's\nthermal conductivity, allowing it to be heated or cooled relatively separate\nfrom the outside, or even just retain the occupants' thermal energy longer.\n\nScientifically, thermal mass is equivalent to 'thermal capacitance' or 'heat\ncapacity', the ability of a body to store thermal energy. It is typically\nreferred to by the symbol C th and measured in units of J/Â°C or J/K\n(which are equivalent). Thermal mass may also be used for bodies of water,\nmachines or machine parts, living things, or any other structure or body in\nengineering or biology. In those contexts, the term \"heat capacity\" is typically\nused instead.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Thermal_mass","recorded":1362500125,"links":16,"instances":["architecture","stes","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.ogdenmfg.com/pdf/tech9.pdf"],"categories":["Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning","Heat transfer","Mass","Thermodynamics"],"headings":["Background","Thermal mass in buildings","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Heavy_vs_light_weight_school_classroom.JPG/300px-Heavy_vs_light_weight_school_classroom.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/9/72958951ab2f1373d8e184846804234f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/2/432c091f1183030184f0185cb2858720.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/b/9/3b9bdeacfff68d79949d5d0626c1bbbc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/b/b0b7995f9fda18f236d91e7ea6e21270.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/8/6f8f57715090da2632453988d9a1501b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/5/ec50ec97ce9f658500f4c797d1d31c6e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Classroom_thermal_mass.JPG/220px-Classroom_thermal_mass.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Santa_Fe_adobe.jpg/220px-Santa_Fe_adobe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["ventilation","architecture"],["seasonal_thermal_energy_storage","stes"],["seasonal_thermal_energy_storage","stes"]],"members":["ventilation","seasonal_thermal_energy_storage","mole"],"related":["Thermal_equilibrium","Thermal_insulation","Thermal_conductivity","Thermal_energy","Extensive_property","Intensive_property","Mass","Mole_(unit)","Specific_heat_capacity","Passive_solar_design","HVAC","Building_services_engineering","Architect","HVAC","Boiler","Specific_heat_capacity","Density","Mass","Passive_solar_design","Adobe","Rammed_earth","Diurnal_temperature_variation","Volumetric_heat_capacity","Ventilation_(architecture)","Water","Acrylic_resin","Thermal_conductivity","Concrete","Insulating_concrete_form","Thermal_inertia","Brick","Adobe","Dirt","Earth_sheltering","Rammed_earth","Stonemasonry","Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage_(STES)","Hockerton_Housing_Project","Specific_heat_capacity","Thermal_energy_storage","Trombe_wall","Rammed_earth","Seasonal_thermal_energy_storage_(STES)","Earthship"]}
