{"cursor":"7476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'provisional government' is an emergency or interim government set up when a\npolitical void has been created by the collapse of a very large government. The\nearly provisional governments were created to prepare for the return of royal\nrule. Irregularly convened assemblies during the English Revolution, such as\nConfederate Ireland (1641â49), were described as \"provisional.\" The practice of\nusing \"provisional government\" as part of a formal name can be traced to\nTalleyrand's government in France in 1814. The numerous provisional governments\nduring the Revolutions of 1848 gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal\ngovernment established to prepare for elections. The most notable provisional\ngovernment was the Russian Provisional Government in 1917\n\nProvisional governments are generally unelected and tend to arise in association\nwith or in the aftermath of civil or foreign wars.
