{"cursor":"7688","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Transduction' is the process by which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to\nanother by a virus. It also refers to the\nprocess whereby foreign DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector.\nTransduction does not require physical contact between the cell donating the DNA\nand the cell receiving the DNA (which occurs in conjugation), and it is DNAase\nresistant (transformation is susceptible to DNAase). Transduction is a common\ntool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host\ncell's genome.\n\nWhen bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) infect a bacterial cell,\ntheir normal mode of reproduction is to harness the replicational,\ntranscriptional, and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make\nnumerous virions, or complete viral particles, including the viral DNA or RNA\nand the protein coat.\n\nTransduction is especially important because it explains one mechanism by which\nantibiotic drugs become ineffective due to the transfer of antibiotic-resistance\ngenes between bacteria. In addition, hopes to create medical methods of genetic\nmodification of diseases such as Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy are based\nupon these methodologies.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Transduction_(genetics)","recorded":1362507545,"links":36,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.med.umich.edu/vcore/protocols/RetroviralCellScreenInfection13FEB2006.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular biology","Virology","Bacteriophages"],"headings":["Lytic and lysogenic (temperate) cycles","Transduction as a method for transferring genetic material","Medical Applications","RNA, DNA","More general uses of the term","Discovery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Transduction_%28genetics%29en.svg/350px-Transduction_%28genetics%29en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["transformation","genetics"]],"members":["translation","transcription","transformation"],"related":["DNA","Bacterium","Virus","Viral_vector","Transformation_(genetics)","Genome","Phage","DNA_replication","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Virions","Lytic","Lysogenic","Lysis","Phage","Bacterial_conjugation","Λ_phage","Esther_Lederberg","Lysis","DNA","SiRNA","Molecular_biology","Viral_vector","Phage","Electroporation","Transfection","Transformation_(genetics)","Norton_Zinder","Joshua_Lederberg","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison"]}
