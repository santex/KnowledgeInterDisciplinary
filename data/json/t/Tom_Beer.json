He played as a tight end in 42\ngames for the Patriots over the 1970-1972 seasons. Beer had 25 receptions for\n381 yards and three TD's. His longest reception was a 31 yard TD reception on\nOctober 24, 1971.\n\nHe also returned two kickoffs for a total of 19 yards. Beer returned a kickoff 4\nyards to end the 1st half in the Patriots 31-21 loss to the New York Jets at\nHarvard Stadium on September 27, 1970. His longest kickoff return was 15 yards\nat the end of the 1st Quarter in the Patriots 34-10 loss to the New York Jets at\nShea Stadium on October 29, 1972.\n\nBeer lateraled a kickoff to Carl Garrett, who took it 27 yards in the Boston\nPatriots 45-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills at Harvard Stadium on November 1, 1970.\nLater in the same game, he lateraled another kickoff to Garrett, who advanced it\n15 yards. Beer is the only tight end in Patriots history who lateraled a kickoff\nto a teammate.\n\nBeer returned a fumbled punt return by Ike Hill 5 yards in the Patriots 38-33\nwin over the Buffalo Bills at Schaefer Stadium on November 14, 1971.\n\nFollowing his playing days, Beer wrote the sardonically ribald 1974 memoir\nSunday's Fools: Stomped, Tromped, Kicked and Chewed in the NFL, recounting the\nexperience of playing for two of the worst franchises in pro football during his\ncareer. He also was an executive for the New York Stars of the short-lived World\nFootball League.\n\nHe is currently residing in New Jersey.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Tom_Beer","recorded":1375056700,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Tom_E._Beer","/wiki/Detroit,_MI","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Tight_End","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/University_of_Houston","/wiki/Common_Draft","/wiki/1967_NFL_Draft","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/BeerTo00.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=BEERTOM01","/wiki/1967_AFL_season","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/1970_NFL_season","/wiki/1971_NFL_season","/wiki/1972_NFL_season","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Denver_Broncos","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Detroit","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/University_of_Houston","/wiki/Denver_Broncos","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Tight_end","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/New_York_Stars_(WFL)","/wiki/World_Football_League","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=edit&section=2","http://www.footballcardgallery.com/player/Tom+Beer/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Detroit,_MI","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&oldid=546744045","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Houston_Cougars_football_players","/wiki/Category:Denver_Broncos_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Boston_Patriots_players","/wiki/Category:New_England_Patriots_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tom+Beer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tom+Beer","/wiki/Tom_Beer","/wiki/Talk:Tom_Beer","#","/wiki/Tom_Beer","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tom_Beer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tom_Beer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&oldid=546744045","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7814924","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Tom_Beer&id=546744045","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Tom+Beer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Tom+Beer&oldid=546744045&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Beer&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7814924#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Beer","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["wfl"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1944
