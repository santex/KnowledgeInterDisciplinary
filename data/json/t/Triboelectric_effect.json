{"cursor":"12073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'triboelectric effect' (also known as triboelectric charging) is a type of\ncontact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged\nafter they come into contact with another different material through friction.\nRubbing glass with fur, or a comb through the hair, can build up\ntriboelectricity. Most everyday static electricity is triboelectric. The\npolarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials,\nsurface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.\n\nThus, it is not very predictable, and only broad generalizations can be made.\nAmber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by contact and separation (or\nfriction) with a material like wool. This property, first recorded by Thales of\nMiletus, suggested the word \"electricity\" (from William Gilbert's initial\ncoinage, \"electra\"), from the Greek word for amber, Älektron. Other examples of\nmaterials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbed together include\nglass rubbed with silk, and hard rubber rubbed with fur.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Triboelectric_effect","recorded":1362485708,"links":34,"instances":["physics","astronomer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrical phenomena","Electrostatics","Electricity"],"headings":["Triboelectric series","Cause","In aircraft and spacecraft","Risks and counter-measures","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/190px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polarity","physics"],["william_gilbert","astronomer"]],"members":["polarity","william_gilbert"],"related":["Contact_electrification","Electric_charge","Friction","Static_electricity","Polarity_(physics)","Amber","Friction","Wool","Thales","Electricity","William_Gilbert_(astronomer)","Greek_language","Glass","Silk","Rubber","Fur","Triboelectric_series","Polyurethane_foam","Hair","Oily","Skin","Nylon","Dry","Skin","Glass","Polymethyl_methacrylate","Leather","Rabbit","Quartz","Mica","Lead","Cat","Silk","Aluminium","Paper","Cotton","Wool","Steel","Wood","Amber","Sealing_wax","Polystyrene","Balloon","Resin","Rubber","Nickel","Copper","Sulfur","Brass","Silver","Gold","Platinum","Acetate","Rayon","Synthetic_rubber","Polyester","Styrene","Styrofoam_-_a_polystyrene_foam","Orlon","Plastic_wrap","Polyethylene","Scotch_tape","Polypropylene","Vinyl","Polyvinyl_chloride","Silicon","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Silicone","Ebonite","Oxide","Adhesion","Electrochemical_potential","Quantum_tunneling","Electrical_breakdown","Corona_discharge","Friction","Adhesion","Pyroelectricity","Contact_electrification","Atomic_force_microscope","Static_electricity","Electric_spark","Faraday_cage","Energy","Voltage","Capacitance","Joules","Weather","Air_friction","Static_dischargers","NASA","45th_Space_Wing","Grain_elevator","Dust_explosion","Petrol","Diethyl_ether","Methane","Hospital","Textile","Antistatic_agent","Electronic_device","CMOS","Integrated_circuit","MOSFET","Foam","Anti-static_wrist_strap","Integrated_circuit","Carbon_black","Rubber","Opto-isolator","Transistor","Varistor","Antistatic_agent","Contact_electrification","Electrical_phenomena","Electronegativity","Electrophorus","Static_electricity","Triboluminescence","Wimshurst_machine","Xerography","University_of_Minnesota"]}
