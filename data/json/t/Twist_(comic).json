It features parodies of science fiction television\nprograms and films, as well as more conventional cartoon concepts. There are new\nstrips every week. His webcomics are unconventional in that Cook draws and\nwrites all but the punchlines. Many comic ideas also come from fans of this\nsite. He then hosts competitions where readers send in their own punchlines, and\nthen vote for winners on IRC (or, more recently, web-based voting, when there\nwere too few people in IRC to vote). In the past, Cook allowed punchlines to be\nsubmitted directly from anyone on the Internet, but recently, only people with\naccounts (subscription is free) can submit punchlines. This prevents someone\nfrom posing as another person by simply typing the same name in the box.\n\nLike many parody sites, the humor derives from fans' love for the franchise and\noften punchlines reflect more the contrasting intentions and obligations of\nwriters and network executives, rather than the series itself. Fans of the site\nare termed Sevilians [http://sevilians.sev.com.au/].\n\nSev comics are also printed in the Adelaide Sunday Mail, Fiji Times & Herald,\nThe Cairns Post, S-press [http://www.spress.com.au/], and AZ Weekly\n[http://www.azweeklymagazine.com/]. They have been formerly printed in the Dalby\nHerald [http://www.dalbyherald.com.au/], Gympie Times\n[http://www.gympietimes.com.au/], Weipa Bulletin\n[http://www.weipa.biz/section/41.html], and Milton-Ulladulla Express.\n[http://forum.sev.com.au/thread.php?ThreadId=522]\n\nDue to server loads and bandwidth issues, a subscription service was enacted on\nApril 1, 2005. [http://www.sev.com.au/news.php?articleid=2140] (When it was\nenacted, it was thought to be an April Fool's Day joke by some.) To view most of\nthe cartoons on the site, users must register and pay a fee. The memberships\ncost A$15.00 (around 9 Euro or USD 11) per 12 months. Memberships are also\navailable as a bonus when merchandise is bought from the Sev Shop\n[http://www.sev.com.au/sevshop/]. Cartoons from the past month are free for\nviewing. There is also an \"On This Day\" page, where cartoons that were done in\npast years on the current day are shown for free. The subscription service also\nprovides access to thousands of user comments on cartoons, and four exclusive\nsubscriber cartoon storylines.\n\nOn April 6, 2006, Cook added another perk to subscribing. Cook will now draw\ncaricatures of new subscribers or of members updating their subscriptions. These\ncaricatures can be used as avatars on the site. Cook will also send you the\noriginal drawings, if you request them.\n[http://www.sev.com.au/news.php?articleid=2853]\n\nOn October 20, 2006, Cook added a Sev Wiki [http://wiki.sev.com.au/] to the\nsite. [http://www.sev.com.au/news.php?articleid=3231]\n\nOn February 17, 2010, Cook made the decision to virtually shut down the Sev site\nfor good, aside from the occasional A Time to Laugh cartoon.\n[http://www.sev.com.au/news.php?articleid=4416] This decision was not\nunexpected, since the site had been floundering for the previous year and a\nhalf, with updates being late and missed. Cook originally was caught up working\non [http://www.cricket-blog.com/ Cricket Blog], a cricket website, but his\ninterests turned towards [http://www.skepticalscience.com/ Skeptical Science], a\nsite about information on global warming. This site was said to \"take over [his]\nlife so dramatically\" that all other projects, including Sev, Cricket Blog, and\na site dedicated to web programming, are now \"sorely neglected.\" The decision\nwas preceded by fans complaining on the Discussion Board about Cook's \"hobby\"\ntaking over, and it rose to the level of \"personal attacks\" on Cook. Cook denies\nany of the accusations in these attacks. Cook apologizes to all who enjoyed his\ncartoons over the years that they won't be getting any more. Cook's critics are\ndisappointed in his decision, as shown by the following
