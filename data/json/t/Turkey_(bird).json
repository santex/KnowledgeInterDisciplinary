One species, [[Meleagris\ngallopavo]] (commonly known as the Wild Turkey) is native to the forests of\nNorth America. The domestic turkey is a descendant of this species. The other\nliving species is [[Meleagris ocellata]] or the Ocellated Turkey, native to the\nforests of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula.\n\nTurkeys are classed in the taxonomic order of Galliformes. Within this order\nthey are relatives of the grouse family or subfamily. Males of both species have\na distinctive fleshy wattle or protuberance that hangs from the top of the beak\n(called a snood in the Wild Turkey and its domestic descendants). They are among\nthe largest birds in their ranges. As in many galliformes, the male (tom or\ngobbler) is larger and much more colorful than the female (hen). Genus Meleagris\nis the only genus in the subfamily 'Meleagridinae', formerly known as the family\n'Meleagrididae', but now subsumed within the family Phasianidae.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Turkey_(bird)","recorded":1372152243,"links":[],"instances":["biology","anatomy","biology","biology","anatomy","biology","navigator","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Meleagrididae|*","Game birds","Bird genera","Hunting in the United States","Native American cuisine"],"headings":["History and naming","Fossil record","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["taxonomy","biology"],["order","biology"],["family","biology"],["subfamily","biology"],["wattle","anatomy"],["comb","anatomy"],["william_strickland","navigator"],["mya","unit"]],"members":["taxonomy","wattle","order","subfamily","comb","family","william_strickland","mya"],"related":["Wild_Turkey","California","Animal","Chordate","Bird","Galliformes","Phasianidae","Carolus_Linnaeus","Bird","Genus","Wild_Turkey","North_America","Domestic_turkey","Extant_taxon","Ocellated_Turkey","Yucatán_Peninsula","Taxonomy_(biology)","Order_(biology)","Galliformes","Grouse","Family_(biology)","Subfamily_(biology)","Wattle_(anatomy)","Comb_(anatomy)","Galliformes","Americas","Guineafowl","Imported","Central_Europe","Turkey","William_Strickland_(navigator)","Scientific_name","Genus","Greek_language","Guineafowl","Asia","List_of_names_for_the_Wild_Turkey","Australian_Brushturkey","Megapode","Australian_Bustard","Gruiformes","Anhinga","Fossil","Early_Miocene","Mya_(unit)","Extinct","Genus","Late_Miocene","Zanclean","Westmoreland_County,_Virginia","Junior_synonym","California_Turkey","Peacock","Climate_change","Last_glacial_period","Retrotransposon_marker","Phasianidae"]}
