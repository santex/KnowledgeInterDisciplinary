Retrieved\n2010-04-30.\n\nThomas traces its roots to 1916, when it was incorporated as the Perley A.\nThomas Car Works in High Point, North Carolina. The company specialized in the\nmanufacture of electric streetcars; as buses superseded them in the middle of\nthe 20th century, Thomas switched to bus production (primarily school buses). By\nthe 1970s, Thomas Car Works had become one of the dominant school bus\nmanufacturers in North America. In 1972, the company reorganized, adopting its\ncurrent name, Thomas Built Buses.\n","linknr":474,"url":"Thomas_Built_Buses","recorded":1362569994,"links":43,"instances":["bus_chassis","automobile"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bus manufacturers","School bus manufacturers","Motor
