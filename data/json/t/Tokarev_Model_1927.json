As a consequence, production of the\nFedorov Avtomat was halted in 1925 and subsequently it would be withdrawn from\nservice by 1928.\n\nIn 1925 the Soviet Army commission for weapons decided that submachineguns\nshould be introduced into army service, initially as offensive weapons for low-\nranking officers. Consequently a contest was started next year for such weapons.\nTokarev, who was familiar with Fedorov's work, decided to take up the challenge\nof producing a suitable substitute weapon that would work with permissible\nammunition. This resulted in the first Soviet-made submachine gun using the 7.62\nx 38mm Nagant revolver round, because at the time there was no Soviet automatic\npistol round accepted for army use.\n\nThe 1927 Tokarev is a blowback-operated weapon, capable of selective fire, which\nis achieved by using two triggers. The rear trigger fired a single shot, while\nthe front trigger was for fully automatic fire. The butt of the gun has a\nstorage cavity for an additional magazine. The guns is sighted for 100 or 200\nmeters by flipping up one of the two peephole sights on the receiver. A carabine\nprototype was also produced; it has a single trigger, slightly longer barrel,\nand adjustable sights up to 800 meters, despite using the same weak cartridge;\nan exemplar of both variants can now be found at the Military Historical Museum\nof Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps in Saint Petersburg.\n\nOnly a handful of these submachineguns had been ordered for trial purposes, when\nin July 1928 the Soviet Army leadership decided that a single new automatic\ncartridge should be developed for both automatic pistols and submachine guns, to\nbe obtained by modifying the 7.63Ã25mm Mauser round down to the Soviet machinery\nstandard of 7.62 mm. Tokarev had to adapt his design to this new ammunition. By\nthen, the competition had been joined by designs from Degtyarev and Korovin, who\ndesigned their weapons directly for the new round. Trials were conducted in July\n1930, pitted Tokarev models chambered for both rounds against these other two\ndomestic competitors. The Army commission was rather dissatisfied with all guns\npresented at this trial. Eventually, in Feb 1931, the army ordered 500 Tokarevs\nchambered in the revolver round, to be sent to the troops for more extensive\ntrials. The feedback received from the troops was apparently negative.  The number of Tokarev submachineguns (chambered in the\nNagant round) actually produced and delivered remains uncertain.

The army\ncommission eliminated the guns of Korovin, Prilutsk and Kolesnikov as\nunsatisfactory due to their unreliable cycling. Ultimately it was a showdown\nbetween Degtyarev and Tokarev's gun, but except for weight, Degtyarev's model\nproved superior in all other departments: accuracy, muzzle velocity, a lower\nrate of fire (as desired by the army), ease of handling and reliability.\nDegtyarev's model eventually was commissioned in 1935 as the PPD-34.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Tokarev_Model_1927","recorded":1375090753,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Tokarev_SMG_1927.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Tokarev_SMG_1927.jpg/250px-Tokarev_SMG_1927.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg.png","/wiki/Soviet_Union","#cite_note-bolotin-1","/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)","/wiki/Caliber","/wiki/Firearm_action","/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)","/wiki/Rate_of_fire","/wiki/Muzzle_velocity","/wiki/Submachine_gun","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Fedor_Vasilievich_Tokarev","/wiki/Fedorov_Avtomat","#cite_note-2","/wiki/7.62_x_38mm_Nagant","#cite_note-bolotin-1","/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)","/wiki/Selective_fire","/wiki/Carabine","/wiki/Military_Historical_Museum_of_Artillery,_Engineers_and_Signal_Corps","#cite_note-kalash-3","/wiki/7.63%C3%9725mm_Mauser","/wiki/Vasily_Degtyaryov","#cite_note-bolotin-1","#cite_note-kalash-3","/wiki/PPD-34","#cite_note-bolotin-1","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Russian_weaponry","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-bolotin_1-0","#cite_ref-bolotin_1-1","#cite_ref-bolotin_1-2","#cite_ref-bolotin_1-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/5-85503-072-5","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Military_Historical_Museum_of_Artillery,_Engineers_and_Signal_Corps","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/5-98655-006-4","#cite_ref-kalash_3-0","#cite_ref-kalash_3-1","http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/0ca/070_073.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit&section=3","http://www.tokarev.com/rus/tokarev_ppt.html","/wiki/File:SIG220-Morges.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/SIG220-Morges.jpg/35px-SIG220-Morges.jpg","/wiki/Firearm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Firearms-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Firearms-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Firearms-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&oldid=564192775","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Firearms_stubs","/wiki/Category:7.62_mm_firearms","/wiki/Category:Submachine_guns","/wiki/Category:Trial_and_research_firearms","/wiki/Category:Weapons_of_the_Soviet_Union","/wiki/Category:Abandoned_military_projects_of_the_Soviet_Union","/wiki/Category:Submachine_guns_of_Russia","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_Russian-language_external_links","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tokarev+Model+1927&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tokarev+Model+1927","/wiki/Tokarev_Model_1927","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Tokarev_Model_1927","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tokarev_Model_1927","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tokarev_Model_1927","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&oldid=564192775","/w/index.php?title=Tokarev_Model_1927&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4363690","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Tokarev_Model_1927&id=564192775","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Tokarev+Model+1927","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=rend
