In\nthalassemia, the disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood\ncells. Thalassemia is caused by variant or missing genes that affect how the\nbody makes hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries\noxygen. People with thalassemia make less hemoglobin and fewer circulating red\nblood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia.\n\nThalassemia can cause significant complications, including pneumonia, iron\noverload, bone deformities and cardiovascular illness. However this same\ninherited disease of red blood cells may confer a degree of protection against\nmalaria, which is or was prevalent in the regions where the trait is common.\nThis selective survival advantage on carriers (known as heterozygous advantage)\nmay be responsible for perpetuating the mutation in populations. In that\nrespect, the various thalassemias resemble another genetic disorder affecting\nhemoglobin, sickle-cell disease. Weatherall David J, \"Chapter 47.
