{"cursor":"10195","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn thermodynamics, the 'triple point' of a substance is the temperature and\npressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance\ncoexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, the\ntriple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of â38.8344 Â°C and a\npressure of 0.2 mPa.\n\nIn addition to the triple point between solid, liquid, and gas, there can be\ntriple points involving more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple\npolymorphs. Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving\ntwo different fluid phases (see lambda point). In general, for a system with p\npossible phases, there are {p\\choose 3} = \\tfrac16p(p-1)(p-2)\ntriple points.\n\nThe triple point of water is used to define the kelvin, the SI base unit of\nthermodynamic temperature. [http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/\nDefinition of the kelvin] at BIPM The number given for the temperature of\nthe triple point of water is an exact definition rather than a measured\nquantity. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in\nthe ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of\nhydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K).\n","linknr":339,"url":"Triple_point","recorded":1362375241,"links":64,"instances":["data_page","materials_science","phase_transition","data_page","data_page","molecule","data_page","unit","data_page","element","unit","thermodynamics","data_page","matter","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Phase transitions","Thermodynamics","Threshold temperatures"],"headings":["Triple points of water","Triple point cells","Table of triple points","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/e/11e1818f2002ce4bd2402388e10cf00c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Phase-diag2.svg/350px-Phase-diag2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["mercury","element"],["pascal","unit"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["pascal","unit"],["bar","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["sublimation","phase_transition"],["mercury","element"],["water","molecule"],["pascal","unit"],["butane","data_page"],["chloroform","data_page"],["ethanol","data_page"],["formic_acid","data_page"],["hexafluoroethane","data_page"],["isobutane","data_page"],["mercury","element"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"]],"members":["butane","polymorphism","sublimation","hexafluoroethane","chloroform","water","isobutane","pascal","formic_acid","mercury","bar","critical_point","ethanol","phase","atmosphere"],"related":["Thermodynamics","Temperature","Pressure","Phase_(matter)","Gas","Liquid","Solid","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Mercury_(element)","Pascal_(unit)","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Helium-4","Lambda_point","Water","Kelvin","SI","SI_base_unit","ITS-90","Water","Ice","Water_vapour","°C","Pascal_(unit)","Bar_(unit)","Atmosphere_(unit)","Partial_pressure","Outer_space","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Mariner_9","Mars","Laser_altimetry","Ice_Ih","Ice_III","Ice_II","Calibration","Thermometer","Isotope","Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water","International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","Hydrogen","Neon","Oxygen","Argon","Mercury_(element)","Water_(molecule)","National_Bureau_of_Standards","NIST","Kelvin","Pascal_(unit)","Acetylene","Ammonia","Argon","Arsenic","Butane","Butane_(data_page)","Graphite","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon_monoxide","Chloroform","Chloroform_(data_page)","Deuterium","Ethane","Ethanol","Ethanol_(data_page)","Ethylene","Formic_acid","Formic_acid_(data_page)","Helium-4","Lambda_point","Hexafluoroethane","Hexafluoroethane_(data_page)","Hydrogen","Hydrogen_chloride","Iodine","Isobutane","Isobutane_(data_page)","Mercury_(element)","Methane","Neon","Nitric_oxide","Nitrogen","Nitrous_oxide","Oxygen","Palladium","Platinum","Sulfur_dioxide","Titanium","Uranium_hexafluoride","Water","Xenon","Zinc","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)","Gibbs'_phase_rule"]}
