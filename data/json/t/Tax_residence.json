{"cursor":"10561","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Definitions of 'residence for tax purposes' vary considerably from state to\nstate. For individuals, physical presence in a state is an important factor.\nSome states also determine residency of an individual by reference to a variety\nof other factors, such as the ownership of a home or availability of\naccommodation, family, and financial interests. For companies, some states\ndetermine the residence of a corporation based on its place of incorporation.\nOther states determine the residence of a corporation by reference to its place\nof management. Some states use both a place-of-incorporation test and a place-of-\nmanagement test.\n\nDomicile is, in common law jurisdictions, a different legal concept to\nresidence.\n\nResidence as defined in double taxation treaties is different from residence as\ndefined for domestic tax purposes. Tax treaties generally follow the OECD Model\nConvention which provides:\n\n:1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"resident of a Contracting\n:   State\" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax\n:   therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any\n:   other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any\n:   political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does\n:   not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of\n:   income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.\n:2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident\n:   of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:\n:a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a\npermanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in\nboth States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which\nhis personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); :b)\nif the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined,\nor if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be\ndeemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode; :c)\nif he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be\ndeemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national; :d) if he\nis a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of\nthe Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.\n:3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an\n:   individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed\n:   to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective\n:   management is\n:   situated.
