Tennessee's capital and\nsecond largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 609,644. Memphis is\nthe state's largest city, with a population of 652,050.\n\nThe state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier\npact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the\nAppalachians.
