It is a process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer\ncells. It is characterized by a progression of changes on cellular and genetic\nlevel that ultimately reprogram a cell to undergo uncontrolled cell division,\nthus forming a malignant mass.\n\nCell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and\nunder many circumstances. Under normal circumstances, the balance between\nproliferation and programmed cell death, usually in the form of apoptosis, is\nmaintained by tightly regulating both processes to ensure the integrity of\norgans and tissues. Mutations in DNA that lead to cancer (only certain mutations\ncan lead to cancer and the majority of potential mutations will have no bearing)\ndisrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the\nprocesses.\n\nCarcinogenesis is caused by this mutation of the genetic material of normal\ncells, which upsets the normal balance between proliferation and cell death.\nThis results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by\nnatural selection in the body. The uncontrolled and often rapid proliferation of\ncells can lead to benign tumors; some types of these may turn into malignant\ntumors (cancer). Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body or\ninvade other tissues, and they are rarely a threat to life unless they compress\nvital structures or are physiologically active, for instance, producing a\nhormone. Malignant tumors can invade other organs, spread to distant locations\n(metastasis) and become life-threatening.\n\nMore than one mutation is necessary for carcinogenesis. In fact, a series of\nseveral mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a\nnormal cell will transform into a cancer cell. {{cite journal\n| title = A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis journal = Cell volume =\n| 61 issue = 5 pages = 759â67 year = 1990 month = June pmid = 2188735 doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(90)90186-\n| I author1 = Fearon ER author2 = Vogelstein B author-separator = ,\n}} Only mutations in those certain types of genes that play vital roles in\ncell division, apoptosis (cell death), and DNA repair will cause a cell to lose\ncontrol of its cell proliferation.\n\nOncovirinae, viruses that contain an oncogene, are categorized as oncogenic\nbecause they trigger the growth of tumorous tissues in the host. This process is\nalso referred to as viral transformation.\n\nCancer is fundamentally a disease of regulation of tissue growth. In order for a\nnormal cell to transform into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and\ndifferentiation must be altered. Genetic changes can occur at many\nlevels, from gain or loss of entire chromosomes to a mutation affecting a single\nDNA nucleotide. There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by\nthese changes. Oncogenes may be normal genes that are expressed at\ninappropriately high levels, or altered genes that have novel properties. In\neither case, expression of these genes promotes the malignant phenotype of\ncancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division,\nsurvival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often\ndisabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Typically, changes in many genes\nare required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.\n\nThere is a diverse classification scheme for the various genomic changes that\nmay contribute to the generation of cancer cells. Most of these changes are\nmutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. Aneuploidy, the\npresence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not\na mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes\nthrough errors in mitosis.\n\nLarge-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome.\nGenomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of\na small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and\nadjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal\nregions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-\nknown example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of\nchromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results\nin production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.\n\nSmall-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which\nmay occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in\nthe gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein\nproduct. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic\nmaterial from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in\nthe expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.\n","linknr":710,"url":"Tumorigenesis","recorded":1362567697,"links":30,"instances":["medicine","genetics","medical","genetics","biology","biochemistry","genetics","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carcinogenesis","Radiation
