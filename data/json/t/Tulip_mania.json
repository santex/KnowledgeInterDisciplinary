Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the\nExtraordinary Passions It Aroused. Mike Dash (2001). By 1636 the tulip\nbulb became the fourth leading export product of the Netherlandsâafter gin,\nherring and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in\ntulip futures among people who never saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost\nfortunes overnight, to the consternation of Calvinist elites who abhorred this\nartificial frenzy that denied the virtues of moderation, discretion and genuine\nwork. Simon Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch\nCulture in the Golden Age (1997) pp 350â66 esp p. 362\n\nAt the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for\nmore than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally\nconsidered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble), More\nextensive discussion of status as the earliest bubble on pp. 247â48.\nalthough some researchers have noted that the [[Kipper und wipperzeit|Kipper-\nund Wipperzeit]] episode in 1619â22, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the\nmetal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a\nbubble.

The term \"tulip mania\" is now often used metaphorically to refer to\nany large economic bubble (when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values).\n\nThe event was popularized in 1841 by the book [[Extraordinary Popular Delusions\nand the Madness of Crowds]], written by British journalist Charles Mackay.\nAccording to Mackay, at one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a\nSemper Augustus bulb. \"The Tulipomania\", Chapter 3, in .\nMackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and\nDutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic that\nis widely reprinted today, his account is sometimes contested. Some modern\nscholars feel that the mania was not quite as extraordinary as Mackay described.\nSome even argue that not enough price data remain, historically, to represent an\nall out tulip bulb bubble.\n\nResearch on the tulip mania is difficult because of the limited economic data\nfrom the 1630sâmuch of which comes from biased and anti-speculative sources.

Although these explanations are not generally accepted,\nsome modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a\nspeculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers,\nsuch as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices at the time of their\nintroduction, which immediately fell dramatically. The high asset prices may\nalso have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts\ncould be voided for a small costâthus lowering the risk to buyers.\n","linknr":633,"url":"Tulip_mania","recorded":1362373107,"links":62,"instances":["goddess","author","measure","plant","magazine","finance","finance","finance","finance","finance","volume"],"pdf":["http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae9_1_1.pdf","http://www.mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae9_1_1.pdf","http://www.econ.ucla.edu/thompson/Document97.pdf","http://www.econ.ucla.edu/thompson/Document97.pdf"],"categories":["Economic
