It is characterized by a tempo of between\n110 and 150 beats per minute, repeating melodic\nphrases, and a musical form that builds up and down\nthroughout a track. It is a combination of many\nstyles of electronic music such as techno,\nhouse, pop, chill-\nout, classical music, :16 and film music.\n\nTrance employs aural dynamics to a great degree: A characteristic of virtually\nall trance songs is the soft mid-song breakdown, beginning with and occurring after the\norchestration is broken down and the rhythm tracks fade out rapidly, leaving the\nmelody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for anywhere from seconds to a few\nminutes. When vocals are present in trance, they are generally sung by a female\nwith a soaring, operatic voice ranging from mezzo-soprano to soprano, best\ndescribed as \"ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths\".
