Since then, the term and the methodology it\nrepresents has gained currency in the social sciences and beyond. Today, \"thick\ndescription\" is used in a variety of fields, including the type of literary\ncriticism known as New Historicism.\n\nIn his essay \"Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture\"\n(1973), Geertz explains that he adopted the term from philosopher Gilbert Ryle,\nspecifically his lecture \"What is le Penseur doing?\"\n","linknr":118,"url":"Thick_description","recorded":1362568374,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social sciences","Anthropology"],"headings":["Adoption","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/P_human_body.svg/30px-P_human_body.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["georgia","u.s._state"]],"members":["georgia"],"related":["Anthropology","Anthropologist","Clifford_Geertz","Ethnography","Social_science","Literary_criticism","New_Historicism","Gilbert_Ryle","Wicca","Atlanta","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Contextualism","Cultural_studies","Indexicality","Deirdre_McCloskey"]}
