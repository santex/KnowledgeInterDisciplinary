{"cursor":"3530","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'T.A.G.' is a DOS-based bulletin board system (BBS) software program, released\nfrom 1986 to 2000.\n\nT.A.G. was written in Borland Pascal and is free for business or personal use\n(They considered it fun to give the program away while others tried to charge\nfor them). http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/IBM/DOS/TAG/\n\n'Authors over the years:' Victor Capton, Randy Goebel, Alan Jurison, Paul\nLoeber, Robert Numerick and Paul Williams. All live in the Detroit (MI) area\nexcept Alan Jurison who lives in Syracuse (NY).\n\n'Peak number of running systems:' Just over 1000, mostly in the United States\nand Canada.\n\n'Areas of major T.A.G. BBS concentrations:'\n* Michigan: Detroit (where it started), Lansing, Flint and Battle Creek\n* California: Oakland\n* Connecticut: Hartford\n* Florida: Jacksonville and Cocoa\n* Maryland: Baltimore.\n* New Jersey: Newark\n* New York: Syracuse\n* North Carolina: Raleigh\n* Ontario, Canada: Windsor and Hamilton\n* Pennsylvania: Pittsburgh\n* Texas: Houston, Beaumont and Fort Worth\n* Virginia: Norfolk\n\nA quote from one of the authors:\n: We all poured countless hours into the development and support of people\n: running BBSs. Even today I don't think the internet has come close to the\n: sense of community and simple accomplishment that BBSing provided. Building\n: and running a complete environment on your local computer and watching people\n: use it is a far different experience than putting up a web page on some remote\n: server. We all made and still have a great many friends from being sysops and\n: BBS developers.\n\nOther Notes:\n: No one ever got them to answer definitively on what their name stood for, but\n: there was a reasonably reliable rumor that it was from \"The Adventurer's\n: Guild\" which was a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] sort of reference.{{Citation\n: needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe only known T.A.G. BBS still in existence can be accessed via telnet at\ndiskbox.homeip.net\n","linknr":125,"url":"TAG_(BBS)","recorded":1362575038,"links":13,"instances":["mi","ny"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bulletin board system software","DOS software","1986 introductions"],"headings":["Intro Screen","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Synaptic.png/24px-Synaptic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["detroit","mi"],["syracuse","ny"]],"members":["detroit","syracuse"],"related":["DOS","Bulletin_board_system","Software_program","Borland_Pascal","Detroit_(MI)","Syracuse_(NY)","United_States","Canada","Michigan","Detroit","Lansing","Flint","Battle_Creek","California","Oakland","Connecticut","Hartford","Florida","Jacksonville","Cocoa,_Florida","Maryland","Baltimore","New_Jersey","Newark,_New_Jersey","New_York","Syracuse,_New_York","North_Carolina","Raleigh,_North_Carolina","Ontario","Canada","Windsor,_Ontario","Hamilton,_Ontario","Pennsylvania","Pittsburgh","Texas","Houston","Beaumont,_Texas","Fort_Worth","Virginia","Norfolk"]}
