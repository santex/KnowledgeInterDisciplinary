{"cursor":"25326","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Tyrosine hydroxylase' or 'tyrosine 3-monooxygenase' is the enzyme responsible\nfor catalyzing the conversion of the amino acid L -tyrosine to L -3,4-\ndihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA). It does so using\nmolecular oxygen (O 2), as well as iron (Fe 2+ ) and\ntetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. L -DOPA is a precursor for\ndopamine, which, in turn, is a precursor for the important neurotransmitters\nnorepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). Tyrosine\nhydroxylase catalyzes the rate limiting step in this synthesis of\ncatecholamines. In humans, tyrosine hydroxylase is encoded by the TH gene, and the enzyme is present in the central nervous system\n(CNS), peripheral sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Tyrosine hydroxylase, phenylalanine hydroxylase and\ntryptophan hydroxylase together make up the family of aromatic amino acid\nhydroxylases (AAAHs).\n","linknr":921,"url":"Tyrosine_hydroxylase","recorded":1362511017,"links":32,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","genetics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes","EC 1.14.16"],"headings":["Reaction","Structure","Regulation","Clinical significance","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Tyrosine_hydroxylase_showing_all_four_subunits.png/250px-Tyrosine_hydroxylase_showing_all_four_subunits.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/PBB_GE_TH_208291_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_TH_208291_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Tyrosine_to_L-DOPA_reaction_TH.svg/220px-Tyrosine_to_L-DOPA_reaction_TH.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Tyrosine_hydroxylase_from_rat_showing_two_of_its_domains.png/220px-Tyrosine_hydroxylase_from_rat_showing_two_of_its_domains.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Catecholamines_biosynthesis.svg/220px-Catecholamines_biosynthesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/PDB_1toh_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1toh_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PDB_2toh_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_2toh_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["meta-","chemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["cofactor","substrate","transcription"],"related":["Enzyme","Amino_acid","L-tyrosine","L-DOPA","Molecular_oxygen","Ferrous","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Dopamine","Norepinephrine","Epinephrine","Catecholamines","Gene","Central_nervous_system","Adrenal_medulla","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Tryptophan_hydroxylase","Biopterin-dependent_aromatic_amino_acid_hydroxylase","Tyrosine","L-DOPA","Catalysis","Hydroxylation","Meta-_(chemistry)","Oxygenase","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Dehydration_reaction","6,7-dihydropteridine_reductase","Iron","Oxidation_state","Aromatic_L-amino_acid_decarboxylase","Dopamine_beta_hydroxylase","Cytosol","Catecholamines","Rate_limiting_step","Indole","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Tetramer","Protein_subunit","Homotetramer","Protein_domain","Carboxyl_terminal","Alpha_helix","Histidine","Glutamate","Amino_terminal","Active_site","Alternative_splicing","Intrinsically_unstructured_protein","Tertiary_structure","Secondary_structure","X-ray_crystallography","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Tryptophan_hydroxylase","Sequence_homology","Biopterin-dependent_aromatic_amino_acid_hydroxylase","Phosphorylation","Serine","Protein_kinases","Protein_kinase_A","Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase","MAPKAPK2","Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases","Enzyme_activity","14-3-3_proteins","Hormones","Glucocorticoids","Cocaine","Second_messengers","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","Transcription_(genetics)","Nicotine","Protein_synthesis","Segawa's_dystonia","Parkinson's_disease","Schizophrenia","Alzheimer's_disease","Huntington's_disease","Autoimmune_polyendocrine_syndrome","Parkinson's_disease","Substantia_nigra","Dopamine","Parkinson's_disease","Pathogenetic","Hydrogen_peroxide","Reactive_oxygen_species","Cytotoxic","Metirosine","Pheochromocytoma","Hypertension","Oudenone","Aquayamycin"]}
