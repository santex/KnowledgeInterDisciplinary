The restriction may be of one or both and depends on the\nhold used and the reaction of the victim. The lack of blood or air may lead to\nunconsciousness or even death if the hold is maintained. Chokeholds are used in\nmartial arts, combat sports, self-defense, law enforcement and in military hand\nto hand combat applications. They are considered superior to brute-force manual\nstrangling, which generally requires a large disparity in physical strength to\nbe effective.<ref name=jones>Jones, Richard.\n[http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm Asphyxia],\n[http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm Strangulation].\nwww.forensicmed.co.uk.

This can be\nmisleading as most holds aim to strangle not choke with the exception of \"air\nchokes\" (choking means \"to have severe difficulty in breathing because of a\nconstricted or obstructed throat or a lack of air\"<ref name=oxford/>). In Judo\nterminology, \"blood chokes\" are referred to as \"strangleholds\" or \"strangles\"\nwhile \"air chokes\" are called \"chokeholds\" or \"chokes\".<ref name=ohlenkamp/> In\nforensics the terms \"strangle\" and \"stranglehold\" designate any type of neck\ncompression,<ref name=jones/> while in law-enforcement they are referred to as\n\"neck holds\".<ref name=reay>Reay, Donald; Eisele, John.\n[http://www.charlydmiller.com/LIB/1982neckholds.html Death from law enforcement\nneck holds]. www.charlydmiller.com.URL last accessed March 3, 2006</ref> </div>\n",
