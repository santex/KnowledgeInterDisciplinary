Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form\nstacks of disks referred to as 'grana' (singular: 'granum'). Grana are connected\nby 'intergranal' or 'stroma' thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a\nsingle functional compartment.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"thylakoid","recorded":1363385139,"links":[],"instances":["botanist","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Membrane biology","Organelles","Photosynthesis"],"headings":["Etymology","Thylakoid structure","Thylakoid formation","Thylakoid isolation and fractionation","Thylakoid proteins","Thylakoid function","Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["arthur_meyer","botanist"]],"members":["arthur_meyer","translation","transcription"],"related":["Chloroplast","Cyanobacterium","Light-dependent_reactions","Photosynthesis","Latin","Greek_language","Stromal_cell","Light-dependent_reactions","Photosynthetic_pigment","Nanometre","Phospholipids","Encyclop√¶dia_Britannica_2006_Ultimate_Reference_Suite_DVD","Galactolipid","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Thylakoid_membrane","Photophosphorylation","Photosynthesis","Electron_tomography","Helix","Proplastid","Seedling","Etioplast","Etiolation","Chlamydomonas","Centrifugation","Sodium_carbonate","Peripheral_membrane_protein","Detergent","Organic_solvent","Integral_membrane_protein","Proteomics","Proteome","Protein_targeting","Protein_folding","Oxidative_stress","Translation_(biology)","Integral_membrane_protein","Photosystem","Photosystem_I","Photosystem_II","Cytochrome_b6f_complex","ATP_synthase","Electron_transport_chain","Chemiosmotic_potential","NADPH","Redox","ATP_synthase","Adenosine_triphosphate","Photophosphorylation","Antenna_complex","Chlorophyll","Photosynthetic_pigment","Carotenoids","Phycobiliprotein","P700","P680","Visible_spectrum","Light-independent_reaction","Plastocyanin","Oxygen_evolving_complex","Twin-arginine_translocation_pathway","Genome","Endosymbiont","Cell_nucleus","Stoichiometry","Transcription_(genetics)","Light","Phosphorylation","Kinase","Translation_(biology)","Negative_feedback","MRNA","Signal_peptide","Secretory_pathway","Twin-arginine_translocation_pathway","Arginine","Signal_recognition_particle","Light-dependent_reactions","Oxygen_evolution","Cellular_respiration","Stromal_cell","Thylakoid_lumen","Acidic","Proton","Photolysis","Photosystem_II","Oxygen","Electron","Plastoquinone","Light-dependent_reactions","Plastoquinone","Ferredoxin","Light-dependent_reactions","Mitochondria","Proton_motive_force","Chemical_potential","Electrical_potential","Membrane_potential","Chemiosmotic_potential","Stromal_cell","ATP_synthase","ATP_synthase","Light-dependent_reactions","Cyanobacteria","Photosynthesis","Cellular_respiration","Bacteria","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Plasma_membrane","Phycobilisomes","Arthur_Meyer_(botanist)","Chemiosmosis","Electrochemical_potential","Endosymbiosis","Oxygen_evolution","Photosynthesis"]}
