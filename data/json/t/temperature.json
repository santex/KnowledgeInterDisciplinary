J.C. (1871). Theory of Heat, Longmans, Green, and Co.,\nLondon. p. 2.</ref> It is a measure of the thermal energy per particle of matter\nor radiation; it is measured by a thermometer, which may be calibrated in any of\nvarious temperature scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, etc.\n\nTemperature is an intensive property, which means it is independent of the\namount of material present; in contrast to energy, an extensive property, which\nis proportional to the amount of material in the system. For example, a\nlightening bolt can heat a small portion of the atmosphere hotter than the\nsurface of the sun.<ref>http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/primer/primer2.html</ref>\n\nEmpirically it is found that an isolated system, one that exchanges no energy or\nmaterial with its environment, tends to a spatially uniform temperature as time\npasses. When a path permeable only to heat is open between two bodies, energy\nalways transfers spontaneously as heat from a hotter body to a colder one. The\ntransfer rate depends on the thermal conductivity of the path or boundary\nbetween them. Between two bodies with the same temperature no heat flows. These\nbodies are said to be in thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn kinetic theory and in statistical mechanics, temperature is a measure of the\nkinetic energy of microscopic particles<ref>Maxwell, J.C. (1871). Theory of\nHeat, Longmans, Green, and Co., London. p. 2.</ref> such as atoms, molecules and\nphotons. The relation is proportional according to the Boltzmann constant. alpha\nhelix. The amplitude of the vibrations increases with temperature.]]\n\nThe lowest theoretical temperature is called absolute zero. However, it cannot\nbe achieved in any actual physical device. It is denoted by 0&nbsp;K on the\nKelvin scale, −273.15&nbsp;°C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67&nbsp;°F on the\nFahrenheit scale. In matter at absolute zero, the motions of microscopic\nconstituents are minimal.\n\nTemperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics,\ngeology, chemistry, atmospheric sciences and biology.\n","title":"temperature","headings":["Use in science","Temperature scales","Thermodynamic approach to temperature","Statistical mechanics approach to temperature","Basic theory","Heat capacity","Temperature measurement","Theoretical foundation","Examples of temperature","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Statistical_mechanics","5: Absolute_zero","4: James_Clerk_Maxwell","4: Thermal_radiation","4: Kelvin","3: Thermal_energy","3: Thermometer","3: Temperature_conversion_formulas","3: Thermal_equilibrium","3: Kinetic_theory","3: Kinetic_energy","3: Boltzmann_constant","3: Triple_point","3: Equipartition_theorem","3: Thermodynamic_temperature","3: Third_law_of_thermodynamics","3: Second_law_of_thermodynamics","3: Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water","2: Calibration","2: Gas","2: International_System_of_Units","2: Thermodynamics","2: Intensive_and_extensive_properties","2: Herbert_Callen","2: Ilya_Prigogine","2: Molecule","2: Heat_capacity","2: Zero-point_energy","2: Scale_of_temperature","2: Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics","2: Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics","2: Internal_energy","2: Entropy","2: Rankine_scale","2: Boiling_point","2: Quantum_mechanics","2: Ideal_gas","2: Herbert_Kroemer","2: Infrared","2: Silicon_burning_process","2: Planck_temperature","1: Intensive_property","1: Energy","1: Extensive_property","1: Empirical_evidence","1: Spontaneous_process","1: Thermal_conductivity","1: Alpha_helix","1: Physics","1: Geology","1: Chemistry","1: Atmospheric_sciences","1: Biology","1: Phases_of_matter","1: Solid","1: Liquid","1: Density","1: Solubility","1: Vapor_pressure","1: Electrical_conductivity","1: Chemical_reaction","1: Speed_of_sound","1: Celsius","1: Fahrenheit","1: Carnot_engine","1: Carnot_cycle","1: J._R._Partington","1: Constantin_Carathéodory","1: Differential_coefficient","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Ratio","1: Thermodynamic_equilibrium#Local_and_global_equilibrium","1: Edward_Arthur_Milne","1: Ion","1: Mechanics","1: Molecular_mechanics","1: Boltzmann's_constant","1: Equipartition","1: Diatomic","1: Uncertainty_principle","1: Galileo_Galilei#Technology","1: Newtons_law_of_cooling","1: Thermodynamic_equilibrium","1: Monotonic","1: Calorimetry","1: Wien's_displacement_law#Frequency-dependent_formulation","1: Frequency_spectrum#Light","1: Manifold","1: Order_parameter","1: Phase_transition","1: Latent_heat","1: Absolute_temperature","1: Heat","1: Amount_of_substance","1: Specific_heat","1: Joules","1: Kilogram","1: Temperature_measurement","1: Gabriel_Fahrenheit","1: Ole_Rømer","1: Thermometers","1: Belize","1: Myanmar","1: Liberia","1: United_States","1: Combustion","1: Freezing_point","1: Ground_state","1: Plasma_physics","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Electronvolt","1: QCD_matter","1: MeV","1: Kinetic_theory_of_gases","1: Statistical_physics","1: Natural_units","1: Metric_system","1: State_of_matter","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Mass","1: Speed","1: Perfect_gas","1: Thermodynamic_limit","1: Thermodynamic_system","1: Atom_vibrations","1: Vibration","1: Rotation","1: Atom","1: Bohr_radius","1: Helium","1: Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution","1: Avogadro_number","1: Ideal_gas_constant","1: Thermal_de_Broglie_wavelength","1: Monoatomic_gas","1: Neon","1: Hydrogen","1: Brownian_motion","1: Ideal_gas_law","1: Directly_proportional","1: Richard_Feynman","1: Mole_unit","1: Gas_constant","1: Heat_engine","1: Carnot_heat_engine","1: Fundamental_thermodynamic_relation","1: Quantum_dot","1: Grand_canonical_ensemble","1: Ergodicity","1: Orthodicity","1: Fermi_energy","1: Dry_ice","1: Negative_temperature","1: Population_inversion","1: Mathematical_singularity","1: Wavelength","1: Wien's_displacement_law","1: Kelvin#Usage_conventions","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: Terametre","1: FM_broadcasting","1: Incandescent_light_bulb","1: Sun","1: Color#Spectral_colors","1: Lightning","1: Ultraviolet","1: Sun#Core","1: X-ray","1: Nuclear_weapon","1: Gamma_ray","1: Z_machine","1: Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram","1: Supernova","1: Neutron_star","1: Relativistic_Heavy_Ion_Collider","1: CERN","1: Planck_time","1: Big_Bang","1: Planck_length","1: False_precision","1: Atmospheric_temperature","1: Color_temperature","1: Dry-bulb_temperature","1: Heat_conduction","1: Heat_convection","1: ISO_1","1: International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","1: Maxwell's_demon","1: Outside_air_temperature","1: Relativistic_heat_conduction","1: Stagnation_temperature","1: Thermoception","1: Thermography","1: Thermoregulation","1: Virtual_temperature","1: Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature","1: Wet-bulb_temperature"]}
