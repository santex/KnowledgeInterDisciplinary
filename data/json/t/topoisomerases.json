{"cursor":"9501","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Topoisomerases' (type I: , type II: ) are enzymes that regulate the overwinding\nor underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined\nnature of its double helical structure. For example, during DNA replication, DNA\nbecomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this tension\nwould eventually halt DNA replication. (a similar event happens during\ntranscription.)\n\nIn order to help overcome these types of topological problems caused by the\ndouble helix, topoisomerases bind to either single-stranded or double-stranded\nDNA and cut the phosphate backbone of the DNA. This intermediate break allows\nthe DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA\nbackbone is resealed again. Since the overall chemical composition and\nconnectivity of the DNA does not change, the tangled and untangled DNAs are\nchemical isomers, differing only in their global topology, thus their name.\nTopoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of DNA.\n","linknr":512,"url":"topoisomerases","recorded":1362579088,"links":33,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 5.99.1","DNA replication"],"headings":["Discovery","Function","Clinical significance","Topological problems","Classes","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["cell","transcription"],"related":["DNA_replication","Transcription_(genetics)","Isomerase","Enzymes","DNA_topology","James_C._Wang","Double_helix","Helicase","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA_sequence","Genetic_code","Protein","Chromosomes","DNA_replication","Circular_DNA","Circle","Knot_theory","Topoisomer","Tyrosine","Genetic_recombination","Quinolone","Antibiotic","Chemotherapy","Topoisomerase_inhibitor","Cancer","Cell_(biology)","Apoptosis","Secondary_neoplasm","Antigen","Anti_Scl-70","Scleroderma","DNA_supercoil","Catenation","DNA_replication","Transcription_(genetics)","Type_I_topoisomerase","Type_II_topoisomerase","Reannealing","Linking_number","DNA_topology","Supercoil","TOP1","Type_II_topoisomerase"]}
