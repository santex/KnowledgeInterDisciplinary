The divalent organic ligand coordinated to the metal\ncenter is called a carbene. Carbene complexes for almost all transition metals\nhave been reported. Many methods for synthesizing them and reactions utilizing\nthem have been reported. The term carbene ligand is a formalism since many are\nnot derived from carbenes and almost none exhibit the reactivity characteristic\nof carbenes. Described often as M=CR 2, they represent a class of\norganic ligands intermediate between alkyls (-CR 3) and carbynes\n(â¡CR). They feature in many catalytic reactions in the petrochemical industry\nand are of increasing interest in fine chemicals.\n\nThe characterization of (CO) 5Cr(COCH 3(Ph)) in the 1960s is\noften cited as the starting point of the area, {{cite journal\n | author = E.
