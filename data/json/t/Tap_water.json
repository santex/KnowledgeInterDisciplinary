It is a principal\ncomponent of \"outdoor plumbing\", which became available in suburban areas of the\ndeveloped world during the last half of the 19th century, and common during the\nmid-20th century. The application of technologies involved in providing clean\n(potable) water to homes, businesses and public buildings is a major subfield of\nsanitary engineering. Calling potable water \"tap water\" distinguishes it from\nthe other main types of potable water, such as water from rainwater-collecting\ncisterns, from village pumps (town pumps), or from streams, rivers, or lakes\n(whose potability varies).\n","linknr":294,"url":"Tap_water","recorded":1362372250,"links":32,"instances":["valve","fluid_conveyance","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Water","Drinking water","Water pollution","Water supply infrastructure"],"headings":["Background","Potable water supply","Hot water supply","Fixtures and appliances","Pipe materials","Fittings and valves","Regulation and compliance","Waste water","Water flow reduction/saving water","Tap water versus bottled water","Cloudiness due to dissolved gases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Wasserhahn.jpg/220px-Wasserhahn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/SinkPlumbing.jpg/150px-SinkPlumbing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tap","valve"],["compound","chemistry"],["compound","chemistry"],["pipe","material"],["pipe","fluid_conveyance"]],"members":["tap","pipe","compound"],"related":["Potable_water","Tap_(valve)","Plumbing","Suburban_area","Developed_world","Sanitary_engineering","Cistern","Village_pump","Public_health","Water-borne_diseases","Water_purification","Clean_water","Compound_(chemistry)","PH","Chlorine","Biotoxin","Groundwater","Ion","Soft_water","Hard_water","Compound_(chemistry)","Fluoride","Dental_health","Water_fluoridation","Water_fluoridation_controversy","Water_purification","Water_well","Water_heater","District_heating","Cross_connection_control_&_backflow_prevention","Copper","Polyvinyl_chloride","Waldo_Semon","Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene","Cross-linked_polyethylene","Building_code","ASTM","Underwriters_Laboratories","National_Fire_Protection_Association","Galvanized_steel","Pipe_(material)","Nominal_pipe_size","National_Pipe_Thread","Valve","Pipe_threader","Building_code","Fire_sprinkler","DWV","Polyvinyl_chloride","Chlorinated_polyvinyl_chloride","Polypropylene","Polybutylene","Polyethylene","Polyvinyl_chloride","Chlorinated_polyvinyl_chloride","Polypropylene","Heat_fusion","Green_building","Polybutylene_terephthalate","PEX","Pipe_(fluid_conveyance)","Piping_and_plumbing_fittings","Valve","Plumbing_drainage_venting","Sewage_treatment","Western_society","Natural_Resources_Defense_Council","United_States","Chlorine","Trihalomethanes","Haloacetic_acids","Cryptosporidium","Milwaukee","Milwaukee_Cryptosporidium_outbreak","Automatic_balancing_valves","Bottled_water","Drought","Fountain","Irrigation","Rainwater","Water_supply","Water_pipe","Water_cycle","Walkerton_Tragedy","ASTM","ASTM","ASTM"]}
