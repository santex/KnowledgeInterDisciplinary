The tmRNA forms a ribonucleoprotein complex\n('tmRNP') together with Small Protein B (SmpB), Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu),\nand ribosomal protein S1. In trans-translation, tmRNA and its associated\nproteins bind to bacterial ribosomes which have stalled in the middle of protein\nbiosynthesis, for example when reaching the end of a messenger RNA which has\nlost its stop codon. The tmRNA is remarkably versatile: it recycles the stalled\nribosome, adds a proteolysis-inducing tag to the unfinished polypeptide, and\nfacilitates the degradation of the aberrant messenger RNA. In the\nmajority of bacteria these functions are carried out by standard one-piece\ntmRNAs. In other bacterial species, a permuted ssrA gene produces a two-piece\ntmRNA in which two separate RNA chains are joined by base-pairing.\n","linknr":545,"url":"TmRNA","recorded":1362374332,"links":23,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Discovery of tmRNA and early work","tmRNA structure","''Trans''-translation","Mobile genetic elements and the tmRNA gene","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/TRNAmRNAtmRNAComparison.png/350px-TRNAmRNAtmRNAComparison.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/EsccolitmRNA2009.png/300px-EsccolitmRNA2009.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/TDLcartoonstructure.png/220px-TDLcartoonstructure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/SmpBcartoonstructure.png/220px-SmpBcartoonstructure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Transtranslation.png/450px-Transtranslation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2c/SsraHistory2.jpg/400px-SsraHistory2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conservation","genetics"]],"members":["conservation"],"related":["Gene","RNA","TRNA","Messenger_RNA","Ribonucleoprotein","SmpB","EF-Tu","Ribosomal_protein","Ribosomes","Protein_biosynthesis","Messenger_RNA","Proteolysis","Polypeptide","Messenger_RNA","RNase_P","Pseudouridine","TRNA","TRNA","5'","3'","Alanine-tRNA_ligase","TRNA","Anticodon","D_arm","Secondary_structure","Protein_structure_prediction","Base_pairs","Sequence_alignment","Phylogeny","Conservation_(genetics)","Peptide","Codon","Stop_codon","Pseudoknot","Cyanobacteria","Cyanobacteria","Pseudoknot","Alphaproteobacteria","Cyanobacteria","TRNA","Ribonuclease_P","RNase_T","RNase_PH","TRNA_nucleotidyltransferase","SmpB","Cryo-electron_microscopy","Ribosome","EF-Tu","Cytokine","Peptides","Alanine","Proteolysis","Ribosome","Messenger_RNA","Stop_codon","Proteases","Introns","Rickettsial_palindromic_elements","Genomic_islands","Transposon","Genomic_islands","CLPP","Ribosome","Messenger_RNA"]}
