{"cursor":"14327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn human resources context, 'turnover' or 'staff turnover' or 'labour turnover'\nis the rate at which an employer gains and loses employees. Simple ways to\ndescribe it are \"how long employees tend to stay\" or \"the rate of traffic\nthrough the revolving door\". Turnover is measured for individual companies and\nfor their industry as a whole. If an employer is said to have a high turnover\nrelative to its competitors, it means that employees of that company have a\nshorter average tenure than those of other companies in the same industry. High\nturnover may be harmful to a company's productivity if skilled workers are often\nleaving and the worker population contains a high percentage of novice workers.\n\nIn the United States, the average total non-farm seasonally adjusted monthly\nturnover rate was 3.3% for the period from December 2000 to\nNovember 2008. However rates vary widely when\ncompared over different periods of time or different job sectors. For example,\nduring the period 2001-2006, the annual turnover rate for all industry sectors\naveraged 39.6% before seasonal adjustments, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, total non-farming separations (not seasonally adjusted),\nSeries ID JTU00000000TSR, http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?jt \"Job\nOpenings and Labor Turnover Survey \" during the same period the Leisure\nand Hospitality sector experienced an average annual rate of 74.6%.
