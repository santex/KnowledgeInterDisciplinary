{"cursor":"12674","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In medicine and biology, 'transmission' is the passing of a communicable disease\nfrom an infected host individual or group to a conspecific individual or group,\nregardless of whether the other individual was previously infected. Bush,\nA.O. et al. (2001) Parasitism: the diversity and ecology of animal parasites.\nCambridge University Press. Pp 391-399. Sometimes transmission can\nspecifically mean infection of a previously uninfected host.\n\nThe term usually refers to the transmission of microorganisms directly from one\nperson to another by one or more of the following means:\n* droplet contact â coughing or sneezing on another person\n* direct physical contact â touching an infected person, including\n  sexual contact\n* indirect physical contact â usually by touching soil contamination or a\n  contaminated surface\n* airborne transmission â if the microorganism can remain in the air for\n  long periods\n* fecal-oral transmission â usually from contaminated food or water sources\n\nTransmission can also be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a\nmosquito) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to\nhumans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve\nzoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more\ncomplex life cycles.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Transmission_(medicine)","recorded":1362673105,"links":24,"instances":["common_cold","medicine","epidemiology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epidemiology","Infectious diseases","Diseases and disorders"],"headings":["Horizontal and vertical","Transmission, symptoms and survival","Locus","Routes of transmission","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["host","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["acute_viral_nasopharyngitis","common_cold"],["acute_viral_nasopharyngitis","common_cold"],["injection","medicine"],["host","biology"]],"members":["acute_viral_nasopharyngitis","injection","vector","host"],"related":["Medicine","Biology","Infectious_disease","Host_(biology)","Conspecificity","Microorganism","Soil_contamination","Organism","Vector_(epidemiology)","Mosquito","Host_(biology)","Taenia_solium","Pork","Zoonosis","Pathogen","Macroparasite","Biological_life_cycle","Horizontal_disease_transmission","Vector_(epidemiology)","Fomites","Vertical_disease_transmission","Perinatal_transmission","Diarrhea","Respiratory_system","Mucous_membrane","Vector_(epidemiology)","Meningitis","Chickenpox","Acute_viral_nasopharyngitis_(common_cold)","Influenza","Mumps","Strep_throat","Tuberculosis","Measles","Rubella","Whooping_cough","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Acute_viral_nasopharyngitis_(common_cold)","Influenzavirus_A","Influenzavirus_B","Mumps","Measles","Rubella","SARS","Developing_countries","Developed_countries","Sanitary_sewer_overflow","Cholera","Hepatitis_A","Polio","Rotavirus","Salmonella","Parasite","Sexual_intercourse","Anal_sex","Oral_sex","Bacterium","Semen","Penis","Vagina","Rectum","Virus","AIDS","Chlamydia_infection","Genital_warts","Gonorrhea","Hepatitis_B","Syphilis","Herpes","Trichomoniasis","Sexually_Transmitted_Disease","HIV","Hepatitis_B","Oral_sex","HIV","Herpes_simplex_virus","Kiss","Cytomegalovirus","Herpes_simplex_virus","Infectious_mononucleosis","Herpesviridae","Athlete's_foot","Impetigo","Syphilis","Chancre","Wart","Childbirth","Perinatal_infection","Breastfeeding","Infectious_disease","HIV","Hepatitis_B","Syphilis","Iatrogenic","Injection_(medicine)","Organ_transplant","Creutzfeldt-Jakob_Disease","Growth_hormone","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Organism","Disease","Infection","Pathogen","Host_(biology)","Epidemiology","Cholera","Polio","Bioaerosol","Bugchasing","Epidemic","Transmission_risks_and_rates"]}
