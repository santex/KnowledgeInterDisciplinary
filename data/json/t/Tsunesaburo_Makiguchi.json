Adopted by the Makiguchi family, he moved to HokkaidÅ, Japan's\nnorthernmost island, at the age of 14. Working his way through school, he\ngraduated from Sapporo Normal School (today's HokkaidÅ University of Education).\nFirst employed as an assistant teacher at a primary school affiliated with his\nalma mater, he later taught high school and served as a dormitory\nsuperintendent.\n\nAlthough he was recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchiâs uncompromising\nattitude toward the authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of\nthe Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen,\nand top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in his\nfrequent transfers from one school to another. Murata, Kiyoaki. Japanâs New\nBuddhism: An Objective Account of Soka Gakkai. New York and Tokyo: Weatherhill,\n1969. pp. 73-74 After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a\nsuccession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932.\n\nDuring those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between\nlife and education, developing his theories on sÅka or the creation of value,\nthe happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their\ninterrelationships in practice.\n\nTypical of his work is his first book, Jinsei Chirigaku ('A Geography of Human\nLife'), published in 1903. In it, he developed unique and progressive ideas on\nthe relationship between people's lives and their geographic location.\nMakiguchiâs work on geography was remarkable in that he was interested primarily\nin the relationship between nature and man. Japanese geographers of the time\nwere chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the\nearth. Murata, p72 In Makiguchiâs words, âit is through our spiritual\ninteraction with the earth that the characteristics that we think of as human\nare ignited and nurtured within us.â Makiguchi, Tsunesaburo. A Geography of\nHuman Life. Ed. by Dayle M. Bethel. Caddo Gap Press, 2002, p25 In this\nwork, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an\napproach to international relations, writing that: âThe important thing is the\nsetting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself\nbut not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the\nbetterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal\nbenefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more\nharmonious community life.â Makiguchi. A Geography of Human Life.\np.286\n\nIn response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the\nMeiji governmentâs adoption of the Imperial Rescript, Makiguchi published the\nfirst volume of SÅka KyÅikugaku Taikei (The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy)\ntogether with his close friend and disciple JÅsei Toda on November 18,\n1930. Kumagaki, Kazunori. âValue-Creating Pedagogy and Japanese Education in\nthe Modern Era,â The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000) Special Issue,\np31 The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of SÅka Gakkai. The four-\nvolume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on\neducation and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the\nstate, as embodied in the Imperial Rescript on Education, Makiguchi proposed a\nstudent-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the\nlearner. Kumagai, pp32-34\n\nHe also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership\nof school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in\nschool and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities\nat home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child.\nMakiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic\nlearners into eager, self-directed students.\n\n\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as\nthe goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In\nvalue-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy\nlife and develop the ability and attitude required to create\nvalue.\" Kumagai, p41\n\nHis value-creating system of education, which aims to instill in an individual\nan appreciation for the highest values, has attracted the attention of educators\noutside Japan as well. The SÅka KyÅikugaku Taikei has been translated now into\nEnglish, Portuguese, French and Vietnamese. In Brazil, Makiguchiâs theory of\neducation based on value-creation has been sponsored in 55 schools and\nintroduced in 1,103 classrooms to more than 34,0000 students. de Melo Silva,\nDilma, âMakiguchi Project in ActionâEnhancing Education for Peace,â The Journal\nof Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000), p62\n\nIn 1928, Makiguchi and JÅsei Toda, converted to Nichiren Buddhism. Mr.\nMakiguchi's encounter with this school of Buddhist thought took his life into an\neven deeper and broader dimension, resulting in the establishment of the SÅka\nKyÅiku Gakkai (Value-Creation Education Society), the predecessor to today's\nSoka Gakkai. It can be said that Mr. Makiguchi created and developed a\ngrassroots movement as the foundation of a lasting peace, an objective he\nperceived at the very heart of [[Nichiren Buddhism]].\n\nDuring World War II, he opposed Japan's military government's attempts to impose\nthe doctrine of State ShintÅ through strict control of religions and thoughts\ninimical to its war effort. While there is some debate as to whether Makiguchiâs\nactions were in direct opposition to the war, it is clear that âhis outspoken\ncriticism of the prevailing belief system represents an implicit and explicit\nprotest against an extreme abuse of the educational process for militarist\npurposes.â Ito, Takao. âReading Resistance: The Record of Tsunesaburo\nMakiguchiâs Interrogation by Wartime Japanâs âThought Police,ââ Educational\nStudies 45(2), p133\n\nIn 1943, due to his refusal to accept the talisman and support the war, he was\narrested and imprisoned as a \"thought criminal\" together with Josei Toda and 20\nsenior leaders of Soka Gakkai for violating the Peace Preservation Law revised\nin 1941 and under which tens of thousands were arrested. Yet, in spite of being\nsubjected to harsh interrogations, he never retreated from his beliefs; the 72-year-\nold former principal continued to assert the value of freedom of religion as a\nfundamental human rights. On November 18, 1944, he died in prison of extreme\nmalnutrition.\n\nMr. Makiguchi is remembered by members of Soka Gakkai International to this day.\nDuring morning and evening gongyÅ members take a moment to remember the first\nthree presidents of Soka Gakkai: TsunesaburÅ Makiguchi (President from 1930 to\n1944), JÅsei Toda (1951â1958), and Daisaku Ikeda (1960âpresent).\n\nA system of Soka schools in Japan, several independent secondary schools\nelsewhere in the world, as well as two universities (Soka University of\nJapan and Soka University of America) have been established based on\nMakiguchi's pedagogy.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Tsunesaburo_Makiguchi","recorded":1375054438,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesaburo_Makiguchi&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Makiguchi.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Makiguchi.jpg","/wiki/Soka_Gakkai","/wiki/J%C5%8Dsei_Toda","/wiki/Buddhism","/wiki/Category:Buddhism","/wiki/Buddhism","/wiki/Dharmacakra","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/100px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png","/wiki/History_of_Buddhism","/wiki/Timeline_of_Buddhism","/wiki/Gautama_Buddha","/wiki/Buddhist_councils","/wiki/List_of_Buddhists","/wiki/Dharma_(Buddhism)","/wiki/Buddhist_terms_and_concepts","/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths","/wiki/Skandha","/wiki/Impermanence","/wiki/Dukkha","/wiki/Anatta","/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da","/wiki/Middle_way","/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81","/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism","/wiki/Rebirth_(Buddhism)","/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra_(Buddhism)","/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology","/wiki/Threefold_Training","/wiki/Three_Jewels","/wiki/Buddhist_Paths_to_liberation","/wiki/%C5%9A%C4%ABla","/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81","/wiki/Buddhist_meditation","/wiki/Mindfulness","/wiki/Wisdom_in_Buddhism","/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81","/wiki/Bodhipakkhiy%C4%81dhamm%C4%81","/wiki/Buddhist_monasticism","/wiki/Householder_(Buddhism)","/wiki/Nirvana","/wiki/Four_stages_of_enlightenment","/wiki/Arhat_(Buddhism)","/wiki/Buddhahood","/wiki/Bodhisattva","/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism","/wiki/Buddhist_texts","/wiki/Theravada","/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon","/wiki/Mahayana","/wiki/Hinayana","/wiki/Chinese_Buddhist_canon","/wiki/Vajrayana","/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist_canon","/wiki/Navayana","/wiki/Outline_of_Buddhism","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/16px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Buddhism","/wiki/Template:Buddhism","/wiki/Template_talk:Buddhism","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Buddhism&action=edit","/wiki/Soka_Gakkai","/wiki/Niigata_Prefecture","/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D","/wiki/Sapporo","/wiki/Education","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Geography","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Imperial_Rescript","/wiki/J%C5%8Dsei_Toda","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Imperial_Rescript_on_Education","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/J%C5%8Dsei_Toda","/wiki/Soka_Gakkai","/wiki/Nichiren_Buddhism","/wiki/Shint%C5%8D","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Josei_Toda","/wiki/Peace_Preservation_Law","/wiki/Religion","/wiki/Human_rights","/wiki/Soka_University","/wiki/Soka_University_of_America","#Other_viewpoints","#References","#Books","#See_also","#References_2","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/victoria011.html","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/S%C5%8Dka_Gakkai","/wiki/Daisaku_Ikeda","/wiki/J%C5%8Dsei_Toda","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/victoria011.html","/w/index.php?title=Tsunesabur%C5%8D_Makiguchi&action=edit&section=6","http://tmakiguchi.org","/wiki/S%C5%8Dka_Gakkai","/wiki/J%C5%8Dsei_Toda","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/67265341","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/star
