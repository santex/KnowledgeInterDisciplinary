Canada) is the power to take\nprivate property for public use by a state.

Retrieved: 10\nOctober 2012.</ref>\n\nThe property may be taken either for government use or by delegation to third\nparties who will devote it to public or civic use or, in some cases, economic\ndevelopment. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain are for\ngovernment buildings and other facilities, public utilities, highways, and\nrailroads; however, it may also be taken for reasons of public safety, as in the\ncase of Centralia, Pennsylvania.
