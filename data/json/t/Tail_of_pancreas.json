The (tail or head? article\nedited - research suggests the head, not the tail) is the only part of the\npancreas which contains Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP) cells, which are responsible\nfor secreting pancreatic polypeptide to coordinate exocrine and islet enzyme\nrelease. PP cells are found in the tail's periphery. Beta cells(insulin\nsecretory) and delta cells (somatostatin secretory) are found in the central\npart of the tail as with the rest of the pancreas.\n\n\n\nThe cells described above are located exclusively in the islet cells; their\nsecretions reach exocrine portions of the pancreas via the capillary network\nsurrounding the islet cell populations.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Tail_of_pancreas","recorded":1362566290,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pancreas anatomy"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Illu_pancreas_duodenum.jpg/250px-Illu_pancreas_duodenum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Gray1098.png/250px-Gray1098.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Upper_gastrointestinal_tract.svg/30px-Upper_gastrointestinal_tract.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Head_of_pancreas","Uncinate_process_of_pancreas","Pancreatic_notch","Body_of_pancreas","Anterior_surface_of_pancreas","Inferior_surface_of_pancreas","Superior_margin_of_pancreas","Anterior_margin_of_pancreas","Inferior_margin_of_pancreas","Omental_tuber","Duodenum","Splenic_hilum","Spleen","PP_cell","Pancreatic_polypeptide","Exocrine","Islet","Enzyme","Beta_cells","Insulin","Delta_cells","Somatostatin","Exocrine","Capillary","Lesser_peritoneal_sac"]}
