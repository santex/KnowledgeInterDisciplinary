It is one of the four\nbasic operations in elementary arithmetic (the others being addition,\nsubtraction and division).\n\nBecause the result of scaling by whole numbers can be thought of as consisting\nof some number of copies of the original, whole-number products greater than 1\ncan be computed by repeated addition; for example, 3 multiplied by 4 (often said\nas \"3 times 4\") can be calculated by adding 4 copies of 3 together:\n\n:<math>3 \\times 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.\\!\\,</math>\n\nHere 3 and 4 are the \"factors\" and 12 is the \"product\".\n\nEducators differ as to which number should normally be considered as the number\nof copies, and whether multiplication should even be introduced as repeated\naddition.<ref></ref> For example 3 multiplied by 4 can also be calculated by\nadding 3 copies of 4 together:\n\n:<math>3 \\times 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.\\!\\,</math>\n\nMultiplication of rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers is defined by\nsystematic generalization of this basic idea.\n\nMultiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a\nrectangle (for whole numbers) or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides\nhave given lengths (for numbers generally). The area of a rectangle does not\ndepend on which side you measure first, which illustrates that the order numbers\nare multiplied together in doesn't matter.\n\nIn general the result of multiplying two measurements gives a result of a new\ntype depending on the measurements. For instance:\n\n:<math>2.5 \\mbox{ meters} \\times 4.5 \\mbox{ meters} = 11.25 \\mbox{ square\n:meters},\\!\\,</math> <math>11 \\mbox{ meters/second} \\times 9 \\mbox{ seconds} =\n:99 \\mbox{ meters}.\\!\\,</math>\n\nThe inverse operation of multiplication is division. For example, 4 multiplied\nby 3 equals 12. Then 12 divided by 3 equals 4. Multiplication by 3, followed by\ndivision by 3, yields the original number.\n\nMultiplication is also defined for other types of numbers (such as complex\nnumbers), and for more abstract constructs such as matrices. For these more\nabstract constructs, the order that the operands are multiplied in sometimes\ndoes matter.\n","title":"Multiplication","headings":["Notation and terminology","Computation","Products of measurements","Products of sequences","Properties","Axioms","Multiplication with set theory","Multiplication in group theory","Multiplication of different kinds of numbers","Exponentiation","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Rational_number","3: Real_number","3: Multiplication_table","2: Addition","2: Natural_number","2: Complex_number","2: Slide_rule","2: Multiplication_algorithm","2: Dimensional_analysis","2: Integer","2: Quaternion","1: Elementary_arithmetic","1: Subtraction","1: Multiplication#Multiplication_of_different_kinds_of_numbers","1: Rectangle","1: Area","1: Length","1: Multiplication_sign","1: Infix_notation","1: Equals_sign","1: Middle_dot","1: Full_stop","1: United_States","1: United_Kingdom","1: Decimal_separator","1: Asterisk","1: Programming_language","1: FORTRAN","1: Algebra","1: Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29","1: Matrix_multiplication","1: Cross_product","1: Dot_product","1: Factorization","1: Coefficient","1: Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication","1: NCTM","1: Traditional_mathematics","1: Common_logarithm","1: Calculator","1: Marchant_Calculator","1: Computer","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_India","1: History_of_China#Ancient_China","1: Ishango_bone","1: Upper_Paleolithic","1: Central_Africa","1: Ahmes_Papyrus","1: Babylonians","1: Sexagesimal","1: Positional_number_system","1: Decimal_expansion","1: Rod_calculus","1: Al_Khwarizmi","1: Hinduâ€“Arabic_numeral_system","1: Brahmagupta","1: Henry_Burchard_Fine","1: Princeton_University","1: Discrete_Fourier_transform#Multiplication_of_large_integers","1: Capital_Pi_notation","1: Greek_alphabet","1: Free_variables_and_bound_variables","1: Empty_product","1: Infinite_product","1: Lemniscate","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Order_of_operations","1: Order_theory","1: Giuseppe_Peano","1: Successor_ordinal","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Peano_axioms#Arithmetic","1: Cardinal_numbers","1: Cartesian_product","1: Rational_numbers","1: Abelian_group","1: Identity_matrix","1: Calculus","1: Multiplication#Products_of_sequences","1: Multiplication#Multiplication_in_group_theory","1: Multiplicative_group","1: Polynomial_ring","1: Integral_domain","1: Division_ring","1: Superscript","1: Karatsuba_algorithm","1: Toomâ€“Cook_multiplication","1: SchÃ¶nhageâ€“Strassen_algorithm","1: Multiplication_ALU","1: Booth's_multiplication_algorithm","1: Floating_point","1: Fused_multiplyâ€“add","1: Multiplyâ€“accumulate","1: Wallace_tree","1: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Factorial","1: Genailleâ€“Lucas_rulers","1: Napier's_bones","1: Peasant_multiplication","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
