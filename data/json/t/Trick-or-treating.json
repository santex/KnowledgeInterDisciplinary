{"cursor":"31409","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Trick-or-treating' or 'Guising', is a customary practice for children on\nHalloween in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house to house in\norder to ask for treats such as candy (or, in some cultures, money) with the\nquestion \"Trick or treat?\". The \"trick\" is a (usually idle) threat to perform\nmischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.\n\nIn North America, trick or treating has been a customary Halloween tradition\nsince the early 1950s. Homeowners wishing to participate in it sometimes\ndecorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons\nand jack-o-lanterns. Some rather reluctant homeowners would simply leave the\ncandy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even\nask an effort from the children in order to provide them with candy. In the more\nrecent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a\nneighborhood being visited by children, including senior residences and\ncondominiums.\n\nThe tradition of going from door to door receiving food already existed in\nGreat Britain and Ireland in the form of \"souling\", where children and poor\npeople would sing and say prayers for the dead in return for cakes. {{cite book\n | first = Nich last = Roger title = Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night\n | location = publisher = Oxford University Press year = 2003 pages = 28â30 isbn\n | = 0-19-514691-3\n }} Guisingâchildren disguised in costumes going from door to door for\n food and coinsâalso predates trick or treat, and is recorded in Scotland at\n Halloween in 1895, where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of\n scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and\n money. While going from door to door in disguise has remained\n popular among Scots and Irish, the North American custom of saying \"trick or\n treat\" has recently become common. The activity is prevalent in the United\n States, Canada, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Puerto Rico, and\n northwestern and central Mexico. In the latter, this practice is called\n calaverita (Spanish for \"little skull\"), and instead of \"trick or treat\", the\n children ask Â¿me da mi calaverita? (\"can you give me my little skull?\"); where\n a calaverita is a small skull made of sugar or chocolate.\n","linknr":448,"url":"Trick-or-treating","recorded":1362686122,"links":32,"instances":["folklore","mythology","norm"],"pdf":["http://www.uc.pt/fluc/eclassicos/publicacoes/ficheiros/BEC46/02_-_Grego_-_LNazare.pdf","http://museus.azores.gov.pt/ficheiros/jornal/532007192254.pdf"],"categories":["Halloween practices"],"headings":["History","Local variants","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Trick_or_Treater.jpg/220px-Trick_or_Treater.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/First_house_for_trick-or-treating.jpg/220px-First_house_for_trick-or-treating.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/A82d_1.JPG/220px-A82d_1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["convention","norm"],["white_horse","mythology"],["coco","folklore"]],"members":["coco","white_horse","convention"],"related":["Convention_(norm)","Halloween","Halloween_costume","Jack-o-lantern","Condominium","Souling","Scotland","Puerto_Rico","Mexico","Calavera","Celts","Samhain","Calan_Gaeaf","All_Saints'_Day","All_Souls'_Day","Mummers_Play","Isle_of_Man","Scottish_Highlands","Wales","Mare","White_horse_(mythology)","Moray","Bonfire","Souling","Soul_cake","Purgatory","Shakespeare","Ruth_Edna_Kelley","Robert_Burns","Ruth_Edna_Kelley","Lynn,_Massachusetts","Blackie,_Alberta","Lethbridge","Blackie,_Alberta","Portland,_Oregon","Helena,_Montana","Pretty_Boy_Floyd","John_Doe","Aurora,_Illinois","Ancestry.com","World_War_II","Indianapolis,_Indiana","Chicago,_Illinois","NBC_Radio_City_Studios","Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California","CBS_Columbia_Square","Walt_Disney","UNICEF","Trick-or-Treat_for_UNICEF","Des_Moines","Iowa","Extortion","Boys_and_Girls_Clubs_of_America","National_Confectioners_Association","BBC","Japanese_knotweed","Extortion","Scotland","South_Lanarkshire","North_Ayrshire","Midwestern_United_States","Southern_United_States","Portugal","Coco_(folklore)","Pão-por-Deus","Azores","Castanyada","Quebec","Halloween","Beggars_Night","Sweden","Maundy_Thursday","Denmark","Fastelavn","Shrove_Monday","Palm_Sunday","Flanders","Netherlands","Austria","Martin_of_Tours","St._Martin's_Day","St_Louis_Missouri","Des_Moines_Iowa","Beggars_Night","Harriet's_Halloween_Candy","Hop-tu-Naa","Poisoned_candy_myths","Samhain"]}
