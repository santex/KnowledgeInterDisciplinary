{"cursor":"12153","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science, 'transclusion' is the inclusion of a document or part of a\ndocument into another document by reference.\n\nFor example, an article about a country might include a chart or a paragraph\ndescribing that country's agricultural exports from a different article about\nagriculture. Rather than copying the included data and storing it in two places,\na transclusion embodies modular design, by allowing it to be stored only once\n(and perhaps corrected and updated if the link type supported that) and viewed\nin different contexts. The reference also serves to link both articles.\n\nTransclusion is usually performed on demand at the time one document referencing\nanother is opened, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user.\nThe result appears to be a single integrated document, even though its parts\nwere assembled on-the-fly from several separate documents which may have come\nfrom different computers located in different places.\n\nThe term was coined by hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson in 1982.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Transclusion","recorded":1362570662,"links":31,"instances":["programming","web_application_hybrid","mac_os","computing","computer_science","computing","text"],"pdf":["http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~wda2003/Papers/Section_III/Paper_11.pdf","http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~wda2003/Papers/Section_III/Paper_11.pdf","http://hkrott.iicm.edu/docs/publications/elpub-2002.pdf","http://hkrott.iicm.edu/docs/publications/elpub-2002.pdf","http://coronet.iicm.edu/denis/pubs/elearn2002b.pdf","http://coronet.iicm.edu/denis/pubs/elearn2002b.pdf","http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/searchWebServices/downloads/wilde-lowe_07.pdf","http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/searchWebServices/downloads/wilde-lowe_07.pdf"],"categories":["HTML","Hypertext","Metadata","Ted Nelson"],"headings":["Technical considerations","History and implementation by Project Xanadu","Implementations on the Web","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Transclusion_simple.svg/250px-Transclusion_simple.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["boilerplate","text"],["ajax","programming"],["server","computing"],["leech","computing"],["mashup","web_application_hybrid"],["macro","computer_science"],["publish_and_subscribe","mac_os"]],"members":["ajax","mashup","publish_and_subscribe","server","macro","leech","boilerplate"],"related":["Computer_science","Modular_design","Hypertext","Ted_Nelson","Boilerplate_(text)","Hypermedia","Micropayment","Hypertext","Quotation","Project_Xanadu","HTML","Web_browsers","Inline_linking","Firefox","Ajax_(programming)","JavaScript","XML","SGML_entity","XPointer","XSLT","Bandwidth_theft","Server_(computing)","Leech_(computing)","Proxy_server","Advertising","Hit_counter","Web_bug","Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)","Server_Side_Includes","SGML_entity","Web_template","Compound_document","Cross-reference","Macro_(computer_science)","Object_Linking_and_Embedding","Publish_and_Subscribe_(Mac_OS)","Single_source_publishing","Subroutine","PDF","HTML","PostScript","Almaden_Research_Center","Google_Tech_Talks"]}
