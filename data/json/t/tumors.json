Tumor is not synonymous with cancer. While cancer is by\ndefinition malignant, a tumor can be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant, or can\nrepresent a lesion without any cancerous potential whatsoever.\n\nThe terms \"mass\" and \"nodule\" are often used synonymously with \"tumor\".\nGenerally speaking, however, the term \"tumor\" is used generically, without\nreference to the physical size of the lesion. More specifically, the term \"mass\"\nis often used when the lesion has a maximal diameter of at least 20 millimeters\n(mm) in greatest direction, while the term \"nodule\" is usually used when the\nsize of the lesion is less than 20&nbsp;mm in its greatest dimension\n(25.4&nbsp;mm = 1&nbsp;inch).\n",
