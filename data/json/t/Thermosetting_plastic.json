{"cursor":"4781","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'thermosetting plastic', also known as a 'thermoset', is polymer material that\nirreversibly cures. The cure may be done through heat (generally above ),\nthrough a chemical reaction (two-part epoxy, for example), or irradiation such\nas electron beam processing.\n\nThermoset materials are usually liquid or malleable prior to curing and designed\nto be molded into their final form, or used as adhesives. Others are solids like\nthat of the molding compound used in semiconductors and integrated circuits\n(IC). Once hardened a thermoset resin cannot be reheated and melted back to a\nliquid form.\n\nAccording to IUPAC recommendation: A thermosetting polymer is a prepolymer in a\nsoft solid or viscous state that changes irreversibly into an infusible,\ninsoluble polymer network by curing. Curing can be induced by the action of heat\nor suitable radiation, or both. A cured thermosetting polymer is called a\nthermoset. http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/TT07168.pdf\n","linknr":154,"url":"Thermosetting_plastic","recorded":1362481448,"links":29,"instances":["gaming","fishing","process","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/TT07168.pdf"],"categories":["Polymer chemistry","Thermosetting plastics|"],"headings":["Process","Properties","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["curing","chemistry"],["molding","process"],["jig","fishing"],["miniature_figure","gaming"]],"members":["miniature_figure","jig","molding","curing"],"related":["Polymer","Curing_(chemistry)","Epoxy","Irradiation","Electron_beam_processing","Malleable","Molding_(process)","Adhesive","Semiconductors","Integrated_circuits","IUPAC","Radiation","Plastic","Rubber","Cross-link","Catalyst","Dimension","Cross-link","Melt","Melt","Thermoplastic","Temperature","Polyurethane","Vulcanization","Bakelite","Phenol","Formaldehyde","Duroplast","Urea-formaldehyde","Plywood","Melamine_resin","Epoxy","Fiber_reinforced_plastic","Graphite-reinforced_plastic","Polyimides","Injection_molding","Extrusion_molding","Compression_molding","Spin_casting","Fishing_lure","Jig_(fishing)","Miniature_figure_(gaming)","Figurine","Vulcanization","Fusion_bonded_epoxy_coating","Thermoplastic"]}
