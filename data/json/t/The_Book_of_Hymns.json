{"cursor":"3213","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'The Book of Hymns' was the official hymnal of The Methodist Church, later the\nUnited Methodist Church, in the United States of America, until it was replaced\nin 1989 by The [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. Published in 1966 it replaced The\nMethodist Hymnal, published in 1935, as the official hymnal of the church.\n\nThere is a dispute as to the proper title of this book. The cover has the title\nThe Book of Hymns but that is the only place in the book where that title\nappears. The title page has The Methodist Hymnal: Official Hymnal of the United\nMethodist Church. ''The Book of Discipline'', as well as other official\npublications, refer to the hymnal as The Book of Hymns. ''The Book of\nDiscipline of the United Methodist Church'', 1972, Â¶1023.6 ''The Book\nof Discipline of the United Methodist Church'', 1984, Â¶1214.3 When it was\npublished it had the title The Methodist Hymnal. Two years after publication the\nMethodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) merged; the\nEUB was using a hymnal published in 1957. A special session of the General\nConference, in 1970, changed the name to The Book of Hymns and assured those who\nhad belonged to the EUB that their hymnal would remain in print. McIntyre,\nDean \"Why were there two names for the 1966 Methodist Hymnal?\", General Board of\nDiscipleship. www.GBOD.org The EUB hymnal was also considered to be an\nofficial hymnal of The United Methodist Church.\n\nThe Book of Hymns was approved unanimously by the 1964 General Conference. The\n1960 General Conference authorized the Commission on Worship to appoint a hymnal\ncommittee to revise the official hymnal. The 29 member committee, chaired by\nEdwin E. Voigt, had a dozen consultants, with the hymnal edited by Carlton R.\nYoung. The book contains 539 texts with 402 tunes of which 122 texts and 119\ntunes which previously had not been included. Methodists add a favorite\nhymn: 'Old Rugged Cross' to be included in new volume, New York Times, 30 April\n1964, pg. 17. The hymnal has been described as a prescriptive as opposed\nto a descriptive hymnal, meaning that the hymns and liturgy were meant to shape\nand mold worship and prescribe what is sung and done.\n\nIt contains most, but not all, of the section in ''The Book of Worship for\nChurch and Home'' titled Acts of Praise. Musical settings for parts of the\nLord's Supper, the worship service and for the canticles were included. The book\nwas noted for adding the word Amen to the end of most of the hymns.\n","linknr":120,"url":"The_Book_of_Hymns","recorded":1375072567,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Hymnal","/wiki/The_Methodist_Church_(USA)","/wiki/United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/United_States_of_America","/wiki/United_Methodist_Hymnal","/wiki/Book_of_Discipline_(United_Methodist)","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Evangelical_United_Brethren_Church","/wiki/General_conference_(United_Methodist_Church)","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Book_of_Worship_for_Church_and_Home_(1965)","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Book_of_Discipline_(United_Methodist)","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Book_of_Discipline_(United_Methodist)","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Template:United_Methodist_Church","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:United_Methodist_Church&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:United_Methodist_Church&action=edit","/wiki/United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/General_conference_(United_Methodist_Church)","/wiki/Conferences_of_the_United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/Jurisdictional_Conferences_(United_Methodist_Church)","/wiki/Central_Conferences_(United_Methodist_Church)","/wiki/Annual_Conferences_of_the_United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/Episcopal_Area","/wiki/United_Methodist_Council_of_Bishops","/wiki/General_Board_of_Church_and_Society","/wiki/General_Board_of_Discipleship","/wiki/General_Commission_on_Christian_Unity_and_Interreligious_Concerns","/wiki/Abingdon_Press","/wiki/Cokesbury","/wiki/United_Methodist_Committee_on_Relief","/wiki/Book_of_Discipline_(United_Methodist)","/wiki/Confession_of_Faith_(United_Methodist)","/wiki/The_United_Methodist_Hymnal","/wiki/District_Superintendent_(Methodism)","/wiki/List_of_bishops_of_the_United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/Lay_speaker","/wiki/Ordination_of_women_in_the_United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/LGBT_and_Methodism","/wiki/Social_Creed_(Methodist)","/wiki/Saints_in_Methodism","/wiki/Connexionalism","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&oldid=561871467","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Methodist_texts","/wiki/Category:Hymnals","/wiki/Category:1966_books","/wiki/Category:1966_in_music","/wiki/Category:1966_in_religion","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Book+of+Hymns&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Book+of+Hymns","/wiki/The_Book_of_Hymns","/wiki/Talk:The_Book_of_Hymns","#","/wiki/The_Book_of_Hymns","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Book_of_Hymns","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Book_of_Hymns","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&oldid=561871467","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7719238","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Book_of_Hymns&id=561871467","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Book+of+Hymns","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Book+of+Hymns&oldid=561871467&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Hymns&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7719238#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikim
