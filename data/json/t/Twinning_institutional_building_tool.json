{"cursor":"5245","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Twinning is an institutional building tool.'\n\nLaunched in May 1998, Twinning\n[http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/tenders/twinning/index_en.htm] is one of the\nprincipal tools of Institution Building accession assistance. Twinning aims to\nhelp beneficiary countries in the development of modern and efficient\nadministrations, with the structures, human resources and management skills\nneeded to implement the acquis communautaire to the same standards as Member\nStates. Twinning provides the framework for administrations and semi-public\norganisations in the beneficiary countries to work with their counterparts in\nMember States. Together they develop and implement a project that targets the\ntransposition, enforcement and implementation of a specific part of the acquis\ncommunautaire.\n\nThe main distinct feature of the Twinning project is direct exchange of specific\nnational experience in EU legislation implementation.\n\nNot similar to other technical assistance, a Twinning project is that it sets\nout to deliver specific and guaranteed results and not to foster general\ncooperation. The parties agree in advance on a detailed work programme to meet\nan objective concerning priority areas of the acquis.\n\nThe key input from administrations of EU Member States to effect longer-term\nchange is in the core team of long-term seconded EU experts, practitioners in\nthe implementation of the acquis, to administrations of new Member States,\nacceding, candidate or potential candidate country. The proposed experts should\nbe seconded from public institutions in the Member State and not be private\nconsultants. Once a Call for Proposals is launched, Member States create and\nsubmit their project proposals, sometimes forming consortiums with other Member\nStates (Lead and Junior Partners). The target country then selects some of these\nMember States and invites them to present their proposal in person. The\npotential Resident Twinning Adviser (RTA) and Project Leader (PL) are expected\nto attend this presentation. Based on the presentation and the proposal, the\ncountry with the best bid is selected. Each country has an appointed \"National\nContact Point\" to coordinate its activities in Twinning.\n\nEach Twinning project has at least one Resident Twinning Adviser (RTA) and a\nProject Leader. The RTA is seconded from a Member State public administration or\nfrom another mandated body in a Member State to work full time for a minimum of\n12 months in the corresponding ministry in partner country to implement the\nproject. The Project Leader is responsible for the overall thrust and\ncoordination of the project. They are supplemented by carefully planned and\ntimed missions of other specialists, training events, awareness raising visits,\netc. to accompany the reform process towards the targeted results.\n\nThe Twinning project cycle is more demanding in terms of preparation and a\nspecific competitive selection procedure is used for selection and evaluation of\nthe potential MS partners.\n\nPolicy Advice (incl. law drafting, advice on organisational issues, awareness\nraising, etc.), training, study tours and internships are among the activities\neligible for Twinning projects. These activities, together with eligible costs\nfor the Twinning project implementation and all relevant procedures are\ndescribed in the Twinning Reference Manual.\n\nTwinning may be implemented as 'classic Twinning' (up to 24 months) and 'light\nTwinning' (up to 6 months), with budget up to 2 mln euros.\n\n'Mutual benefits of Twinning for counterparts:'\n\n1. Exchange of experiences and knowledge based on equal-level communication\n   between twinning partners (civil servant to civil servant);\n\n2.  Implementation of best practices of EU member State public administration;\n\n3. Complementarity in the case of a consortium;\n\n4. Alignment with current European legislation;\n\n5. Knowledge of political administrative systems;\n\n6. Long-term and structural working-relationships, professional networking, and,\n   therefore, influencing attitude towards a beneficiary country in the EU;\n\n7. Training and improving professional capacity;\n\n8. Development and implementation of adapted legislation which is necessary for\n   fulfilment of the obligations on joint Agreements and Action Plans, and for\n   integrating into the European markets;\n\n9. Changes in organisational practices and culture, improvements in managerial\n   styles, better communication and co-ordination between and within Beneficiary\n   Administrations are valuable bi-products of the process of MS civil servants\n   working closely alongside BA counterparts.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Twinning_institutional_building_tool","recorded":1374963956,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit&redlink=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Layout_guide","http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/tenders/twinning/index_en.htm","/wiki/Human_resources","/wiki/Acquis_communautaire","/wiki/Exchange_interaction","/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states","/wiki/History_of_the_European_Union","/wiki/Leadership","/wiki/Public_administration","/wiki/Full_time","/wiki/Civil_service","/wiki/Best_practice","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit&section=1","http://www.twinning.com.ua","/wiki/Center_for_Adaptation_of_Civil_Service_to_the_Standards_of_EU","/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Ukraine","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&oldid=539070402","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Enlargement_of_the_European_Union","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_introduction_cleanup_from_August_2009","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_August_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Twinning+institutional+building+tool&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Twinning+institutional+building+tool","/wiki/Twinning_institutional_building_tool","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Twinning_institutional_building_tool","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Twinning_institutional_building_tool","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Twinning_institutional_building_tool","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&oldid=539070402","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7858404","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&id=539070402","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Twinning+institutional+building+tool","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Twinning+institutional+building+tool&oldid=539070402&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Twinning_institutional_building_tool&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7858404#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribut
