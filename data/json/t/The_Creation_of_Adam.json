It is traditionally\nthought to illustrate the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis\nin which God breathes life into Adam, the first man. Chronologically the fourth\nin the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis on the Sistine ceiling,\nit was among the last to be completed. It is the most well-known of the Sistine\nChapel fresco panels, and its fame as a piece of art is rivaled only by the\n[[Mona Lisa]] by Leonardo da Vinci. The image of the near-touching hands of God\nand Adam has become one of the single most iconic images of humanity and has\nbeen reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Along with Leonardo da\nVinci's [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]], The Creation of\nAdam and the other Sistine Chapel panels are the most replicated religious\npaintings of all time.\n","linknr":236,"url":"The_Creation_of_Adam","recorded":1362668350,"links":41,"instances":["neuroanatomy","bible"],"pdf":["http://www.ecfs.org/projects/fieldston272/Readings/SteinbergMichelCreation.pdf"],"categories":["Paintings by Michelangelo","Sistine Chapel","1512 paintings","Paintings with biblical themes","Adam and Eve","Fresco paintings"],"headings":["Composition","Anatomical theories","Influence on popular culture","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Michelangelo_-_Creation_of_Adam.jpg/300px-Michelangelo_-_Creation_of_Adam.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a0/Simpsons-michaelangelo.jpg/220px-Simpsons-michaelangelo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adam","bible"],["sulcus","neuroanatomy"]],"members":["sulcus","adam"],"related":["Michelangelo","Fresco","Sistine_Chapel_ceiling","Bible","Genesis_creation_narrative","Book_of_Genesis","Adam_(Bible)","Man","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Human","Eve","Virgin_Mary","Leo_Steinberg","Medieval","Hymn","Anderson,_Indiana","Physician","Human_brain","Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)","Telencephalon","Brain_stem","Frontal_lobe","Pituitary_gland","Optic_chiasm","Synaptic_cleft","PET_scan","Limbic_system","Prefrontal_cortex","Uterus","Umbilical_cord","Navel","The_Homer_of_Seville","College_of_Cardinals","Tenacious_D","The_Pick_of_Destiny","T.U.F.F._Puppy"]}
