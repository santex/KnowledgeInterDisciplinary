{"cursor":"14130","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'transit pass' (North American English) or 'travel card' (British English),\noften referred to as a 'bus pass' or 'train pass' etc. (in all kinds of English-\n), [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pass?q=pass] [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pass] is a ticket that allows\na passenger of the service to take either a certain number of pre-purchased\ntrips or unlimited trips within a fixed period of time. Depending on the\ntransport network and on how much the pass is used, the pass may offer varying\ndiscounts compared with trips that are purchased individually.\n\nWhile transit passes can generally be purchased at full price by anyone wishing\nto use the services (senior citizens, the disabled, students and some others are\noften able to get them at a reduced price) many employers, colleges, and\nuniversities will subsidize the cost of them, or sometimes the full amount. Some\npublic transport networks will allow certain types of personnel, including\npolice officers, fire fighters, active military, and their own employees to ride\ntheir services for free with proper identification and without the need to\npurchase a pass.\n","linknr":358,"url":"Transit_pass","recorded":1362670125,"links":17,"instances":["bus","public_transit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Public transport fare collection"],"headings":["Types of passes","Examples of transit passes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/England_Bus_Pass_Example.jpg/250px-England_Bus_Pass_Example.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%D0%A1%D0%9F%D0%B1_%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%81_%D0%90%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%81_10_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA.jpg/220px-%D0%A1%D0%9F%D0%B1_%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%81_%D0%90%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%81_10_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transfer","public_transit"],["metrobus","washington,_d.c."],["ride_on","bus"]],"members":["ride_on","metrobus","transfer"],"related":["Senior_citizen","Disabled","Student","Employer","College","University","Police_officer","Fire_fighter","Token_coin","New_York_City_Transit","Transfer_(public_transit)","New_York_Subway","Washington_Metropolitan_Area_Transit_Authority","Washington_Metro","Metrobus_(Washington,_D.C.)","Smartrip","Montgomery_County,_Maryland","Ride_On_(bus)","MARC_train","Maryland_Transit_Administration","Baltimore_Metro_Subway","Baltimore_Light_Rail","Baltimore","Portland,_Oregon","Trimet","New_Orleans","Streetcars_in_New_Orleans","Martha's_Vineyard","Sound_Transit","Everett_Transit","Community_Transit","King_County_Metro","Pierce_Transit","Kitsap_Transit","ORCA_Card","Toronto_Transit_Commission","Winnipeg_Transit","Greyhound_Lines","United_States","Canada","United_Kingdom","Bus","Bank_Holiday","English_National_Concessionary_Travel_Scheme","Trains","Light_Rail","Mersey_Ferry","Wales","Scotland","England","Northern_Ireland","Octopus_card","Smartcard","MTR","Fachhochschule","Germany","University_of_Duisburg-Essen","States_of_Germany","U-Bahn","S-Bahn","Intercity-Express","Transit_fares","Free_travel_pass"]}
