{"cursor":"74243","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'tax' (from the Latin [[wikt:en:taxo#Latin|taxo]]; \"I estimate\") is a\nfinancial charge or other levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal\nentity) by a state or the functional equivalent of a state such that failure to\npay is punishable by law. Taxes are also imposed by many administrative\ndivisions. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or\nas its labour equivalent.\n\nAccording to Black's Law Dictionary, a tax is a \"pecuniary burden laid upon\nindividuals or property owners to support the government [...] a payment exacted\nby legislative authority.\" It \"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an\nenforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority\" and is \"any\ncontribution imposed by government [...] whether under the name of toll,\ntribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or\nother name.\" Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1307 (5th ed.\n1979).\n","linknr":1113,"url":"Taxes","recorded":1362671605,"links":116,"instances":["measurement","law","polity","hebrew_bible","penalty","finance","economics","taxation","ayn_rand","political_science"],"pdf":["http://www.oecd.org/daf/mai/pdf/eg2/eg2963e.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/daf/mai/pdf/eg2/eg2963e.pdf","http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/economics/econref/workingpapers/researchreports/wp2000/wp2000_1.pdf","https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2011/res2/pdf/crbs.pdf","http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf","http://cbees.utdallas.edu/papers/gtg2.pdf","http://cbees.utdallas.edu/papers/gtg2.pdf"],"categories":["Taxation|","Basic
