{"cursor":"21286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In topology and related branches of mathematics, a 'topological space' is a set\nof points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, that satisfy a set\nof axioms relating points and neighbourhoods. The definition of a topological\nspace relies only upon set theory and is the most general notion of a\nmathematical \"space\" that allows for the definition of concepts such as\ncontinuity, connectedness, and convergence. Other spaces, such as manifolds and\nmetric spaces, are specializations of topological spaces with extra structures\nor constraints. Being so general, topological spaces are a central unifying\nnotion and appear in virtually every branch of modern mathematics. The branch of\nmathematics that studies topological spaces in their own right is called point-\nset topology or general topology.\n","linknr":347,"url":"Topological_space","recorded":1362477257,"links":56,"instances":["category_theory","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematician","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","set_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematician","mathematics","set_theory","topology","geometry","mathematics","topology","mathematics","set_theory","graph_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["General
