{"cursor":"2341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Transfer' is a technique used in propaganda and advertising. Also known as\nassociation, this is a technique of projecting positive or negative qualities\n(praise or blame) of a person, entity, object, or value (an individual, group,\norganization, nation, patriotism, etc.) to another in order to make the second\nmore acceptable or to discredit it. It evokes an emotional response, which\nstimulates the target to identify with recognized authorities. Often highly\nvisual, this technique often utilizes symbols (for example, the Swastika used in\nNazi Germany, originally a symbol for health and prosperity) and what do you do\nsuperimposed over other visual images. An example of common use of this\ntechnique in the United States is for the President to be filmed or photographed\nin front of the country's flag. \"[Symbols] are constantly used. The cross\nrepresents the Christian Church. The flag represents the nation. Cartoons like\nUncle Sam represent a consensus of public opinion. Those symbols stir\nemotions.\" â [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]]. Transfer originally\nidentified in 1938 by the IPA as one of the [[Institute for Propaganda\nAnalysis#Execution and Audience|seven classifications]] of propaganda. In other\nwords, transfer fantasy causes people to want to be as gorgeous as the model in\nthe ad or as good as a basketball play in the commercial. So, it makes you want\nto buy the product to be just like the person in the ad.\n[http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ct.fc.transfer.html] Another\ntechnique used is celebrity endorsement. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.allbusiness.com/professional-scientific/advertising-related-\n| services/392122-1.html title = Building Brand Image Through Event Sponsorship:\n| The Role of Image Transfer. publisher = AllBusiness.com date = accessdate =\n| 2010-03-22\n}}\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Transfer_(propaganda)","recorded":1362477999,"links":0,"instances":["psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Propaganda techniques","Advertising techniques","Metaphors by type"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["association","psychology"]],"members":["association"],"related":["Propaganda","Advertising","Association_(psychology)","Praise","Blame","Nation","Patriotism","Nazi_Germany","United_States","President_of_the_United_States","Flag_of_the_United_States","Christian_cross","Christianity","Flag","Nation","Uncle_Sam","Public_opinion","Celebrity_endorsement","Propagandas"]}
