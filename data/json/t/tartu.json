In contrast to Estonia's\npolitical and financial capital Tallinn, Tartu is often considered the\nintellectual and cultural hub, especially since it is home to Estonia's\noldest and most renowned university. Situated 186&nbsp;km southeast of\nTallinn, the city is the centre of southern Estonia. The Emajõgi river, which\nconnects the two largest lakes of Estonia, traverses Tartu. The city is\nserved by Tartu Airport.\n\nHistorical names of the town include 'Tarbatu',<ref>In the fifth century\nEstonians built the first fortress at Tarbatu – from which both the modern\nEstonian name of Tartu and the Germanic name of Dorpat derive: </ref> an\nEstonian fortress founded in the 5th century,<ref></ref> 'Yuryev' () named c.\n1030 by Yaroslav I the Wise, and 'Dorpat' as first known by the German crusaders\nin the 13th century.\n","title":"tartu","headings":["Historical names","History","Climate","Government","Population","Neighbourhoods","Economy","Education and culture","Science","Main sights","Sport","International relations","Gallery","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: University_of_Tartu","3: Yaroslav_I_the_Wise","2: Estonian_Reform_Party","2: Mayor","2: Urmas_Kruuse","2: Estonians","2: Russians","2: Estonia","2: Tallinn","2: Russian_language","2: Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden","1: Counties_of_Estonia","1: Tartu_County","1: Tharapita","1: Aurochs","1: Ethnicity","1: Eastern_European_Time","1: Eastern_European_Summer_Time","1: EmajÃµgi","1: Tartu_Airport","1: Livonian_crusade","1: German_language","1: Swedish_language","1: Polish_language","1: Latvian_language","1: Finnish_language","1: Kievan_Rus","1: Kiev","1: Ugaunia","1: Chud","1: Northern_Crusades","1: Livonian_Knights","1: Vyachko","1: Koknese","1: Middle_Ages","1: Bishopric_of_Dorpat","1: Dmitri_of_Pereslavl","1: Alexander_Nevsky","1: Old_East_Slavic","1: Hanseatic_League","1: Baltic_Germans","1: Rostock","1: Mecklenburg","1: Heim_ins_Reich","1: 1558","1: Muscovy","1: Ivan_the_Terrible","1: Livonian_War","1: Moscow","1: Truce_of_Jam_Zapolski","1: 1582","1: Livonian_Confederation","1: Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania","1: Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth","1: Dorpat_Voivodeship","1: Society_of_Jesus","1: Grammar_school","1: Stephen_Bathory,_King_of_Poland","1: PolishâSwedish_War","1: Charles_IX_of_Sweden","1: Reiter","1: Castellan","1: Hetman","1: Jan_Karol_Chodkiewicz","1: Truce_of_Altmark","1: Dominions_of_Sweden","1: Treaty_of_Nystad","1: Russian_Empire","1: Baroque_architecture","1: Neoclassicism","1: Romantic_nationalism","1: Russification","1: Voronezh","1: Estonian_language","1: Estonian_War_of_Independence","1: Bolsheviks","1: Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic","1: Nazi-Soviet_Pact","1: Catherine_II_of_Russia","1: Raadi_Airfield","1: Humid_continental_climate","1: Andrus_Ansip","1: Prime_Minister_of_Estonia","1: Statistics_Estonia","1: Ukrainians","1: Finns","1: Belorussians","1: Poles","1: Jews","1: Germans","1: Latvians","1: Lithuanians","1: Tatars","1: Annelinn","1: Ihaste","1: JaamamÃµisa","1: Karlova,_Tartu","1: Kesklinn,_Tartu","1: Kvissentali","1: MaarjamÃµisa","1: Raadi-KruusamÃ¤e","1: Ropka","1: Ropka_industrial_district","1: RÃ¤nilinn","1: Supilinn","1: Tammelinn","1: TÃ¤htvere","1: ÃlejÃµe,_Tartu","1: Vaksali","1: Variku,_Tartu","1: Veeriku","1: Information_and_communication_technologies","1: Playtech","1: Webmedia_Group","1: ZeroTurnaround","1: Skype","1: Athens","1: University_of_Heidelberg","1: Estonian_University_of_Life_Sciences","1: Baltic_Defence_College","1: Estonian_Aviation_Academy","1: Supreme_Court_of_Estonia","1: Estonian_Historical_Archives","1: Estonian_National_Museum","1: Estonian_Sports_Museum","1: Vanemuine","1: Tartu_school_of_composition","1: Karl_Ernst_von_Baer","1: Jakob_von_UexkÃ¼ll","1: Juri_Lotman","1: Tartu_School","1: Semiotics","1: Lutheran","1: St._John's_Church,_Tartu","1: Tartu_Town_Hall","1: Tartu_Cathedral","1: Barclay_Square","1: Basketball","1: Tartu_Ãlikool/Rock","1: Korvpalli_Meistriliiga","1: Baltic_Basketball_League","1: EuroChallenge","1: Association_football","1: JK_Tammeka_Tartu","1: Meistriliiga","1: Town_twinning","1: BÃ¦rum","1: Deventer","1: Ferrara","1: Frederiksberg_Municipality","1: Gyumri","1: HafnarfjÃ¶rÃ°ur","1: HÃ¤meenlinna","1: Kaunas","1: LÃ¼neburg","1: Pskov","1: Riga","1: Salisbury,_Maryland","1: Tampere","1: Turku","1: Uppsala","1: VeszprÃ©m","1: Zutphen","1: University_of_Tartu_Botanical_Gardens"]}
