He was a truck driver, jewelry maker and\ncarpenter. Having been inspired by the Sermon on the\nMount, he became a pilgrim and traveled the world in the interests of world\npeace.\n\nHe spent eight months in an Egyptian prison in 1978 for trying to swim across\nthe Suez Canal on his way to Israel. In London, England, in\nresponse to US government foreign policy he tried to renounce his American\ncitizenship by destroying his passport. British authorities\ndeported him back to the United States in 1980.\n\nHe traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1981, spending several months with Mitch\nSnyder's Community for Creative Non-Violence before launching the White House\nPeace Vigil in Lafayette Square on June 3, 1981. He was later\njoined by Concepcion Picciotto in August 1981 and Ellen Benjamin in April\n1984. In his first three years of protesting Thomas was arrested 16\ntimes by the Park Police on charges ranging from illegal camping to disorderly\nconduct.\n\nOn May 6, 1984, Thomas married Ellen Benjamin in a Quaker wedding. They protested together with numerous other activists over the\nyears, including those from the Catholic Worker Movement and Plowshares\nMovement. In January 2009, Thomas died aged 61 of pulmonary\ndisease.\n\nThomas and the White House Peace Vigil inspired Eleanor Holmes Norton to\nintroduce the \"Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act.\" The Act would\nrequire the United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear weapons once all\nother nations possessing nuclear weapons do likewise, and redirect the funds\nsaved into renewable energy and social projects.\nNorton has repeatedly introduced versions of the bill since 1994. In 2011, the\nbill was revised and renamed the \"Nuclear Weapons Abolition and Economic and\nEnergy Conversion Act.\"\n\nThe Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue, a documentary directed by Tim Wilkerson and\ncommissioned by the Al Jazeera Documentary Channel, recounts the lives of anti-\nnuclear activists William and Ellen Thomas, Concepcion Picciotto and Norman\nMayer.\n","linknr":373,"url":"Thomas_(activist)","recorded":1362569993,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["American anti-war activists","American anti–nuclear weapons activists","American tax resisters","People from Tarrytown, New York","1947 births","2009 deaths","Christian radicals","Nonviolence advocates"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/WilliamThomas.jpg/220px-WilliamThomas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/PeacePark.jpg/220px-PeacePark.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Smiling_Sun_-_English.jpg/120px-Smiling_Sun_-_English.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/16px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/30px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vigil","Nuclear_disarmament","Simple_living","Vigil","White_House","Tarrytown,_New_York","Sermon_on_the_Mount","World_peace","Egypt","Suez_Canal","Israel","London","England","Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States","Citizenship_in_the_United_States","United_States_passport","Deportation","Washington,_D.C.","Mitch_Snyder","White_House_Peace_Vigil","Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.","Concepcion_Picciotto","Ellen_Thomas","United_States_Park_Police","Quaker_wedding","Catholic_Worker_Movement","Plowshares_Movement","Pulmonary_disease","White_House_Peace_Vigil","Eleanor_Holmes_Norton","Renewable_energy","Al_Jazeera_Documentary_Channel","Norman_Mayer","Brian_Haw","Christian_anarchism","Christian_pacifism","Ed_Grothus","List_of_peace_activists"]}
