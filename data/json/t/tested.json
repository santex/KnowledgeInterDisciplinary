It is Bad Religion's first live album since their 1979\nformation. Instead of using crowd mikes and mobile studios like most live\nalbums, the band tapped the inputs, for a result that portrays Bad Religion's\nlive sound without crowd noise. It also includes three new songs; \"Dream of\nUnity,\" \"It's Reciprocal,\" and the title track.\n","title":"tested","headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Notes/Trivia","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Bad_Religion","2: Punk_rock","2: Canada","2: Germany","2: Estonia","2: Denmark","2: Italy","1: Live_album","1: Epic_Records","1: Allmusic","1: Album","1: United_States","1: Austria","1: Greg_Graffin","1: Greg_Hetson","1: Jay_Bentley","1: Bobby_Schayer","1: Ronnie_Kimball","1: Berlin","1: Rome","1: Roskilde","1: Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania","1: Pennsylvania","1: Loreley","1: Melbourne,_Florida","1: Florida","1: Toronto","1: Ontario","1: Dortmund","1: Detroit","1: Michigan","1: New_York_City","1: New_York","1: Ithaca,_NY","1: Raleigh,_North_Carolina","1: North_Carolina","1: Munich","1: Tallinn","1: Baltimore","1: Maryland","1: Vancouver","1: British_Columbia","1: Chicago","1: Illinois","1: San_Francisco","1: California","1: Jacksonville","1: Montreal","1: Quebec"]}
