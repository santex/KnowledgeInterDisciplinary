{"cursor":"5073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'State of Idaho Executive Residence', also known as the 'Governor's House'\nor 'Idaho House', is the official residence of the governor of Idaho, located in\nBoise, the state capital.\n\nLocated at 4000 Simplot Lane on the top of a prominent hill in the Highlands\narea of North Boise, the house is the former residence of billionaire potato and\nagribusiness magnate J. R. (Jack) Simplot and wife Esther Simplot. Simplot\ndonated the house to the State of Idaho in November 2005 as a residence for\nfuture governors on the sole condition that a massive American flag continue to\nfly above the home. The property, located north of Hill Road off of Bogus Basin\nRoad, covers 37.749 acres and includes the house (7,370 ftÂ²) and garages\n(1,151 ftÂ²). The main level of the home consists of two bedrooms, two and a\nhalf bathrooms, a library, a main kitchen and caterer's kitchen, and a\nboardroom/dining room, while the upper level consists of an office, bathroom,\nentertainment area and great room/formal dining\nroom. [http://governorshouse.idaho.gov/ \"The Governor's House\"]\n\nThe Governor's Housing Committee and Residence Fund were created by statute\n(Idaho Code 67-455) in 1995, with the Fund being established \"for the purpose of\nproviding a Governor's housing allowance and/or the acquisition, construction,\nremodel, furnishing, equipping, or maintaining a Governor's residence\". In 1999,\nthe Legislature amended Idaho law (Idaho Code 67-455A) to allow the Governor's\nHousing Committee to accept grants, gifts, or donations related to a governor's\nresidence. [http://governorshouse.idaho.gov/committee.html Governor's\nHousing Committee]\n\nThe Mediterranean-style villa was built by Simplot in 1979. The house is visible\nfor miles and was dubbed \"Fort Simplot\" by neighbors who said it resembled a Boy\nScout camp. The flag pole that carries the 30-foot-by-50-foot flag was erected\nin 1980. Neighbors soon complained that the noise from the flag disturbed their\nsleep at night; Simplot responded by raising the flag pole to 100 feet. A 1983\nmudslide from the slopes of the hill caused $20,000 in damage to an adjacent\nhome. In the 2006 gubernatorial election, Otter's Democratic opponent, Jerry\nBrady, called the house \"too gaudy for a governor\". Some state legislators have\nsuggested selling the home, using the proceeds to build a new mansion on state-\nowned residential property nearby. Miller, John (March 1, 2009), [http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-03-01/news/17212811_1_governor-s-mansion-\notter-dirk-kempthorne \"Idaho governor's mansion renovated but empty\"] San\nFrancisco Chronicle, Associated Press.\n\nDirk Kempthorne, who was governor at the time of the donation, accepted the $2.1\nmillion property in 2004 and launched a $3 million private fund raising effort\nto renovate the interior. He also planned to sell naming rights to various rooms\nto make the house a showcase for Idaho industry, but Kempthorne resigned to\nbecome Secretary of the Interior and the plans were never implemented under his\nsuccessor, Jim Risch. The state's current governor, Butch Otter, is a former\nexecutive with the Simplot Company; he divorced the Simplots' daughter, Gay, in\n1993 and refuses to live in the mansion that his former father-in-law owned. In\nJanuary 2009, it was reported that a fund-raising campaign for the mansion had\n\"sputtered\" and that the cost of maintaining the lawn, $100,000 a year, was\ndepleting funds. Otter and his current wife, Lori, live on their ranch west of\nthe city near Star and receive a state housing allowance of $58,000 per year,\ncausing controversy; the [[Idaho Statesman]] editorialized that \"It is\nridiculous to subsidize his living expenses.\" Otter said he would stop taking\nthe allowance once the state finishes minimal renovations, but would still not\nlive there.
