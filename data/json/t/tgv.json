Following the inaugural TGV\nservice between Paris and Lyon in 1981 on the [[LGV Sud-Est]] ('LGV' (, high-\nspeed line)), the TGV network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect many\ncities across France and in adjacent countries on combinations of high-speed and\nconventional lines.\n\nA TGV test train set the record for the fastest wheeled train, reaching on 3\nApril 2007.<ref></ref> In mid-2011, scheduled TGV trains operated at the highest\nspeeds in conventional train service in the world, regularly reaching on the LGV\nEst and the LGV Méditerranée.\n\nA TGV service held the record for the fastest scheduled rail journey with a\nstart to stop average speed of ,<ref name=\"worldspeedsurvey2007\">,</ref><ref name=\"worldspeedsurvey2007pdf\"/><!--\nNote: Sources conflict between 279.3 and 279.4 km/h --> surpassed by the Chinese\nCRH service Harmony express on the Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway. from\nDecember 2009 until July 2011.<ref>Until mid-2011 Chinese high speed trains were\nthe fastest trains, but speeds have since been lowered: [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-\n08/11/c_131043781.htm link]</ref>\n\nThe commercial success of the first line, the LGV Sud-Est, led to an expansion\nof the network, with extensions towards the south (LGV Rhône-Alpes and LGV\nMéditerranée), and new lines in the west (LGV Atlantique), north (LGV Nord) and\neast (LGV Est). Eager to emulate the success, neighbouring countries such as\nBelgium, Italy, Spain and Germany built their own high-speed lines. TGVs link\nwith Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Belgium; with Belgium, Germany and the\nNetherlands through the Thalys network; and the Eurostar network links France\nand Belgium with the United Kingdom. Several lines are planned, including\nextensions within France and to surrounding countries. Cities such as Tours have\nbecome part of a \"TGV commuter belt\" around Paris.\n\nIn 2007, SNCF generated profits of €1.1 billion (approximately US$1.75 billion\nor £875 million) driven largely by higher margins on the TGV\nnetwork.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n","title":"TGV","headings":["History","Tracks","Signalling","Stations","Rolling stock","Network","TGV technology outside France","Future
