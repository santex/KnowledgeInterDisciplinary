Temptation\nalso describes the coaxing or inducing a person into committing such an act, by\nmanipulation or otherwise of curiosity, desire or fear of loss.\n\nMore informally, temptation may be used to mean \"the state of being attracted\nand enticed\" without anything to do with moral, ethical, or ideological\nvaluation; for example, one may say that a piece of food looks \"tempting\" even\nthough eating it would result in no negative consequences.\n",
