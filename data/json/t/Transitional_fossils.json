This is especially important where the descendant group is\nsharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral\ngroup. These fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human\nconstructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation.\nBecause of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to\nknow exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence.\nTherefore, transitional fossils cannot be assumed to be direct ancestors of more\nrecent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.\n\nIn 1859, when Charles Darwin's [[On the Origin of Species]] was first published,\nthe fossil record was poorly known. Darwin described the perceived lack of\ntransitional fossils as \"the most obvious and gravest objection which can be\nurged against my theory\", but explained it by relating it to the extreme\nimperfection of the geological record. He noted the limited\ncollections available at that time, but described the available information as\nshowing patterns that followed from his theory of descent with modification\nthrough natural selection. Indeed, [[Archaeopteryx]] was discovered\njust two years later, in 1861, and represents a classic transitional form\nbetween dinosaurs and birds. Many more transitional fossils have been discovered\nsince then, and there is now considered to be abundant evidence of how all\nclasses of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional\nfossils. Specific examples include humans and other\nprimates, tetrapods and fish, and birds and dinosaurs.\n\nThe phrase [[#Missing links|missing link]] has been used extensively in popular\nwritings on human evolution to refer to a perceived gap in the hominid\nevolutionary record. It is most commonly used to refer to any new transitional\nfossil finds. Scientists, however, do not use the term, as it refers to a pre-\nevolutionary view of nature.\n","linknr":805,"url":"Transitional_fossils","recorded":1362483177,"links":59,"instances":["geology","biology","biology","biology","bone","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/proseminar/Lovejoy_1988_SA.pdf","http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/proseminar/Lovejoy_1988_SA.pdf","http://nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7277/pdf/nature08623.pdf","http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald.html/Archibald09JHB42p561.pdf","http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald.html/Archibald09JHB42p561.pdf"],"categories":["Fossils","Transitional
