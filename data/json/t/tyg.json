These tall, black-glazed, red-bodied\ndrinking vessels were produced from the 15th century through the first half of\nthe 17th century, peaking in popularity during the 16th and 17th centuries. Some\nwere made with as many as nine handles. <ref>Hume, Ivor Noel. A Guide to\nArtifacts of Colonial America. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1980. Pp.102-104</ref>\n\nThe multiple handles also allow hot drinks to be passed around without pain.\n\nTygs were made in large quantities at Wrotham in Kent and in many Staffordshire\nfactories. Examples have surfaced at 17th-century American colonial sites, as\nwell as in the UK.<ref>Hume 1980.</ref>\n\nThere is a whole other life to Tygs. The miniatures, many of the leading names\nin Staffordshire and Worcester area have manufactured three handled Tygs that\nstand proud at only 1 to 1 7/10 inches in size.\n\nThere are also examples of Japanese and German Tygs.\n\nMany people ask what are they for? The most likely answer for the small ones is\nfor decoration, as many of them are exquisitely painted and are widely\ncollected.\n","title":"tyg","headings":["Notes"]},"micro-relation":["1: Mug","1: Wrotham","1: Kent","1: Staffordshire"]}
