Transgenesis can be\nfacilitated by liposomes, plasmid vectors, viral vectors, pronuclear injection,\nprotoplast fusion, and ballistic DNA injection.\n\nTransgenic organisms are able to express foreign genes because the genetic code\nis similar for all organisms. This means that a specific DNA sequence will code\nfor the same protein in all organisms.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Transgenic","recorded":1362892129,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic engineering"],"headings":["Using plasmids from bacteria","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Breeding_transgenesis_cisgenesis.svg/300px-Breeding_transgenesis_cisgenesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Exogeny","Transgene","Living_organism","Offspring","Liposomes","Plasmid_vector","Viral_vector","Protoplast_fusion","Gene_gun","Transgenic_organism","Genetic_code","DNA_sequence","Protein","Plasmid","Restriction_enzyme","Sticky_end","Nucleic_acid_hybridisation","Enzyme","Sperm-mediated_gene_transfer"]}
