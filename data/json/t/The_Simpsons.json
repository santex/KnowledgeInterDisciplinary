The series is a satirical parody of a middle class\nAmerican lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of\nHomer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of\nSpringfield and parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects\nof the human condition.\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series\nof animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a\ndysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family,\nsubstituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of [[The Tracey\nUllman Show]] on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was\ndeveloped into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox,\nbecoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season\n(1989â1990).\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast {{The Simpsons\nepisode count}} episodes\nand the twenty-fourth season started airing on September 30, 2012. The Simpsons\nis the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated\nprogram, and in 2009 it surpassed [[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]] as\nthe longest-running American primetime, scripted television series. [[The\nSimpsons Movie]], a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on\nJuly 26 and July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million.\n\nThe Simpsons is widely considered to be one of the greatest television series of\nall time. [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine's December 31, 1999, issue named it\nthe 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000, the Simpson\nfamily was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of\nawards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30\nAnnie Awards and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has\nbeen adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many\nadult-oriented animated sitcoms.\n","linknr":2504,"url":"The_Simpsons","recorded":1362686257,"links":167,"instances":["computer_virus","game","country","game","tv_network","season_12","the_simpsons_episode","comics","band","comics","writer","the_simpsons","actor","united_states","the_simpsons","the_simpsons"],"pdf":["http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/PeabodyWinnersBook.pdf","http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/PeabodyWinnersBook.pdf"],"categories":["Fox
