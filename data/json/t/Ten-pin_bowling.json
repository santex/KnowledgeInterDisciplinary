In the United\nStates, United Kingdom and Australia, the game is commonly referred to as just\n\"Bowling\". In New England, \"Bowling\" is usually referred to as \"Regular Bowling\"\nor \"Ten-pin Bowling\" because of the \"small-ball\" used in candlepin and sometimes\nduckpin varieties, which each use much smaller and lighter bowling balls as\ncompared to tenpin bowling, without the need for finger holes in them.\n","linknr":788,"url":"Ten-pin_bowling","recorded":1362481524,"links":45,"instances":["baseball","bowling","bowling","bowling","bowling","uk","sport","bowler","bowling","bowling","people","bowling","bowling"],"pdf":["http://bowl.com/uploadedFiles/Equipment_Specs/Information/2012FebESManualWEBINTERACTIVE.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061012141347/http://www.btba.org.uk/forms/rules.pdf","http://www.btba.org.uk/forms/rules.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061012141347/http://www.btba.org.uk/forms/rules.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060508085129/http://www.wtba.ws/pdf/WTBA_rulebook.pdf","http://www.wtba.ws/pdf/WTBA_rulebook.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060508085129/http://www.wtba.ws/pdf/WTBA_rulebook.pdf"],"categories":["Bowling","Precision
