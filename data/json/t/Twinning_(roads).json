[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/mediaroom/releases-2010-h091e-\n6063.htm FEDERAL, PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS OPEN NEWLY TWINNED SECTION OF HIGHWAY\n101]. Transport Canada. It is usually done when an existing highway\nrequires a significant increase in capacity. Twinning is frequently advantageous\nbecause it allows traffic capacity to be doubled and produces a dual carriageway\nwith separation between traffic directions, while keeping the existing right of\nway. Additionally, unlike simple widening, the old road stays open while the\ntwin is being built.\n\nSome freeways are constructed by bypassing an established two- or four-lane\nhighway. The older highways, constructed before the demand to travel that route\nexisted, or before the legislation of control of access, are often lined with\nresidences and businesses. Without control of access, a municipal or state\ngovernment is obliged to provide a driveway access where the owner sees fit.\n\nThe bypass may be initially designed as a freeway, but often the need for such a\nroute is not immediately present. Instead, a two lane road with no properties\nabutting it is constructed. A wide right-of-way is purchased in most cases so\nthat enough property is available to simply twin the highway. These roads are\nknown as a Super Two, and can be easily upgraded to a freeway by constructing\ninterchanges and by twinning the road.\n\nTwinning is often a public preference to reduce the dangers of overcrowded 2-\nlane single carriageways, like sections of the Trans-Canada Highway.
