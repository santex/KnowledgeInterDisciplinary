Petersen, William. 1979.\nMalthus. Heinemann, London. 2nd ed 1999. Malthus used his middle name\nRobert, though work after his lifetime often refers to him as Thomas\nMalthus. Malthus popularised the economic theory of rent.\n\nMalthus has become widely known for his theories about population and its\nincrease or decrease in response to various factors. The six editions of his\n[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]], published from 1798 to 1826,\nobserved that sooner or later population gets checked by famine and disease. He\nwrote in opposition to the popular view in 18th-century Europe that saw society\nas improving and in principle as perfectible. Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction\nto Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's\nClassics reprint. viii in Oxford World's Classics reprint. William Godwin\nand the Marquis de Condorcet, for example, believed in the possibility of almost\nlimitless improvement of society. In a more complex way, so did Jean-Jacques\nRousseau, whose notions centered on the goodness of man and the liberty of\ncitizens bound only by the social contractâa form of popular sovereignty.\n\nMalthus thought that the dangers of population growth would preclude endless\nprogress towards a utopian society: \"The power of population is indefinitely\ngreater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man\". Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of\npopulation. Chapter 1, p 13 in Oxford World's Classics reprint. As an\nAnglican clergyman, Malthus saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach\nvirtuous behaviour. Believing that one could not change human\nnature, Malthus wrote: {{quote|Must it not then be acknowledged by an attentive\nexaminer of the histories of mankind, that in every age and in every State in\nwhich man has existed, or does now exist\n\nThat the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of\nsubsistence,\n\nThat population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence\nincrease, and,\n\nThat the superior power of population is repressed, and the actual population\nkept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice. Malthus T.R.\n1798. An essay on the principle of population, in Oxford World's Classics\nreprint. p 61, end of Chapter VII }}\n\nMalthus placed the longer-term stability of the economy above short-term\nexpediency. He criticised the Poor Laws, Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the\nprinciple of population. Chapter V, p 39â45. in Oxford World's Classics\nreprint. and (alone among important contemporary economists) supported the\nCorn Laws, which introduced a system of taxes on British imports of\nwheat. Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the\nprinciple of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xx.  He thought\nthese measures would encourage domestic production, and so promote long-term\nbenefits. Malthus T.R. An essay on the principle of population, Ed. 6 1826,\nBook 3, Chapter 6. \"[...] a country which so restricts the importations of\nforeign corn as on an average to grow its own supplies, and to import merely in\nperiods of scarcity, is not only certain of spreading every invention in\nmanufactures and every peculiar advantage it may possess from its colonies or\ngeneral commerce on the land, and thus of fixing them to the spot and rescuing\nthem from accidents; but is necessarily exempt from those violent and\ndistressing convulsions of property which almost unavoidably arise from the\ncoincidence of a general war and an insufficient home supply of corn.\" \n\nMalthus became hugely influential, and controversial, in economic, political,\nsocial and scientific thought. Many individuals whom subsequent centuries termed\nevolutionary biologists read him, Not only after Darwin: some of the\nBritish proto-evolutionists (such as William Lawrence) read him, and Patrick\nMatthew certainly did: Matthew published in 1839 a short book, Emigration fields\n(Black, Edinburgh) encouraging emigration, in part as a solution to the problem\nof over-population. notably Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, for\neach of whom Malthusianism became an intellectual stepping-stone to the idea of\nnatural selection.
