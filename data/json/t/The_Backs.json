{"cursor":"10642","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Clare bridge, and the back lawns of King's.]] 'The Backs' is a picturesque\narea to the east of Queen's Road in the city of Cambridge, England, where\nseveral colleges of the University of Cambridge back on to the River Cam, their\ngrounds covering both banks of the river. The name \"the Backs\" refers to the\nbacks of the colleges. The area, from Magdalene Street bridge in the north to\nSilver Street bridge in the south, consists of the rear grounds of the following\ncolleges (north to south):\n\n*Magdalene â grounds on the west bank of the river before the Magdalene Street\nbridge. *St John's â buildings on both sides of the river, spanned by the St\nJohn's kitchen bridge and the Bridge of Sighs *Trinity â buildings on the east\nbank, spanned by Trinity bridge. *Trinity Hall â buildings on the east bank but\nwith no rear grounds on the west bank. *Clare â buildings on the east bank,\nspanned by Clare bridge. *King's â buildings on the east bank, spanned by King's\nbridge. *Queens' â buildings on both sides of the river, spanned by the\nMathematical Bridge.\n\nHistorically, much of the land was used by the colleges for grazing livestock or\ngrowing fruit. The river was also an important commercial thoroughfare to the\nmill at Silver Street.\n","linknr":223,"url":"The_Backs","recorded":1362893217,"links":30,"instances":["cambridge"],"pdf":["http://131.111.214.230/about/documents/432_01TheBacksLandscapeReport.pdf","http://131.111.214.230/about/documents/432_01TheBacksLandscapeReport.pdf","http://131.111.214.230/about/documents/432_01TheBacksLandscapeReport.pdf","http://131.111.214.230/about/documents/432_01TheBacksLandscapeReport.pdf"],"categories":["University of Cambridge sites","Geography of Cambridge","History of Cambridge","Parks and open spaces in Cambridge"],"headings":["History","Present-day and future development","Gallery","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/The_Backs.jpg/220px-The_Backs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/TheBacks-Cambridge-RichardLyne-1574.jpg/170px-TheBacks-Cambridge-RichardLyne-1574.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/TheBacks-Cambridge-CapabilityBrown-plan-1779.jpg/220px-TheBacks-Cambridge-CapabilityBrown-plan-1779.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/St_Johns_New_Court.jpg/512px-St_Johns_New_Court.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/The_Backs.jpg/220px-The_Backs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/DSCN00221.jpg/120px-DSCN00221.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/ClareCollegeAndKingsChapel.jpg/120px-ClareCollegeAndKingsChapel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/TheBacks-Cambridge-WilliamCustance-1798.jpg/54px-TheBacks-Cambridge-WilliamCustance-1798.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/TheBacks-Cambridge-SpendloweLamborn-late18C.jpg/96px-TheBacks-Cambridge-SpendloweLamborn-late18C.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Clare_Bridge_2003.jpg/120px-Clare_Bridge_2003.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/River_Cam_green.JPG/120px-River_Cam_green.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Jerwood_Library_Trinity_Hall_Cambridge.jpg/120px-Jerwood_Library_Trinity_Hall_Cambridge.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/CambridgeSunset.jpg/80px-CambridgeSunset.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Kings_College_Chapel_and_the_Gibbs_Building_from_the_Backs.JPG/120px-Kings_College_Chapel_and_the_Gibbs_Building_from_the_Backs.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bridge_of_sighs","cambridge"]],"members":["bridge_of_sighs"],"related":["King's_College,_Cambridge","Queen's_Road,_Cambridge","Cambridge","England","University_of_Cambridge","River_Cam","Magdalene_Street","Silver_Street,_Cambridge","Magdalene_College,_Cambridge","St_John's_College,_Cambridge","Bridge_of_Sighs_(Cambridge)","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Trinity_Hall,_Cambridge","Clare_College,_Cambridge","King's_College,_Cambridge","Queens'_College,_Cambridge","Mathematical_Bridge","Grazing","Livestock","Landscape_architect","Capability_Brown","English_country_house","Elm","Dutch_elm_disease","English_Heritage","National_Register_of_Historic_Parks_and_Gardens","Girton_College,_Cambridge","Cambridge_City_Council,_England","Beech","King's_College_Chapel,_Cambridge","Clare_College,_Cambridge","King's_College_Chapel,_Cambridge","King's_College,_Cambridge","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Clare_College,_Cambridge","River_Cam","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Trinity_Hall,_Cambridge","List_of_bridges_in_Cambridge","Punting"]}
