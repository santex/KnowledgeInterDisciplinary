Maintaining this standard\nof thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures is one of the\nimportant goals of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) design\nengineers.\n\nThermal comfort is affected by heat conduction, convection, radiation, and\nevaporative heat loss. Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by\nhuman metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium\nwith the surroundings. It has been long recognized that the sensation of feeling\nhot or cold is not just dependent on air temperature alone. Thermal comfort\ncalculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55  can be freely performed with the CBE\n[http://cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool/ Thermal Comfort Tool for ASHRAE-55].\n","linknr":350,"url":"Thermal_comfort","recorded":1362373432,"links":22,"instances":["insulation"],"pdf":["http://www.rehva.eu/projects/clima2007/SPs/D04F1510.pdf","http://www.rehva.eu/projects/clima2007/SPs/D04F1510.pdf"],"categories":["Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning","Building engineering","Temperature","Heat transfer"],"headings":["Effects of thermal discomfort","Factors determining thermal comfort","Thermal stress","Adjustment mechanisms","Effects of natural ventilation on thermal comfort","Operative temperature","Thermal sensitivity of individuals","Sex differences","Thermal Comfort Models","Thermal comfort in different regions","Thermal comfort of livestock","Research","Thermal comfort for patients and hospital staff","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["r-value","insulation"]],"members":[],"related":["ANSI","American_Society_of_Heating,_Refrigerating_and_Air-Conditioning_Engineers","HVAC","Heat_conduction","Convection","Thermal_radiation","Perspiration","Metabolism","Center_for_the_Built_Environment","Sick_building_syndrome","Indoor_air_quality","R-value_(insulation)","Dry-bulb_temperature","Mean_radiant_temperature","Solar_radiation","Humidity","Toxicology_and_Applied_Pharmacology","Layered_clothing","Operative_temperature","Mean_radiant_temperature","P._Ole_Fanger","Mean_radiant_temperature","Clothing_insulation","Humidity","Clothing_insulation","Urban_heat_island","Saudi_Arabia","Mosques","Muslims","Prayer","Jumu'ah","Kansas_State_University","P._Ole_Fanger","P._Ole_Fanger","Room_air_distribution","Psychrometrics","Air_conditioning","Building_insulation","Mahoney_tables","ASHRAE","VDM_Verlag"]}
