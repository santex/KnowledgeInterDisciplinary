{"cursor":"12021","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'transporter bridge' (also 'ferry bridge' or 'aerial transfer bridge') is a\ntype of movable bridge that carries a segment of roadway across a river. The\ngondola is slung from a tall span by wires or a metal frame. The design has been\nused to cross navigable rivers or other bodies of water, where there is a\nrequirement for ship traffic to be able to pass. This has been a rare type of\nbridge, with fewer than two dozen built. There are just twelve that continue to\nbe used today, including one converted into a lift bridge and one designed as,\nbut not yet operating as, a transporter bridge.\n","linknr":284,"url":"Transporter_bridge","recorded":1362668868,"links":32,"instances":["oste"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1873 introductions","1893 establishments in Spain","British inventions","Spanish inventions","Bridges","Transporter bridges|"],"headings":["Examples","History","Known transporter bridges","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Transporter.3.750pix.jpg/120px-Transporter.3.750pix.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge.jpg/120px-Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/MovableBridge_transport.gif/120px-MovableBridge_transport.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Osten.jpg/120px-Osten.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rendsburg_Schwebef%C3%A4hre_abends.jpg/120px-Rendsburg_Schwebef%C3%A4hre_abends.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Royal_Victoria_Dock_Bridge.jpg/120px-Royal_Victoria_Dock_Bridge.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Zubia_jun.jpg/120px-Zubia_jun.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["osten","oste"]],"members":["osten"],"related":["Movable_bridge","Aerial_tramway","Wire","River","Aerial_Lift_Bridge","Lift_bridge","Newport_Transporter_Bridge","Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge","Osten_Transporter_Bridge","Rendsburg_High_Bridge","Royal_Victoria_Dock_Bridge","Vizcaya_Bridge","Portugalete","World_Heritage_Site","Hartlepool","England","Middlesbrough","Glasgow","Vizcaya_Bridge","Portugalete","Spain","Alberto_Palacio","Ferry","Automobile","France","Rouen","Seine","World_War_II","United_Kingdom","Warrington_Transporter_Bridge","Royal_Victoria_Dock_Bridge","Newport_Transporter_Bridge","River_Usk","Newport","Ferdinand_Arnodin","Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge","River_Tees","Widnes-Runcorn_Transporter_Bridge","Aerial_Bridge","Duluth,_Minnesota","Gondola_lift","Sky_Ride","Century_of_Progress","Rendsburg_High_Bridge","Rendsburg","Railroad","Osten_Transporter_Bridge","Osten_(Oste)","Soviet_Union","Volgograd","Vizcaya_Bridge","Portugalete","Bilbao","Rochefort-Martrou_Transporter_Bridge","Rochefort,_Charente-Maritime","Aerial_Lift_Bridge","Duluth,_Minnesota","Lift_bridge","Newport_Transporter_Bridge","Newport","Osten_Transporter_Bridge","Osten","Middlesbrough_Transporter_Bridge","Middlesbrough","Puente_Transbordador","Buenos_Aires","Argentina","Rendsburg_High_Bridge","Rendsburg","Warrington_Transporter_Bridge","Warrington","Royal_Victoria_Dock_Bridge","Erlebnisbrücke_Transporter_Bridge","Mönchengladbach","Bizerta/Brest_Transporter_Bridge","Bizerta","Tunisia","Brest,_France","Bordeaux_Transporter_Bridge","Bordeaux","Devil's_Dyke_Transporter_Bridge","Devil's_Dyke,_Sussex","University_of_Toronto","Kiel_Transporter_Bridge","Kiel","Marseille_Transporter_Bridge","Marseille","Nantes_Transporter_Bridge","Nantes","Rio_de_Janeiro_Transporter_Bridge","Rio_de_Janeiro","Brazil","Rouen_Transporter_Bridge","Rouen","Sky_Ride","Chicago,_Illinois","Stalingrad_Transporter_Bridge","Volgograd","Widnes-Runcorn_Transporter_Bridge","Widnes","Runcorn","Movable_bridge"]}
