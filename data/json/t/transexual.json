Discrimination or negative attitudes towards transsexualism often\naccompany certain religious beliefs or cultural values.\n\nThere are cultures that have no difficulty integrating people who change gender\nroles, often holding them with high regard, such as the traditional role for \"Two-\nSpirit\" people found among certain Native American tribes.<ref>Two-Spirit\nPeople: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality 1997 U.\nIllinois, p.100 Sabine Lang et al.</ref>\n",
