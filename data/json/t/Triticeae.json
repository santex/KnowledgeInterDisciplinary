Major crop genera are found in\nthis tribe including wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other\ngenera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or\nrangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some\nof the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains\nthe genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat [[Triticum]]\nspecies. Seed storage proteins in Triticeae are implicated in various food\nallergies and intolerances.\n","linknr":402,"url":"Triticeae","recorded":1362544126,"links":21,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cereals","Pooideae","Plant tribes"],"headings":["Genera of Triticeae","Cultivated or edible species","Genetics","Evolution of the tribe","Goat grasses and the evolution of bread wheat","Wild Triticeae use by humans","Pastoral grasses","Triticeae and health","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/Triticeae.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Gluten_Sources.png/350px-Gluten_Sources.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/BreadWheatEvolution.svg/300px-BreadWheatEvolution.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tribe","biology"]],"members":["tribe"],"related":["Carolus_Linnaeus","Tribe_(biology)","Wheat","Wheat_taxonomy","Barley","Rye","Triticeae_glutens","Food_allergy","Common_wheat","Durum","Wheat","Gluten","Spelt","Barley","Rye","Spelt","Triticum_boeoticum","Triticum_monococcum","Aegilops_speltoides","Aegilops_tauschii","Hordeum_vulgare","Secale_cereale","Triticum_aestivum","Triticum_timopheevii","Oat","Diploid","Allotetraploid","Allohexaploid","Poulard_wheat","Holocene","Pastoral","Gluten_sensitivity","Triticeae_glutens"]}
