Due to family differences that could not\nbe settled with her father and brothers, she moved to Cairo to stay with an old\nneighbour, Suad Mahasen, a night club owner and an artist. Tahiya had asked\nseveral times for employment in Suad's nightclub but Suad refused to employ her\ndue to the disreputability of working at a night club. However, many of Suad's\nassociates and friends became acquainted with Tahiya through various visits to\nSuad's home. They all advised Suad to add her to one of the shows as a chorus\ngirl but still she refused. Soon, Tahiya was mentioned to Badia Masabni, the\nowner of Casino Opera, one of the most prominent nightclubs of the time. Badia\noffered a position in her troupe to Tahiya. Tahiya accepted and was given the\nstage name Tahiya Mohamed. She soon began gaining popularity as a solo dancer\nand as she became more experienced she learned a popular Samba dance from Brasil\nat the time called the Karioka. After that she became known as Tahiya Karioca.\nTahiya began starring in movies during what is dubbed as the Egyptian film\nindustries \"Golden Age\".
