{"cursor":"37950","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, a type of tannin]] solution in water.]]\n\nA 'tannin' (also known as vegetable tannin, natural organic tannins or sometimes\ntannoid, i.e. a type of biomolecule, as opposed to modern synthetic tannin) is\nan astringent, bitter plant polyphenolic compound that binds to and precipitates\nproteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and\nalkaloids.\n\nThe term tannin (from tanna, an Old High German word for oak or fir tree, as in\n) refers to the use of wood tannins from oak in tanning animal hides into\nleather; hence the words \"tan\" and \"tanning\" for the treatment of leather.\nHowever, the term \"tannin\" by extension is widely applied to any large\npolyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups\n(such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with proteins and other\nmacromolecules.\n\nThe tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where\nthey play a role in protection from predation, and perhaps also as pesticides,\nand in plant growth regulation. The astringency from the tannins is\nwhat causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption\nof unripened fruit or red wine. Likewise, the destruction or\nmodification of tannins with time plays an important role in the ripening of\nfruit and the aging of wine.\n\nTannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 (proanthocyanidins). Tannins\nare incompatible with alkalis, gelatin, heavy metals, iron, limewater, metallic\nsalts, strong oxidizing agents and zinc sulfate, since they form complexes and\nprecipitate in aqueous solution.\n","linknr":771,"url":"Tannin","recorded":1362482849,"links":77,"instances":["aquarium","herbalism","chemistry","cooking","chemistry","chemist","chemistry","element","skin","wine","chemist","beverage"],"pdf":["http://www.gov.ns.ca/nse/water/docs/droponwaterFAQ_HumicSubstances.pdf","http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/cognosy/tannins.pdf","http://www.natural-specialities.com/natural-specialities/PDF/Applications/BR02%20overview%20fact%20sheet%20version%202.1.pdf","http://www.nupro.net/science/enhnce%20berry%20phenoli.pdf","http://www.nupro.net/science/enhnce%20berry%20phenoli.pdf","http://www.users.muohio.edu/hagermae/tannin.pdf"],"categories":["Tannins|","Nutrition","Oenology","Organic
