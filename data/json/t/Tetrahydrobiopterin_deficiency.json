Phenylalanine is an amino acid obtained through\nthe diet. It is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners. If\ntetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is not treated, excess phenylalanine can build up\nto harmful levels in the body, causing mental retardation and other serious\nhealth problems.\n\nHigh levels of phenylalanine are present from infancy in people with untreated\ntetrahydrobiopterin (THB, BH 4) deficiency. The resulting signs and\nsymptoms range from mild to severe. Mild complications may include temporary low\nmuscle tone. Severe complications include mental retardation, movement\ndisorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, progressive\nproblems with development, and an inability to control body temperature.\n\nIt was first characterized in 1975.\n","linknr":351,"url":"Tetrahydrobiopterin_deficiency","recorded":1362511146,"links":15,"instances":["genetics","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amino acid metabolism disorders","Autosomal recessive disorders","Vitamin, coenzyme, and cofactor metabolism disorders"],"headings":["Epidemiology","Related genes","Genetics","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Tetrahydrobiopterin_structure.png/230px-Tetrahydrobiopterin_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pts","gene"],["dominance","genetics"]],"members":["dominance","pts"],"related":["Tetrahydrobiopterin","Metabolic_disorder","Phenylalanine","Amino_acid","Sugar_substitute","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Mental_retardation","Core_temperature","Taiwan","GTP_cyclohydrolase_I","PCBD1","PTS_(gene)","QDPR","MTHFR","DHFR","Amino_acid","Serotonin","Dopamine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Neurotransmitter","Mutation","Hydroxylase","Brain","Central_nervous_system","Nitric_oxide","Peroxynitrite","Dominance_(genetics)","L-DOPA","5-HTP","Folinic_acid","Phenylketonuria","Tetrahydrobiopterin"]}
