{"cursor":"6529","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Transitioning' is the process of changing one's gender presentation permanently\nto accord with one's internal sense of one's gender - the idea of what it means\nto be a man or woman. Brown, M.L. & Rounsley, C.A.\n(1996) True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism - For Families, Friends,\nCoworkers, and Helping Professionals Jossey-Bass: San Francisco ISBN 0-7879-6702-\n5 For transsexuals, this process typically involves sex reassignment\ntherapy (which may include hormone replacement therapy and sex reassignment\nsurgery), and their new sex is \"opposite\" that of birth sex; for intersex people\nit is different from how they were raised; for genderqueer people it is neither\nsolely female nor male. Cross-dressers and drag queens and drag kings tend not\nto transition, since their variant gender presentations are (usually) only\nadopted temporarily.\n\nTransition must begin with a personal decision to transition, prompted by the\nfeeling that one's gender identity does not match the gender that one was\nassigned at birth. One of the most significant parts of transitioning for many\ntransgender people is coming out for the first time. Transitioning is a process, not an event, that takes anywhere between several\nmonths and several years. Some people, especially genderqueer people, may spend\ntheir whole life transitioning as they redefine and re-interpret their gender as\ntime passes. Transitioning generally begins where the person feels comfortable:\nfor some, this begins with their family with whom they are intimate and reaches\nto friends later or may begin with friends first and family later. Sometimes\ntransitioning is at different levels between different spheres of life. For\nexample, someone may transition far with family and friends before even coming\nout at work.\n","linknr":436,"url":"Transitioning_(transgender)","recorded":1362581833,"links":28,"instances":["gender","transgender","transgender"],"pdf":["http://www.wpath.org/documents2/socv7.pdf","http://www.wpath.org/documents2/socv7.pdf"],"categories":["Gender transitioning"],"headings":["Terminology","Various aspects","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Portal_Transgender.svg/16px-Portal_Transgender.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Portal_Transgender.svg/32px-Portal_Transgender.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg/120px-Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hormone_replacement_therapy","transgender"],["passing","gender"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","transgender"],["voice_therapy","transgender"]],"members":["passing","hormone_replacement_therapy","voice_therapy"],"related":["Gender_role","Gender","Transsexual","Sex_reassignment_therapy","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(transgender)","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Intersex","Genderqueer","Cross-dressers","Drag_queens","Drag_kings","Gender_identity","Coming_out","Genderqueer","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Holistic","Gender_identity","Trans_woman","Mental_health_professional","World_Professional_Association_for_Transgender_Health","Standards_of_Care_for_the_Health_of_Transsexual,_Transgender,_and_Gender_Nonconforming_People","Real-Life_Experience","Coming_out","Gender_role","Passing_(gender)","Name_change","Gender-specific_pronoun","Sex_reassignment_surgery","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(transgender)","Hair_removal","Laser_hair_removal","Electrolysis","Voice_therapy_(transgender)","List_of_transgender-related_topics","Sex_reassignment_therapy"]}
