      "text" : "\n\n\n [[BW Group|BW]] Fjord]] use several modes of transport, each with their\n distinct advantages]]\n\n\n'Transport' or 'transportation' is the movement of people, animals and goods\nfrom one location to another. Modes of transport include air, rail, road, water,\ncable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure,\nvehicles and operations. Transport is important since it enables trade between\npeople, which in turn establishes civilizations.\n\nTransport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for\ntransport, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines\nand terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses,\ntrucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations)\nand seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo\nand for maintenance.\n\nVehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses,\ntrains, trucks, people, helicopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way\nthe vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including\nfinancing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and\nownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the\ncountry and mode.\n\nPassenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services,\nor private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although\nbulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an\nimportant part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air\npollution and use large amounts of land. While it is heavily subsidized by\ngovernments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and\nrestrain urban sprawl.\n",
