The first two members of the\nfamily to be identified were: *Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), formerly known as\nTNF-Î±, is the best-known member of this class. TNF is a monocyte-derived\ncytotoxin that has been implicated in tumor regression, septic shock, and\ncachexia. The\nprotein is synthesized as a prohormone with an unusually long and atypical\nsignal sequence, which is absent from the mature secreted cytokine. A short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids serves to\nanchor the prohormone in lipid bilayers. Both the\nmature protein and a partially processed form of the hormone can be secreted\nafter cleavage of the propeptide. *Lymphotoxin-alpha,\nformerly known as Tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-Î²), is a cytokine that is\ninhibited by interleukin 10.\n","linknr":507,"url":"Tumour_necrosis_factor","recorded":1362504341,"links":25,"instances":["gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines"],"headings":["Family members","Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Mouse_Tumor_Necrosis_Factor_Alpha.png/220px-Mouse_Tumor_Necrosis_Factor_Alpha.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/PDB_1du3_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1du3_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Strong_Hydrogen_Bond_between_Asn34_and_Arg82_of_Different_Monomers.png/220px-Strong_Hydrogen_Bond_between_Asn34_and_Arg82_of_Different_Monomers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eda","gene"]],"members":["eda"],"related":["Cytokines","Apoptosis","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Septic_shock","Cachexia","Lymphotoxin_alpha","Tumor_necrosis_factor-beta","Interleukin_10","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Lymphotoxin_alpha","Lymphotoxin_beta","CD154","CD70","TNFSF8","Fas_ligand","TNFRSF9","OX40L","TRAIL","Cytokine","Secondary_structure","Tumor","Necrosis","Tumour","Protein","Prohormone","Secreted","Hydrophobic","Amino_acid","Lipid_bilayer","Hormone","Bond_cleavage","CD154","CD70","EDA_(gene)","Fas_ligand","Lymphotoxin_alpha","Lymphotoxin_beta","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","OX40L","CD153","TNFSF9","TRAIL","RANKL","TNFSF12","TNFSF13","B-cell_activating_factor","TNFSF14","Vascular_endothelial_growth_inhibitor","TNFSF18"]}
