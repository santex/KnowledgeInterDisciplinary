This data may be delivered over a physical or logical\nlink, or pass through a certain network node. The throughput is usually measured\nin bits per second (bit/s or bps), and sometimes in data packets per second or\ndata packets per time slot.\n\nThe 'system throughput' or 'aggregate throughput' is the sum of the data rates\nthat are delivered to all terminals in a network.\n\nThe throughput can be analyzed mathematically by means of queueing theory, where\nthe load in packets per time unit is denoted arrival rate Î», and the throughput\nin packets per time unit is denoted departure rate Î¼.\n\nThroughput is essentially synonymous to digital bandwidth consumption.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Thruput","recorded":1362481400,"links":23,"instances":["data","traffic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Network performance"],"headings":["Maximum throughput","Channel utilization - Channel efficiency - Normalized throughput","Factors affecting throughput","Goodput and overhead","Other uses of throughput for data","See also","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/a/c6a880d1f76b1cb3dc1770a594ae8002.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bottleneck","traffic"],["flow_control","data"]],"members":["flow_control","bottleneck"],"related":["Communication_networks","Ethernet","Packet_radio","Network_node","Bit","Data_packets","Time_slot","Queueing_theory","Digital_bandwidth_consumption","Digital_bandwidth_capacity","Data_compression","Bottleneck_(traffic)","Channel_capacity","Protocol_overhead","Duty_cycle","Asymptotic_throughput","Packet_switched","Packet_loss","Net_bitrate","Communication_channel","Point-to-multipoint_communication","Channel_capacity","Shannon-Hartley_theorem","3_db_bandwidth","Capacitance","Parasitic_capacitance","Skin_effect","American_wire_gauge","Cat_5e","Transmission_lines","Radio_Propagation","Capacitance","Class_B_subnet","CSMA/CD","CSMA/CA","Flow_control_(data)","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Bandwidth-delay_product","Congestion_avoidance","Fair_queuing","Best-effort","Packet_loss","Network_congestion","Bit_error","Weighted_fair_queuing","Quality_of_service","Gross_bitrate","Raw_bitrate","Forward_error_correction_codes","Modem","Point-to-Point_Protocol","Net_bitrate","Useful_bitrate","Goodput","Goodput","Application_layer","Goodput","Data_flow_diagram","FFT","Binary_multiplier","Propagation_delay","ASIC","Embedded_processor","Wireless_network","Cellular_system","System_spectral_efficiency","Goodput","Greedy_source","Liquid_schedule","Measuring_network_throughput","Network_traffic_measurement","Spectral_efficiency","Traffic_generation_model","Iperf","Ttcp","Bwping","Prentice_Hall","Cambridge_University_Press","Prentice_Hall","McGraw-Hill"]}
