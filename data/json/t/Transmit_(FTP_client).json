Developed by Panic, Transmit is shareware â after a seven-day\ntrial period, the product can only be used for seven-minute sessions until it\nhas been purchased.\n\nTransmit 4 includes a number of features, many of which take advantage of\ntechnologies Apple has introduced in OS X 10.4, such as uploading using a\nDashboard widget or the dock, support for .Mac and iDisk/WebDAV, FTP/WebDAV/S3\nservers as disks in Finder (since v4.0), Spotlight, Droplets, Amazon S3 support\nand Automator plugins.\n\nThe app was called \"Transit\" at introduction,[http://panic.com/museum/transmit/-\nolder/Transmit%201.X/Transit_Guide.pdf] but had to be changed due to a conflict\nwith an existing product. Transmit was also made for Mac OS Classic, but it has\nbeen discontinued and made freeware.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Transmit_(FTP_client)","recorded":1362673200,"links":18,"instances":["computing","software","computing","software","mac_os","company"],"pdf":["http://panic.com/museum/transmit/older/Transmit%201.X/Transit_Guide.pdf"],"categories":["FTP clients","SFTP clients","Mac OS-only software","Mac OS X-only software","Panic software","Apple Design Award winners"],"headings":["Awards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Transmit_4_icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Bus_icon.svg/35px-Bus_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["panic","company"],["panic","company"],["dashboard","mac_os"],["widget","computing"],["dock","computing"],["spotlight","software"],["automator","software"]],"members":["dock","spotlight","widget","automator","dashboard","panic"],"related":["Panic_(company)","Mac_OS_X","Mac_OS_history","File_Transfer_Protocol","Proprietary_software","FTP_client","Mac_OS_X","Mac_OS_history","Panic_(company)","Shareware","Upload","Dashboard_(Mac_OS)","Widget_(computing)","Dock_(computing)",".Mac","IDisk","WebDAV","Spotlight_(software)","Automator_(software)","Freeware","Apple_Design_Award","MacWorld_Expo","MacMinute","Comparison_of_FTP_client_software","MacUser","MacUser"]}
