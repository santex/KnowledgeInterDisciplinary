Discrete\ntranslational symmetry is invariance under discrete translation.\n\nAnalogously an operator A on functions is said to be translation invariant with\nrespect to a translation operator T_\\delta if the result after\napplying A doesn't change if the argument function is translated. More precisely\nit must hold that\n\n: \\forall \\delta \\ A f = A (T_\\delta f).\\,\n\nLaws of physics are translationally invariant if they do not distinguish\ndifferent points in space. According to Noether's theorem, translational\nsymmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the momentum conservation law.\n\nTranslational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not\nchange the object.
