It has been known by several\nnames, including 'human resource development', and 'learning and\ndevelopment'.\n\nHarrison observes that the name was endlessly debated by the Chartered Institute\nof Personnel and Development during its review of professional standards in\n1999/2000. \"Employee Development\" was seen as too evocative of the master-slave\nrelationship between employer and employee for those who refer to their\nemployees as \"partners\" or \"associates\" to be comfortable with. \"Human Resource\nDevelopment\" was rejected by academics, who objected to the idea that people\nwere \"resources\" â€” an idea that they felt to be demeaning to the\nindividual. Eventually, the CIPD settled upon \"Learning and Development\",\nalthough that was itself not free from problems, \"learning\" being an overgeneral\nand ambiguous name. Moreover, the field is still widely known by the other\nnames.\n\nTraining and development (T&D) encompasses three main activities: training,\neducation, and development. Garavan, Costine, and Heraty, of the\n[http://www.iitd.ie Irish Institute of Training and Development], note that\nthese ideas are often considered to be synonymous. However, to practitioners,\nthey encompass three separate, although interrelated, activities: *'Training': This activity is\nboth focused upon, and evaluated against, the job that an individual currently\nholds. *'Education': This activity focuses upon the jobs that\nan individual may potentially hold in the future, and is evaluated against those\njobs. *'Development': This activity focuses upon the activities\nthat the organization employing the individual, or that the individual is part\nof, may partake in the future, and is almost impossible to evaluate.\n\nThe \"stakeholders\" in training and development are categorized into several\nclasses. The sponsors of training and development are senior managers. The\nclients of training and development are business planners. Line managers are\nresponsible for coaching, resources, and performance. The participants are those\nwho actually undergo the processes. The facilitators are Human Resource\nManagement staff. And the providers are specialists in the field. Each of these\ngroups has its own agenda and motivations, which sometimes conflict with the\nagendas and motivations of the others.\n\nThe conflicts are the best part of career consequences are those that take place\nbetween employees and their bosses. The number one reason people leave their\njobs is conflict with their bosses. And yet, as author, workplace relationship\nauthority, and executive coach, Dr. John Hoover John Hoover, PhD \"How to\nWork for an Idiot: Survive and Thrive Without Killing Your Boss\" (Career Press\nISBN 1564147045/ISBN 978-1564147042) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1564147045\npoints out, \"Tempting as it is, nobody ever enhanced his or her career by making\nthe boss look stupid.\" [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1564147045] Training an\nemployee to get along well with authority and with people who entertain diverse\npoints of view is one of the best guarantees of long-term success. Talent,\nknowledge, and skill alone won't compensate for a sour relationship with a\nsuperior, peer, or customer.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Training_and_development","recorded":1362477568,"links":17,"instances":["corporate"],"pdf":["http://www.gnr2.org/html/2007/4-19.pdf","http://www.gnr2.org/html/2007/4-19.pdf","http://www.chrs.net/images/chrs_papers/teninsights.pdf","http://www.chrs.net/images/chrs_papers/teninsights.pdf"],"categories":["Human resource management","Performance management"],"headings":["Talent development","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stakeholder","corporate"]],"members":["stakeholder"],"related":["Human_Resource_Management","Organization","Chartered_Institute_of_Personnel_and_Development","Human_resources","Organization","Employee","Stakeholder_(corporate)","Employee_retention","Job_satisfaction","Coaching","Life_planning","Person_Analysis","Personal_development","Mentoring","Training","Education"]}
