{"cursor":"11488","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn Roman religion, 'Terminus' was the god who protected boundary markers; his\nname was the Latin word for such a marker. Sacrifices were performed to sanctify\neach boundary stone, and landowners celebrated a festival called the\n\"Terminalia\" in Terminus' honor each year on February 23. The Temple of Jupiter\nOptimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was thought to have been built over a\nshrine to Terminus, and he was occasionally identified as an aspect of Jupiter\nunder the name \"Jupiter Terminalis\".\n\nAncient writers believed that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to\nRome during the reign of the first king Romulus (traditionally 753–717 BC)\nor his successor Numa (717–673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it\nas the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power inherent in the\nboundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a\ngod concerned with the division of property.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Terminus_(god)","recorded":1362667397,"links":33,"instances":["vedic","capitoline_hill","decoration","timekeeping","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["February observances","Roman gods","Liminal deities"],"headings":["Worship","History","Notes and references","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Design_for_a_Stained_Glass_Window_with_Terminus%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg/250px-Design_for_a_Stained_Glass_Window_with_Terminus%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["temple_of_jupiter","capitoline_hill"],["jupiter","mythology"],["garland","decoration"],["temple_of_jupiter","capitoline_hill"],["jupiter","mythology"],["intercalation","timekeeping"],["mitra","vedic"]],"members":["mitra","temple_of_jupiter","garland","intercalation","jupiter"],"related":["Religion_in_ancient_Rome","Boundary_marker","Latin","Sacrifice","Terminalia","Temple_of_Jupiter_(Capitoline_Hill)","Capitoline_Hill","Jupiter_(mythology)","Rome","Romulus","Numa_Pompilius","Animism","Proto-Indo-European_religion","Latin","Roman_Republic","Roman_Empire","Siculus_Flaccus","Honeycomb","Wine","Garland_(decoration)","Altar","Ovid","Hymn","Milestone","Rome","Via_Laurentina","Laurentum","Temple_of_Jupiter_(Capitoline_Hill)","Capitoline_Hill","Jupiter_(mythology)","Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus","Roman_calendar","Intercalation_(timekeeping)","Mercedonius","Marcus_Terentius_Varro","Diocletian","Diocletian_Persecution","Christian","Sabine","Titus_Tatius","Romulus","Marcus_Terentius_Varro","Numa_Pompilius","Plutarch","Plutarch","Tarquinius_Priscus","Tarquinius_Superbus","Augur","Auspice","Juventas","Livy","Religion_in_ancient_Rome","Animism","Proto-Indo-European_religion","Georges_Dumézil","Proto-Indo-European_religion","Historical_Vedic_religion","Mitra_(Vedic)","Aryaman","Bhaga"]}
