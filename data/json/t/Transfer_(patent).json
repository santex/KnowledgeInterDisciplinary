{"cursor":"2160","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"As objects of intellectual property or intangible assets, 'patents' and patent\napplications may be 'transferred'. See for instance  A transfer of\npatent or patent application can be the result of a financial transaction, such\nas an assignment, a merger, a takeover or a demerger, or the result of an\noperation of law, such as in an inheritance process, or in a bankruptcy.\n\nThe rationale behind the transferability of patents and patent applications is\nthat it enables inventors to sell their rights and to let other people manage\nthese intellectual property assets both on the valuation and enforcement fronts.\nAs The Economist put it,\n:\"Patents are transferable assets, and by the early 20th century they had made\n:it possible to separate the person who makes an [[invention]] from the one who\n:[[commerce|commercialises]] it. This recognised the fact that someone who is\n:good at coming up with [[idea]]s is not necessarily the best person to bring\n:those ideas to [[market]].\"  The Economist, A market for ideas, October\n:20, 2005.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Transfer_(patent)","recorded":1362478001,"links":0,"instances":["finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Patent law"],"headings":["United States","Security agreement","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["collateral","finance"]],"members":["collateral"],"related":["Intellectual_property","Intangible_asset","Patent_application","Patent","Financial_transaction","Mergers_and_acquisitions","Takeover","Demerger","Law","Inheritance","Bankruptcy","Inventor","The_Economist","United_States","Statute","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","Security_agreement","Collateral_(finance)","Assignor_estoppel"]}
