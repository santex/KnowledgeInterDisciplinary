{"cursor":"41894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Tragedy' (, tragÅidia, \"he-goat-song\", tragÅidia .}}) is a form of\ndrama based on human suffering that invokes in its audience an accompanying\ncatharsis or pleasure in the viewing. While many cultures have developed forms\nthat provoke this paradoxical response, the term tragedy often refers to a\nspecific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role\nhistorically in the self-definition of Western civilization. That tradition has\nbeen multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a\npowerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuityâ\"the Greeks and\nthe Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common\nactivity,\" as Raymond Williams puts it.\n\nFrom its obscure origins in the theaters of Athens 2,500 years ago, from which\nthere survives only a fraction of the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles and\nEuripides, through its singular articulations in the works of Shakespeare, Lope\nde Vega, Racine, and Schiller, to the more recent naturalistic tragedy of\nStrindberg, Beckett's modernist meditations on death, loss and suffering, and\nMÃ¼ller's postmodernist reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an\nimportant site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change. A\nlong line of philosophersâwhich includes Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine,\nVoltaire, Hume, Diderot, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud,\nBenjamin, Camus, Lacan, and Deleuzeâhave analysed, speculated upon, and\ncriticised the tragic form.\n\nIn the wake of Aristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (335 BCE), tragedy\nhas been used to make genre distinctions, whether at the scale of poetry in\ngeneral (where the tragic divides against epic and lyric) or at the scale of the\ndrama (where tragedy is opposed to comedy). In the modern era, tragedy has also\nbeen defined against drama, melodrama, the tragicomic, and epic theatre. Drama,\nin the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and\ntragedy in an anti- or a-generic deterritorialization from the mid-19th century\nonwards. Both Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal define their epic theatre projects\n(Non-Aristotelian drama and Theatre of the Oppressed respectively) against\nmodels of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of\ntragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.\n","linknr":910,"url":"Tragedy","recorded":1362373365,"links":84,"instances":["arts","aristotle","play","publisher","drama_","theatre","play"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ancient Greek
