Following the rediscovery\nof Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan's research moved to the study of\nmutation in the fruit fly [[Drosophila melanogaster]]. In his famous Fly Room at\nColumbia University, Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes\nand are the mechanical bases of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of\nthe modern science of genetics.\n\nDuring his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific\npapers. (subscription required) As a result of his work, Drosophila\nbecame a major model organism in contemporary genetics. The Division of Biology\nwhich he established at the California Institute of Technology has produced\nseven Nobel Prize winners.\n","linknr":597,"url":"Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","recorded":1362374034,"links":68,"instances":["biologist","biology","geneticist","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/morgan-thomas-hunt.pdf"],"categories":["1866
