Above, from left right: DDS-4 tape (20 GB), 112m Data8 tape (2.5\n GB), QIC DC-6250 tape (250 MB), and a 3.5\" floppy disk (1.44 MB)]]\n\nA 'tape drive' is a data storage device that reads and writes data on a magnetic\ntape. Magnetic tape data storage is typically used for offline, archival data\nstorage. Tape media generally has a favorable unit cost and long archival\nstability.\n\nA tape drive provides sequential access storage, unlike a disk drive, which\nprovides random access storage. A disk drive can move to any position on the\ndisk in a few milliseconds, but a tape drive must physically wind tape between\nreels to read any one particular piece of data. As a result, tape drives have\nvery slow average seek times. For sequential access once the tape is positioned,\nhowever, tape drives can stream data very fast. For example, Linear Tape-Open\n(LTO) supported continuous data transfer rates of up to 140 MB/s, comparable to\nhard disk drives.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Tape_drive","recorded":1362675475,"links":40,"instances":["tape","computer_science","company","data_storage_device"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20110107153214/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/255/ibmrd2505ZD.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110107153214/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/255/ibmrd2505ZD.pdf","http://www.thic.org/pdf/July06/sun.rraymond060718.pdf","http://www.thic.org/pdf/July06/sun.rraymond060718.pdf","http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/tape-storage/033617.pdf","http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/tape-storage/033617.pdf"],"categories":["History of computing hardware","Magnetic devices","Tape-based computer storage|*"],"headings":["Design","Media","History","Market Trends","Future Capacity","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Dds_tape_drive_01.jpg/300px-Dds_tape_drive_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Coloradobrandtapedrive.jpg/220px-Coloradobrandtapedrive.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["autoloader","data_storage_device"],["buffer","computer_science"],["data_cartridge","tape"],["exabyte","company"]],"members":["data_cartridge","buffer","exabyte","autoloader"],"related":["Digital_Data_Storage","Data8","Quarter_Inch_Cartridge","Floppy_disk","Computer_data_storage","Digital_recording","Magnetic_tape","Magnetic_tape_data_storage","Sequential_access","Disk_drive","Random_access","Linear_Tape-Open","Data_compression","Native_capacity","Sparse_database","SCSI","Fibre_Channel","Serial_ATA","USB","FireWire","FICON","ESCON","Parallel_port","Integrated_Drive_Electronics","Pertec_Computer","Autoloader_(data_storage_device)","Tape_libraries","DECtape","ZX_Microdrive","Rotronics_Wafadrive","Disk_drive","Storage_Magazine","Buffer_(computer_science)","Buffer_underrun","Magnetic_tape","Data_cartridge_(tape)","4-track_cartridge","Compact_cassette","Plastic","Compact_Cassette","Home_computer","Floppy_disk","Commodore_Datasette","Remington_Rand","UNISERVO","IBM","IBM_726","Cellulose_acetate","IBM_7_track","IBM","IBM_729","Computer_History_Museum","IBM_1401","IBM","9-track_tape","IBM","Group_code_recording","3M","Quarter_Inch_Cartridge","Quarter-inch_cartridge","IBM_3850","Commodore_International","Commodore_Datasette","Compact_Cassette","Cipher_Data_Products","IBM_3480_Family","Giant_magnetoresistance","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","Digital_Linear_Tape","Digital_Linear_Tape","IBM_3480_Family","Exabyte_(company)","Sony","Data8","Digital_Linear_Tape","IBM_3570","Hewlett-Packard","Digital_Data_Storage","IBM_VTS","Data8","Hewlett-Packard","Digital_Data_Storage","Quantum_Corporation","Super_DLT","Visual_Servoing","IBM_3592","Advanced_Intelligent_Tape","Storage_Technology_Corporation","StorageTek_tape_formats","IBM_3592","Encryption","IBM_TS1130","TS2250","Linear_Tape_File_System","Oracle_Corporation","Fujifilm","IBM","Magnetic_tape_data_storage"]}
