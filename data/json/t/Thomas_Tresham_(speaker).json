{"cursor":"6458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Sir Thomas Tresham' (died 6 May 1471) was a British politician, soldier and\nadministrator. He was the son of Sir William Tresham and his wife Isabel de\nVaux, daughter of Sir William Vaux of Harrowden. Thomas's early advancement was\ndue to his father's influence. In 1443 he and his father were appointed as\nstewards to the Duchy of Lancaster's estates in Northamptonshire,\nBuckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire, and by 1446 Thomas was\nserving as an esquire for Henry VI, being made an usher of the king's chamber in\n1455. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Huntingdonshire in 1446, a\nposition he held until 1459, and was returned to Parliament for Buckinghamshire\nin 1447 and Huntingdonshire in 1449. Despite the Tresham family's close links\nwith the royal court they were also on good terms with Richard Plantagenet, 3rd\nDuke of York, and when he returned from Ireland in 1450 Tresham and his father\nwent to greet him. Shortly after leaving home on 23 September they were attacked\nby a group of men involved in a property dispute with his father; William\nTresham was killed, and Thomas was injured.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries he again began to take government\nappointments; he was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between\n1451 and 1452, a Justice of the Peace between 1452 and 1460 for Northamptonshire\nand a Member of Parliament in 1453 for Northamptonshire. Tresham stayed in\nfavour throughout the disturbances of 1456, and was again made High Sheriff of\nCambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire between 1457 and 1458, and for Sussex and\nSurrey between 1458 and 1459. He was returned to parliament in 1459 for\nNorthamptonshire again, and the parliament, packed with anti-Yorkists, chose him\nto act as Speaker of the House of Commons. After the Parliament ended he was\nappointed to various anti-Yorkist commissions of Oyer and terminer, followed by\nan appointment as Comptroller of the Household in 1460.\n\nHe fought at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, but denied having been at the\nBattle of Wakefield, an odd thing for a Lancastrian. He joined up with Margaret\nof Anjou in January 1461 and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans, where he\nwas knighted. He fought at the Battle of Towton and was captured; despite being\none of the lords on whom Edward IV had placed a Â£100 bounty, he only suffered\nforfeiture. He secured a pardon in 1464 and again represented Northamptonshire\nin Parliament in 1467, but failed to regain his lands and possessions. As a\nresult he took part in the plots of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, and was\nimprisoned in the Tower of London from 1468 until Henry VI regained the throne\nin 1470. He was rewarded for his services and loyalty with various grants,\nincluding that of Huntingdon Castle, to be held for seven years.\n\nAfter the Battle of Barnet he fled to meet Margaret of Anjou but was captured\nand executed on 6 May 1471.\n\nHis children by Mary, daughter of William, Lord Zouche of Harringworth, included\na son, John, who was born in 1462. John was restored to his father's estates\nafter the reversal of the attainder by Henry VII in 1485. John's son was Sir\nThomas Tresham (d.1559). A daughter, Isabella, was born in 1471 and married Sir\nHenry de Vere of Addington, thus establishing a long line of\ndescendants. The National Dictionary of Biography makes no mention of a\ndaughter named Isabella.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)","recorded":1375085690,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Tresham_(disambiguation)","/wiki/William_Tresham","/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster","/wiki/Northamptonshire","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Bedfordshire","/wiki/Huntingdonshire","/wiki/Esquire","/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England","/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace","/wiki/Buckinghamshire_(Parliamentary_constituency)","/wiki/Huntingdonshire_(Parliamentary_constituency)","/wiki/Richard_Plantagenet,_3rd_Duke_of_York","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Cambridgeshire_and_Huntingdonshire","/wiki/Northamptonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Sussex","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Surrey","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Oyer_and_terminer","/wiki/Comptroller_of_the_Household","/wiki/Battle_of_Northampton_(1460)","/wiki/Battle_of_Wakefield","/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou","/wiki/Second_Battle_of_St_Albans","/wiki/Battle_of_Towton","/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England","/wiki/John_de_Vere,_13th_Earl_of_Oxford","/wiki/Tower_of_London","/wiki/Huntingdon_Castle","/wiki/Battle_of_Barnet","/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Baron_Zouche","/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England","/wiki/Thomas_Tresham","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Tresham_(speaker)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27710?docPos=3","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Oxford_University_Press","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fref%3Aodnb%2F27710","http://www.oup.com/oxforddnb/info/freeodnb/libraries/","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Tresham,_Thomas_(d.1471)_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Buckinghamshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Huntingdonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Northamptonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Northamptonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Cambridgeshire_and_Huntingdonshire","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Cambridgeshire_and_Huntingdonshire","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Sussex","/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Surrey","/wiki/John_Wenlock","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/John_Green_(speaker)","/wiki/Template:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Template_talk:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons&action=edit","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Thomas_Hungerford_(Speaker)","/wiki/Peter_de_la_Mare","/wiki/James_Pickering","/wiki/John_Guildesborough","/wiki/Richard_Waldegrave_(politician)","/wiki/James_Pickering","/wiki/John_Bussy","/wiki/John_Cheyne_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Doreward","/wiki/Arnold_Savage","/wiki/Henry_Redford","/wiki/William_Esturmy","/wiki/John_Tiptoft,_1st_Baron_Tiptoft","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/William_Stourton_(speaker)","/wiki/Walter_Hungerford,_1st_Baron_Hungerford","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/Richard_Redman_(Speaker)","/wiki/Walter_Beauchamp","/wiki/Roger_Flower","/wiki/Roger_Hunt_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Chaucer","/wiki/Richard_Baynard","/wiki/John_Russell_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Walton","/wiki/Richard_Vernon_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Tyrell","/wiki/William_Alington_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Bowes_(speaker)","/wiki/William_Burley","/wiki/William_Tresham","/wiki/John_Say","/wiki/John_Popham_(military_commander)","/wiki/William_Oldhall","/wiki/Thomas_Thorpe_(Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons)","/wiki/Thomas_Charlton_(speaker)","/wiki/John_Wenlock,_1st_Baron_Wenlock","/wiki/John_Green_(speaker)","/wiki/James_Strangeways","/wiki/John_Wood_(speaker)","/wiki/William_Catesby","/wiki/Thomas_Lovell","/wiki/John_Mordaunt_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Fitzwilliam","/wiki/Richard_Empson","/wiki/Robert_Drury_(speaker)","/wiki/Thomas_Englefield","/wiki/Edmund_Dudley","/wiki/Robert_Sheffield",
