{"cursor":"5690","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'transcription service' is a business which converts speech (either live or\nrecorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are\noften provided for business, legal, or medical purposes. The most common type of\ntranscription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file\nsuitable for printing as a document such as a report. Common examples are the\nproceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or\na physician's recorded voice notes (medical transcription). Some transcription\nbusinesses can send staff to events, speeches, or seminars, who then convert the\nspoken content into text. Some companies also accept recorded speech, either on\ncassette, CD, VHS, or as sound files. For a transcription service, various\nindividuals and organizations have different rates and methods of pricing. That\ncan be per line, per word, per minute, or per hour, which differs from\nindividual to individual and industry to industry. Transcription companies\nprimarily serve private law firms, local, state and federal government agencies\nand courts, trade associations, meeting planners and nonprofits.\n\nTranscription is one of the fastest growing legitimate jobs in the US.\nTranscription work can be a good choice for people who are retired or who want\nto earn extra income by utilizing their free time.\n\nBefore 1970, transcription was a difficult job, as secretaries had to write down\nthe speech as they heard it using advanced skills, like shorthand. They also had\nto be at the location where the service was required. But with the introduction\nof tape cassettes and portable recorders in the late 1970s, the work became much\neasier and new possibilities emerged. Cassettes can travel through internal mail\nor external mail which meant for the first time, the transcriptions could have\nthe work brought to them in their own office which could be in a different\nlocation or business. For the first time, transcriptionist could work from home\nfor many different businesses at their own convenience, provided they met the\ndeadlines required by their clients.\n\nWith the advanced technology of today, people can have almost anything\ntranscribed very rapidly. An mp3 based Dictaphone, for example, can be used to\nrecord the sound. The recording can then be uploaded to a pc and emailed within\nminutes to someone who could be anywhere in the world. The transcriptionist can\nthen replay the audio many times. The sound can also be filtered, equalised or\nhave the tempo adjusted when the clarity is poor. The completed document can\nthen be emailed back and printed out or incorporated into other documents - all\nwithin just a few hours of the original recording being made.\n\nThe industry standard for transcribing an audio file takes one hour for every 15\nminutes of audio. For live usage, real-time text transcription services are\navailable for captioning purposes, including Remote CART, Captioned Telephone,\nand live closed captioning during live broadcasts. Live transcripts are less\naccurate than offline transcripts, as there is no time for corrections and\nrefinements. However, in a multistage subtitling process with a broadcast delay\nand access to a live audio feed it is possible to have several correction stages\nand for the text to be displayed at the same time as the \"live\" transmission.\n\nThere are two methods of transcription: dictation typing of correspondence and\nreports, and interview transcription.\n\nDictation typing is one person dictating and interview transcription is of two\npeople or more.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Transcription_(service)","recorded":1374963290,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Medical_transcription","/wiki/Spoken_language","/wiki/Written_language","/wiki/Computer_file","/wiki/Document","/wiki/Court_hearing","/wiki/Criminal_trial","/wiki/Court_reporter","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/Medical_transcription","/wiki/Shorthand","/w/index.php?title=Tape_cassettes&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Internal_mail","/w/index.php?title=External_mail&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mp3","/wiki/Dictaphone","/wiki/Filtered","/w/index.php?title=Equalised&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tempo","/wiki/Real-time_text","/wiki/Remote_CART","/wiki/Captioned_Telephone","/wiki/Closed_captioning","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Best_practice","/wiki/Law_firms","/wiki/Government_agencies","/wiki/Courts","/wiki/Information_security","/wiki/Passwords","/wiki/Secure_environment","/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreements","/wiki/Oaths","/wiki/Confidentiality","/wiki/Accuracy","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&oldid=564542162","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Transcription_(linguistics)","/wiki/Category:Writing","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transcription+%28service%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Transcription+%28service%29","/wiki/Transcription_(service)","/wiki/Talk:Transcription_(service)","#","/wiki/Transcription_(service)","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Transcription_(service)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Transcription_(service)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&oldid=564542162","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2249643","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Transcription_%28service%29&id=564542162","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Transcription+%28service%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Transcription+%28service%29&oldid=564542162&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Transcription_(service)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreibb%C3%BCro","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2249643#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(service)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transcription
