The buds on the\ntwig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars\nwhere the leaves have fallen away. The color, texture, and patterning of the\ntwig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any\npith of the twig.\n\nThere are two types of twig, vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs\nare specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and\nleading twigs, and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings\nfrom seasons past. The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by\ncounting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, down the\nlength of the twig.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Twig","recorded":1362897290,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant morphology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Woody_plant","Abscission","Bark","Pith"]}
