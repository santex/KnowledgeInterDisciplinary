The tigon is not currently as\ncommon as the converse hybrid, the liger; however, in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries, Gerard Iles wrote that he had been able to obtain three tigons,\nbut he had never seen a\nliger.<ref>iam.colum.edu/students/ronald.bass/aim2/p2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe tigon's genome includes genetic components of both\nparents.<ref>http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v6n3/lee.html</ref> Tigons\ncan exhibit observable characteristics of both\nparents:<ref>http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v6n3/lee.html</ref> they\ncan have both spots from the mother (lions carry genes for spots—lion cubs are\nspotted and some adults retain faint markings) and stripes from the father. Any\nmane that a male tigon may have will appear shorter and less noticeable than a\nlion's mane and is closer in type to the ruff of a male tiger. It is a common\nmisconception that tigons are smaller than lions or tigers. They do not exceed\nthe size of their parent species because they inherit growth-inhibitory genes\nfrom the lioness mother, but they do not exhibit any kind of dwarfism or\nminiaturization; they often weigh around .\n\nA number of tigons are currently being bred in China.\n","title":"Tigon%20%28hybrid%29","headings":["Fertility","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Liger","1: Animal","1: Chordate","1: Mammal","1: Carnivora","1: Felidae","1: Panthera_tigris","1: Panthera_leo","1: Tiger","1: Lion","1: Genus","1: Species","1: Lion#Mane","1: Gene","1: Tierpark_Hellabrunn","1: Alipore_Zoo","1: Asiatic_Lion","1: Golden_tiger","1: Siberian_Tiger","1: Cancer","1: Hybrid_growth_disorders","1: Maltese_tiger","1: Panthera_hybrid"]}
