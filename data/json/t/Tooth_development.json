{"cursor":"67566","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Tooth development' or 'odontogenesis' is the complex process by which teeth\nform from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse\nspecies have teeth, non-human tooth development is largely the same as in\nhumans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin,\ncementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of\nfetal development. Primary (baby) teeth start to form between the sixth and\neighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they\nwill not develop at all.\n\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that\ninitiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within\nthe tissues of the first branchial arch that is necessary for the development of\nteeth.\n\nIn vertebrates, several specializations of epithelial tissue ('phanÃ¨res')\ngenerate after thickening specific structures: keratinized structure (hair,\nnails) or exoskeletons structure (scales, teeth). Placoids scales and teeth of\nsharks are considered homologous organs.\n","linknr":1036,"url":"Tooth_development","recorded":1362477549,"links":39,"instances":["biology","anatomy","dental","observational","biology","physical","human","tooth","people","dentistry","biology","biology","dentistry","mechanics","dental","biology","zoology","biology","tooth"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tooth
