      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Trial and error' is a fundamental method of solving problems.<ref>Evolutionary\nEpistemology, Rationality, and the Sociology of Knowledge p94 p108</ref> It is\ncharacterised by repeated, varied attempts which are continued until\nsuccess,<ref>Concise Oxford Dictionary p1489</ref> or until the agent stops\ntrying. It is an unsystematic method which does not employ insight, theory or\norganised methodology.\n\nAccording to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan after trying\nout similar phrases \"trial and failure\" and \"trial and practice\".<ref>Thorpe\nW.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London & Praeger, New York.\np26. ISBN 0-03-053251-1</ref> Under Morgan's canon, animal behaviour should be\nexplained in the simplest possible way. Where behaviour seems to imply higher\nmental processes, it might be explained by trial and error learning. An example\nis the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily\nmisunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behaviour. Lloyd\nMorgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which\nthe dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no\ninsight was required to explain it.\n\nEdward Thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the\nlaboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle\nboxes in order to study the law of effect in learning.<ref>Thorndike E.L. 1898.\nAnimal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in\nanimals. Psychological Monographs #8.</ref> He plotted learning curves which\nrecorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that\nlearning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended\nby B.F. Skinner's operant conditioning.\n\nTrial and error is also a heuristic method of problem solving, repair, tuning,\nor obtaining knowledge. In the field of computer science, the method is called\n'generate and test'. In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is\n'\"guess and check\"'.\n\nThis approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem solving,\ncontrasted with an approach using insight and theory. However, there are\nintermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an\napproach known as guided empiricism.\n",
