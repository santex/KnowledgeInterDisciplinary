Transposition often results in duplication of the TE. Barbara McClintock's\ndiscovery of these 'jumping genes' early in her career earned her a Nobel prize\nin 1983. {{cite journal|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S\nA.|year=1950|month=June |volume=36|issue=6|pages=344â355|title=The origin and\nbehavior of mutable loci in maize|author=McClintock, B.|pmid=15430309|doi=10.10-\n73/pnas.36.6.344|pmc=1063197|bibcode=1950PNAS...36..344M|display-\nauthors=1}}\n\nTEs make up a large fraction of the C-value of eukaryotic cells.
