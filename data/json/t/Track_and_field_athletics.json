The name of the sport derives\nfrom the competition venue: a stadium with an oval running track around a grass\nfield. The throwing and jumping events generally take place in the central\nenclosed area.\n\nTrack and field falls under the umbrella sport of athletics—(which also\nincludes road running, cross-country running, and race walking). The two most\nprestigious international track and field competitions are held under the banner\nof athletics: the athletics competition at the Olympic Games and the IAAF World\nChampionships in Athletics. The International Association of Athletics\nFederations is the international governing body for track and field.\n\nTrack and field events are generally individual sports with athletes challenging\neach other to decide a single victor. The racing events are won by the athlete\nwith the fastest time, while the jumping and throwing events are won by the\nathlete who has achieved the greatest distance or height in the contest. The\nrunning events are categorised as sprints, middle and long-distance events,\nrelays, and hurdling. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump,\nhigh jump and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put,\njavelin, discus and hammer. There are also \"combined events\", such as heptathlon\nand decathlon, in which athletes compete in a number of the above events.\n\nTrack and field in the United States and Canada tends to refer to all athletics\nevents, including racewalking, marathon and cross-country running.\n\nRecords are kept of the best performances in specific events, at world and\nnational levels, right down to a personal level. However, if athletes are deemed\nto have violated the event's rules or regulations, they are disqualified from\nthe competition and their marks are erased.\n","linknr":1560,"url":"Track_and_field_athletics","recorded":1362479229,"links":67,"instances":["sports","game","athletics","track_and_field","running","island","racing","length","entertainment","ancient_greece","sport","running","disambiguation","sprinter","united_kingdom","athlete","running","athlete"],"pdf":["http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_658.pdf","http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv7n1/JOHv7n1g.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/45/31/20091001092345_httppostedfile_CompRules-2009-Eng_16838.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/04/95/59/20090303014358_httppostedfile_CompetitionRules2009_printed_8986.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/imported/9589.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/AboutIAAF/Publications/05/47/96/20100113075829_httppostedfile_IAAFConstitution-01.11.09-Eng-Website_17812.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Antidoping/Rules&Regulations/03/30/48/20100113104605_httppostedfile_Chap32010-2011_EN_17816.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Antidoping/Rules&Regulations/05/63/49/20100331073253_httppostedfile_2010Anti-DopingRegulations-Website-Final-Eng_19750.pdf","http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Antidoping/Rules&Regulations/05/52/78/20100112023517_httppostedfile_WADA_Prohibited_List_2010_EN_17798.pdf"],"categories":["Track
