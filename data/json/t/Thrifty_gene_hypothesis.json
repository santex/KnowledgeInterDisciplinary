{"cursor":"18421","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'thrifty genehypothesis' states that connections between low quality fetal\nand infant growth followed by diabetes mellitus type 2 and metabolic syndrome\ncaused by poor nutrition during early childhood, produces permanent effects in\nglucose-insulin metabolism. The hypothesis was proposed by geneticist\nJames V. Neel in 1962 to resolve a fundamental problem. Diabetes is clearly a\nvery harmful medical condition. Yet it is quite common, and it was already\nevident to Neel that it likely had a strong genetic basis. The problem is to\nunderstand how disease with a likely genetic component and with such negative\neffects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection. Neel\nsuggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to\ndiabetes (called 'thrifty genes') were historically advantageous, but they\nbecame detrimental in the modern world. In his words they were \"rendered\ndetrimental by 'progress'\". Neel's primary interest was in diabetes, but the\nidea was soon expanded to also encompass obesity. Thrifty genes are genes which\nenable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit fat during\nperiods of food abundance.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' genotype would have been advantageous\nfor hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing women, because it\nwould allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance. Fatter\nindividuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food\nscarcity. However, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this\ngenotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. The\nresult is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes.\n\nThe hypothesis has received various criticisms and several modified or\nalternative hypotheses have been proposed.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Thrifty_gene_hypothesis","recorded":1362485082,"links":14,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obesity","Diabetes"],"headings":["Hypothesis and research by Neel","Other research","Thrifty phenotype hypothesis","Other alternative hypotheses","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canalisation","genetics"]],"members":["canalisation"],"related":["Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Metabolic_syndrome","Genetics","James_V._Neel","Diabetes","Obesity","Genotype","Hunter-gatherer","Pregnancy","Human_genetics","University_of_Michigan_Health_System","Western_world","Genetic_predisposition","Gene_pool","Non-insulin-dependent_diabetes_mellitus","Impaired_glucose_tolerance","Metabolic_syndrome","Western_pattern_diet","Pacific_Islander","Sub-Saharan_Africa","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Southwestern_United_States","Inuit","Famine","Paleolithic","Anthropology","Body_mass_index","Lipid_metabolism","Canalisation_(genetics)","Gene_regulatory_network","Metabolic_syndrome","Insulin_resistance","R/K_selection_theory","Drifty_gene_hypothesis","John_Speakman","Genetic_drift","Genetics_of_obesity","New_World_Syndrome"]}
