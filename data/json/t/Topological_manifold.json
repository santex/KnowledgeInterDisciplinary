{"cursor":"12491","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'topological manifold' is a topological space (can even be a\nseparated space) which looks locally like Euclidean space in a sense defined\nbelow. Topological manifolds form an important class of topological spaces with\napplications throughout mathematics.\n\nA [[manifold]] can mean a topological manifold, or more frequently, a\ntopological manifold together with some additional structure. Differentiable\nmanifolds, for example, are topological manifolds equipped with a differential\nstructure. Every manifold has an underlying topological manifold, obtained\nsimply by forgetting the additional structure. An overview of the manifold\nconcept is given in that article. This article focuses purely on the topological\naspects of manifolds.\n","linknr":222,"url":"Topological_manifold","recorded":1362477234,"links":22,"instances":["mathematics","topology","geometry","mathematics","topology","topology","topology","topology","topology","topology"],"pdf":["http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/ks.pdf","http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/ks.pdf"],"categories":["Manifolds","Properties of topological spaces"],"headings":["Formal definition","Examples","Properties","Coordinate charts","Classification of manifolds","Manifolds with boundary","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/c/f4c7ab9c1c202b64c4101e953fc9f374.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["neighborhood","topology"],["group","mathematics"],["product","topology"],["disjoint_union","topology"],["disjoint_union","topology"],["connected_component","topology"],["pathological","mathematics"],["long_line","topology"],["connected_component","topology"],["basis","topology"],["cover","topology"],["half-space","geometry"]],"members":["pathological","connected_component","group","disjoint_union","cover","basis","product","long_line","neighborhood"],"related":["Mathematics","Topological_space","Hausdorff_space","Euclidean_space","Differentiable_manifold","Differential_structure","Topological_space","Neighborhood_(topology)","Homeomorphic","Euclidean_space","Hausdorff_space","Paracompact","Second-countable","Euclidean_space","Discrete_space","Circle","Torus","Surface","Klein_bottle","N-sphere","Compact_space","N-torus","Circle","Projective_space","Real_number","Complex_number","Quaternion","Real_projective_space","Complex_projective_space","Quaternionic_projective_space","Grassmannian","Flag_manifold","Stiefel_manifold","Lens_space","Quotient_space","Lie_group","Group_(mathematics)","Subspace_topology","Product_(topology)","Disjoint_union_(topology)","Connected_sum","List_of_manifolds","Local_homeomorphism","Topological_property","Locally_compact_space","Locally_connected_space","First-countable_space","Locally_contractible_space","Locally_metrizable_space","Tychonoff_space","Disjoint_union_(topology)","Connected_component_(topology)","Open_set","If_and_only_if","T1_space","Metrizable_space","Paracompact","Pathological_(mathematics)","Long_line_(topology)","Perfectly_normal_Hausdorff_space","Second-countable_space","Embedding","Lindelöf_space","Σ-compact_space","Countable_set","Connected_component_(topology)","Separable_space","Compact_space","Invariance_of_domain","Topological_property","3-manifold","4-manifold","5-manifold","Invariance_of_domain","Open_ball","Basis_(topology)","Cover_(topology)","Cartography","Globe","Atlas","Differentiable_manifolds","Diffeomorphism","Discrete_space","Cardinality","Countable_set","Circle","Disjoint_union","Surface","Sphere","Connected_sum","Torus","Real_projective_plane","Classification_theorem_for_surfaces","Thurston's_geometrization_conjecture","Grigori_Perelman","Word_problem_for_groups","Group_theory","Undecidable_problem","Algorithm","Simply_connected","Hausdorff_space","Half-space_(geometry)","3-manifold","4-manifold","5-manifold"]}
