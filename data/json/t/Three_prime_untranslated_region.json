{"cursor":"4676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn molecular genetics, the 'three prime untranslated region' (3' UTR) is a\nparticular section of messenger RNA (mRNA). It starts with the nucleotide\nimmediately following the stop codon of the coding region.\n\nA mRNA molecule codes for a protein through translation. The mRNA also contains\nregions that are not translated. In eukaryotes these regions are the cap, 5'\nuntranslated region, '3' untranslated region', and polyA tail (see diagram).\n\nIn prokaryotes mRNA structures have some differences (see mRNA) as do histone\nmRNAs. However, both have 3' UTRs.\n\nSeveral regulatory sequences are found in the 3' UTR:\n* A polyadenylation signal, usually AAUAAA, or a slight variant. This marks the\n  site of cleavage of the transcript approximately 30 base pairs past the\n  signal, followed by the addition of several hundred adenine residues (poly-A\n  tail).\n* Binding sites for proteins, that may affect the mRNA's stability or location\n  in the cell, like SECIS elements (which direct the ribosome to translate the\n  codon UGA as selenocysteines rather than as a stop codon), or AU-rich elements\n  (AREs), stretches consisting of mainly adenine and uracil nucleotides (which\n  can either stabilize or destabilize the mRNA depending on the protein bound to\n  it).\n* Binding sites for miRNAs, a type of RNAi.\n\nGenetic alterations to the 3'UTR can be used to increase or decrease the half-\nlife of the mRNA, leading to greater or lesser protein levels.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Three_prime_untranslated_region","recorded":1362374362,"links":15,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Gene expression"],"headings":["See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/MRNA_structure.svg/400px-MRNA_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Molecular_genetics","Messenger_RNA","Stop_codon","Coding_region","Protein","Translation_(genetics)","5'_cap","5'_untranslated_region","Polyadenylation","MRNA","Histone","Regulatory_sequence","Polyadenylation","Base_pair","Poly-A_tail","SECIS_element","Selenocysteine","AU-rich_element","Adenine","Uracil","MiRNA","RNAi","Five_prime_untranslated_region","UTRdb","UTRome","Medical_Subject_Heading"]}
