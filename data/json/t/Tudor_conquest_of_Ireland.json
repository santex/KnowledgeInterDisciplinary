{"cursor":"20396","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, sets out from Dublin Castle. Detail\nfrom a plate in The Image of Irelande, by John Derrick (London,\n1581). ]] The 'Tudor conquest (or reconquest) of Ireland' took place\nunder the Tudor dynasty, which held the Kingdom of England during the 16th\ncentury. Following a failed rebellion against the crown by Silken Thomas, the\nEarl of Kildare, in the 1530s, Henry VIII was declared King of Ireland by\nstatute of the Irish parliament, with the aim of restoring such central\nauthority as had been lost throughout the country during the previous two\nhundred years.\n\nBy conciliation and repression the conquest continued for sixty years, until\n1603, when the entire country came under the nominal control of James I,\nexercised through his privy council at Dublin. This control was perfected upon\nthe Flight of the Earls in 1607.\n\nThe conquest was complicated by the imposition of English law, language and\nculture, as well as by the extension of Anglicanism as an institutional\nreligion. The Spanish Empire intervened several times at the height of the Anglo-\nSpanish War (1585-1604), and the Irish found themselves caught between their\nwidespread acceptance of the Pope's authority and the requirements of allegiance\ndemanded of them by the English monarchy.\n\nUpon completion of the conquest, the polity of Gaelic Ireland had been largely\ndestroyed and the Spanish were no longer willing to intervene directly. This\nleft the way clear for extensive confiscation of land by English, Scots, and\nWelsh colonists, culminating in the Plantation of Ulster.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland","recorded":1362889510,"links":16,"instances":["ireland","ireland","lord_deputy_of_ireland","settlement_or_colony","soldier","1585"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of Ireland","Flight of the Earls","Tudor England|Conquest"],"headings":["Ireland in 1500","Henry VIII","Difficulties","Solutions","Crisis","Results","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Henry_sidney_ireland_detail.jpg/250px-Henry_sidney_ireland_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Elizabeth_I%27s_primer_on_Irish.jpg/200px-Elizabeth_I%27s_primer_on_Irish.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hugh_%C3%93_Neill%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Tyrone.jpg/220px-Hugh_%C3%93_Neill%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Tyrone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["anglo-spanish_war","1585"],["anthony_st_leger","lord_deputy_of_ireland"],["plantations_of_ireland#early_plantations","1556â€“1576"],["richard_bingham","soldier"],["old_english","ireland"],["nine_years_war","ireland"],["anglo-spanish_war","1585"],["plantation","settlement_or_colony"],["old_english","ireland"],["nine_years_war","ireland"]],"members":["nine_years_war","old_english","anthony_st_leger","plantation","richard_bingham"],"related":["Tudor_dynasty","Kingdom_of_England","Rebellion","Silken_Thomas","Earl_of_Kildare","Henry_VIII_of_England","King_of_Ireland","Irish_parliament","James_I_of_England","Privy_council","Dublin","Flight_of_the_Earls","Culture","English_Reformation","Spanish_Empire","Anglo-Spanish_War_(1585)","Gaelic_Ireland","Plantation_of_Ulster","Norman_invasion_of_Ireland","Gaels","Dundalk","The_Pale","Hiberno-Norman","Fiefdom","Black_Death","Clan_Burke","Gaels","Ulster","County_Wicklow","County_Wexford","County_Cork","County_Kerry","County_Clare","Statutes_of_Kilkenny","Irish_language","Wars_of_the_Roses","Lord_Deputy_of_Ireland","Yorkist","Silken_Thomas","Thomas_Cromwell","Surrender_and_regrant","Royal_Charter","Kingdom_of_Ireland","Anthony_St_Leger_(Lord_Deputy_of_Ireland)","Confiscation","Leinster","Mary_I_of_England","Philip_II_of_Spain","Laois","Offaly","Shane_O'Neill","Battle_of_Affane","Battle_of_Farsetmore","The_Pale","Desmond_Rebellions","Brehon_laws","Primogeniture","Gallowglass","Elizabeth_I_of_England","Mary_I_of_England","Elizabeth_I_of_England","Wicklow_Mountains","Seneschal","Martial_law","Taxation","Richard_Bingham_(soldier)","Nicholas_Malby","Lord_President_of_Munster","Desmond_Rebellions","Thomond","Surrender_and_regrant","English_language","Desmond_Rebellions","Plantations_of_Ireland","Sir_Walter_Raleigh","Richard_Boyle,_1st_Earl_of_Cork","Earl_of_Cork","Regnans_in_Excelsis","Second_Desmond_Rebellion","Old_English_(Ireland)","Elizabethan","Ulster","Hugh_O'Neill,_2nd_Earl_of_Tyrone","Maguire","County_Fermanagh","Nine_Years_War_(Ireland)","Anglo-Spanish_War_(1585)","Spain","Philip_III_of_Spain","Battle_of_Kinsale","Flight_of_the_Earls","Plantation_of_Ulster","English_people","Scotland","Wales","James_Fitzmaurice_Fitzgerald","Hugh_O'Neill,_Earl_of_Tyrone","Plantation_(settlement_or_colony)","Plantation_of_Ulster","James_I_of_England","Gunpowder_plot","Old_English_(Ireland)","Irish_Rebellion_of_1641","Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland","Glorious_Revolution","Protestant_Ascendancy","Early_Modern_Ireland_1536-1691","Plantations_of_Ireland","History_of_Ireland","Desmond_Rebellions","Nine_Years_War_(Ireland)","Miler_Magrath"]}
