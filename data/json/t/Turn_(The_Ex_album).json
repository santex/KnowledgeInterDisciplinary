After 20\nyears of working with Luc, their former bass guitarist, Turn is the only Ex\nalbum to feature double bass player Rosemarie giving the band a sound akin their\nprior work with cellist Tom Cora. In tandem with The Ex's drummer Katrin,\nRosemarie also contributed significant female vocal harmonies to the album.\n\nOn Turn, The Ex also displayed their love and interpretations of African rhythms\nand melodies. On \"Theme From Konono\" The Ex's guitars imitate amplified thumb\npianos in a tribute to the infectious rhythm of Congolese percussion group\nKonono NÂº 1 who had toured Europe with The Ex. \"Getatchew\" pays tribute to\nEthiopian Saxophone legend Getatchew Mekuria with whom The Ex would later record\nan album. Turn also features The Ex playing the Eritrean revolutionary song\n\"Huriyet\" set to a traditional Tigrinya beat.\n\nTurn was recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago, and mixed by\nMikel Le Roy and The Ex at Studio Le Roy, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Turn_(The_Ex_album)","recorded":1362892611,"links":15,"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Ex albums","2004 albums","Albums produced by Steve Albini"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Turnexalbum.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_ex","band"],["the_ex","band"]],"members":["the_ex"],"related":["The_Ex_(band)","Electrical_Audio","Chicago","Studio_Le_Roy","Amsterdam","Punk_rock","Post-punk","Experimental_music","African_music","Touch_and_Go_Records","Steve_Albini","Mikel_Le_Roy","Double_album","Netherlands","Anarchist","Post-punk","The_Ex_(band)","Bass_guitar","Double_bass","Cellist","Tom_Cora","Thumb_piano","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Konono_Nº_1","Getatchew_Mekuria","Moa_Anbessa","Tigrinya","Steve_Albini","Electrical_Audio","Chicago","Amsterdam","Netherlands"]}
