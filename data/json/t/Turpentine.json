It is composed of terpenes, mainly the monoterpenes alpha-\npinene and beta-pinene with lesser amounts of carene, camphene, dipentene, and\nterpinolene. Kent p.569 It is sometimes colloquially known\nas turps.\n\nThe word turpentine derives (via French and Latin) from the Greek word\nÏÎµÏÎµÎ²Î¹Î½Î¸Î¯Î½Î· terebinthine, the name of a species of tree, the terebinth\ntree. Mineral turpentine or other petroleum distillates are used to\nreplace turpentine, but they are very different chemically.
