The imprint was\nestablished as a children's imprint to complement the adult Tandem imprint, and\nbecame well known for their highly successful range of novelisations and other\nassorted books based on the popular science-fiction television series [[Doctor\nWho]]. In 1975 Universal-Tandem was sold by its American owners, the Universal-\nAward group, to the British conglomerate Howard and Wyndham. The company was\nrenamed Tandem Publishing Ltd before being merged with the paperback imprints of\nHoward and Wyndham's general publishing house W. H. Allen Ltd to become Wyndham\nPublications Ltd in 1976. However, during 1977 and 1978 the Wyndham identity was\nphased out and, until 1991, Target books were published by 'the paperback\ndivision of WH Allen & Co.'\n\nThe most prolific writer in the Doctor Who range was Terrance Dicks, while actor\nturned writer Ian Marter, Malcolm Hulke, Philip Hinchcliffe and Nigel Robinson\n(who was for a time the editor of the range) were also contributors.\n\nAlmost every story from the Doctor Who series was produced in novelisation\nform; the exceptions being three scripts by Douglas Adams ([[Shada]], [[The\nPirate Planet]] and [[City of Death]]) and two by Eric Saward ([[Resurrection\nof the Daleks]] and [[Revelation of the Daleks]]). Saward was reluctant to\nnovelise these scripts himself due to the large percentage of the author's\nroyalties demanded by the agents of the creator of the Daleks, Terry Nation,\nfor the inclusion of the creatures, and other writers were dissuaded for the\nsame reason. Adams, when interviewed on video about his involvement with Doctor\nWho, stated that he was unhappy with the standard one-off fee offered by Target\nBooks for the novelisations saying \"I do have this tendency to be a best-\nselling author\".\n\nThe company also produced novelisations of various other films and television\nseries, again aimed mostly at the child and teenage markets. They also published\na number of original children's and teenage novels. In 1973, the company\nproduced a successful paperback edition of Tim Dinsdale's book, The Story of the\nLoch Ness Monster. In 1977, Target published the novelisation of the Ray\nHarryhausen film, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger.\n\nWH Allen was purchased by the Virgin Group in the late 1980s and changed its\nname to Virgin Publishing in 1991. According to the On Target website (see link\nbelow), the Target Books line was retired on new books following the\npublication of Victor Pemberton's [[The Pescatons|Doctor Who - The Pescatons]]\nin the autumn of 1991.\n\nHowever, when Virgin Books later published novelisations of the serials [[The\nEvil of the Daleks]] and [[The Power of the Daleks]], and an adaptation of the\nradio play [[The Paradise of Death]], the books were identified as being part of\nthe Target series on their title pages; The Paradise of Death, published in\nApril 1994 as No. 156 in the \"Doctor Who Library\", was the last book to be\nconnected to Target. Reprints of the older novelisations with new covers were\npublished until March 1994, using the Target name.\n\nFurther novelisations of Doctor Who-related productions were published by Virgin\nunder the New Adventures and Missing Adventures lines (including an adaptation\nof the BBC Radio play [[The Ghosts of N-Space]] and the independently-produced\nspin-offs [[Downtime (Doctor Who)|Downtime]] and [[Shakedown: Return of the\nSontarans]]), while BBC Books would later adapt the 1996 TV-movie, the 2003\nwebcast, [[Scream of the Shalka]] and, in March 2012, the unbroadcast story,\n[[Shada]].\n","linknr":141,"url":"Target_Books","recorded":1375068981,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Target_books.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Target_books.png","/wiki/Parent_company","/wiki/Universal-Tandem_Publishing_Co_Ltd","/wiki/Publishing","/wiki/Imprint","/wiki/Universal-Tandem_Publishing_Co_Ltd","/wiki/Publisher","/wiki/Universal-Tandem_Publishing_Co_Ltd","/wiki/Novelisation","/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television","/wiki/Doctor_Who","/w/index.php?title=Universal-Award&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Howard_and_Wyndham","/wiki/Tandem_Publishing_Ltd","/wiki/W._H._Allen_Ltd","/wiki/Wyndham_Publications_Ltd","/wiki/Terrance_Dicks","/wiki/Ian_Marter","/wiki/Malcolm_Hulke","/wiki/Philip_Hinchcliffe","/wiki/Nigel_Robinson","/wiki/Douglas_Adams","/wiki/Shada","/wiki/The_Pirate_Planet","/wiki/City_of_Death","/wiki/Eric_Saward","/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/Revelation_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/Terry_Nation","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Film","/wiki/Television","/wiki/Tim_Dinsdale","/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster","/wiki/Ray_Harryhausen","/wiki/Sinbad_and_the_Eye_of_the_Tiger","/wiki/Virgin_Group","/wiki/Virgin_Publishing","/wiki/Victor_Pemberton","/wiki/The_Pescatons","/wiki/The_Evil_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/The_Power_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/The_Paradise_of_Death","/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures","/wiki/Virgin_Missing_Adventures","/wiki/The_Ghosts_of_N-Space","/wiki/Downtime_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/Shakedown:_Return_of_the_Sontarans","/wiki/BBC_Books","/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)","/wiki/Webcast","/wiki/Scream_of_the_Shalka","/wiki/Shada","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_novelisations","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit&section=2","http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecl6nb/OnTarget/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&oldid=561931881","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Book_publishing_companies_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Publishers_of_Doctor_Who_books","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2006","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Target+Books&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Target+Books","/wiki/Target_Books","/wiki/Talk:Target_Books","#","/wiki/Target_Books","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Target_Books","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Target_Books","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&oldid=561931881","/w/index.php?title=Target_Books&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12005242","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Target_Books&id=561931881","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Target+Books","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_ar
