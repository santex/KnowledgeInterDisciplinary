He is known as \"Nagashime Ouji\" (æµãç®çå­) or \"Sidelong Glance Prince\".\n\nHis father is the head of the gekidan sujaku theatre troupe, and Saotome grew up\nwithin the troupe, performing primarily in [[taishÅ« engeki]], a theatrical form\nrelated to kabuki, but less formalized. Identified as having a natural talent as\nan onnagata (female impersonator), he has been trained in that field, and\nperforms in female roles onstage.\n\nHe has acted in two films by director Takeshi Kitano. In 2003, in [[Zatoichi\n(2003 film)|Zatoichi]], he portrayed the child Seitaro who, when older,\ndisguised himself as a geisha (played by Daigoro Tachibana). Though in a\ndifferent troupe from Tachibana, the two have frequently practiced and performed\ntogether. Saotome was also in Kitano's 2005 film, [[Takeshis']], in which he was\ncredited as himself, playing a young female impersonator and dancer.\n\nSaotome also plays young male roles, particularly those with a bishÅnen\naesthetic, i.e. graceful, beautiful young men. In 2005, he played the role of\nMori Ranmaru in a National Museum event called \"Sengoku Fantasy\", and on New\nYear's 2007, he played a young Horibe Yasubee in the NHK New Year's\n[[jidaigeki]] play.\n\nThough he has not appeared in many films, Saotome has a powerful fan following\nin the theatre, and his official fan club was established in 2006. He has said\nthat he does not really understand his appeal, but is happy that people of all\nages enjoy his performances. \"Teen's Female Performances Draw Him a\nCrowd.\" NPR.org.\n[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15004725]. 30 October\n2007. His appearance on the variety show [[D no GekijÅ]] in late January\n2007 was one of a number of his events which have generated an overwhelming fan\nresponse. It was arranged that he would reprise the same performance, a dance in\na flower-decorated kimono, at the TaishÅkan, soon afterwards. The performance\nwas sold out the next day. Many of his fellow performers from D no GekijÅ and\nother events are said to have become fans of his as well, and make time in their\nbusy schedules to attend his performances.\n\nSaotome has expressed a desire to play men's roles and to perform in more\nmainstream or traditional theatre, saying that he has never much cared for\nplaying female roles.\n\nBeginning in October 2010, Saotome will star in the stage production of the\notome game, [[Hakuouki]]. He has been cast as vice commander, Hijikata Toshizo,\nof the Shinsengumi.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Taichi_Saotome","recorded":1374784126,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Japanese_name","/wiki/Family_name","/wiki/Dazaifu,_Fukuoka","/wiki/Japan","http://www.saotometaichi.com/","/wiki/Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets","/wiki/Taish%C5%AB_engeki","/wiki/Kabuki","/wiki/Takeshi_Kitano","/wiki/Zatoichi_(2003_film)","/wiki/Daigoro_Tachibana","/wiki/Takeshis%27","/wiki/Sengoku","/wiki/NHK","/wiki/Jidaigeki","#cite_note-NPR-1","/w/index.php?title=D_no_Gekij%C5%8D&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kimono","/w/index.php?title=Taish%C5%8Dkan&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-NPR-1","/wiki/Otome_game","/wiki/Hakuouki","/wiki/Hijikata_Toshizo","/wiki/Shinsengumi","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=edit&section=1","http://www.taiching.jp/","#cite_ref-NPR_1-0","#cite_ref-NPR_1-1","/wiki/National_Public_Radio","http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15004725","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=edit&section=2","http://www.saotometaichi.com/","http://ameblo.jp/sujyaku/","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1671749/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://lokulog.blog43.fc2.com/blog-entry-1138.html","http://blog.goo.ne.jp/kuronyan510/e/5d3e7fc9b3060705fd5b4f99a35151bd","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Dazaifu,_Fukuoka","/wiki/Japan","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&oldid=552079370","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1991_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Japanese_stage_actors","/wiki/Category:Japanese_film_actors","/wiki/Category:Japanese_dancers","/wiki/Category:People_from_Fukuoka_Prefecture","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dazaifu,_Fukuoka","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Japanese-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Taichi+Saotome&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Taichi+Saotome","/wiki/Taichi_Saotome","/wiki/Talk:Taichi_Saotome","#","/wiki/Taichi_Saotome","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Taichi_Saotome","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Taichi_Saotome","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&oldid=552079370","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9146748","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Taichi_Saotome&id=552079370","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Taichi+Saotome","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Taichi+Saotome&oldid=552079370&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Taichi_Saotome&printable=yes","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A9%E4%B9%99%E5%A5%B3%E5%A4%AA%E4%B8%80","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A9%E4%B9%99%E5%A5%B3%E5%A4%AA%E4%B8%80","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9146748#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taichi_Saotome","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/stat
