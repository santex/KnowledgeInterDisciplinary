It was released in 1992 by Earache Records and follows the\nband's debut album [[The Key (Nocturnus album)|The Key]].\n\nThresholds continued the experimental sound created on the first album and the\nline-up was expanded to a six-piece with the addition of a vocalist &ndash;\nallowing Mike Browning to concentrate solely on drums. Lyrical topics range from\nopener \"Climate Controller\" (possibly a device that must control the earth's\nclimate after global warming), \"Aquatica\" (about a race that has evolved in the\nocean to overtake humans) and \"Gridzone\" (about an alternate planet capable of\nlife).. \"Tribal Vodoun\" is about primitive religions and voodoo, while\n\"Subterranean Infiltrator\" is inspired by the Metal Gear video game series.\n\nThe production of Thresholds is not considerably more polished than that of The\nKey. The music is also more complex and mature. The time signature changes at\nleast once in every song and there are numerous breakdowns and tempo changes in\nevery song. The band's musicianship has also advanced. Guitarists Mike Davis and\nSean McNenney play longer, more melodic but even more technical solos (now often\nwith a Jason Becker-esque neo-classical flair). Mike Browning's drumming has\nbecome more technical and precise than it was on The Key, not to mention his\ndrum tone has improved. Louis Panzer's keyboard lines are more complex and he\neven takes solos on a few songs. The bass (now played by Chris Anderson) is much\nmore audible than on The Key and is also highly technical. Dan Izzo's vocals are\nmuch deeper and clearer than Mike Browning's, often compared to the vocals of\nMax Cavalera of Sepultura.\n\n\"Alter Reality\" was released as a single and featured a music video that\nreceived substantial airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. \"Arctic Crypt\" and\n\"Climate Controller\" also became notable fan favorites.\n","title":"thresholds","headings":["Track listing","Credits","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Nocturnus","2: Morrisound_Recording","2: Tampa,_Florida","2: Earache_Records","2: Mike_Browning","1: Progressive_death_metal","1: Melodic_death_metal","1: Combat_Records","1: Allmusic","1: Florida","1: Death_metal","1: West_African_Vodun","1: Time_signature","1: Jason_Becker","1: Neo-classical_metal","1: Max_Cavalera","1: Sepultura","1: MTV","1: Headbangers_Ball"]}
