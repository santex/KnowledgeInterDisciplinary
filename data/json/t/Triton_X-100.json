The hydrocarbon group is a\n4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenyl group. It is closely related to IGEPAL CA-\n630 or erstwhile Nonidet P-40 which might differ from it in mainly slightly\nshorter ethylene oxide units. Thus Triton X-100 being slightly more hydrophilic\nthan Igepal CA-630; these two detergents may not be considered to be\nfunctionally interchangeable in most applications [http://www.snowpure.com/docs/triton-x-100-\nsigma.pdf Sigma product description] . Triton X-100 was originally a\nregistered trademark of Rohm & Haas Co. It was subsequently purchased by Union\nCarbide and then acquired by the Dow Chemical Company upon the acquisition of\nUnion Carbide. Soon afterward (in 2009), Dow also acquired Rohm & Haas Co.\n\nTriton X detergents are distantly related to Pluronic range of detergents\nmarketed by BASF. The pluronics are triblock copolymers of ethylene oxide and\npropylene oxide with the ethylene oxide segments being more hydrophilic than the\npropylene oxide.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Triton_X-100","recorded":1362512163,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.snowpure.com/docs/triton-x-100-sigma.pdf"],"categories":["Non-ionic surfactants","Aromatic compounds"],"headings":["Physical properties","Uses","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Triton_X-100.png/200px-Triton_X-100.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nonionic","Surfactant","Hydrophilic","Polyethylene_oxide","Hydrocarbon","Lipophilic","Hydrophobic","Phenyl","IGEPAL_CA-630","Nonidet_P-40","Union_Carbide","Dow_Chemical_Company","Pluronic","Detergent","BASF","Ethylene_oxide","Propylene_oxide","Polyethylene_oxide","Viscosity","Centipoise","Detergent","Membrane_protein","Zwitterion","CHAPS_detergent","Lysis_buffer","DNA_extraction","Immunostaining","Vinyl_record","Isopropyl_alcohol","Detergent","Surfactant"]}
