{"cursor":"1353","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn civil engineering, a 'transient' is used to refer to any pressure wave that\nis short lived (i.e. not static pressure or pressure differential due to\nfriction/minor loss in flow). The most common occurrence of this is called water\nhammer. In a pipe network, when a valve or pump is suddenly shut off, the water\nflowing in an adjacent pipe is suddenly forced to stop. A region of high\npressure builds up immediately behind said valve or pump and a region of low\npressure forms in front of it. The momentum of the water is suddenly transferred\ninto the fitting and Newton's Third Law kicks in forming growing the high-\npressure region of water as it all \"piles up\" in the pipe. This high pressure\nregion then travels back along the pipe in the form of a wave. The border of the\nhigh-pressure zone is referred to as a pressure wave, or transient (which is apt\nas the general definition of a transient is something that only exists for a\nshort period of time).\n\nTransients are often misunderstood and not accounted for in the design of water\ndistribution systems and are often the cause of (or a contributing factor to)\nhydraulic element failures (i.e. pipe breaks, pump/valve failures, etc.).\n","linknr":89,"url":"Transient_(civil_engineering)","recorded":1362562716,"links":15,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hydraulic engineering"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Suspension_bridge_pattern_german1.svg/60px-Suspension_bridge_pattern_german1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transience","disambiguation"]],"members":["transience"],"related":["Civil_engineering","Water_hammer","Newton's_Third_Law","Transience_(disambiguation)"]}
