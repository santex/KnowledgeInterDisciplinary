{"cursor":"7209","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Slow playing' (also called 'sandbagging' or 'trapping') is deceptive play in\npoker that is roughly the opposite of bluffing: betting weakly or passively with\na strong holding rather than betting aggressively with a weak one. The flat call\nis one such play. The objective of the passive slow play is to lure opponents\ninto a pot who might fold to a raise, or to cause them to bet more strongly than\nthey would if the player had played aggressively (bet or raised). Slow playing\nsacrifices protection against hands that may improve and risks losing the pot-\nbuilding value of a bet if the opponent also checks.\n\nDavid Sklansky defines the following conditions for profitable slow plays:\n* A player must have a very strong hand.\n* The free card or cheap card the player is allowing to his opponents must have\n  good possibilities of making them a second-best hand.\n* That same free card must have little chance of giving an opponent a better\n  hand or even giving them a draw to a better hand on the next round with\n  sufficient pot odds to justify a call.\n* The player must believe that he will drive out opponents by showing\n  aggression, but can win a big pot if the opponents stay in the pot.\n* The pot must not yet be very large.\n\n:Seven-card stud example :In a seven-card stud game, Ted's first three cards are\nall fours. Alice with a king showing bets first, Ted raises and Alice calls. On\nthe next round, Alice catches another king, and Ted miraculously catches the\nlast four (making four-of-a-kind). Ted suspects Alice has two pair or three\nkings, and Alice suspects that Ted has two pair or three fours. Alice bets\nagain, and Ted just flat calls. Ted decides to just call for next round or two,\nand maybe even check if Alice doesn't bet, rather than raising, for several\nreasons. Ted's hand is so strong that the chance of getting beaten is\nnegligible, so he doesn't need protection. If Alice just has two pair and Ted\nacts strongly, Alice may think Ted has three fours and fold if she doesn't\nimprove. By allowing Alice to continue for smaller stakes, Ted hopes that Alice\nwill improve to a very strong (but second best) hand that will induce her to\nbet, raise, or at least call in the later betting rounds.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Trap_(poker)","recorded":1363548164,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Slow_play_(poker)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Trap_(poker)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Poker_strategy#Deception","/wiki/Poker","/wiki/Bluff_(poker)","/wiki/Poker_jargon#passive","/wiki/Poker_jargon#flat_call","/wiki/Protection_(poker)","/wiki/David_Sklansky","#cite_note-Sklansky_Theory-1","/wiki/Poker_jargon#free_card","/wiki/Draw_(poker)","/wiki/Pot_odds","/wiki/Seven-card_stud","#Relationship_between_slow_playing_and_bluffing","#Check_raising_as_a_slow_play","#Fishing_for_the_overcall","#See_also","#Notes","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-Harrington_II-2","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Check-raise_(poker)","/wiki/Pot_odds#Manipulating_pot_odds","#cite_note-Sklansky_Theory-1","/wiki/Draw_poker","/wiki/Betting_in_poker#Ante","/wiki/Lowball_(poker)","/wiki/Poker_jargon#flat_call","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Poker_jargon#overcall","/wiki/High-low_split","/wiki/Omaha_hold_%27em","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Bluff_(poker)","/wiki/Poker_jargon","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-Sklansky_Theory_1-0","#cite_ref-Sklansky_Theory_1-1","/wiki/David_Sklansky","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-880685-00-0","#cite_ref-Harrington_II_2-0","/wiki/Dan_Harrington","/wiki/Bill_Robertie","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-880685-35-3","#cite_ref-3","http://www.playwinningpoker.com/poker/skills/sharing/","/wiki/Steve_Badger_(poker_player)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&oldid=541664277","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Poker_gameplay_and_terminology","/wiki/Category:Poker_strategy","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slow+play+%28poker%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Slow+play+%28poker%29","/wiki/Slow_play_(poker)","/wiki/Talk:Slow_play_(poker)","#","/wiki/Slow_play_(poker)","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Slow_play_(poker)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Slow_play_(poker)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&oldid=541664277","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Slow_play_%28poker%29&id=541664277","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Slow+play+%28poker%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Slow+play+%28poker%29&oldid=541664277&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Slow_play_(poker)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowplay","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Slow
