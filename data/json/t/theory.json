Depending on the context, the results\nmight for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word\nhas its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several\ndifferent related meanings. A theory is not the same as a hypothesis, as a\ntheory is a 'proven' hypothesis, that, in other words, has never been disproved\nthrough experiment, and has a basis in fact.\n\nOne modern group of meanings emphasizes the speculative and generalizing nature\nof theory. For example in the arts and philosophy, the term \"theoretical\" may be\nused to describe ideas and empirical phenomena which are not easily measurable.\nAnd by extension of the philosophical meaning, \"theoria\" is also a word still\nused in theological contexts. As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is\nvery often contrasted to \"practice\" (from Greek [[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]],\nπρᾶξις) a Greek term for \"doing\", which is opposed to theory because pure theory\ninvolves no doing apart from itself. A classical example of the distinction\nbetween theoretical and practical uses the discipline of medicine: medical\ntheory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and\nsickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy.\nThese two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to\nresearch health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is\npossible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.<ref>See for\nexample Hippocrates [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:-\n1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&highlight=medical%2Ctheory Praeceptiones,\nPart 1].</ref>\n\nIn modern science, the term \"theory\" refers to scientific theories, a well-\nconfirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with\nscientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. Such\ntheories are described in such a way that any scientist in the field is in a\nposition to understand and either provide empirical support (\"verify\") or\nempirically contradict (\"falsify\") it. Scientific theories are the most\nreliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,<ref></ref>\nin contrast to more common uses of the word \"theory\" that imply that something\nis unproven or speculative (which is better defined by the word\n'hypothesis').<ref>[http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html\nNational Academy of Sciences], 2008.</ref> Scientific theories are also\ndistinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable\nconjectures, and scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of how nature\nwill behave under certain conditions.<ref>See the article on Physical law, for\nexample.</ref>\n\nA theory can be \"normative (or prescriptive),<ref name=Kneller93></ref> meaning\na postulation about what ought to be. It provides \"goals, norms, and\nstandards\".<ref name=\"Dolhenty\"></ref>\n\nA theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with\nparticular explanatory models. To theorize is to develop this body of\nknowledge.<ref>Thomas, G. (2007) Education and Theory: Strangers in Paradigms.\nOpen University Press.</ref>\n","title":"theory","headings":["Ancient uses","Theories formally and scientifically","Philosophical
