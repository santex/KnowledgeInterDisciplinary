{"cursor":"10425","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" of the tree.]] A 'tree hollow' or 'tree hole' is a semi-enclosed cavity which\n has naturally formed in the trunk or branch of a tree. These are predominantly\n found in old trees, whether living or not. Hollows form in many species of\n trees, and are a prominent feature of natural forests and woodlands, and act as\n a resource or habitat for a number of vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\n\nHollows may form as the result of physiological stress from natural forces\ncausing the excavating and exposure of the heartwood. Forces including wind,\nfire, heat, lightning, rain, attack from insects (such as termites or beetles),\nbacteria, or fungi. Also, trees may self-prune, dropping lower branches as they\nreach maturity, exposing the area where the branch was attached. Many animals\nfurther develop the hollows using instruments such as their beak, teeth or\nclaws.\n\nThe size of hollows may depend on the age of the tree. For example, eucalypts\ndevelop hollows at all ages, but only from when the trees are 120 years old do\nthey form hollows suitable for vertebrates, and it may take 220 years for\nhollows suitable for larger species to form.\n\nHollows in fallen timber are also very important for animals such as echidnas,\nnumbats, chuditch and many reptiles. In streams, hollow logs may be important to\naquatic animals for shelter and egg attachment.\n\nHollows are an important habitat for many wildlife species, especially where the\nuse of hollows is obligate, as this means no other resource would be a feasible\nsubstitute. Animals may use hollows as diurnal or nocturnal shelter sites, as\nwell as for rearing young, feeding, thermoregulation, and to facilitate ranging\nbehaviour and dispersal. While use may also be opportunistic, rather than\nobligate, it may be difficult to determine the nature of a species' relationship\nto hollowsâit may vary across a species' range, or depend on climatic\nconditions.\n\nAnimals will select a hollow based on factors including entrance size and shape,\ndepth, and degree of insulation. Such factors greatly affect the frequency and\nseasonality of hollow use. Includes a list of Victorian hollow-\nusing animals.\n\nEspecially in Europe, entomologists are interested in the use of hollows by\ninvertebrates. One beetle associated with hollow trees, Osmoderma eremita, has\nbeen given the highest priority according to the European Union's Habitat\nDirective.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Tree_hollow","recorded":1362568540,"links":27,"instances":["botany","ecology","wood"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070926230726/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/dse/nrenpa.nsf/9e58661e880ba9e44a256c640023eb2e/148c12f368f40c594a256dea002499e5/$FILE/LFWNews5_2.pdf","http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/dse/nrenpa.nsf/9e58661e880ba9e44a256c640023eb2e/148c12f368f40c594a256dea002499e5/$FILE/LFWNews5_2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070926230726/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/dse/nrenpa.nsf/9e58661e880ba9e44a256c640023eb2e/148c12f368f40c594a256dea002499e5/$FILE/LFWNews5_2.pdf"],"categories":["Plant morphology"],"headings":["Description","Artificial hollows","Around the world","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Treehollow2500px.JPG/250px-Treehollow2500px.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Eucalyptus_camaldulensis_01_Pengo.jpg/67px-Eucalyptus_camaldulensis_01_Pengo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Dendrocopos_minor_mushrooms_tree_brok_1_beentree.jpg/90px-Dendrocopos_minor_mushrooms_tree_brok_1_beentree.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sapwood","wood"],["trunk","botany"],["snag","ecology"]],"members":["trunk","snag","sapwood"],"related":["Heartwood","Eucalypt","Vertebrate","Echidna","Numbat","Chuditch","Diurnal_animal","Nocturnal","Thermoregulation","Biological_dispersal","Invertebrate","Osmoderma_eremita","Tree","Bark","Sapwood_(wood)","Fungi","Bacteria","Trunk_(botany)","Phytotelma","Ceratopogonidae","Chironomidae","Common_Merganser","Toucan","Woodpecker","Bluebird","La_Crosse_encephalitis","Pygmy_possum","Pardalote","Nest_box","Habitat_conservation","Eastern_Bluebird","Scandinavia","Sweden","Red-listed","Australia","Rare_species","Threatened_species","Near_Threatened","Silviculture","Firewood","Forest_dieback","Inundation","Salinity","Cattle","Common_Myna","Western_honey_bee","Cat","Black_rat","Galah","Common_Brushtail_Possum","Little_Corella","Asian_Black_Bear","Eucalyptus_camaldulensis","Lesser_Spotted_Woodpecker","Nest_box","Snag_(ecology)","Tree_throw"]}
