{"cursor":"3195","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Transmission' is an independent record label set by British progressive rock\nband Porcupine Tree in 2003 (not to be confused with Transmission Records, a\nDutch record company founded in 1995). It was named after an information service\nby mail of the same name the band had during the nineties (subscribers of the\n\"Transmission\" service could even receive some exclusive releases). In a similar\nway, Porcupine Tree uses the label to bring the fans live material or special\nlimited editions of their albums though this does not limit other labels on\nreleasing them, in fact, many albums get their regular editions on major labels\nand are launched as special limited printings through \"Transmission\" later or\neven simultaneously. For example, [[Fear of a Blank Planet]] was first released\non Roadrunner and Atlantic, and thereafter reissued on \"Transmission\" as a\nlimited DVDA version.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Transmission_(record_label)","recorded":1362673158,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf"],"categories":["British independent record labels","Record labels established in 2003","Porcupine Tree"],"headings":["Numbering","Releases","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Record_label","United_Kingdom","Progressive_rock","Porcupine_Tree","Transmission_Records","Roadrunner_Records","Atlantic_Records","DVD-Audio","Software_versioning","Steven_Wilson","United_States","Europe","Burning_Shed","Porcupine_Tree_discography"]}
