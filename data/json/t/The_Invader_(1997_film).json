The larger ship is clearly chasing the smaller one, and the alien\nhas the look of a soldier about him. The smaller ship is able to cause the\nlarger one to crash, then lands itself. The pilot (Renn) sets out for town\nlooking for an Earth woman named Annie Nilssen. Annie is a local school teacher\nwho has recently broken up with her boyfriend, Sheriff Jack Logan. While she's\non a girl's night out at the tavern with a friend, she encounters Renn. Refusing\nhis offer to take her home, they nonetheless share a smoking hot kiss. Feeling\nill during school the next day she goes to her doctor only to be told she is 2\n1 /2 months pregnant - an impossibility not only because\nshe broke up with Logan four months ago, but because uterine scarring had made\nher infertile. While reading up on pregnancy and baby books at home that night\nshe is found by Renn. He explains that he is the father of her baby and insists\nshe come with him to escape the following alien killer. Renn ends up having to\nkidnap Annie. When she wakes the next day he gives her an egg-shaped supplement\nand tries to explain to her about how his world had died and why his people\nneeded Earth women - to repopulate themselves. The baby's pregnancy is meant to\nbe done in three days and he has to take her back to his ship. Annie doesn't\nbelieve him and tries to escape until she meets Willard, the second alien. He\nhad accompanied Jack Logan and his deputies on a rescue expedition and tries to\nkill Annie on the trail. His attempt is foiled by one of the deputies and Renn\nis able to reclaim Annie and keep moving her to his ship. When his ship is found\nto be destroyed by a lightning storm they must continue on to the nearest\nmountaintop to try and connect with his mother-ship.\n","linknr":102,"url":"The_Invader_(1997_film)","recorded":1363496496,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Mark_Rosman","/wiki/Sean_Young","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Mark_Rosman","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119380/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Template:Mark_Rosman","/wiki/Template_talk:Mark_Rosman","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mark_Rosman&action=edit","/wiki/Mark_Rosman","/wiki/The_House_on_Sorority_Row","/wiki/The_Blue_Yonder","/wiki/Spot_Marks_the_X","/wiki/The_Force_(film)","/wiki/Evolver_(film)","/wiki/Life-Size","/wiki/Model_Behavior","/wiki/A_Cinderella_Story","/wiki/The_Perfect_Man","/wiki/Princess_(2008_film)","/wiki/Snow_2:_Brain_Freeze","/wiki/William_%26_Kate","/wiki/File:Action_film_clapperboard.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Action_film_clapperboard.svg/30px-Action_film_clapperboard.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Action-film-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Action-film-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Action-film-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&oldid=518160878","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English-language_films","/wiki/Category:1997_films","/wiki/Category:American_films","/wiki/Category:Films_directed_by_Mark_Rosman","/wiki/Category:Action_film_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Invader+%281997+film%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Invader+%281997+film%29","/wiki/The_Invader_(1997_film)","/wiki/Talk:The_Invader_(1997_film)","#","/wiki/The_Invader_(1997_film)","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Invader_(1997_film)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Invader_(1997_film)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&oldid=518160878","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Invader_%281997_film%29&id=518160878","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Invader+%281997+film%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Invader+%281997+film%29&oldid=518160878&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Invader_(1997_film)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invader_%E2%80%93_Killer_aus_einer_anderen_Welt","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/The
