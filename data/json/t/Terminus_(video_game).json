It was released in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple\nMacintosh. Terminus won awards in the 1999 Independent Games Festival for\n\"Technical Excellence\" and \"Innovation in Audio\".\n\nTerminus is notable for its implementation of Newtonian laws of motion, which\nmeans that objects are subject to inertia. Once accelerated, they float\nindefinitely in one direction unless again accelerated into a different\ndirection. This makes steering quite complicated, but mirrors actual behavior in\nfree space.\n\nIn Story mode, the player chooses one of four careers (United Earth League\nmilitary, Mars Consortium militia, Marauder Pirate Clan, mercenary) and follows\nTerminus's single-player storyline, set in the year 2197. In 2000, Terminus was\nunusual among RPGs in that the player's actions can affect the ending of the\nstoryline. Failing a mission, for example, may lead to a different ending than\nwould have occurred if the mission had succeeded. One unique feature of Terminus\nis the story would progress with or without the player. The player could begin\nthe game in story mode, then go off and do something else and the story\nmissions/battles would still take place, reaching an outcome depending on which\nside eventually wins.\n\nIn Free mode, the player chooses a career and does the same as in Story mode,\nexcept there will be no storyline missions. In Gauntlet mode, the player outfits\na ship with near-infinite money at their disposal, and faces several waves of\nattackers, with the object of staying alive for as long as possible.\n\nSupport for Terminus has long since ended. Although the game is still licensed\nby Vicarious Visions, the source code was licensed to the owner of the\nTerminusPoint website [http://www.terminuspoint.com/terminuspoint/downloads-\n/TPE/index.shtml TPE (TerminusPoint Edition) Downloads] from\nTerminusPoint.com to allow continued development of the game and thus has\nbeen improved and enhanced.\n\nIn addition to hosting the enhanced version of the game, TerminusPoint also has\nlinks to live servers and other community sites.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Terminus_(video_game)","recorded":1374961866,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:TerminusGameCoverArt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/TerminusGameCoverArt.jpg","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/Video_game_developer","/wiki/Vicarious_Visions","/wiki/Video_game_publisher","/w/index.php?title=Vatical_Entertainment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Game_designer","/wiki/Video_game_music","/wiki/Computing_platform","/wiki/Microsoft_Windows","/wiki/Macintosh","/wiki/Linux","/wiki/2000_in_video_gaming","/wiki/Video_game_genres","/wiki/Role-playing_video_game","/wiki/Space_flight_simulator_game","/wiki/Single_player","/wiki/Multi_player","/wiki/CD-ROM","/wiki/Role-playing_game","/wiki/Action_game","/wiki/Computer_game","/wiki/Vicarious_Visions","/wiki/Microsoft_Windows","/wiki/Linux","/wiki/Apple_Macintosh","/wiki/Independent_Games_Festival","/wiki/Newtonian_laws_of_motion","/wiki/Inertia","/wiki/Single-player","/wiki/Player_(game)","/wiki/Spacecraft","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.terminuspoint.com/terminuspoint/downloads/TPE/index.shtml","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.vvisions.com/games/details.cfm?ID=28","http://www.mobygames.com/game/terminus","/wiki/MobyGames","/wiki/File:Rpg_video_game.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Rpg_video_game.svg/32px-Rpg_video_game.svg.png","/wiki/Action_role-playing_game","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Action-rpg-videogame-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Action-rpg-videogame-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Action-rpg-videogame-stub&action=edit","/wiki/Flight_simulation","/wiki/Video_game","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Flightsim-videogame-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Flightsim-videogame-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Flightsim-videogame-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&oldid=548040673","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2000_video_games","/wiki/Category:Linux_games","/wiki/Category:Mac_OS_games","/wiki/Category:Space_combat_simulators","/wiki/Category:Video_games_developed_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Windows_games","/wiki/Category:Independent_Games_Festival_winners","/wiki/Category:Action_role-playing_video_game_stubs","/wiki/Category:Flight_simulation_video_game_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Terminus+%28video+game%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Terminus+%28video+game%29","/wiki/Terminus_(video_game)","/wiki/Talk:Terminus_(video_game)","#","/wiki/Terminus_(video_game)","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Terminus_(video_game)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Terminus_(video_game)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&oldid=548040673","/w/index.php?title=Terminus_(video_game)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7702860","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Terminus_%28video_game%29&id=548040673","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Terminus+%28video+game%29","/w/index.php?title=Spec
