      "text" : "\n<!-- toxic redirects here; keep its mention -->\n\n is a common symbol for toxicity.]]\n\n'Toxicity' is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism. Toxicity\ncan refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an animal, bacterium, or\nplant, as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a cell\n(cytotoxicity) or an organ such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). By extension, the\nword may be metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more\ncomplex groups, such as the family unit or society at large.\n\nA central concept of toxicology is that effects are dose-dependent; even water\ncan lead to water intoxication when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a\nvery toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no\ndetectable toxic effect. Toxicity is species-specific, lending cross-species\nanalysis problematic. Newer paradigms and metrics are evolving to bypass animal\ntesting, while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.<ref> {{Cite web\n|date = Retrieved 25 February 2012\n| title = Toxicity Endpoints & Tests publisher = AltTox.org url = http://alttox.org/ttrc/toxicity-\n| tests/\n}}</ref>\n",
