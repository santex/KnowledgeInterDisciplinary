It departed Cairo at 23:35 for Rome with 55 persons\naboard, (48 passengers and seven crew members), in good weather.\n\nAs Flight 903 was climbing at , the crew reported that its number three engine\nwas on fire and that they needed a priority return to Cairo. As the plane was\nreturning to Cairo, the engine separated from the aircraft, forcing the crew to\nattempt a forced landing in the desert about 65 miles NNW of Cairo. The\nairliner went down near the village of Ityai el Barud at the rim of the Western\nDesert, killing all 55 on board, including twenty-three Americans and an\nEgyptian film star.\n\nSearchers found the wreckage strewn over after trekking over hot sands to reach\nit, where the aircraft wreckage was found almost completely burnt out. The\nbodies of the victims were badly charred, delaying identification. A United\nPress International correspondent reported that the plane had smashed into a\nnarrow-gauge railway in hitting the ground and had plowed up a considerable\nstretch of track.\n\nA dozen nations were represented among the 48 passengers. Prominent among the\nAmericans were Aubrey William Schofield, of Houston, Tex., and New York, an oil\ncompany executive; and Dr. Everett Moore Baker, dean of students at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Schofield, a native of San Antonio,\nTexas., was manager of the Gulf Oil Company's eastern hemisphere foreign\nproduction division and had recently been filling in as manager of the Kuwait\nOil Company. Dr. Baker had been in Bombay to preside over the International\nStudent Service's annual conference there. Also killed was the architect Maciej\nNowicki, who had been working on the design of the new city of Chandigarh.\n\nAfter an intensive investigation, the probable cause of the crash was cited to\nbe failure of the rear master rod bearing on the number three engine. The\nfailure caused the rear crankpin to overheat and fail, whereupon all the rear\nconnecting rods failed, tearing through the cylinder walls and crankcase. In the\nprocess, oil lines were torn open, which caused the fire. Sludge buildup in the\ncrankpins, blocking oil flow was thought to be the root cause, which resulted in\nimproved oil screens and the implementation of a crankpin plug, as well as\nrevised oil change intervals.\n","linknr":146,"url":"TWA_Flight_903","recorded":1375076147,"links":["/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Lockheed_L749A_N6022C_TWA_Connie_final.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Lockheed_L749A_N6022C_TWA_Connie_final.jpg/350px-Lockheed_L749A_N6022C_TWA_Connie_final.jpg","/w/index.php?title=Ityai_el_Barud&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=TWA_Flight_903&params=30_03_N_31_14_E_source:kolossus-plwiki","/wiki/Lockheed_L-749A_Constellation","/wiki/TWA","/wiki/Aircraft_registration","/wiki/Bombay_International_Airoprt","/wiki/India","/w/index.php?title=Cairo-King_Farouk_Airport&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Rome%E2%80%93Ciampino_Airport","/wiki/New_York-Idlewild_Airport","/wiki/TWA","/wiki/Bombay_International_Airoprt","/wiki/India","/wiki/New_York-Idlewild_Airport","/w/index.php?title=Cairo-King_Farouk_Airport&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Rome-Ciampino_Airport","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/Lockheed_L-749A_Constellation","/wiki/Climb","/wiki/Aircraft_engine","/wiki/Desert","/w/index.php?title=Ityai_el_Barud&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_Press_International","/w/index.php?title=Aubrey_William_Schofield&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Houston,_Tex.","/wiki/New_York","/w/index.php?title=Dr._Everett_Moore_Baker&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas","/wiki/Gulf_Oil","/wiki/Kuwait_Oil_Company","/wiki/Bombay","/w/index.php?title=International_Student_Service&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Maciej_Nowicki_(architect)","/wiki/Chandigarh","/wiki/Crankpin","/wiki/Connecting_rod","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Lists_of_accidents_and_incidents_on_commercial_airliners","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-85260-526-X","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit&section=3","http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19500831-0","/wiki/Aviation_Safety_Network","/wiki/Template:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1950","/wiki/Template_talk:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1950","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1950&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1949","/wiki/Template:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1951","/wiki/1950_Sverdlovsk_air_disaster","/wiki/1950_Douglas_C-54D_disappearance","/wiki/1950_British_Columbia_B-36_crash","/wiki/Northwest_Orient_Airlines_Flight_307","/wiki/Llandow_air_disaster","/wiki/1950_Air_France_multiple_Douglas_DC-4_accidents","/wiki/1950_Air_France_multiple_Douglas_DC-4_accidents","/wiki/Northwest_Orient_Airlines_Flight_2501","/wiki/1950_Australian_National_Airways_Douglas_DC-4_crash","/wiki/1950_Heathrow_BEA_Viking_accident","/wiki/Air_India_Flight_245","/wiki/1950_T%C3%AAte_de_l%27Obiou_C-54_crash","/wiki/Maroochy_air_crash","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&oldid=565032708","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Trans_World_Airlines_accidents_and_incidents","/wiki/Category:Airliner_accidents_and_incidents_caused_by_in-flight_fires","/wiki/Category:Airliner_accidents_and_incidents_caused_by_mechanical_failure","/wiki/Category:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Aviation_accidents_and_incidents_in_1950","/wiki/Category:1950_in_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Accidents_and_incidents_involving_the_Lockheed_Constellation","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=TWA+Flight+903&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=TWA+Flight+903","/wiki/TWA_Flight_903","/wiki/Talk:TWA_Flight_903","#","/wiki/TWA_Flight_903","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=TWA_Flight_903&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Fe
