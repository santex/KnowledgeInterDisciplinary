{"cursor":"62668","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Terry Southern' (1 May 1924 â 29 October 1995) was an American author,\nessayist, screenwriter, and university lecturer, noted for his distinctive\nsatirical style. Part of the Paris postwar literary movement in the 1950s and a\ncompanion to Beat writers in Greenwich Village, Southern was also at the center\nof Swinging London in the 1960s and helped to change the style and substance of\nAmerican films in the 1970s. In the 1980s he wrote for [[Saturday Night Live]]\nand lectured on screenwriting at several universities in New York.\n\nSouthern's dark and often absurdist style of satire helped to define the\nsensibilities of several generations of writers, readers, directors and film\ngoers. He is credited by journalist Tom Wolfe as having invented New Journalism\nwith the publication of \"Twirling at Ole Miss\" in [[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]\nin 1962, and his gift for writing memorable film dialogue was evident in [[Dr.\nStrangelove]], [[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]], [[The Cincinnati Kid]],\n[[Easy Rider]], and [[The Magic Christian (film)|The Magic Christian]]. His work\non Easy Rider helped create the independent film movement of the 1970s.\n","linknr":687,"url":"Terry_Southern","recorded":1362582742,"links":30,"instances":["new_york_city","film_director","photographer","literary_agents","actor","band","actor","art_dealer","film_industry_term","photographer","author","editor","writer","author"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1924
