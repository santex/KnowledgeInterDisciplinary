{"cursor":"15802","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Transcendentalism' was a philosophical movement that was developed in the 1830s\nand 1840s in the Eastern region of the United States as a protest to the general\nstate of culture and society, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at\nHarvard University and the doctrine of the Unitarian church taught at Harvard\nDivinity School. Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent\ngoodness of both people and nature. Transcendentalists believed that society and\nits institutions—particularly organized religion and political\nparties—ultimately corrupted the purity of the individual. They had faith\nthat people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent. It is\nonly from such real individuals that true community could be formed.\n\nThe major figures in the movement were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau,\nJohn Muir, Margaret Fuller and Amos Bronson Alcott. Other prominent\ntranscendentalists included Louisa May Alcott, Charles Timothy Brooks, Orestes\nBrownson, William Ellery Channing, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke,\nChristopher Pearse Cranch, Walt Whitman, John Sullivan Dwight, Convers Francis,\nWilliam Henry Furness, Frederic Henry Hedge, Sylvester Judd, Theodore Parker,\nElizabeth Palmer Peabody, George Ripley, Thomas Treadwell Stone, Emily Dickinson\nand Jones Very.
