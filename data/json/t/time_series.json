      "text" : "\n\nA 'time series' is a sequence of data points, measured typically at successive\npoints in time spaced at uniform time intervals. Examples of time series are the\ndaily closing value of the Dow Jones index and the annual flow volume of the\nNile River at Aswan. Time series are very frequently plotted via line charts.\nTime series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition,\neconometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction,\nelectroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy and communications\nengineering.\n\n'Time seriesanalysis' comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order\nto extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. 'Time\nseriesforecasting' is the use of a model to predict future values based on\npreviously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such\na way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent\ntime series affect the current value of another time series, this type of\nanalysis of time series is not called \"time series analysis\".\n\nTime series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series\nanalysis distinct from other common data analysis problems, in which there is no\nnatural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by\nreference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data\ncould be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from\nspatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical\nlocations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the\nintrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series\nwill generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be\nmore closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series\nmodels will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that\nvalues for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past\nvalues, rather than from future values (see time reversibility.)\n\nMethods for time series analyses may be divided into two classes: frequency-\ndomain methods and time-domain methods. The former include spectral analysis and\nrecently wavelet analysis; the latter include auto-correlation and cross-\ncorrelation analysis. In time domain correlation analyses can be made in a filter-\nlike manner using scaled correlation, thereby mitigating the need to operate in\nfrequency domain.\n\nAdditionally time series analysis techniques may be divided into parametric and\nnon-parametric methods. The parametric approaches assume that the underlying\nstationary stochastic process has a certain structure which can be described\nusing a small number of parameters (for example, using an autoregressive or\nmoving average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the\nparameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, non-\nparametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the\nprocess without assuming that the process has any particular structure.\n\nAdditionally methods of time series analysis may be divided into linear and non-\nlinear, univariate and multivariate.\n\nTime series analysis can be applied to:\n* real-valued, continuous data\n*  numeric data\n*  symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in\n   English language<ref>Lin, Jessica and Keogh, Eamonn and Lonardi, Stefano and\n   Chiu, Bill. A symbolic representation of time series, with implications for\n   streaming algorithms.
