Each year, the program accepts only\n20 new students between the ages 13 to 15, half of which are from outside\nthe Vancouver School District, out of about 200 applicants, so rigorous\ntesting must be performed to select and accept candidates. Vancouver\nSchool Board|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/programs/university-transition-\nprogram|work=Mini Schools|publisher=Vancouver School Board|accessdate=12\nJanuary 2012}} Over the course of two years, students aim to\ncomplete the required high school curriculum, along with some university\nlevel coursework. When they graduate from the program, the students\nusually are accepted into UBC earlier than they would if they graduated\nfrom a regular high school (aged 15â17 instead of 17â18). The program was\nfirst established in 1993 by the Vancouver School Board, British Columbia\nMinistry of Education and the University of British Columbia.\nUniversity Transition Program|url=http://universitytransition.ubc.ca|pub-\nlisher=UBC|accessdate=12 January 2012}} Students of the program\nhave access to most UBC facilities and possess UBC undergraduate student\ncards.[http://universitytransition.ubc.ca/content/welcome-0]\n","linknr":135,"url":"The_University_Transition_Program","recorded":1362581876,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Education in British Columbia"],"headings":["Location","Work load","Achievements","Staff","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Vancouver","British_Columbia","School_District_39_Vancouver","Early_college_entrance_program","Canadian_English","Vancouver,_British_Columbia","Early_college_entrance_program","Vancouver_School_Board","University_of_British_Columbia","MathChallengers"]}
