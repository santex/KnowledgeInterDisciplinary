Programs are\nrun by the young Reach \"Crew\" in over 500 metropolitan and regional\nschools and communities across Australia. The main focus is on prevention and\nearly intervention. Programs aim to identify the underlying reasons for\nnegative behaviour and enable young people to redirect their energy towards\nmore positive outcomes.\n\nIndependent research shows that Reach helps teenagers to improve overall levels\nof self-esteem, optimism, and feelings of control over themselves and their\nlives.
