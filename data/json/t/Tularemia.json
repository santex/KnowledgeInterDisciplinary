A Gram-negative,\nnonmotile coccobacillus, the bacterium has several subspecies with varying\ndegrees of virulence. The most important of those is F. tularensis tularensis\n(Type A), which is found in lagomorphs (rabbits and similar animals) in North\nAmerica, and it is highly virulent in humans and domestic rabbits. F. tularensis\npalaearctica (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in\nNorth America and in hares and small rodents in northern Eurasia. It is less\nvirulent for humans and rabbits. The primary vectors are ticks and\ndeer flies, but the disease can also be spread through other arthropods. The disease is named after Tulare County, California.\n","linknr":733,"url":"Tularemia","recorded":1362501505,"links":47,"instances":["country","epidemiology","epidemiology","epidemiology"],"pdf":["http://fhp.osd.mil/CBexposures/pdfs/red_cloud.pdf"],"categories":["Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions","Zoonotic bacterial diseases","Biological weapons","Central Valley (California)","Zoonoses","Tick-borne diseases","Insect-borne diseases","Rabbit diseases"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Treatment and prevention","Epidemiology","History","Tularemia as a biological weapon","Documented outbreaks","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Tularemia_lesion.jpg/230px-Tularemia_lesion.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Francisella_tularensis_01.jpg/220px-Francisella_tularensis_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","epidemiology"],["endemic","epidemiology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["incidence","epidemiology"],["endemic","epidemiology"],["georgia","country"],["georgia","country"]],"members":["georgia","incidence","endemic","vector"],"related":["Infectious_disease","Bacterium","Gram-negative","Motility","Coccobacillus","Virulence","Lagomorphs","Beaver","Muskrat","Vector_(epidemiology)","Tick","Deer_Fly","Arthropod","Tulare_County,_California","Subclinical","Buffered_charcoal_yeast_extract_agar","Macrophage","Streptomycin","Gentamicin","Tetracycline","Doxycycline","Chloramphenicol","Fluoroquinolone","Vaccine","Endemic_(epidemiology)","Arthropod","Vector_(epidemiology)","Rodent","Natural_reservoir","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Canaan","Cyprus","Iraq","Palestine","Syria","Egypt","Anatolia","Biological_warfare","U.S._Public_Health_Service","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Biological_warfare","Kenneth_Alibek","Pine_Bluff_Arsenal","Arkansas","Camp_Detrick","Anthrax","M143_bomblet","Tanana_Valley","Vaccine","Insect_repellent","Martha's_Vineyard","Kosovo","BioWatch","Endemic_(epidemiology)","Gori,_Georgia","Eurasia","Georgia_(country)","Georgia_(country)","Gori,_Georgia","Castile_and_Le√≥n","Vole","Feral_hog","Tasmania","Northern_Territory","List_of_mites_associated_with_cutaneous_reactions"]}
