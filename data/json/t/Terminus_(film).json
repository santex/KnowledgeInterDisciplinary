{"cursor":"1310","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Terminus' is a 1961 British Transport Film documentary directed by John\nSchlesinger which presents a \"fly-on-the-wall\" look at an ordinary day at\nWaterloo Station in London. Along with most British Transport Films, it was\nproduced by Edgar Anstey. It was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best\nDocumentary. Original music was by Ron Grainer.\n\nMany of the \"reportage\" shots were actually staged. Schlesinger makes a cameo\nappearance as a passing, umbrella-carrying business man and one of the main\ncharacters in the film, a tearful and apparently lost five-year old, Matthew\nPerry, was abandoned deliberately by his mother Margaret, an actress relative of\nSchlesinger. Other characters, including handcuffed convicts and a confused\nelderly woman, were actors.
