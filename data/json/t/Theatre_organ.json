{"cursor":"35140","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" Michigan Theatre]] A 'theatre organ' (also known as a 'cinema organ') is a pipe\n organ originally designed specifically for imitation of an orchestra. New\n designs have tended to be around some of the sounds and blends unique to the\n instrument itself.\n\nTheatre organs took the place of the orchestra when installed in a cinema (movie\ntheatre) during the heyday of silent films. Most theatre organs were modelled\nafter the style originally devised by Robert Hope-Jones, which he called a \"unit\norchestra\".\n\nSuch instruments were typically built to provide the greatest possible\nvariety of timbres with the fewest possible pipes, and often had pianos and\nother percussion instruments built in, as well as a variety of sound effects\nsuch as a siren.\n\nTheatre organs are usually identified by their distinctive horseshoe-shaped\nconsoles, which are frequently painted white with gold trim. An original example\nis the 3/13 Barton from Ann Arbor's historic Michigan Theatre. The organ was\ninstalled in 1927 and is currently played daily before most film\nscreenings. Steven Ball. The Barton Organ of the Michigan\nTheatre.[http://www.stevenball.com/MITheaterBartonAldridgeArticle.htm] Journal\nof the American Theatre Organ Society (September/October 1998). There were\nover 7,000 such organs installed in American theatres from 1915 to 1933, but\nfewer than 40 original instruments remain in their original theatres. Steven\nBall. The Story of The Hollywood\nBarton.[http://www.stevenball.com/HollywoodTheater.htm] Journal of the American\nTheatre Organ Society (November/December), citing The Hollywood Theatre,\nDetroit, MI Detroit News March 17, 1963. Though there are few original\ninstruments in their original theatres, hundreds of theatre pipe organs are\ninstalled in public venues throughout the world, American Theatre Organ\nSociety.
