Then an incident tidal wave can be reinforced by reflections\nbetween the coast and the shelf edge, the result producing a much higher tidal\nrange at the coast.\n\nFamous examples of this effect are found in the Bay of Fundy, where the\nworld's highest tides are reportedly found, and in the Bristol Channel. Large\ntides due to resonances are also found on the Patagonian Shelf  {{Cite journal\n  | last = Webb first = D.J. title = A Model of Continental-shelf Resonances\n  | journal = Deep-Sea Research volume = 25 pages = 1â15 year = 1976\n}} and on the N.W. Australian continental shelf.\n\nThe speed of long waves in the ocean is given, to a good approximation, by\n\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{gh} , where g is the acceleration of gravity and h\nis the depth of the ocean  {{Cite book\n  | last = Segar first = D.A. title = Introduction to Ocean Science publisher =\n  | W.W.

So if the tidal period is 12 hours, a quarter\nwavelength shelf will have a width of about 300 km.\n\nWith a narrower shelf, there is still a resonance but it has less effect at\ntidal frequencies. However the effect is still enough to partly explain why\ntides along a coast lying behind a continental shelf are often higher than at\noffshore islands in the deep ocean. The strong tidal currents associated with\nresonances also mean that the resonant regions are the areas where most tidal\nenergy is dissipated.\n\nIn the deep ocean, where the depth is typically 4000 m, the speed of long waves\nincreases to approximately 200 m/s. The difference in speed, when compared\nto the shelf, is responsible for the reflections at the continental shelf edge.\nAway from resonance this can stop tidal energy moving onto the shelf. However\nnear a resonant frequency the phase relationships between the wave on the shelf\nand in the deep ocean can have the effect of drawing energy onto the shelf.\n\nThe increased speed of long waves in the deep ocean means that the tidal\nwavelength there is of order 10,000 km. As the ocean basins have a similar\nsize, they also have the potential of being resonant \n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Platzman first = G.W. coauthors = Curtis, G.A., Hansen, K.S., Slater,\n  | R.D. title = Normal Modes of the World ocean.
