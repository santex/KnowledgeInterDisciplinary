More specifically, the term\nmay be used in either of two overlapping senses:\n# One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a\n# relatively short time interval. A competition involving multiple matches, each\n# involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner\n# determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. These\n# are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small\n# number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most team sports, racket\n# sports and combat sports, many card games and board games, and many forms of\n# competitive debating. Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against\n# each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match.\n\nThese two senses are distinct. All golf tournaments meet the first definition,\nbut while match play tournaments meet the second, stroke play tournaments do\nnot, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast,\nfootball (soccer) leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second\nsense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period\nof up to a year. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the\nWimbledon tennis championship.\n\nA tournament-match (or tie or fixture or heat) may involve multiple game-matches\n(or rubbers or legs) between the competitors. For example, in the Davis Cup\ntennis tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the\nnations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later\nrounds of UEFA Champions League of football (soccer), each fixture is played\nover two legs. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher\naggregate score wins the fixture, with away goals used as a tiebreaker and a\npenalty shootout if away goals cannot determine a winner.\n","title":"tournament","headings":["Knock-out tournaments","Group tournaments","Multi-stage tournaments","Promotion and relegation","Bridge tournaments","Poker tournaments","Alternatives to tournament systems","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Competition","1: Sport","1: Game","1: Team_sport","1: Racket_sport","1: Combat_sport","1: Card_game","1: Board_game","1: Debate","1: Golf_tournament","1: Match_play","1: Stroke_play","1: Premier_League","1: The_Championships,_Wimbledon","1: Davis_Cup","1: Tennis","1: UEFA_Champions_League","1: Two-legged_tie","1: Away_goals_rule","1: Intransitivity","1: Single-elimination_tournament","1: NBA","1: Double-elimination_tournament","1: Sport_rowing","1: Regatta","1: Repechage","1: McIntyre_System","1: Australian_Football_League","1: National_Rugby_League","1: A-League","1: Super_League","1: Indian_Premier_League","1: Curling","1: PBA_Tour","1: Ten-pin_bowling","1: West_Coast_Conference","1: Ohio_Valley_Conference","1: 2010â€“12_NCAA_conference_realignment#Second_wave_2","1: Brigham_Young_University","1: Women's_Professional_Soccer","1: 2009_Women's_Professional_Soccer_Playoffs","1: League_system","1: County_Championship","1: Cricinfo","1: Round-robin_tournament","1: Swiss_system_tournament","1: Professional_sport","1: Handicapping","1: Local_derby","1: Sports_rivalry","1: 2006_Women's_Rugby_World_Cup","1: Playoff","1: FIFA_World_Cup","1: Cricket_World_Cup","1: 2007_Cricket_World_Cup","1: Swiss_Football_League","1: Scottish_Premier_League","1: Premier_A_Slovenian_Basketball_League","1: Euroleague","1: Chess","1: Scrabble","1: English_football_league_system#Structure","1: Contract_bridge","1: Duplicate_bridge#Pairs_game","1: Duplicate_bridge_movements","1: Poker_tournament","1: Boxing#Professional_boxing","1: Lineal_championship","1: World_Chess_Championship","1: FA_Cup","1: America's_Cup","1: Ranfurly_Shield","1: Ladder_tournament","1: Billiards","1: Voting","1: Science_fair","1: Film","1: Academy_Awards","1: Associated_Press","1: College_football","1: 1998_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","1: Bowl_Championship_Series","1: National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","1: College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","1: 2005_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season","1: AP_Poll","1: Playoff_format","1: Apertura_and_Clausura","1: Tennis_tour"]}
