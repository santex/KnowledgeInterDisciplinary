{"cursor":"36247","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn molecular biology, 'trimeric autotransporter adhesins' shortened to TAAs, are\nproteins found on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria use\nTAAs in order to infect their host cells via a process called cell adhesion. TAAs also go by another name, oligomeric coiled-coil\nadhesins, which is shortened to OCAs. They are, essentially, virulence factors,\nfactors that make the bacteria harmful and infective to the host organism.\n\nTAAs are just one of many methods bacteria use to infect their hosts, infection\nresulting in diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Most bacteria\ninfect their host through a method named the secretion pathway. TAAs are part of\nthe secretion pathway, more specifically the type Vc secretion system.\n\nTrimeric autotransporter adhesins have a unique structure. The structure they\nhold is crucial to their function. They all appear to have a head-stalk-anchor\nstructure. Each TAA is made up of three identical proteins, hence the name\ntrimeric. Once the membrane anchor has been inserted into the outer membrane,\nthe passenger domain passes through it into the host extracellular environment\nautonomously, hence the description of autotransporter. The head domain, once\nassembled, then adheres to an element of the host extracellular matrix, for\nexample, collagen, fibronectin etc.\n","linknr":690,"url":"Trimeric_Autotransporter_Adhesins_(TAA)","recorded":1362486639,"links":27,"instances":["blood","t5ss","biochemistry","protein","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein families","Protein domains","Virulence factors","Gram-negative bacteria","Secretion","Membrane proteins"],"headings":["Molecular structure","Extended Signal Peptide Region domain","N-terminal head domain","Neck domain","Stalk domain","C-terminal membrane anchor domain","Model proteins","Clinical effects","Infection Process","Type V secretion system (T5SS)","Evading the host's immune system","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Taabasic1.jpg/220px-Taabasic1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/PDB_3emo_EBI.png/220px-PDB_3emo_EBI.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Lupasfig2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Edwardsfig5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/PDB_2gr8_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_2gr8_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Yadahead.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/T5SS.svg/220px-T5SS.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["cell","biology"],["secretion#type_v_secretion_system","t5ss"],["secretion#type_v_secretion_system","t5ss"],["antiparallel","biochemistry"],["host","biology"],["porin","protein"],["chimera","genetics"],["secretion#type_v_secretion_system","t5ss"],["serum","blood"],["secretion#type_v_secretion_system","t5ss"]],"members":["serum","antiparallel","porin","cell","chimera","host"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Gram-negative","Bacteria","Host_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Cell_adhesion","Oligomeric_protein","Coiled_coil","Adhesins","Virulence_factors","Organism","Pneumonia","Sepsis","Meningitis","Secretion","Secretion","Protein_trimer","Extracellular_matrix","Collagen","Fibronectin","Electron_microscopy","N-terminal","C-terminal","Coiled-coil","Beta-roll","Hydrophobic","Bond_cleavage","Sequence_conservation","Arginine","Periplasm","Extracellular_matrix","Fibronectin","Collagen","Laminin","Autoagglutination","Amino_acid","Amino_acid","Tryptophan","Tryptophan","Glycine","Isoleucine","Aspargine","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","Beta_sheet","Beta_helix","Supercoiling","Alpha_helix","Coiled-coil","Hydrophobic","Amino_acid","Extracellular_matrix","Host_(biology)","Complement_system","Beta_strand","Beta-barrel","Polypeptide","Cell_membrane","Beta-barrel","Porin_(protein)","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Bacterial_outer_membrane","YadA_bacterial_adhesin_protein_domain","Beta_helix","Beta_propeller","Beta_helix","Alpha_helix","YadA_bacterial_adhesin_protein_domain","Collagen","Sepsis","Meningitis","Middle_ear","Respiratory_epithelium","Pneumonia","Meningitis","Sepsis","Cyrus_Chothia","Beta_sheets","Cat_scratch_disease","Immune_system","Chemotherapy","AIDS","Bacillary_angiomatosis","Benign","Tumours","Blood_vessels","Cell_proliferation","Capillaries","Angiogenesis","NF-ÎºB","Hypoxia-inducible_factor","Chimera_(genetics)","Evolution","Immune_system","Intestine","Mucosa","Epithelial_cells","Extracellular_matrix","Collagen","Laminin","Fibronectin","Lipopolysaccharide","Glycan","Secretion","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Inner_membrane","Periplasmic_space","Peptidoglycan","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Lipopolysaccharides","Eukaryotes","Gram-positive","Adhesins","Enzyme","Inner_membrane","Adenosine_triphosphate","Proton","Gradient","Periplasm","Pilus","Autoagglutination","Serum_(blood)","Complement_system","Phagocytosis","YadA_bacterial_adhesin_protein_domain","Virulence_factor","Cell_adhesion","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Gram_negative_bacteria"]}
