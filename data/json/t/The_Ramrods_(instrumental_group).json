Claire played drums and arranged the songs; Rich\nplayed saxophone. They added Vinny Lee on lead guitar, and Gene Moore on second\nguitar. At the end of 1960 they recorded their instrumental arrangement of\n\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\", a song written by Stan Jones which had been a big\nhit in 1949 for Vaughn Monroe. The Ramrods' version contained eerie and\nevocative overdubbed shouts, whistles and cattle calls, and was placed with Amy\nRecords, a subsidiary of Bell Records in New York. [http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/ramrods.htm The\nRamrods at Black Cat Rockabilly] The record was made a \"Pick of the Week\"\nby [[Cash Box]] magazine, and rose to # 30 on the [[Billboard\n(magazine)|Billboard]] pop chart in early 1961. Released on the\nLondon label, it also reached # 8 on the UK pop chart.\n\nThe follow-up, \"Loch Lomond Rock\", a rocked-up version of a traditional Scottish\ntune, with bagpipes solo, was not successful, and nor were two later singles on\nthe Amy label. Later records by the Ramrods (or The Rockin' Ramrods) on the\nPlymouth, R&H and Queen labels are thought to be by different bands.\n\nGene Moore left the group in the early 1960s and was replaced by Russ Cook (born\nRuss Mumma) on bass. Vinny Lee later died and was replaced by Bernie Moore (no\nrelation to Gene Moore), who was in turn later replaced by George Sheck, with\nCook taking over on lead guitar. Claire Lane left the group in the late 1960s to\npursue a solo career, and the remaining Ramrods became the Russ Cook Combo\nbefore disbanding in the early 1970s.\n","linknr":108,"url":"The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","recorded":1375054399,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Connecticut","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Instrumental_rock","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Amy_Records","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/(Ghost)_Riders_in_the_Sky","/wiki/Connecticut","/wiki/Stan_Jones_(songwriter)","/wiki/Vaughn_Monroe","/wiki/Overdub","/wiki/Amy_Records","/wiki/Bell_Records","/wiki/New_York","#cite_note-blackcat-1","/wiki/Cash_Box","/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)","/wiki/Hot_100","#cite_note-2","/wiki/London_Records","/wiki/UK_pop_chart","#cite_note-betts-3","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Bagpipes","#cite_note-blackcat-1","#cite_note-blackcat-1","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-blackcat_1-0","#cite_ref-blackcat_1-1","#cite_ref-blackcat_1-2","http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/ramrods.htm","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-89820-155-1","#cite_ref-betts_3-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-00-717931-6","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&oldid=554430297","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_instrumental_musical_groups","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_from_Connecticut","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1956","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Ramrods+%28instrumental+group%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Ramrods+%28instrumental+group%29","/wiki/The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&oldid=554430297","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7759383","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Ramrods_%28instrumental_group%29&id=554430297","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Ramrods+%28instrumental+group%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Ramrods+%28instrumental+group%29&oldid=554430297&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7759383#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramrods_(instrumental_group)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lan
