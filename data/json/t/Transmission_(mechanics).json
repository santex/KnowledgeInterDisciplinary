Merriam-Webster defines\ntransmission as an assembly of parts including the speed-changing gears and the\npropeller shaft by which the power is transmitted from an engine to a live axle. http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/transmission Merriam-Webster definition of\n'transmission' Often 'transmission' refers simply to the 'gearbox' that\nuses gears and gear trains to provide speed and torque conversions from a\nrotating power source to another device. J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J.\nE. Shigley, 2003, 'Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,' Oxford University Press,\nNew York. B. Paul, 1979, 'Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar\nMachinery', Prentice Hall.\n\nIn British English, the term transmission refers to the whole drive train,\nincluding clutch, gearbox, prop shaft (for rear-wheel drive), differential, and\nfinal drive shafts. In American English, however, a gearbox is any device that\nconverts speed and torque, whereas a transmission is a type of gearbox that can\nbe âshiftedâ to dynamically change the speed-torque ratio such as in a vehicle.\n\nThe most common use is in motor vehicles, where the transmission adapts the\noutput of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. Such engines need\nto operate at a relatively high rotational speed, which is inappropriate for\nstarting, stopping, and slower travel. The transmission reduces the higher\nengine speed to the slower wheel speed, increasing torque in the process.\nTransmissions are also used on pedal bicycles, fixed machines, and anywhere\nrotational speed and torque must be adapted.\n\nOften, a transmission has multiple gear ratios (or simply âgearsâ), with the\nability to switch between them as speed varies. This switching may be done\nmanually (by the operator), or automatically. Directional (forward and reverse)\ncontrol may also be provided. Single-ratio transmissions also exist, which\nsimply change the speed and torque (and sometimes direction) of motor output.\n\nIn motor vehicles, the transmission generally is connected to the engine\ncrankshaft. The output of the transmission is transmitted via driveshaft to one\nor more differentials, which in turn, drive the wheels. While a differential may\nalso provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at\neither end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel\nslippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.\n\nConventional gear/belt transmissions are not the only mechanism for speed/torque\nadaptation. Alternative mechanisms include torque converters and power\ntransformation (for example, diesel-electric transmission and hydraulic drive\nsystem). Hybrid configurations also exist.\n","linknr":591,"url":"Transmission_(mechanics)","recorded":1362673107,"links":64,"instances":["mechanics","grinding","mechanical","device","mechanical_device","mechanical"],"pdf":["http://www.windmission.dk/workshop/BonusTurbine.pdf","http://www.windmission.dk/workshop/BonusTurbine.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/wind/pdfs/41548.pdf"],"categories":["Mechanical
