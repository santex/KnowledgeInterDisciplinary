Flush toilets, which are common in many parts of the\nworld, may be connected to a nearby septic tank or more commonly in urban areas\nvia \"large\" () sewer pipe connected to a sewerage pipe system. The water and\nwaste from many different sources is piped in large pipes to a more distant\nsewage treatment plant. Chemical toilets are used in mobile and many temporary\nsituations where there is no access to sewerage, dry toilets, including pit\ntoilets and composting toilet require no or little water with excreta being\nremoved manually or composted in situ.\n\nThe word toilet may also be used, especially in British English to describe the\nroom containing the fixture, for which euphemisms such as restroom or bathroom\nare used in American English. Prior to the introduction of modern flush\ntoilets, most human waste disposal was done through the use of household\nchamber pots, or took place outdoors in outhouses or latrines. Pail closets\nwere introduced in England and France in an attempt to reduce sewage problems\nin rapidly expanding cities.\n\nAncient civilizations used toilets attached to simple flowing water sewage\nsystems included those of the Indus Valley Civilization, e.g.,\nHarappa and Mohenjo-daro which are located in present day\nIndia and Pakistan [http://tampub.uta.fi/tup/951-44-6251-3.pdf Kaivot Ja\nKÃ¤ymÃ¤lÃ¤t: Johdatus Historiaan EsimerkkinÃ¤ Suomi (A Brief History of Wells and\nToilets - The Case of Finland)], Petri S. Juuti and Katri J. Wallenius, Tampere\nUniversity Press, ePublications, Tampere, 2005. and also the Romans and\nEgyptians. [http://www.infoweb.co.nz/toilet Who invented a version of the\nflowing water toilet ] Although a precursor to\nthe modern flush toilet system was designed in 1596 by John\nHarington, [http://www.victoriancrapper.com/Toilethistory.HTML A History of\nthe flush toilet ] such systems did not come\ninto widespread use until the late nineteenth\ncentury. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/193259521X Poop Culture: How America is\nShaped by its Grossest National Product], Dave Praeger, ISBN 1-932595-21-X\nThomas Crapper was one of the early maker of toilets in England.\n\nDiseases, including cholera which still affects some 3 million people each year,\ncan be largely prevented when effective sanitation and water treatment prevents\nfecal matter from contaminating waterways, groundwater and drinking water\nsupplies. Infected water supplies can be treated to make the water safe for\nconsumption and use. There have been five main cholera\noutbreaks and pandemics since 1825, during one of which 10,000 people died in\n1849 in London alone. The physician John Snow proved that deaths were being\ncaused by people drinking water from a source that had been contaminated by a\nnearby cesspit which was used by people who were infected with cholera. The\nLondon sewer system of the time had not reached crowded Soho and many houses had\ncellars (basements) with overflowing cesspools underneath their floorboards.\n\nAccording to The Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 by the World\nHealth Organization, 40% of the global population does not have access to \"good\"\n'excreta disposal facilities'--they live mostly in Asia and Africa. There are\nefforts being made to design simple effective squat toilets for these\npeople. Usually, they are made by digging a hole, then installing a\npremade plastic squat toilet seat atop this hole, covering the walls with\ncanvas.\n","linknr":755,"url":"Toilet","recorded":1362476868,"links":114,"instances":["physician","watercraft","waste","ceramics","inventor","room","restroom","sociolinguistics","company"],"pdf":["http://tampub.uta.fi/tup/951-44-6251-3.pdf","http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf","http://www.who.int/immunization/Cholera_PP_Accomp_letter__Mar_10_2010.pdf","http://www.eawag.ch/organisation/abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/publications_sesp/downloads_sesp/compendium_high.pdf","http://www.redoakleaves.com/downloads/The_hidden_room.pdf"],"categories":["Toilets|","Bathrooms","Articles
