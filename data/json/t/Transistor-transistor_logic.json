{"cursor":"25497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"-based computer with various TTL chips mounted on protoboards.]]\n\n'Transistorâtransistor logic' ('TTL') is a class of digital circuits built\nfrom bipolar junction transistors (BJT) and resistors. It is called\ntransistorâtransistor logic because both the logic gating function (e.g.,\nAND) and the amplifying function are performed by transistors (contrast with\nRTL and DTL).\n\nTTL is notable for being a widespread integrated circuit (IC) family used in\nmany applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and\ninstrumentation, consumer electronics, synthesizers, etc. The designation TTL is\nsometimes used to mean TTL-compatible logic levels, even when not associated\ndirectly with TTL integrated circuits, for example as a label on the inputs and\noutputs of electronic instruments. Eren, H., 2003.\n\nAfter introduction in integrated circuit form in 1963 by Sylvania, TTL\nintegrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies, with\nthe 7400 series by Texas Instruments becoming particularly popular. TTL\nmanufacturers offered a wide range of logic gate, flip-flops, counters, and\nother circuits. Several variations from the original bipolar TTL concept were\ndeveloped, giving circuits with higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow\noptimization of a design. TTL circuits simplified design of systems compared to\nearlier logic families, offering superior speed to resistorâtransistor logic\n(RTL) and easier design layout than emitter-coupled logic (ECL). The design of\nthe input and outputs of TTL gates allowed many elements to be interconnected.\n\nTTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics. Even after\nmuch larger scale integrated circuits made multiple-circuit-board processors\nobsolete, TTL devices still found extensive use as the \"glue\" logic interfacing\nmore densely integrated components. TTL devices were originally made in ceramic\nand plastic dual-in-line (DIP) packages, and flat-pack form. TTL chips are now\nalso made in surface-mount packages. Successors to the original bipolar TTL\nlogic often are interchangeable in function with the original circuits, but with\nimproved speed or lower power dissipation.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Transistor-transistor_logic","recorded":1362668278,"links":43,"instances":["electronics","electronics"],"pdf":["http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/es154/lectures/lecture_7/pdfs/215ln04.pdf","http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-368.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/261/ibmrd2601B.pdf","http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/sdaa010/sdaa010.pdf"],"categories":["Digital electronics","Logic families"],"headings":["History","Implementation","Interfacing considerations","Packaging","Comparison with other logic families","Sub-types","Applications","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/68k_ttl.jpg/300px-68k_ttl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/50/TTL_Clock.jpg/300px-TTL_Clock.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/TTL_npn_nand.svg/220px-TTL_npn_nand.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/7400_Circuit.svg/220px-7400_Circuit.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["noise","electronics"],["flatpack","electronics"]],"members":["flatpack","noise"],"related":["Protoboard","Digital_circuit","Bipolar_junction_transistor","Resistor","Logical_conjunction","Resistor–transistor_logic","Diode–transistor_logic","Integrated_circuit","Computer","Synthesizer","7400_series","Texas_Instruments","Resistor–transistor_logic","Emitter-coupled_logic","TRW_Inc.","Sylvania_Electric_Products","Phoenix_missile","Texas_Instruments","7400_series","Motorola","AMD","Fairchild_Semiconductor","Intel","Intersil","Signetics","Mullard","Siemens","SGS-Thomson","National_Semiconductor","IBM","IBM_System/38","IBM_4300","IBM_3081","BJT","Logic_gate","Bit-slice","Kenbak-1","Personal_computer","CPU","Microprocessor","Xerox_Alto","Xerox_Star","Graphical_user_interface","Arithmetic_logic_unit","Glue_logic","Programmable_logic","Hardware_emulation","Microarchitecture","Multiple-emitter_transistor","Common_emitter","Fanout","Open_collector","Pull-up_resistor","Push–pull_output","Common_collector","Volt","Noise_(electronics)","Pull-up_resistor","Through-hole","Dual_in-line_package","Flatpack_(electronics)","CMOS","Paul_Horowitz","Emitter_coupled_logic","Electrostatic_discharge","Decoupling_capacitor","Pinouts","7400_series","CMOS","Schottky_diode","DTL","Power–delay_product","Joule","CMOS","Schottky_diode","Miller_effect","7400_series","Radiation_hardening","Very-large-scale_integration","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","VAX","Data_General","Data_General_Eclipse","Microprocessor","Negative_feedback_amplifier","Crystal_oscillator","Positive_emitter-coupled_logic","Digital_circuit","Don_Lancaster"]}
