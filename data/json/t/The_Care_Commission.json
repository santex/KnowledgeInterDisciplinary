The new organisation took\non work in these areas previously carried out by:\n\n*Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) *Social Work Inspection Agency\n(SWIA) and *The Care Commission\n\n\"The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care,\" known as \"The Care\nCommission,\" regulated care services between 2002 and 2011. It had\nresponsibility for the registration and inspection of all care services\nin Scotland.\n\nThe Care Commission began work in April 2002 as an independent regulator under\nthe Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. The key principles of the Commission\nin regulating care services were threefold; keeping people safe; promoting\ndignity and choice, and supporting independence.\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/8/part/4\n\nThe Social Work Inspection Agency (SWIA) had the remit to inspect all social\nwork services in Scotland, and to report publicly and to parliament on the\nquality of these services, locally and nationally.\n\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) in Scotland had the remit of\nscrutinising education services, and had a specific role to monitor child\nprotection services. It was the latter function which was transferred to the\nCare Inspectorate (SCSWIS) in 2011.\n\nThe Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force in April 2011. It\naimed to reduce and to streamline the number of Government agencies, including\nthe different regulators. As a result, the previous work of the Care Commission,\nof SWIA and of HMIE (children's services remit) were absorbed into the new\nSocial Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS). Care services in the\ncountry became regulated by the latter body [http://www.scswis.com/]. From 15\nSeptember 2011, SCSWIS adopted the simpler working name of the Care\nInspectorate.\n","linknr":183,"url":"The_Care_Commission","recorded":1363136074,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Care_Inspectorate","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=The_Care_Commission&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:CareCommissionLogo.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/CareCommissionLogo.gif","#cite_note-1","http://www.carecommission.com","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Social_work_and_social_care_services_of_Scotland","/wiki/Registration","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Care_Inspectorate&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Care_service","/w/index.php?title=Regulation_of_Care_(Scotland)_Act_2001&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Public_Services_Reform_(Scotland)_Act_2010&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.scswis.com/","#Services_Regulated","#Scope_and_statistics","#Methods_of_regulation","#A_changed_approach","#Transfer_of_responsibilities","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Children","/wiki/Adults","/wiki/Older_people","http://www.carecommission.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=17&Itemid=70","/wiki/Drug_addiction","/wiki/Alcoholism","/wiki/Learning_disabilities","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Sensory_impairment","/wiki/Respite_care","/wiki/Adoption_agencies","/wiki/Foster_care","/wiki/Hospice_care","/wiki/Nurse","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Employment","http://www.carecommission.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=112","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/National_Care_Standards","/wiki/Inspection","http://www.carecommission.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24&Itemid=45","/wiki/Complaint","/wiki/Enforcement","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Inspectorate_of_Education","http://henrystewart.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&eissn=1750-1687&volume=2&issue=1&spage=17;","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Crerar_Review&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Inspectorate_of_Education","/wiki/NHS_Quality_Improvement_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Social_Work_Inspection_Agency&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Care_Commission","/wiki/Healthcare_Improvement_Scotland","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/Scrutiny","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Commission_for_Social_Care_Inspection","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.carecommission.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=112","#cite_ref-2","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/8/part/4","/w/index.php?title=Care_Inspectorate&action=edit&section=8","http://www.carecommission.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=112","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/17652/National-Care-Standards-1-1","/wiki/Template:Executive_NDPBs_of_the_Scottish_Government","/wiki/Template_talk:Executive_NDPBs_of_the_Scottish_Government","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Executive_NDPBs_of_the_Scottish_Government&action=edit","/wiki/Non-departmental_public_bodies_of_the_Scottish_Government","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Accounts_Commission_for_Scotland","/wiki/Architecture_and_Design_Scotland","/wiki/B%C3%B2rd_na_G%C3%A0idhlig","/wiki/Cairngorms_National_Park","/wiki/Creative_Scotland","/wiki/Crofters_Commission","/wiki/Highlands_and_Islands_Enterprise","/wiki/Loch_Lomond_and_The_Trossachs_National_Park_Authority","/wiki/National_Galleries_of_Scotland","/wiki/National_Library_of_Scotland","/wiki/National_Museums_of_Scotland","/wiki/Police_Complaints_Commissioner_for_Scotland","/wiki/Quality_Meat_Scotland","/wiki/Risk_Management_Authority","/wiki/Royal_Botanic_Garden_Edinburgh","/wiki/Royal_Commission_on_the_Ancient_and_Historical_Monuments_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Agricultural_Wages_Board","/wiki/Scottish_Children%27s_Repor
