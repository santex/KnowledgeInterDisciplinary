It is the first period of the\nMesozoic Era, and lies between the Permian and Jurassic periods. Both the start\nand end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was\nnamed in 1834 by Friedrich Von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers\n(tri meaning \"three\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern\nEuropeâred beds, capped by chalk, followed by black shalesâcalled the\n\"Trias.\" Friedrich von Alberti, Beitrag zu einer Monographie des bunten\nSandsteins, Muschelkalks und Keupers, und die Verbindung dieser Gebilde zu einer\nFormation [Contribution to a monograph on the colored sandstone, shell limestone\nand mudstone, and the joining of these structures into one formation] (Stuttgart\nand TÃ¼bingen, (Germany): J. G. Cotta, 1834). Alberti coined the term \"Trias\" on\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=1ClSAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA324#v=onepage&q&f=false page\n324] : \"â¦ bunter Sandstein, Muschelkalk und Keuper das Resultat einer\nPeriode, ihre Versteinerungen, um mich der Worte E. de Beaumontâs zu bedeinen,\ndie Thermometer einer geologischen Epoche seyen, â¦ also die bis jezt beobachtete\nTrennung dieser Gebilde in 3 Formationen nicht angemessen, und es mehr dem\nBegriffe Formation entsprechend sey, sie zu einer Formation, welche ich\nvorlÃ¤ufig Trias nennen will, zu verbinden.\" ( â¦ colored sandstone, shell\nlimestone, and mudstone are the result of a period ; their fossils are, to avail\nmyself of the words of E. de Beaumont, the thermometer of a geologic epoch ; â¦\nthus the separation of these structures into 3 formations, which has been\nmaintained until now, isn't appropriate, and it is more consistent with the\nconcept of \"formation\" to join them into one formation, which for now I will\nname \"trias\".)\n\nThe Triassic began in the wake of the PermianâTriassic extinction event, which\nleft the Earth's biosphere impoverished; it would take well into the middle of\nthe period for life to recover its former diversity. Therapsids and archosaurs\nwere the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time. A specialized subgroup\nof archosaurs, dinosaurs, first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become\ndominant until the succeeding Jurassic. {{cite journal\n  | last = Brusatte | first = S.
