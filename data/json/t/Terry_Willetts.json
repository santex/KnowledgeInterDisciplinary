He also\nplayed Minor Counties cricket for Shropshire and Cornwall. He was a left-handed\nmiddle-order batsman. But though a prolific scorer at second eleven and Minor\nCounties level, he was not able to establish himself in first-class cricket.\n\nWilletts played for Somerset's second eleven as a batsman from 1960, and in the\n1964 season made more than 900 runs for the second team, playing in both the\nMinor Counties Championship and the Second Eleven\nChampionship. He was brought into Somerset's first team\nfor three matches in mid-season, but made little impact. The following season,\n1965, he was given six matches, but only in the game against Glamorgan at Weston-super-\nMare did he make significant runs, his first-innings 38 being the highest score\nof his career. His first List A appearance was in a losing Gillette\nCup semi-final in 1966 against Warwickshire when he failed to score.\nIn the 1967, he played a further six first-class matches and two List A games,\nwithout success, and he left the county staff at the end of the season.\n\nWilletts had a long career in second-class cricket. He joined Shropshire's Minor\nCounties team in 1968, moved back to Somerset's second eleven in the early 1970s\nand then went on from 1977 to Cornwall where, from 1988 to 1990, finishing at\nthe age of 50, he was captain of the Minor Counties side. He appeared in one\nfurther List A match for Cornwall, in the first round of the 1980 Gillette Cup,\nwhen the Cornish side lost to Devon.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Terry_Willetts","recorded":1374966646,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/List_A_cricket","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/List_A_cricket","/wiki/Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Devon_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/List_A_cricket","/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)","/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket","/wiki/Bowling_average","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3895/3895.html","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/List_A_cricket","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Minor_Counties","/wiki/Shropshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Minor_Counties_Championship","/wiki/Second_Eleven_Championship","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Clarence_Park,_Weston-super-Mare","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Gillette_Cup_(England)","/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Devon_County_Cricket_Club","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3895/3895.html","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/27/27703.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/28/28376.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/40/40340.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Birmingham","/wiki/Warwickshire","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&oldid=542520053","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1939_births","/wiki/Category:English_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Somerset_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Cornwall_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Shropshire_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Terry+Willetts&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Terry+Willetts","/wiki/Terry_Willetts","/wiki/Talk:Terry_Willetts","#","/wiki/Terry_Willetts","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Terry_Willetts","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Terry_Willetts","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&oldid=542520053","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7705147","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Terry_Willetts&id=542520053","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Terry+Willetts","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Terry+Willetts&oldid=542520053&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Terry_Willetts&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7705147#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wik
