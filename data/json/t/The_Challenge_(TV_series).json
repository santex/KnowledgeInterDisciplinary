The Challenge has developed a spin-off series in its own\nright, [[Spring Break Challenge]]. The Challenge and Spring Break Challenge have\na somewhat cast-contestant interdependent relationship in that both programs\nhave used at least one or more contestants from the other. The Challenge is\ncurrently hosted by T. J. Lavin.\n\nThe series premiered on June 1, 1998. The title of the show was originally\n[[Road Rules: All Stars]] before it was renamed Real World/Road Rules Challenge\nby the show's 2nd season, then later abridged to simply The Challenge by the\nshow's . The series initially used no hosts but instead a former cast member who\nhad been kicked off his or her season, providing assignments as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\nBig\" (David \"Puck\" Rainey, , and Gladys Sanabria served this role). Later on,\nhowever, the series began using hosts: Eric Nies and co-hosted a season, and\nJonny Moseley and Dave Mirra hosted various seasons before T. J. Lavin became\nthe show's regular host by the .\n\nSince the 4th season, each season has supplied the show with a unique subtitle,\nsuch as \"[[The Challenge: Rivals|Rivals]].\" Each season consists of a format and\ntheme whereby the subtitle is derived. Of each season's format and theme, 6 have\nbeen repeated or revamped through sequel seasons with shared subtitles. In\nchronological order, these include: [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of\nthe Sexes|Battle of the Sexes]] (tied to [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge:\nBattle of the Sexes II|Battle of the Sexes II]], the show's first sequel\nseason); [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno|The Inferno]] (tied to\n[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno II|The Inferno II]] and [[Real\nWorld/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno III|The Inferno III]], the show's first\ntrilogy); [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet|The Gauntlet]] (tied\nto [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet II|The Gauntlet II]] and\n[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet III|The Gauntlet III]]); [[Real\nWorld/Road Rules Challenge: The Duel|The Duel]] (tied to [[Real World/Road Rules\nChallenge: The Duel II|The Duel II]]); [[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Fresh\nMeat|Fresh Meat]] (tied to [[The Challenge: Fresh Meat II|Fresh Meat II]]); and\n[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons|Battle of the Seasons]]\n(tied to the second ).\n\nThe 23rd and most recent season, [[The Challenge: Battle of the Seasons|Battle\nof the Seasons]], premiered on September 19, 2012, and completed its run on\nDecember 19, 2012. http://vevmo.com/f266/the-challenge-summer-2012-trailer-\n7072/ The Challenge: Summer 2012 Trailer\n","linknr":649,"url":"The_Challenge_(TV_series)","recorded":1362569606,"links":22,"instances":["titling","season","vehicle","television","mtv_tr3́s","media"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Challenge (TV series)","Television series by Bunim/Murray Productions","American reality television series","American game shows","1990s American television series","1998 American television series debuts","2000s American television series","2010s American television series","MTV television series","English-language television series"],"headings":["Structure","TV show's conception","External episodes","'' The Challenge'' lingo","Original contestants","''Spring Break Challenge''","Seasons","Players with the most ''Challenge'' appearances","Locations","Notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin-off","media"],["cancellation","television"],["real_world/road_rules_challenge","season"],["subtitle","titling"],["the_challenge","tv_series#theme_and_format_by_season_title"],["coach","vehicle"],["carlos_santos","mtv_tr3́s"],["real_world/road_rules_challenge","season"]],"members":["subtitle","the_challenge","coach","cancellation","carlos_santos"],"related":["Mary-Ellis_Bunim","Jonathan_Murray","T._J._Lavin","United_States","English_language","MTV","Bunim/Murray_Productions","MTV","Spin-off_(media)","Cast_member","Reality_show","Cancellation_(television)","T._J._Lavin","Premiere","Real_World/Road_Rules_Challenge_(season)","David_Rainey","Eric_Nies","Jonny_Moseley","Dave_Mirra","Real_World/Road_Rules_Extreme_Challenge","Subtitle_(titling)","Trilogy","Team","Gender","Drama","Monologue","Confessional","TV_season","Money","Coach_(vehicle)","San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico","Kit_Hoover","Millennium","Hotel_rating","Fantasy_baseball","Austin,_Texas","Season_finale","Vanessa_Minnillo","Susie_Castillo","Carlos_Santos_(MTV_Tr3́s)","Lyndsey_Rodrigues","Maria_Menounos","Betrayal","Gossip","Conspiracy_theory","The_Miz","Jonny_Moseley","Editing","Veronica_Portillo","Evan_Starkman","MTV","Spring_break","Acapulco,_Mexico","Evan_Starkman","T._J._Lavin","Montreal","Lake_Placid,_New_York","Wellington","Auckland","Los_Angeles","San_Francisco","Las_Vegas,_Nevada","Nashville,_Tennessee","Miami","Real_World/Road_Rules_Extreme_Challenge","Portland,_Maine","Boston","London","Hamburg","Prague","New_York_City","Cabo_San_Lucas","Mexico","Montego_Bay","Jamaica","Telluride,_Colorado","Acapulco","Mexico","Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico","Manzanillo,_Colima","Mexico","Tobago","Trinidad_and_Tobago","Byron_Bay,_New_South_Wales","Australia","Armação_dos_Búzios","Brazil","Somerset_West","South_Africa","Puerto_Vallarta","Mexico","Colón_Island","Panama","Queenstown,_New_Zealand","Phuket,_Thailand","Whistler,_British_Columbia","Canada","Prague,_Czech_Republic","Dominical","Costa_Rica","Buenos_Aires","Patagonia","Argentina","Sosúa","Dominican_Republic","Reykjavík","Iceland","Yalıkavak","Turkey","Swakopmund","Namibia","Real_World/Road_Rules_Challenge_(season)","Real_World/Road_Rules_Challenge_2000","Real_World/Road_Rules_Extreme_Challenge","Spring_Break_Challenge","Trishelle_Cannatella","Africa","South_Africa","Namibia","Asia","Thailand","Turkey","Caribbean","Jamaica","Trinidad_and_Tobago","Dominican_Republic","Central_America","Panama","Costa_Rica","Europe","United_Kingdom","Germany","Czech_Republic","Iceland","North_America","Canada","United_States","Mexico","Oceania","New_Zealand","Australia","South_America","Brazil","Argentina"]}
