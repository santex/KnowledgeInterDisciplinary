{"cursor":"19100","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Thought suppression' is the process of deliberately trying to stop thinking\nabout certain thoughts (Wegner, 1989). It is often associated with\nobsessiveâcompulsive disorder, in which a sufferer will repeatedly (usually\nunsuccessfully) attempt to prevent or \"neutralize\" intrusive distressing\nthoughts centered around one or more obsessions. It is also related to work on\nmemory inhibition.\n\nThought suppression is different from Freud's (1955) concept of repression,\nwhich is unconscious and automatic and has relatively little empirical support\n(see Eysenck, 1985; Holmes, 1990 for a review). Over thirty-five experiments to\ndate have found evidence for thought suppression and its effectiveness. It can\nproduce paradoxical effects for personally irrelevant and relevant thoughts at\nboth a mental and a behavioral level.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Thought_suppression","recorded":1362903004,"links":47,"instances":["mind_game","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.actmindfully.com.au/upimages/experiential_avoidance.pdf","http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/exp_avoid_vulnerablity_BRAT.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner%20Ironic%20Processes%201994.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner&Erber1992.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner,Quillian,&Houston1996.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner,Schneider,Carter,&White%201987.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner,Shortt,Blake,&Page1990.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wegner,Erber,&Zanakos1993.pdf","http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Wenzlaff,Wegner,&Roper1988.pdf"],"categories":["Defence mechanisms","Cognition","Memory processes","Social psychology"],"headings":["Empirical work","Improved methodology","Behavioral domain","Cognitive dynamics","Summary","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","psychology"],["the_game","mind_game"]],"members":["the_game","fixation"],"related":["Obsessive–compulsive_disorder","Fixation_(psychology)","Memory_inhibition","Freud","Psychological_repression","Unconscious_mind","Automatic","Eysenck","Daniel_Wegner","David_J._Schneider","White_Bear_Phenomenon","Ironic_Process_Theory","Anxious","Depressed_mood","Individual_differences_psychology","Paradox","Experiential_avoidance","Relational_Frame_Theory","Self-monitoring","Individual_differences_psychology","Daniel_Wegner","Ironic_process_theory","Obsessive–compulsive_disorder","Experiential_avoidance","Psychological_trauma","Self-censorship","The_Game_(mind_game)","Trauma_trigger","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology","Personality_and_Social_Psychology_Bulletin"]}
