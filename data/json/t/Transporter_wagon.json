{"cursor":"9473","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'transporter wagon', in railway terminology, is a wagon (UIC) or railroad car\n(US) designed to carry other railway equipment. Normally, it is used to\ntransport equipment of a different rail gauge. In most cases, a transporter\nwagon is a narrower gauge wagon for transporting a wider gauge equipment,\nallowing freight in a wider gauge wagons to reach destinations on the narrower\ngauge network without the expense and time of transshipment into a narrower\ngauge wagons.\n\n freight car on a narrower gauge transporter wagon]] This is an attempt to\n overcome one of the primary problems with a narrower gauge system—gauge\n incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be\n built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the\n wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of a narrower gauge\n construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced on a narrower\n gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low\n speeds of or so.\n\nTransporter wagons have seen varying popularity. They were quite common on\nGerman and some Swiss systems; a transporter wagon is a Rollwagen in German.\nTransporter wagons were uncommon in North America, where the practice of\nexchanging trucks was more common, as was at one time the case on CN's\nNewfoundland Railway at Port aux Basques. They were used on the Paw Paw\nRailroad of Paw Paw, Michigan for a short time, and on a short stretch of track\nof the defunct Bradford, Bordell and Kinzua Railroad by lumberman Elisha Kent\nKane. They were used in the United Kingdom on the Leek and Manifold Valley\nLight Railway.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Transporter_wagon","recorded":1362668868,"links":18,"instances":["engineer","rail_transport","rail"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rolling stock"],"headings":["Transporter flatcar","Transporter trailer","Crocodile wagons","See also","Road Transporter Trains","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/001015_gauge_buster.jpg/220px-001015_gauge_buster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Oberheinsdorf_Rollbock_Detail.jpg/220px-Oberheinsdorf_Rollbock_Detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["air_brake","rail"],["air_brake","rail"],["keith_smith","engineer"],["drawbar","haulage#rail"],["wheelset","rail_transport"],["keith_smith","engineer"]],"members":["keith_smith","wheelset","drawbar","air_brake"],"related":["Railway","Goods_wagon","International_Union_of_Railways","Railroad_car","Rail_gauge","Transshipment","Structure_gauge","Loading_gauge","North_America","Bogie_exchange","Canadian_National_Railway","Newfoundland_Railway","Channel-Port_aux_Basques,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador","Paw_Paw_Railroad","Paw_Paw,_Michigan","Bradford,_Bordell_and_Kinzua_Railroad","United_Kingdom","Leek_and_Manifold_Valley_Light_Railway","Brünigbahn","Standard_gauge","Roll-block","United_Kingdom","Leek_and_Manifold_Valley_Light_Railway","Everard_Calthrop","Barsi_Light_Railway","India","Port_Pirie,_South_Australia","Marree,_South_Australia","Standard_gauge","Narrow_gauge_railway","Flinders_Ranges","Washaway","Air_brake_(rail)","Air_brake_(rail)","Keith_Smith_(engineer)","Weltrol","Full-trailer","Bogie","Roll-block","South_Australian_Railways","Victorian_Railways","Irish_gauge","Narrow_gauge_railway","Break_of_gauge","Wheelset_(rail_transport)","Great_Western_Railway","Didcot_Railway_Centre","East_African_Railway_Master_Plan","Leek_and_Manifold_Valley_Light_Railway","Rollbock","Keith_Smith_(engineer)","Train_on_Train","Shinkansen","The_Railway_Magazine","Modalohr","Rolling_highway"]}
