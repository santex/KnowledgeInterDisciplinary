{"cursor":"72156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Tobacco smoking' is the practice of burning tobacco and inhaling the resulting\nsmoke (consisting of particle and gaseous phases). (A more broad definition may\ninclude simply taking tobacco smoke into the mouth, and then releasing it, as is\ndone with tobacco pipes and cigars.) The practice may have begun as early as\n5000â3000 BC. Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the\nlate 17th century where it followed common trade routes. The practice\nencountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards, but\nembedded itself in certain strata of a number of societies before becoming\nwidespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus.\n\nGerman scientists identified a link between smoking and lung cancer in the late\n1920s, leading to the first anti-smoking campaign in modern history, albeit one\ntruncated by the collapse of the Third Reich at the end of the Second World\nWar. In 1950, British researchers demonstrated a clear\nrelationship between smoking and cancer.\nScientific evidence continued to mount in the 1980s, which prompted political\naction against the practice. Rates of consumption since 1965 in the developed\nworld have either peaked or declined. However, they\ncontinue to climb in the developing world.\n\nSmoking is the most common method of consuming tobacco, and tobacco is the most\ncommon substance smoked. The agricultural product is often mixed with\nadditives and then combusted. The resulting smoke\nis then inhaled and the active substances absorbed through the alveoli in the\nlungs. The active substances trigger chemical\nreactions in nerve endings, which heighten heart rate, alertness, and reaction time.\nDopamine and endorphins are released, which are often associated with\npleasure. As of 2000, smoking is practiced\nby approximately 1.22 billion people. In most communities men are more likely to\nsmoke than women, although the gender gap\ntends to be less pronounced in lower age groups.\n\nMany smokers begin during adolescence or early adulthood. During the early\nstages, a combination of perceived pleasure acting as positive reinforcement and\ndesire to respond to social peer pressure may offset the unpleasant symptoms of\ninitial use, which typically include nausea and interrupted sleep patterns.\nAfter an individual has smoked for some years, the avoidance of withdrawal\nsymptoms and negative reinforcement become the key motivations to continue.\n\nIn a study done by Jennifer O' Loughlin and her colleagues, for 5 years seventh\ngrade students were studied, with their first smoking experience. They found out that the most common factors leading students to\nsmoke is cigarette advertisements. Smoking by parents, siblings and friends also\nencourage students to smoke.\n","linknr":1490,"url":"Tobacco_smoking","recorded":1362486199,"links":132,"instances":["sociology","comics","cannabis","pipe","australia","australia"],"pdf":["http://www.jeffreywigand.com/WHOFinal.pdf","http://www.jeffreywigand.com/WHOFinal.pdf","http://www1.worldbank.org/tobacco/pdf/Guindon-Past,%20current-%20whole.pdf","http://www1.worldbank.org/tobacco/pdf/Guindon-Past,%20current-%20whole.pdf","http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/WomenMonograph.pdf","http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/WomenMonograph.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/16324087772709012427.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/16324087772709012427.pdf","http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq307_ArmourPitts.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_prevalence_data_2008.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/11583457347305312840.pdf","http://www.the-tma.org.uk/files/January%202007.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/Tobacco/Documents/com_20080520_en.pdf","http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//FSC/ReynoldsLetter.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/tobacco/mpower/mpower_report_full_2008.pdf"],"categories":["Smoking","Tobacco","Habits","IARC
