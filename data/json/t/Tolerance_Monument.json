The monument\nwas designed by Polish sculptor CzesÅaw DÅºwigaj, known for his religious art, in\ncollaboration with sculptor Michal Kubiak. The project was funded by Polish\nbusinessman Aleksander Gudzowaty to promote peace and tolerance in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\nEtched on a stone at the entrance to the park are the following words: \"The\nmonument is in the form of two halves of a broken column, which stand divided\nbut still linked, on the ruins of a nameless and ageless temple. An olive tree\ngrows in the middle of the split column and with its leaves seeks to encompass\nand shade both halves. The tree enables the two parts of the column to link\ntogether in symbolic coexistence. It cannot be known when the break will heal,\nwhen the two sides will grow back together but it can be seen that between the\nbranches of the olive tree a new seed is sprouting, a golden grain of\ntolerance.\" [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1029306.html Choked by\nunrealistic messages, David Kroyanker, Haaretz]\n\nThe monument is situated on a hill marking the divide between Jewish Armon\nHaNetziv and Arab Jabel Mukaber, just outside the United Nations\nheadquarters. {{cite news |first=Greer Fay |last=Cashman |title=Monumental\ntolerance |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&cid=1159193336672&-\npagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=Jerusalem Post |date=2006-09-29|accessdate=2007-04-\n11}}\n","linknr":118,"url":"Tolerance_Monument","recorded":1362538094,"links":14,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Buildings and structures in Jerusalem","Monuments and memorials in Israel","Peace symbols","Israeli–Palestinian peace efforts","Visitor attractions in Jerusalem"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Monument_of_Tolerance_in_Jerusalem.jpg/220px-Monument_of_Tolerance_in_Jerusalem.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tolerance","disambiguation"]],"members":["tolerance"],"related":["Hebrew_language","Jerusalem","Israel","Czesław_Dźwigaj","Religious_art","Aleksander_Gudzowaty","Israeli-Palestinian_conflict","David_Kroyanker","Haaretz","Jewish","Armon_HaNetziv","Arab","Jabel_Mukaber","United_Nations","Center_for_Human_Dignity","Monument","Tolerance_(disambiguation)"]}
