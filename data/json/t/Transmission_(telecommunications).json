{"cursor":"1749","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n used for transmission of radio signal]] In telecommunications, 'transmission'\n (abbreviation: 'Tx') is the process of sending and propagating an analogue or\n digital information signal over a physical point-to-point or point-to-\n multipoint transmission medium, either wired, optical fiber or\n wireless. Transmission technologies and schemes typically refer to\n physical layer protocol duties such as modulation, demodulation, line coding,\n equalization, error control, bit synchronization and multiplexing, but the term\n may also involve higher-layer protocol duties, for example, digitizing an\n analog message signal, and source coding (compression).\n\nTransmission of a digital message, or of a digitized analog signal, is known as\ndata transmission or digital communication.\n\nOne transmission is the sending of a signal with limited duration, for example a\nblock or packet of data, a phone call, or an email.\n","linknr":528,"url":"Transmission_(telecommunications)","recorded":1362673104,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Telecommunications engineering"],"headings":["Converse","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/TV_antenna.JPG/200px-TV_antenna.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Analog_signal","Digital_signal","Transmission_medium","Physical_layer","Modulation","Demodulation","Line_coding","Equalization","Error_control","Bit_synchronization","Multiplexing","Digitizing","Data_transmission","Digital_communication","Communication_channel"]}
