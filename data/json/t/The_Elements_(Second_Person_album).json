This album contains an\nexclusive set of tracks written for \"believers\" on the online music community,\nSellaband. Using the website, fans raised a total of $50,000 to fund the album\nand since Second Person were the first UK band to achieve this goal the project\nhas gained a great deal of worldwide media attention.\n[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2034014,00.html]\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20070314_sellaband.shtml]\n\nIn the latter stages of production the band were joined by legendary\nproducer/engineer: Tony Platt who is best known for his work with Bob Marley,\nAC/DC and Iron Maiden amongst many others. A&R supervisor for this project was\nAdam Sieff (former Director of Jazz at Sony Music) and despite rumours of\nrecording it in New York the band remained in London to record and mix the album\nat The London Recording Studios (formerly Sarm East Studios - Queen, Madonna,\nThe Clash, INXS etc.) and The Way Studios respectively. The album was mastered\nby Ray Staff (Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Muse etc.) at Alchemy, Soho.\n\nThe record is to be accompanied by an animated short film, of the same name,\nthat will span the length of the entire album. The first chapter of this video\nis called \"Wood\" and premiered exclusively on the front page of Bebo.com three\ndays before the album's official release on 9 August 2007. The story follows a\nyoung girl and her journey through a world of dragons and strange creatures. The\nstory of the remaining four chapters remains a secret but animators and artists\nconfirmed for this project include Everton Sebben, Katy Davis and Ben King. A\nnumber of guest animators will also join the team for different sections of the\nstory and the new videos are due for release throughout the remainder of 2007.\n","linknr":118,"url":"The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","recorded":1363185437,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:ElementsCover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/ElementsCover.jpg/220px-ElementsCover.jpg","/wiki/Studio_album","/wiki/Second_Person_(band)","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Trip_hop#Post_trip_hop","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Tony_Platt","/wiki/Mark_Maclaine_(producer)","/wiki/Trip_hop#Post_trip_hop","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Second_Person_(band)","http://www.sellaband.com/secondperson","/wiki/Chromatography_(album)","/wiki/Julia_Johnson","/wiki/Mark_Maclaine_(producer)","/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_L%C3%B3pez_(musician)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Sellaband","http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2034014,00.html","http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20070314_sellaband.shtml","/wiki/Tony_Platt","/wiki/Bob_Marley","/wiki/AC/DC","/wiki/Iron_Maiden","/wiki/A%26R","/wiki/Adam_Sieff","/wiki/Sony_Music","/wiki/The_London_Recording_Studios","/wiki/Sarm_East_Studios","/wiki/Queen_(band)","/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)","/wiki/The_Clash","/wiki/INXS","/wiki/The_Way_Recording_Studio_London","/wiki/Ray_Staff","/wiki/Led_Zeppelin","/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones","/wiki/Muse_(band)","/wiki/Wood_(Second_Person_song)","/wiki/Bebo.com","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wood_(Second_Person_song)","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.sellaband.com/secondperson","http://www.cdbaby.com/secondperson/","http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20070314_sellaband.shtml","http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2034014,00.html","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit&section=3","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&oldid=507084794","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2007_albums","/wiki/Category:Second_Person_albums","/wiki/Category:Albums_produced_by_Tony_Platt","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hAudio_microformats","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Elements+%28Second+Person+album%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Elements+%28Second+Person+album%29","/wiki/The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","/wiki/Talk:The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","#","/wiki/The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&oldid=507084794","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Elements_%28Second_Person_album%29&id=507084794","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Elements+%28Second+Person+album%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Elements+%28Second+Person+album%29&oldid=507084794&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Elements_(Second_Person_album)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:Ab
