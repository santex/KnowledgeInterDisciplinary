A thioether is similar to an ether except that it\ncontains a sulfur atom in place of the oxygen. The grouping of oxygen and sulfur\nin the periodic table suggests that the chemical properties of ethers and\nthioethers are somewhat similar.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Thioether","recorded":1362670416,"links":36,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Thioethers|","Functional groups"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Structure and properties","Occurrence and applications","Preparation","Reactions","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Thioether_structure.svg/140px-Thioether_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/ThioetherGallery.png/750px-ThioetherGallery.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor"],"related":["Organosulfur_chemistry","Volatile_organic_compound","Ether","Periodic_table","Dimethylsulfide","Anisole","Picometer","Thiophene","Heterocyclic_compound","Aromatic","Delocalize","Hydrogenation","Tetrahydrothiophene","Amino_acid","Methionine","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Biotin","Petroleum","Polyphenylene_sulfide","Coenzyme_M","Methane","Methanogenesis","Coenzyme-M","Methionine","Biotin","Polyphenylene_sulfide","Alkylation","Thiol","Disulfide","Organolithium_reagent","Grignard_reagent","Alkene","Free_radical","Pummerer_rearrangement","Alkyl","S-Adenosyl_methionine","Methylation","SN2_reaction","Sulfoxide","Sulfone","Hydrogen_peroxide","Dimethyl_sulfide","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Methylsulfonylmethane","Alkylate","Sulfonium","Trimethylsulfonium_iodide","Coordination_complexes","HSAB","Phosphine","1,4,7-trithiacyclononane","Hydrogenolysis","Raney_nickel","Hydrodesulfurization"]}
