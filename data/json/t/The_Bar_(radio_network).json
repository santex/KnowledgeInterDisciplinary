This satellite-\ndriven feed has got its name from a Bar, an establishment that usually serves\nalcoholic beverages to its customers.\n\nAlthough \"The Bar\" will not be affected by the acquisition of Waitt Radio\nNetworks by Triton Media Group, it will likely be relocated into Dial Global's\nportfolio.\n\nWhile most affiliates use \"The Bar\" imagery, one station (in a dry i.e. no\nalcohol sales area) uses an alternative of \"The West Texas JukeBox\". That\nstation is KBXJ Los Ybanez, Texas.\n","linknr":147,"url":"The_Bar_(radio_network)","recorded":1362565067,"links":11,"instances":["establishment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American radio networks"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bar","establishment"]],"members":["bar"],"related":["United_States","Radio_network","Waitt_Radio_Networks","Triton_Media_Group","Waitt_Radio_Networks","Country_rock","George_Strait","The_Eagles","Toby_Keith","Bob_Seger","Johnny_Cash","Bar_(establishment)","Alcoholic_beverage","Triton_Media_Group","Dial_Global"]}
