The lead truck,\ncalled \"Monster\" has been created by a boy genius (Gabriel Damon) and is to be\ndriven by a woman (Karen Allen) through the course. The only problem is the\ncomputer guidance system fails and she ends up in uncharted territories. There\nshe encounters leather-clad hoods that torture her and eventually kill her.\nBefore dying she tells a fellow prisoner (Johnny Hallyday) about the truck and\nhe uses it to escape. Most of the rest of the film is his relationship (\"2001 -\nHal-like) with the truck's computer and his avoidance of attacking vehicles.\nMeanwhile back at the Terminus, the boy genius is ruled by a mysterious doctor\n(JÃ¼rgen Prochnow), who may have another plan in mind.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Terminus_(1987_film)","recorded":1362667396,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1987 films"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Action_film_clapperboard.svg/30px-Action_film_clapperboard.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Sffilm.png/29px-Sffilm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pierre-William_Glenn","Gabriel_Damon","Karen_Allen","Johnny_Hallyday","Jürgen_Prochnow"]}
