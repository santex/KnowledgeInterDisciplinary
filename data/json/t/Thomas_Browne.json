A\nconsummate literary craftsman, Browne's works are permeated by frequent\nreference to Classical and Biblical sources and to his own highly idiosyncratic\npersonality. His literary style varies according to genre resulting in a rich,\nunusual prose that ranges from rough notebook observations to the highest\nbaroque eloquence. Although he was described as suffering from melancholia,\nBrowne's writings are also characterised by wit and subtle humour.\n","linknr":490,"url":"Thomas_Browne","recorded":1362485565,"links":37,"instances":["literature","philosophy","writer","united_kingdom","writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English science
