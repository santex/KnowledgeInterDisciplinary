The comic of the same name was\npublished by WildStorm Productions and ran from 2001 - 2002. It was created by\nIan Edginton and Charlie Adlard, who were also sole creative team throughout its\nentire 13 issue run.\n\nThe series focused on the exploits of the current incarnation of the group while\ndefending Britain and the world from various threats including Daemonite\nattacks, invasion from little green Venusians, plagues of zombies, and an\nattempt at recreating the universe.\n\nWhile the majority of the series was self-contained with little contact with the\nrest of the Wildstorm Universe several minor characters, concepts and hanging\nplot threads were incorporated into its run. In addition to this it was heavily\ninfluenced by British Pop Culture and incorporated various cameos and nods to\nthe various TV series and novels that inspired it.\n","linknr":168,"url":"The_Establishment_(comics)","recorded":1362562767,"links":12,"instances":["comics","mathematician","comics","dc_comics","doctor_who","comics","comic_strip","comics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Comics by Ian Edginton","Stormwatch and the Authority characters"],"headings":["Publication history","Characters","Bibliography","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/The_Establishment_1_cover.jpg/250px-The_Establishment_1_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sergio_garcia","comics"],["world's_end","comics"],["captain_marvel","dc_comics"],["doctor","doctor_who"],["john_dee","mathematician"],["garth","comic_strip"],["spartan","comics#the_future"],["spartan","comics"],["spartan","comics"],["black_sun","comics"]],"members":["spartan","john_dee","sergio_garcia","captain_marvel","doctor","garth","black_sun"],"related":["Wildstorm","Ian_Edginton","Charlie_Adlard","Ian_Edginton","Charlie_Adlard","Jenna_Garcia","Sergio_Garcia_(comics)","Wildstorm_FX","Darlene_Royer","Jeff_Mariotte","Wildstorm_Universe","Wildstorm","2001_in_comics","2002_in_comics","Ian_Edginton","Charlie_Adlard","Daemonite","Wildstorm_Universe","World's_End_(comics)","Miracleman","Captain_Marvel_(DC_Comics)","Axel_Brass","Gravitational_singularity","Tom_Baker","Doctor_(Doctor_Who)","John_Dee_(mathematician)","John_Steed","Sanskrit","Selkie","Emma_Peel","Garth_(comic_strip)","Jenny_Sparks","Daemonite","Daemonite","H.G._Wells","The_Time_Machine","Spartan_(comics)","Mister_Majestic","H.G._Wells","The_Time_Machine","Spartan_(comics)","Mister_Majestic","Tunguska_event","Black_Sun_(comics)","Comic_Book_Resources"]}
