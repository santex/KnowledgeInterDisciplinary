Its\ndouble-stranded DNA genome is about 169 kbp long and is held in an\nicosahedral head, also known as a capsid. T4 is a relatively large phage, at\napproximately 90 nm wide and 200 nm long (most phages range from 25 to\n200 nm in length). Its tail fibres allow attachment to a host cell, and the\nT4âs tail is hollow so that it can pass its nucleic acid to the cell it is\ninfecting during attachment. T4 is capable of undergoing only a lytic lifecycle\nand not the lysogenic lifecycle.\n","linknr":282,"url":"T4_phage","recorded":1362481862,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caudovirales","Bacteriophages"],"headings":["Infection process","Features","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bacteriophage","Bacterium","DNA","Genome","Base_pair","Icosahedron","Capsid","Phage","Nanometer","Nucleic_acid","Lytic","Lysogeny","Infection","Lipopolysaccharide_","Cell_membrane","Lysozyme","Peptidoglycan","Lytic_cycle","Adsorption","Gene_expression","Enzyme","DNA_replication","Virus","Lysis","Eukaryote","Intron","DNA_repair","Terminally_redundant","Concatemer","Circular_permutation","Nobel_Prize","Max_Delbrück","Salvador_Luria","Alfred_Hershey","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Michael_Rossmann","Seymour_Benzer","Bruce_Alberts","Richard_Lenski","James_Bull","T4_rII_system"]}
