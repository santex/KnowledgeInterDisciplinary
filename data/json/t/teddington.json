It is located south west of\nCharing Cross. It stretches inland from the River Thames to Bushy Park. Formerly\nit was in the county of Middlesex.\n\nTeddington is mostly residential but is bisected by an almost continuous road of\nshops, offices and other facilities running from the river to Bushy Park. There\nare three clusters of offices on this route: on the river Teddington Studios and\nHaymarket Group form a media hub whilst on the edge of Bushy Park the NPL, NMO\nand LGC form a scientific centre. Around Teddington Station and the town centre\nare a number of offices in industries such as Direct Marketing and IT, and\noffices outside this axis include Tearfund. Several riverside businesses and\nhouses were redeveloped in the last quarter of the 20th century as blocks of\nriverside flats.\n\nTeddington gives its name to Teddington Lock, which is across the river at Ham\nand is accessible via the Teddington Lock Footbridges. This marks the upstream\nlimit of the Tideway and is a complex of three locks of which the barge lock at\n650 feet (nearly 200 metres) is the longest on the River Thames.<ref name=\"visi-\ntthames.co.uk\">[http://www.visitthames.co.uk/uploads/a_users_guide_to_the_River-\n_thames.pdf Statistics from – Environment Agency A User's Guide to the River\nThames:Part II]</ref>\n\nIn 2001 the RNLI opened the Teddington Lifeboat Station, one of the four Thames\nlifeboat stations, below the lock on the Teddington side. The station became\noperational in January 2002 and is the only volunteer station on the river.\n","title":"teddington","headings":["History","Education","Sport","Transport","Local geography","Literature","Notable residents","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Twickenham","4: Bushy_Park","4: Richmond,_London","4: Kingston_upon_Thames","3: Hampton_Wick","3: National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK","3: Teddington_railway_station","3: Ham,_London","3: Hampton,_London","3: Bushy_House","3: Whitton,_London","2: Teddington_Studios","2: Adelaide_of_Saxe-Meiningen","2: Hampton_Hill","2: Fulwell,_London","1: London_Borough_of_Richmond_upon_Thames","1: River_Thames","1: Charing_Cross","1: Historic_counties_of_England","1: Middlesex","1: Haymarket_Group","1: National_Measurement_Office","1: LGC","1: Tearfund","1: Teddington_Lock","1: Teddington_Lock_Footbridges","1: Tideway","1: RNLI","1: Teddington_Lifeboat_Station","1: Rudyard_Kipling","1: Mesolithic","1: Neolithic","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Anglo-Saxons","1: Benedictine_monks","1: Staines","1: Westminster_Abbey","1: Abbot_of_Westminster","1: Cardinal_Wolsey","1: Henry_VIII","1: Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Frederick_North,_Lord_North","1: William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom","1: Dorothea_Jordan","1: Little_Ice_Age","1: City_of_London_Corporation","1: Teddington_Lock_Footbridge","1: Surrey","1: Victorian_era","1: Edwardian","1: High_church_","1: Notre_Dame_de_Paris","1: Elementary_Education_Act_1870","1: Edwardian_Baroque_architecture","1: Suffragettes","1: Atomic_clock","1: Carnegie_Library","1: Electricity","1: Bouncing_bomb","1: Dwight_D._Eisenhower","1: D-Day_landings","1: SHAEF","1: Tesco","1: Widescreen","1: Thames_Television","1: Towpath_murders","1: Alfred_Whiteway","1: Scotland_Yard","1: Collis_Primary_School","1: Teddington_School","1: Lensbury","1: Royal_Dutch_Shell","1: Kingston_Loop_Line","1: South_West_Trains","1: London_Waterloo","1: Wimbledon,_London","1: Putney","1: Shepperton","1: London_Heathrow","1: Hanworth","1: Feltham","1: Hatton,_London","1: Tolworth","1: Surbiton","1: Hounslow","1: Hammersmith","1: East_Sheen","1: Barnes,_London","1: Castelnau,_London","1: Hampton_Court","1: Kew","1: West_Middlesex_Hospital","1: West_Croydon_station","1: New_Malden","1: Worcester_Park","1: Cheam","1: Sutton,_London","1: Carshalton","1: Wallington_Green","1: East_Croydon","1: Strawberry_Hill,_London","1: Sunbury-on-Thames","1: Thames_Ditton","1: Richmond_Park","1: Hampton_Wick_railway_station","1: Fulwell_railway_station","1: Strawberry_Hill_railway_station","1: Church_of_England","1: Teddington_Baptist_Church","1: Roman_Catholic_Church","1: Methodist","1: St_Peter","1: Paul_the_Apostle","1: Mo_Farah","1: Viv_Groskop","1: Noël_Coward","1: Prince_Louis,_Duke_of_Nemours","1: Eugène_Marais","1: Norman_Selfe"]}
