{"cursor":"2572","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Transcription software' assists in the conversion of human speech into a text\ntranscript. The primary meaning of the term \"transcription software\" has changed\nover time, with the introduction of new technologies such as natural language\nspeech recognition. References also depend on the purpose for the transcript.\nThe term \"transcription software\" can refer to a completely automated solution,\nor to software which helps a human transcriber manually convert spoken audio\ninto text transcripts. In the latter case, the term [[digital dictation]] is\nsometimes used.\n\nTranscription software, as with transcription services is often provided for\nbusiness, legal, or medical purposes. Compared with audio content, a text\ntranscript is searchable, takes up less computer memory, and can be used as an\nalternate communication method, such as for closed captions.\n\nThe definition of transcription \"software\" as compared with transcription\n\"service\" is that the former is sufficiently automated that a user can run the\nentire system without engaging outside personnel. However, the advent of software-as-a-\nservice and cloud computing models blur this distinction.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Transcription_(software)","recorded":1362671879,"links":11,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Speech recognition","Lists of software"],"headings":["Transcription Software Products & Vendors"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","service"],["transcription","linguistics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Natural_language","Speech_recognition","Transcription_(service)","Medical_transcription","SaaS","Cloud_computing","Transcription_(linguistics)","NCH_Software","Nuance_Communications","Nuance_Communications","Dragon_NaturallySpeaking","Nuance_Communications","Nuance_Communications","MacSpeech_Scribe","Nuance_Communications","Vocapia","VoxSigma","Digital_dictation_software"]}
