{"cursor":"10137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" lower, in the key of B.]]\n\nIn music 'transposition' refers to the process, or operation, of moving a\ncollection of notes (pitches or pitch classes) up or down in pitch by a\nconstant interval.\n\nFor example, one might transpose an entire piece of music into another key.\nSimilarly, one might transpose a tone row or an unordered collection of pitches\nsuch as a chord so that it begins on another pitch.\n\nThe transposition of a set A by n semitones is designated by 'T' n(A),\nrepresenting the addition (mod 12) of an integer n to each of the pitch class\nintegers of the set A. Thus the set (A) consisting of 0-1-\n2 transposed by 5 semitones is 5-6-7 ('T' 5(A)) since 0+5=5, 1+5=6,\nand 2+5=7.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Transposition_(music)","recorded":1362903497,"links":42,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","music","dvořák","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical techniques","Pitch (music)"],"headings":["Four kinds of transposition","Sight transposition","Transpositional equivalence","Twelve-tone transposition","Fuzzy transposition","See also","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Transposition_example_from_Koch.png/350px-Transposition_example_from_Koch.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/86540fa9f7eb89238c87373578d4a83f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/9/0/090505e4a7660bf1c0bf133388bc98e8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/7/8/9783d4373b1d115f06b4604fd334fe04.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Dvorak_9%2C_trumpet_part_exerpt.png/220px-Dvorak_9%2C_trumpet_part_exerpt.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/7/ef73f36ec659999141774086e1bf8492.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/2/272f5d4d5eb256e80897a7c6f9dd9fc7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/4/6c4b0d0815fa3778b039b7b50dc01ff6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/0/fb05198d307916e1e5015b17300cd160.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg/80px-Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operation","music"],["set","music"],["pitch","music"],["pitch","music"],["interval","music"],["piece","music"],["key","music"],["chord","music"],["symphony_no._9","dvořák"],["degree","music"],["set_theory","music"],["operation","music"],["relation","music"],["modulation","music"],["modulation","music"]],"members":["piece","degree","chord","interval","key","modulation","relation","set_theory","pitch","operation","set"],"related":["Music","Operation_(music)","Set_(music)","Note","Pitch_(music)","Pitch_class","Pitch_(music)","Interval_(music)","Piece_(music)","Key_(music)","Tone_row","Chord_(music)","Modular_math","Musical_scale","Symphony_No._9_(Dvořák)","Antonín_Dvořák","Transposing_instrument","Clef","Staff_position","Note","Degree_(music)","Enharmonic_equivalence","Octave_equivalence","Set_theory_(music)","Operation_(music)","Relation_(music)","Modulation_(music)","Related_key","Integer_notation","Modular_arithmetic","Milton_Babbitt","Fuzzy_inversion","Voice-leading","Pitch-class_space","Modulation_(music)","Pitch_shift","Transposing_instrument"]}
