{"cursor":"32458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn molecular biology 'transformation' is genetic alteration of a cell resulting\nfrom the direct uptake, incorporation and expression of exogenous genetic\nmaterial (exogenous DNA) from its surroundings and taken up through the cell\nmembrane(s). Transformation occurs naturally in some species of bacteria, but it\ncan also be effected by artificial means in other cells. For transformation to\nhappen, bacteria must be in a state of competence, which might occur as a time-\nlimited response to environmental conditions such as starvation and cell\ndensity. Transformation is one of three processes by which exogenous genetic\nmaterial may be introduced into a bacterial cell, the other two being\nconjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct\ncontact) and transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage virus\ninto the host bacterium). \"Transformation\" may also be used to describe the\ninsertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells, including animal and\nplant cells; however, because \"transformation\" has a special meaning in relation\nto animal cells, indicating progression to a cancerous state, the term should be\navoided for animal cells when describing introduction of exogenous genetic\nmaterial. Introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells is often called\n\"transfection\".\n","linknr":538,"url":"Transformation_(bacteria)","recorded":1362486621,"links":37,"instances":["genetics","t2ss","biology","biochemist","genetics","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/25239/1/018_33.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular biology","Gene delivery"],"headings":["History","Methods and mechanisms","Practical aspects of transformation in molecular biology","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["competence","biology"],["transduction","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["stanley_cohen","biochemist"],["competence","biology"],["secretion#type_ii_secretion_system","t2ss"],["transduction","genetics"],["complementation","genetics"],["vector","molecular_biology"]],"members":["complementation","competence","stanley_cohen","transduction","cell","vector"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Introduction_to_genetics","Cell_(biology)","Gene_expression","Gene","Exogenous_DNA","Bacteria","Competence_(biology)","Bacterial_conjugation","Transduction_(genetics)","Eukaryotic_cell","Transfection","Frederick_Griffith","Oswald_Avery","Colin_MacLeod","Maclyn_McCarty","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","Genetic_markers","Bacterial_conjugation","Transduction_(genetics)","Joshua_Lederberg","Lambda_phage","Helper_virus","Stanley_Cohen_(biochemist)","Douglas_Hanahan","Molecular_cloning","Biotechnology","Research","Electroporation","Bacterial_strain","Transgenic_mouse","Plasmid","Ti_plasmid","Electroporation","Microinjection","Biolistic_Particle_Delivery_System","John_C._Sanford","Naked_DNA","Competence_(biology)","Bacillus_subtilis","Haemophilus_influenzae","Streptococcus_mutans","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Meiosis","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Translocase","Gram-positive_bacteria","Gram-negative_bacteria","Cell_membrane","RecA","Pilin","Divalent","Cation","Calcium_chloride","Calcium_chloride_transformation","Phospholipids","Lipopolysaccharide","Electroporation","Electric_field","Volt","Yeast","Alkali","Cation","Cesium","Lithium","Lithium_acetate","Polyethylene_glycol","Electroporation","Arabidopsis_thaliana","Gene_gun","Transformation_efficiency","Electroporation","Viral_transformation","Transduction_(genetics)","RNA","Transfection","Transfection","Origin_of_replication","Transformation_efficiency","PUC19","Calcium_chloride_transformation","Calcium_chloride","Plasmid","Exonuclease","Selectable_marker","Antibiotic_resistance","Auxotrophy","Reporter_gene","Marker_gene","Beta-galactosidase","Blue-white_screen","Complementation_(genetics)","X-gal","Multiple_cloning_site","DNA_ligase","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Green_fluorescent_protein","Luciferase","Luciferin"]}
