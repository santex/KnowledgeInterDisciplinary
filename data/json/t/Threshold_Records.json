The band formed this label to allow for\nartistically packaged gatefold covers for their LP releases, and for releasing\nband members' solo efforts.

The rock sextet Providence also recorded for\nThreshold. After 1976 the Moody Blues went back to having their albums\nmanufactured by Decca Records (and later PolyGram and Universal Records), but\nthe Threshold company and logo were maintained over the years as a means of\nselling their records through their own record shop in Cobham, Surrey.\n\nThe Moody Blues subsequent albums, up to and including 1999's [[Strange Times\n(Moody Blues album)|Strange Times]], were branded 'in association with\nThreshold Records'.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Threshold_Records","recorded":1362564701,"links":19,"instances":["musician","band","album","album","mike_pinder_album","music","band","trapeze_album","band","album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct record labels of the United Kingdom","Vanity record labels","Progressive rock record labels","Vivendi subsidiaries"],"headings":["Label variations","Threshold Records Discography","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/MusicalnotesUK.svg/35px-MusicalnotesUK.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["single","music"],["john_lodge","musician"],["trapeze","band"],["providence","band"],["trapeze","band"],["trapeze","1970_album"],["trapeze","band"],["medusa","trapeze_album"],["every_good_boy_deserves_favour","album"],["asgard","band"],["trapeze","band"],["providence","band"],["trapeze","band"],["john_lodge","musician"],["blue_jays","album"],["hopes,_wishes_and_dreams","album"],["the_promise","mike_pinder_album"]],"members":["john_lodge","asgard","every_good_boy_deserves_favour","the_promise","single","trapeze","medusa","providence","blue_jays"],"related":["Decca_Records","London_Records","The_Moody_Blues","Record_label","The_Moody_Blues","Album","United_Kingdom","Decca_Records","London_Records","Music_ensemble","Gramophone_record","Single_(music)","Album","John_Lodge_(musician)","Record_producer","Trapeze_(band)","Providence_(band)","PolyGram","Universal_Records","Gramophone_record","Cobham,_Surrey","Surrey","The_Moody_Blues","To_Our_Children's_Children's_Children","Trapeze_(band)","Trapeze_(1970_album)","The_Moody_Blues","A_Question_of_Balance","Trapeze_(band)","Medusa_(Trapeze_album)","The_Moody_Blues","Every_Good_Boy_Deserves_Favour_(album)","Asgard_(band)","In_the_Realm_of_Asgard","The_Moody_Blues","Seventh_Sojourn","Trapeze_(band)","You_Are_the_Music...We're_Just_the_Band","Providence_(band)","Ever_Sense_the_Dawn","Trapeze_(band)","The_Final_Swing","The_Moody_Blues","This_Is_The_Moody_Blues","Justin_Hayward","John_Lodge_(musician)","Blue_Jays_(album)","Graeme_Edge","Kick_Off_Your_Muddy_Boots","Ray_Thomas","From_Mighty_Oaks","Ray_Thomas","Hopes,_Wishes_and_Dreams_(album)","Mike_Pinder","The_Promise_(Mike_Pinder_album)","The_Moody_Blues","Long_Distance_Voyager","The_Moody_Blues","The_Present","The_Moody_Blues","List_of_record_labels"]}
