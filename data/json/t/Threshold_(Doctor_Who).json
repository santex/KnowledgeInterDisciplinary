The canonicity of the comic strips, like other\nDoctor Who spin-off media, is open to interpretation.\n\nThe Threshold were created by the \"partnership\" of Abraham White, a travelling\nsalesman, and the Pariah, a living weapon of great power created on Gallifrey\nmany years ago, but was soon cast out by Rassilon as it had developed a mind of\nits own and rebelled. During a final battle with Rassilon, its containment\nsphere crashed to Earth, where it was discovered by Abraham. Offering him power\nand immortality, the Pariah persuaded Abraham to merge with her core being.\nAfter helping Henry Ford begin the mass production line of his cars, an inspired\nAbraham mass-produced a series of spheres, giving birth to the Threshold.\n\nThe Threshold began their careers as profiteers, using their transport window\ncapabilities to carry out important missions from their clients, during the DMW\ncomic strip \"Ground Zero\" (Issues 238-242) they eventually come under contract\nto the Lobri, a race of spider-like parasitic entities trapped on a plane of\nreality that also holds together the link between human minds. They supply the\nLobri with the resources required to instigate a breakout, a large gathering of\nhumans at the Notting Hill Carnival, and supply them with three of the Doctor's\nprevious companions, Peri, Ace, and Sarah Jane Smith, to gain enough power to\nescape the dimension, having taken them from previous adventures in the\nDoctor's life.\n\nThe Doctor, along with his granddaughter Susan, were also abducted and used by\nThreshold agents, but successfully managed to trick the main Threshold operative\nfor the Notting Hill mission, Isaac, and travelled to the realm. There, they\nsaved all of the companions, except for Ace, who dies saving the Doctor. They\ndestroyed two of the Lobri, and killed the surviving member when it arrived on\nEarth. Using the TARDIS, the Threshold remained untouched, and with their\nsecrets still known only to them, merely continued on with business as usual.\nTheir only real weakness is their inability to time travel, providing the Doctor\nwith an inevitable upper hand when dealing with them in later adventures.\n\nDuring the Eighth Doctor comic strip adventure \"Fire and Brimstone\" (Issues 251-\n255), the Threshold are hired by the Time Lords to eliminate the Daleks as they\nattempt to open the doorway to an alternate reality as part of a war effort to\ndestroy a group of alternate Daleks that had crossed over into their reality,\nand then to eventually conquer all of the multiverse. This goal was not above\nattempting to sacrifice the Doctor, their major interest in fulfilling this\ncontract was the reward: A black box (which would allow them the gift of\nuniversal translation, necessary to implement a message to the galaxies on a\nproposal of their own).\n\nThe Doctor successfully managed to end the Dalek threat without sacrificing\nhimself, and the Threshold attained their box. Tiring of the Threshold's\nmanipulations, the Doctor fought back in the comic strip \"Wormwood\" (Issues 266-\n271). Enabling the aid of a disguised Shayde to fake his own regeneration, he\nallowed the Threshold to believe him vulnerable enough to take the TARDIS crew\nto their main base on the moon, a western like town on the surface (to appease\nAbraham's roots) and a major complex underneath. The Doctor's friends learned\nof the Threshold's secret history and the extent of their agenda; to make\nuniversal travel impossible and profit from the continuous use of their\ninterdimensional windows.\n\nWith the plot revealed, the Doctor came out of hiding, the Pariah then revealed\nthat it had tricked even its own creations, it (or a \"she\" by her own\nadmission) wiped out the Threshold legions by shifting their Eye of Disharmony\ndevice, using it to disrupt their universe, a split second in time, killing\nthem instantly. Abraham at this point turned against the Pariah and separated\nhimself from her, causing her to lose most of her powers, before finally being\nbrought down by Shayde, who is revealed to be her successor. The Doctor\ndestroys the Eye's control centre, and the device explodes, decimating the\nalien moon and killing both White and The Pariah, ending the Threshold's\norganisation once and for all.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Threshold_(Doctor_Who)","recorded":1362564697,"links":13,"instances":["doctor_who"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Doctor Who organisations"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ace","doctor_who"]],"members":["ace"],"related":["Science_fiction_television","Gallifrey","Rassilon","Henry_Ford","Notting_Hill_Carnival","Peri_Brown","Ace_(Doctor_Who)","Sarah_Jane_Smith","TARDIS","Time_travel","Eighth_Doctor","Time_Lord","Daleks","Shayde"]}
