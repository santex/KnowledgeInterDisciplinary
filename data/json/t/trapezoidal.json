The parallel sides are called the bases of the\ntrapezoid and the other two sides are called the legs or the lateral sides (if\nthey are not parallel; otherwise there are two pairs of bases). A scalene\ntrapezoid is a trapezoid with no sides of equal measure, in contrast to the\nspecial cases below. A trapezoid with vertices ABCD is denoted .\n\nThere is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of\nparallel sides, should be counted as trapezoids. Some define a trapezoid as a\nquadrilateral having exactly one pair of parallel sides (the exclusive\ndefinition), thereby excluding parallelograms.<ref></ref> Others<ref\nname=Mathworld></ref> define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral with at least one\npair of parallel sides (the inclusive definition<ref>Trapezoids, [http://www.ma-\nth.washington.edu/~king/coursedir/m444a00/syl/class/trapezoids/Trapezoids.html],\naccessed 2012-02-24.</ref>), making the parallelogram a special type of\ntrapezoid. The latter definition is consistent with its uses in higher\nmathematics such as calculus. The former definition would make such concepts as\nthe trapezoidal approximation to a definite integral ill-defined. This article\nuses the inclusive definition and considers parallelograms as special cases of a\ntrapezoid. This is also advocated in the taxonomy of quadrilaterals.\n","title":"trapezoid","headings":["Etymology","Special cases","Characterizations","Midsegment and height","Area","Diagonals","Other properties","More on terminology","Architecture","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Quadrilateral","3: Parallelogram","2: Proclus","2: Isosceles_trapezoid","1: Convex_polygon","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Convex_set","1: American_English","1: Trapezoid#Special_cases","1: Mathematical_notation","1: Trapezoidal_approximation","1: Definite_integral","1: Quadrilateral#Taxonomy","1: Euclid's_Elements","1: Right_angles","1: Tangential_trapezoid","1: Rhombus","1: Rectangle","1: If_and_only_if","1: Angle","1: Supplementary_angles","1: Diagonal","1: Ratio","1: Collinear","1: Midpoint","1: Quadrilateral#Special_line_segments","1: Perpendicular","1: Aryabhata","1: Mathematician","1: Astronomer","1: Indian_mathematics","1: Indian_astronomy","1: Triangle","1: Heron's_formula","1: Semiperimeter","1: Brahmagupta's_formula","1: Cyclic_quadrilateral","1: Bretschneider's_formula","1: Harmonic_mean","1: Planar_lamina","1: Euclid","1: Polite_number","1: Trapezoidal_rule"]}
