Typically,\nthe idea was that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter\nsuch as dust, or that maggots could arise from dead flesh. A variant idea was\nthat of 'equivocal generation', in which species such as tapeworms arose from\nunrelated living organisms, now understood to be their hosts. Doctrines\nsupporting such processes of generation held that these processes are\ncommonplace and regular. Such ideas are in contradiction to that of 'univocal\ngeneration': effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related\nparent(s), generally of the same species.\n\nThe doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by\nAristotle, who compiled and expanded the work of prior natural\nphilosophers and the various ancient explanations of the appearance of\norganisms; it held sway for two millennia. Today it is generally accepted to\nhave been decisively dispelled during the 19th century by the experiments of\nLouis Pasteur. He expanded upon the investigations of predecessors (such as\nFrancesco Redi who, in the 17th century, had performed experiments based on the\nsame principles). However, the experimental difficulties are greater than people\nmight think, and objections from persons holding the traditional views\npersisted. Many of these residual objections were routed by the work of John\nTyndall, succeeding the work of Pasteur. Tyndall,\nJohn; Fragments of Science, Vol 2, chapters IV, XII (1876), XIII(1878); Pub. P.\nF. Collier, New York 1905; (Available at:\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/fragmenoscien02tyndrich ) Ultimately, the\nideas of spontaneous generation were displaced by advances in germ theory and\ncell theory.\n\nDisproof of the traditional ideas of spontaneous generation is no longer\ncontroversial among professional biologists. Objections and doubts have been\ndispelled by studies and documentation of the life cycles of various life forms.\nHowever, the principles of the very different matter of the original abiogenesis\non this planet — of living from non-living material — still are\nunder investigation.
