This industry includes restaurants, school and hospital\ncafeterias, catering operations, and many other formats.\n\nThe companies that supply foodservice operators are called foodservice\ndistributors. Foodservice distributors sell goods like small wares (kitchen\nutensils) and foods. Some companies manufacture products in both consumer and\nfoodservice versions. The consumer version usually comes in individual-sized\npackages with elaborate label design for retail sale. The foodservice version is\npackaged in a much larger industrial size and often lacks the colorful label\ndesigns of the consumer version.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Table_service","recorded":1362560716,"links":22,"instances":["establishment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Foodservice|","Serving and dining"],"headings":["Statistics","Counter service","Table service","Gueridon service","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Lunch_%40_Pantip_Plaza_Food_Court.jpg/220px-Lunch_%40_Pantip_Plaza_Food_Court.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Highland_Park_Pharmacy_interior_02A.jpg/220px-Highland_Park_Pharmacy_interior_02A.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bar","establishment"],["bar","counter"],["bar","establishment"]],"members":["bar"],"related":["Restaurant","Cafeterias","Catering","Foodservice_distributor","Consumer","Retail","Industry","Restaurant","Pub","Bar_(establishment)","Bar_(counter)","Take-out","Fast_food","Republic_of_Ireland","United_Kingdom","Continental_Europe","Waiter","Waitresses","Fast_food_restaurants","Pub","Bar_(establishment)","United_Kingdom","Silver_service","Bottle_service","Dietary_management","Pizza_delivery","Waiting_staff"]}
