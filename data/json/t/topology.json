A major area of mathematics concerned\nwith the most basic properties of space, such as connectedness, continuity and\nboundary. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous\ndeformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. The\nexact mathematical definition is given below. Topology developed as a field of\nstudy out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as\nspace, dimension, and transformation.\n\nIdeas that are now classified as topological were expressed as early as 1736.\nToward the end of the 19th century, a distinct discipline developed, referred to\nin Latin as the geometria situs (\"geometry of place\") or analysis situs (Greek-\nLatin for \"picking apart of place\"). This later acquired the name topology<!--\nSpecify -->. By the middle of the 20th century, topology had become an important\narea of study within mathematics.\n\nTopology has many subfields. *'[[General topology|Point-set topology]]'\nestablishes the foundational aspects of topology and investigates concepts\ninherent to topological spaces (examples include compactness and connectedness).\n*'[[Algebraic topology]]' tries to measure degrees of connectivity using\nalgebraic constructs such as homology and homotopy groups. *'[[Geometric\ntopology]]' primarily studies manifolds and their embeddings (placements) in\nother manifolds. A particularly active area is '[[low dimensional topology]]',\nwhich studies manifolds of four or fewer dimensions. This includes '[[knot\ntheory]]', the study of mathematical knots.\n\n, the simplest non-trivial knot]]\n\nSee also: topology glossary for definitions of some of the terms used in\ntopology, and topological space for a more technical treatment of the subject.\n",
