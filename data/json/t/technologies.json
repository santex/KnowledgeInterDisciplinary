and , [[wikt:-logia|-\nlogia]]<ref name=\"Liddell 1980\"></ref>) is the making, modification, usage, and\nknowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of\norganization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a\nproblem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a\nspecific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including\nmachinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies\nsignificantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control\nand adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied\ngenerally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology,\nmedical technology, and information technology.\n\nThe human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural\nresources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to\ncontrol fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the\nwheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent\ntechnological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the\nInternet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to\ninteract freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for\npeaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive\npower has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\n\nTechnology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In\nmany societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including\ntoday's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many\ntechnological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and\ndeplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment.\nVarious implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new\ntechnology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the\nnotion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied\nonly to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.\n\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology\nin society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human\ncondition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements\ncriticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it\nharms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as\ntranshumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as\nbeneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was\nbelieved that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings,\nbut recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin\ncommunities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to\nother generations.\n","title":"Technology","headings":["Definition and usage","Science, engineering and
