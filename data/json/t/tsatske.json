Also, stores that sell cheap souvenirs in\ntourist areas like Times Square, Venice Beach, and Waikiki Beach in Hawaii are\nsometimes called \"tchotchke shops\".\n\nLeo Rosten, author of [[The Joys of Yiddish]], gives an alternate sense of\ntchotchke as meaning a desirable young girl, a \"pretty young thing\". Less\nflatteringly, the term could be construed as a more dismissive synonym for\n\"bimbo\". These usages are not common outside of Jewish circles. The term is\nsometimes used in modern Hebrew as a slang word equivalent to [[slut]].\n",
