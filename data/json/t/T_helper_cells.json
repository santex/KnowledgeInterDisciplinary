{"cursor":"29468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'T helper cells' ('T h cells') are a sub-group of lymphocytes, a type\nof white blood cell, that play an important role in the immune system,\nparticularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other\nimmune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. They are essential in B cell\nantibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and\nin maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.\n\nMature T h cells express the surface protein CD4 and are referred to\nas 'CD4 + T cells'. CD4 + T cells are generally treated as\nhaving a pre-defined role as helper T cells within the immune system. For\nexample, when an antigen presenting cell expresses an antigen on MHC class II, a\nCD4 + cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell\ninteractions (e.g. CD40 and CD40L) and through cytokines. Nevertheless, there\nare rare exceptions; for example, sub-groups of regulatory T cells, natural\nkiller T cells, and cytotoxic T cells express CD4 (although cytotoxic examples\nhave been observed in extremely low numbers in specific disease states, they are\nusually considered non-existent). All of the latter CD4 + T cell\ngroups are not considered T helper cells.\n\nThe importance of helper T cells can be seen from HIV, a virus that infects\nCD4 + cells. Towards the end of an HIV infection the number of\nfunctional CD4 + T cells falls, which leads to the symptomatic stage\nof infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are\nalso some rare disorders that result in the absence or dysfunction of\nCD4 + T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, and many of\nthese are fatal.\n","linknr":479,"url":"T_helper_cells","recorded":1362486737,"links":39,"instances":["immunology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["T cells","Human cells"],"headings":["Activation of naïve helper T cells","Determination of the effector T cell response","Role of helper T cells in disease","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Lymphocyte_activation.png/400px-Lymphocyte_activation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cd3","immunology"]],"members":["cd3"],"related":["Lymphocytes","White_blood_cell","Immune_system","B_cell","Antibody_class_switching","Cytotoxic_T_cells","Bactericidal","Phagocytes","Macrophages","CD4","Immune_system","Antigen_presenting_cell","MHC_class_II","CD40","CD40L","Cytokines","Regulatory_T_cell","Natural_killer_T_cell","Cytotoxic_T_cells","HIV","AIDS","Lymphocytopenia","Thymus","Lymph_nodes","Antigen","T_cell_receptor","CD3_receptor","Class_II_MHC","Thymus","Antigen-presenting_cells","Dendritic_cells","Macrophages","B_cells","Follicular_dendritic_cells","Peptides","Endocytosis","Bacteria","Virus","Antigen_processing","Lymph_nodes","T_cell_receptor","CD3_(immunology)","CD4","Intracellular","Kinase","Phosphorylation","CD45","Memory_T_cells","LFA-1","Intercellular_adhesion_molecule","Anergy","Apoptosis","CD28","CD80","CD86","Co-stimulation","Cytotoxic_T_cell","Acquired_immunity","Cell_growth","T_cell_growth_factor","Interleukin_2","Autocrine","Alpha_sub-unit","IL-2_receptor","CD25","Autocrine","Paracrine","Interleukin_4","Interferon_gamma","Cytokine","Interleukin_10","Pleiotropic","Cytokine","Protein","Peptide","Leukocyte","Regulatory_T_cell","Auto-immune_disease","Extracellular","Cytokine","Immunology","Disease","Vaccination","Major_histocompatibility_complex_2","Interferon_γ","Transforming_growth_factor_β","Macrophage","Interleukin_2","Interleukin_4","Macrophage","B-cell","Interferon-γ","TGF-beta","Interleukin-2","Interleukin-10","Interleukin-4","Interleukin-5","Interleukin-6","Interleukin-10","Interleukin-13","Cell-mediated_immunity","Macrophages","CD8","Humoral_immune_system","B-cells","Antibody_class_switching","Antibody","Interferon-gamma","Interleukin-12","Interferon-gamma","Interleukin-4","Interleukin-4","Interleukin-10","Interleukin-2","Interferon-gamma","Interleukin_10","Plasma_cells","Antibody","Regulatory_T_cells","Regulatory_T_cells","TGF_β","T_helper_17_cell","Interleukin_17","Interleukin_9","Helminth","Hypersensitivity","Allergy","Auto-immune_disease","Type_1_hypersensitivity","Asthma","Allergic_rhinitis","Eczema","Urticaria","Anaphylaxis","IgE","Antibody","Corticosteroids","Montelukast","Type_II_hypersensitivity","Type_3_hypersensitivity","Lupus_erythematosus","Type_4_hypersensitivity","Lymphocytes","Macrophages","Inflammation","Cytotoxic_T_cell","Auto-immune_disease","Transplant_rejection","Autoimmunity","Interleukin-2","Natural_killer_cell","Interferon-gamma","Viruses","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Immune_system","Rheumatoid_arthritis","CD4","HIV","Macrophages","Dendritic_cells","Thymus","Bone_marrow","Co-receptor","Antigen","AIDS","Pathogens","Opportunistic_infection","CD8","Antibody_class_switching","IgG","IgA","IgM","Cd4+_T_cells_and_antitumor_Immunity"]}
