remain precisely\nbalanced on its tip because of inertia. Such toys have existed since antiquity.\nTraditionally tops were constructed of wood, sometimes with an iron tip, and\nwould be set in motion by aid of a string or rope coiled around its axis which,\nwhen pulled quickly, caused a rapid unwinding that would set the top in motion.\nToday they are often built of plastic, and modern materials and manufacturing\nprocesses allows tops to be constructed with such precise balance that they can\nbe set in motion by a simple twirl of the wrist without need for string or rope.\n","title":"top","headings":["Characteristics","Notable types","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["1: Toy","1: Spun","1: Inertia","1: Classical_antiquity","1: Wood","1: Iron","1: Twine","1: Rope","1: Plastic","1: Auger","1: Archaeology","1: Gambling","1: Prophecy","1: Role-playing_game","1: Dice","1: Thumbtack","1: Gyroscope","1: Angular_momentum","1: Precession","1: Chico,_California","1: Orlando,_Florida","1: Battling_Tops","1: Beigoma","1: Spin_Fighters","1: Dreidel","1: Gaming_top","1: Levitron","1: Perinola","1: Rattleback","1: Tippe_top","1: Trompo","1: Whipping_top","1: Wizzzer","1: Bauernroulette","1: Gee-haw_whammy_diddle","1: Yo-yo"]}
