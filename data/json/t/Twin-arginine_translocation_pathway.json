In contrast\nto the Sec pathway which transports proteins in an unfolded manner, the Tat\npathway serves to actively translocate folded proteins across a lipid membrane\nbilayer. In plants, the Tat translocase is located in the thylakoid membrane of\nthe chloroplast, where it acts to export proteins into the thylakoid lumen. In\nbacteria, the Tat translocase is found in the cytoplasmic membrane and serves to\nexport proteins to the cell envelope, or to the extracellular space. {{cite journal\n | author = Sargent, F. coauthors = Berks, B.C.; Palmer, T. year = 2006 title =\n | Pathfinders and trailblazers: a prokaryotic targeting system for transport of\n | folded proteins journal = FEMS Microbiol.

In the most widely studied Tat pathway, that of the Gram-negative\nbacterium [[Escherichia coli]], these three proteins are expressed from an\noperon with a fourth Tat protein, TatD, which is not required for Tat function.\nA fifth Tat protein TatE that is homologous to the TatA protein is present at a\nmuch lower level in the cell than TatA and is not believed to play any\nsignificant role in Tat function.\n\nThe Tat pathways of Gram-positive bacteria differ in that they do not have a\nTatB component. In these bacteria the Tat system is made up from a single TatA\nand TatC component, with the TatA protein being bifunctional and fulfilling the\nroles of both E. coli TatA and TatB. {{cite journal\n | author = Barnett, J.P. coauthors = Eijlander, R.T.; Kuipers O.P.; Robinson,\n | C. year = 2008 title = A minimal Tat system from a gram-positive organism: a\n | bifunctional TatA subunit participates in discrete TatAC and TatA complexes\n | journal = Journal Biological Chemistry pmid = 18029357 volume = 283 issue = 5\n | pages = 2534â2542\n }}\n\nThe name of the Tat pathway relates to a highly conserved twin-arginine leader\nmotif (S/TRRXFLK) which is found in the N terminal Signal peptide of the\ncorresponding passenger proteins. {{cite journal\n | author = Chaddock, A.M. coauthors = Mant, A.; Karnauchov, I.; Brink, S.;\n | Herrmann, R.G.; KlÃ¶sgen, R.B.; Robinson, C. year = 1995 title = A new type of\n | signal peptide: central role of a twin-arginine motif in transfer signals for\n | the delta pH-dependent thylakoidal protein translocase. journal = EMBO J.\n | volume = 14 issue = 12 pages = 2715â2722 pmid = 7796800 pmc = 398390\n}} The signal peptide is removed by a signal peptidase after release of\nthe transported protein from the Tat complex. {{cite journal\n | author = Frielingsdorf, S. coauthors = KlÃ¶sgen, R.B. year = 2007 title =\n | Prerequisites for Terminal Processing of Thylakoidal Tat Substrates journal =\n | J.
