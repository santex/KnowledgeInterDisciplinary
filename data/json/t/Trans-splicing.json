This phenomenon can be exploited for molecular\ntherapy to address mutated gene products.\n\nTrans-splicing can be the mechanism behind certain oncogenic fusion\ntranscripts.\n\nTrans-splicing is used by certain microbial organisms, notably protozoa of the\nKinetoplastae class to produce variable surface antigens and change from one\nlife stage to another.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Trans-splicing","recorded":1362374177,"links":16,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Spliceosome","RNA splicing"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["splicing","genetics"]],"members":["splicing"],"related":["Messenger_RNA","Eukaryote","Exon","Ligase","Splicing_(genetics)","Fusion_transcript","Kinetoplastid"]}
