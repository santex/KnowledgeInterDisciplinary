      "text" : "A 'transgene' is a gene or genetic material that has been transferred naturally,\nor by any of a number of genetic engineering techniques from one organism to\nanother. The introduction of a transgene has the potential to change the\nphenotype of an organism.\n\nIn its most precise usage, the term transgene describes a segment of DNA\ncontaining a gene sequence that has been isolated from one organism and is\nintroduced into a different organism. This non-native segment of DNA may retain\nthe ability to produce RNA or protein in the transgenic organism, or it may\nalter the normal function of the transgenic organism's genetic code. In general,\nthe DNA is incorporated into the organism's germ line. For example, in higher\nvertebrates this can be accomplished by injecting the foreign DNA into the\nnucleus of a fertilized ovum. This technique is routinely used to introduce\nhuman disease genes or other genes of interest into strains of laboratory mice\nto study the function or pathology involved with that particular gene.\n\nThe construction of a transgene requires the assembly of a few main parts. The\ntransgene must contain a promoter, which is a regulatory sequence that will\ndetermine where and when the transgene is active, an exon, a protein coding\nsequence, usually derived from the cDNA for the protein of interest, and a stop\nsequence. The way that all these parts are typically combined is in a bacterial\nplasmid and the coding sequences are typically chosen from previous transgenes\nwith previously known function.<ref name=\"renamed_from_1_on_20130507103349\">[ht-\ntp://mgc.wustl.edu/Protocols/TransgeneDesign/tabid/153/Default.aspx], A.
