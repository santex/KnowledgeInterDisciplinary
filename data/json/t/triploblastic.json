{"cursor":"1137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Triploblasty' is a condition of the blastula in which there are three primary\ngerm layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The germ layers form during\ngastrulation of the blastula. Additionally, the term may refer to any ovum in\nwhich the blastoderm splits into three layers.\n\nAll higher and intermediate animals (from flat worms to humans), arise from a\ntriploblastic ovum. Triploblastic organisms are organisms which develop from\nsuch an ovum. Generally speaking, triploblastic organisms belong to the\nBilateria subregnum. Triploblastic organisms generally possess bilateral\nsymmetry, which is where the clade Bilateria takes its name.\n\nSimpler animals qualified as [[diploblasty|diploblastic]], such as cnidaria\n(which include jellyfish, corals and hydra), possess two germ layers. Even\nsimpler animals such as sponges within the formally termed Porifera phylum\ncontain no true tissues.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"triploblastic","recorded":1372154264,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":["See also"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Blastula","Germ_layer","Ectoderm","Mesoderm","Endoderm","Gastrulation","Blastula","Blastoderm","Bilateria","Bilateria","Cnidaria","Sea_sponge","Porifera","Embryo"]}
