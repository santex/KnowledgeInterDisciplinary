This is also\nthe penultimate recording ever made by Perry Como, the last being for a\nChristmas special in 1994. This album is also significant in that it was the\nfirst and only album of Como's career to be released contemporaneously in both\nvinyl LP format and compact disc.\n\nThe song \"Wind Beneath My Wings\", recorded for this album in 1987, two years\nbefore it was a hit for Bette Midler, was meant to be somewhat autobiographical.\nComo also sang this song some 5 years earlier as a tribute to Como's boyhood\nidol, Bing Crosby.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Today_(Perry_Como_album)","recorded":1362584409,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Perry Como albums","1987 albums","Albums produced by Mike Berniker","English-language albums"],"headings":["Track listing","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d6/Perry_Como_Today.jpg/220px-Perry_Como_Today.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Album","Perry_Como","Vocal","RCA_Victor","Mike_Berniker","Nick_Perito","Perry_Como","RCA_Victor","Christmas","Compact_disc","Wind_Beneath_My_Wings","Bette_Midler","Bing_Crosby","Sammy_Cahn","Gerry_Goffin","Burt_Bacharach","Carole_Bayer_Sager","The_Wind_Beneath_My_Wings","My_Heart_Stood_Still","Richard_Rodgers","Lorenz_Hart","You're_Nearer","Richard_Rodgers","Lorenz_Hart","Jerry_Herman"]}
