The\nglacier was first photographed from the air on November 23, 1935, by Lincoln\nEllsworth and mapped from these photos by W.L.G. Joerg. Surveyed in 1949 by the\nFalkland Islands Dependencies Survey, and so named by them because this glacier\nmarks the transition between igneous rocks to the north and sedimentary rocks\nto the south.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Transition_Glacier","recorded":1362581871,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glaciers of Alexander Island"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/AlexanderIsland.png/35px-AlexanderIsland.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Glacier","Alexander_Island","George_VI_Ice_Shelf","George_VI_Sound","Block_Mountain,_Antarctica","Tilt_Rock","Lincoln_Ellsworth","W.L.G._Joerg","Falkland_Islands_Dependencies_Survey","List_of_glaciers_in_the_Antarctic","Balakirev_Glacier","Eros_Glacier","Lennon_Glacier"]}
