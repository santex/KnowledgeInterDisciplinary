For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two\nseparate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD).\nThe BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain\nresponsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.\n","linknr":445,"url":"Two-hybrid_screening","recorded":1362505743,"links":25,"instances":["molecular_biology","biology","molecular_biology","biologist","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.rug.nl/farmacie/onderzoek/basiseenheden/therapeuticgenemodulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/!find?path=/farmacie/onderzoek/basisEenheden/THErapeuticGeneModulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/2005_6.pdf&params=as=pdf","http://www.rug.nl/farmacie/onderzoek/basiseenheden/therapeuticgenemodulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/!find?path=/farmacie/onderzoek/basisEenheden/THErapeuticGeneModulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/2005_6.pdf&params=as=pdf"],"categories":["Cell biology","Molecular biology","Protein-protein interaction assays","Systems biology"],"headings":["History","Basic premise","Fixed domains","Construction of expression plasmids","Recovery of protein information","Controlling sensitivity","Non-fusion proteins","Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid","One-, three- and one-two-hybrid variants","Host organism","Applications","Strengths","Weaknesses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Two_hybrid_assay.svg/400px-Two_hybrid_assay.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Three-hybrid-system.svg/350px-Three-hybrid-system.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["downstream","molecular_biology"],["upstream","molecular_biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["stanley_fields","biologist"],["library","biology"]],"members":["upstream","library","downstream","stanley_fields","transcription"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Protein–protein_interaction","Protein","DNA","Downstream_(molecular_biology)","Reporter_gene","Transcription_factor","Upstream_(molecular_biology)","Protein_domain","DNA-binding_protein","Transcription_(genetics)","Protein-fragment_complementation_assay","Stanley_Fields_(biologist)","Eukaryotic","Genetic_engineering","Biosynthesis","Amino_acid","Nucleic_acid","Plasmid","Library_(biology)","Zif268","CDNA_library","Reverse_transcription","DNA_ligase","Restriction_endonucleases","IPTG","Lac_promoter","Episome","Helper_phage","Primary_structure","Dideoxy_sequencing","3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole","Integral_membrane_protein","Ubiquitin","Transcription_factor","Protease","Reporter_gene","Protein–DNA_interaction","Y187","AH109","Takara_Holdings","Nuclear_localisation_signal","DNA_methyltransferase","Zinc_finger_proteins","Protein_engineering","Coaffinity_purification","Mass_spectrometry","Mammalian","Phosphorylation","Co-immunoprecipitation","Gene_ontology","Network_topologies","Phage_display","Protein_array","Synthetic_genetic_array"]}
