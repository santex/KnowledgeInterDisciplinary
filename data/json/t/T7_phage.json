It infects most strains of [[Escherichia coli]] (including [[Escherichia\ncoli O157:H7|E. coli O157:H7]], a strain of E. coli which can cause foodborne\nillness). Bacteriophage T7 is a DNA virus that has a lytic life cycle. The T7\nbacteriophage has several properties that make it an ideal phage for\nexperimentation.\n","linknr":185,"url":"T7_phage","recorded":1362481867,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.evergreen.edu/phage/docs/TOC_Forward.pdf"],"categories":["Bacteriophages"],"headings":["Discovery","Hosts","Virion structure","Genome","Life cycle","Applications in molecular biology","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bacteriophage","Bacteria","Foodborne_illness","Lipopolysaccharide","Capsid","Spherical","Nanometer","DsDNA","Lysozyme","DNA_polymerase","E._coli","Thioredoxin","DNA_replication","Molecular_biology","T7_RNA_polymerase","Synthetic_biology","Refactored","Restriction_endonuclease","Silent_mutations"]}
