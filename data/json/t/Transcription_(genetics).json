Both RNA and DNA\nare nucleic acids, which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary\nlanguage that can be converted back and forth from DNA to RNA by the action of\nthe correct enzymes. During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA\npolymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand. As opposed\nto DNA replication, transcription results in an RNA complement that includes\nuracil (U) in all instances where thymine (T) would have occurred in a DNA\ncomplement. Also unlike DNA replication where DNA is synthesised, transcription\ndoes not involve an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis.\n\nTranscription proceeds in 5 or 6 steps, each moving like a wave along the DNA.\n#One or more sigma factors initiate transcription of a gene by enabling binding\nof RNA polymerase to promoter DNA. #Helicase enzymes move a transcription\nbubble, like the slider of a zipper, which splits the double helix DNA molecule\ninto two strands of unpaired DNA nucleotides, by breaking the hydrogen bonds\nbetween complementary DNA nucleotides. #RNA polymerase adds matching RNA\nnucleotides that are paired with complementary DNA nucleotides of one DNA\nstrand. #RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms with assistance from RNA polymerase\nto form an RNA strand. #Hydrogen bonds of the untwisted RNA + DNA helix break,\nfreeing the newly synthesized RNA strand. #If the cell has a nucleus, the RNA is\nfurther processed (addition of a 3'UTR poly-A tail and a 5'UTR cap) and exits to\nthe cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex.\n\nTranscription is the first step leading to gene expression. The stretch of DNA\ntranscribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit and encodes at\nleast one gene. If the gene transcribed encodes a protein, the result of\ntranscription is messenger RNA (mRNA), which will then be used to create that\nprotein via the process of translation. Alternatively, the transcribed gene may\nencode for either non-coding RNA genes (such as microRNA, lincRNA, etc.) or\nribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), other components of the protein-\nassembly process, or other ribozymes.

ISBN 978-0-495-30978-8\n\nA DNA transcription unit encoding for a protein contains not only the sequence\nthat will eventually be directly translated into the protein (the coding\nsequence) but also regulatory sequences that direct and regulate the synthesis\nof that protein. The regulatory sequence before (i.e., upstream from) the coding\nsequence is called the five prime untranslated region (5'UTR), and the sequence\nfollowing (downstream from) the coding sequence is called the three prime\nuntranslated region (3'UTR).\n\nTranscription has some proofreading mechanisms, but they are fewer and less\neffective than the controls for copying DNA; therefore, transcription has a\nlower copying fidelity than DNA replication. \n\nAs in DNA replication, DNA is read from 3'UTR â 5'UTR during transcription.\nMeanwhile, the complementary RNA is created from the 5'UTR â 3'UTR direction.\nThis means its 5' end is created first in base pairing. Although DNA is arranged\nas two antiparallel strands in a double helix, only one of the two DNA strands,\ncalled the template strand, is used for transcription. This is because RNA is\nonly single-stranded, as opposed to double-stranded DNA. The other DNA strand is\ncalled the coding (lagging) strand, because its sequence is the same as the\nnewly created RNA transcript (except for the substitution of uracil for\nthymine). The use of only the 3'UTR â 5'UTR strand eliminates the need for the\nOkazaki fragments seen in DNA replication.\n\nTranscription is divided into five stages: pre-initiation, initiation, promoter\nclearance, elongation and termination.\n","linknr":532,"url":"Transcription_(genetics)","recorded":1362509243,"links":65,"instances":["genetics","dna","biochemistry","molecular_biology","molecular_biology","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Major steps","Measuring and detecting transcription","Transcription factories","History","Reverse transcription","Inhibitors","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/MRNA.svg/400px-MRNA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Simple_transcription_initiation1.svg/400px-Simple_transcription_initiation1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Simple_transcription_elongation1.svg/400px-Simple_transcription_elongation1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Transcription_label_en.jpg/220px-Transcription_label_en.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/RetroTranscription.jpg/300px-RetroTranscription.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["antiparallel","biochemistry"],["primer","molecular_biology"],["promoter","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["upstream_and_downstream","dna"],["promoter","biology"],["activator","genetics"],["promoter","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"]],"members":["splicing","upstream_and_downstream","antiparallel","complementarity","primer","activator","promoter","translation"],"related":["Gene_expression","DNA","RNA","Enzyme","RNA_polymerase","Nucleic_acid","Base_pair","Nucleotide","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Enzyme","RNA_polymerase","Antiparallel_(biochemistry)","DNA_replication","Uracil","Thymine","DNA_replication","Primer_(molecular_biology)","Sigma_factor","Promoter_(genetics)","Helicase","Zipper","Cell_nucleus","Nuclear_pore","Gene_expression","Gene","Protein","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(genetics)","Non-coding_RNA","MicroRNA","LincRNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Ribozyme","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Five_prime_untranslated_region","Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)","Three_prime_untranslated_region","Double_helix","Okazaki_fragment","RNA_polymerase","Promoter_(biology)","Transcription_factor","TATA_box","TATA-binding_protein","Transcription_Factor_II_D","Transcription_preinitiation_complex","Transcription_factor_II_H","Helicase","Activator_(genetics)","Repressor","Coactivator","Coactivator","Archaea","Transcription_factor_II_B","Bacteria","Core_enzyme","Sigma_factor","Promoter_(genetics)","Transcription_factor","Energy","Adenosine_triphosphate","Thymine","Uracil","Rho-independent_transcription_termination","Hairpin_loop","Rho_factor","Polyadenylation","MRNA","Nuclear_run-on","RNase_protection_assay","ChIP-Chip","RNAP","T7_RNA_polymerase","RT-PCR","DNA_microarrays","In_situ_hybridization","MS2_tagging","Stem-loop_","Transcriptional_bursting","Northern_blot","RNA-Seq","RNA-Seq","Transcription_factories","Euchromatin","HeLa_cell","François_Jacob","Jacques_Monod","Severo_Ochoa","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Roger_D._Kornberg","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Viruses","HIV","AIDS","Reverse_transcriptase","Complementary_DNA","Integrase","Apoptosis","T_cell","Telomerase","Antibiotic","Pathogenic_bacteria","Antibacterial","Fungus","Antifungal_medication","Rifampicin","Prokaryotic_transcription","RNA_polymerase","8-Hydroxyquinoline","Eukaryotic_transcription","Prokaryotic_transcription","RNA_Polymerase","Translation_(genetics)","Polypeptide","Splicing_(genetics)","Intron","Pre-mRNA","MRNA","Reverse_transcription","Virus","Crick's_central_dogma","Gene_regulation"]}
