This is usually done in cases where a target device (or\nworkflow) does not support the format or has limited storage capacity that\nmandates a reduced file size, or to convert incompatible or\nobsolete data to a better-supported or modern format. Transcoding can be\nperformed just while files are being searched, as well as for presentation. For\nexample, Cineon and DPX files have been widely used as a common format for\ndigital cinema, but the data size of a two-hour movie is about 8 terabytes\n(TB). That large size can increase the cost and difficulty of\nhandling movie files. However, transcoding into a JPEG2000 lossless format has\nbetter compression performance than other lossless coding technologies, and in\nmany cases, JPEG2000 can compress images to half-size.\n\nTranscoding is commonly a lossy process, introducing generation loss; however,\ntranscoding can be lossless if the input is losslessly compressed and the output\nis either losslessly compressed or uncompressed. The process of\nlossy-to-lossy transcoding introduces varying degrees of generation loss. In\nother cases, the transcoding of lossy to lossless or uncompressed is technically\na lossless conversion because no information is lost, however the process is\nirreversible and is more suitably known as destructive.\n\nIn contrast to a conversion, the prefix \"trans\" emphasizes a conversion from a\nsource to a different destination.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Transcoding","recorded":1362669846,"links":19,"instances":["codec"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Video conversion software","Audio format converters|","Film and video technology"],"headings":["Process","Re-encoding/recoding","Drawbacks","Usage","Notes","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tta","codec"]],"members":["tta"],"related":["Encoder","Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers","Movie","Workflow","Cineon","DPX","Digital_cinema","Terabytes","JPEG2000","Lossy_compression","Generation_loss","Lossless_compression","Generation_loss","Pulse-code_modulation","YUV","Image_editing","JPEG","Digital_generation_loss","Sample_rate_conversion","DVD","Video_CD","Image_scaling","Downsampling","Bitrate_peeling","Vorbis","Compression_artifact","Digital_generation_loss","Digital_audio_editing","FLAC","Apple_Lossless","TTA_(codec)","WavPack","Pulse-code_modulation","WAV","Audio_Interchange_File_Format","Meta_data","Image_editing","Raw_image_format","Video_editing","File_size","Mobile_phone","Mobile_device","Multimedia_Messaging_Service","Pixels","Home_theatre_PC","Disk_space","MPEG-2","MPEG-4","H.264","Federal_Standard_1037C","MIL-STD-188","List_of_Portable_Multimedia_Software","Data_conversion","Lossy_data_conversion","Data_transformation","Type_conversion","Video_coding","Comparison_of_video_converters"]}
