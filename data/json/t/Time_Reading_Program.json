{"cursor":"5081","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Time Reading Program' ('TRP'), was a book sales club run by TimeâLife, the\npublisher of [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]], from 1962 through 1966. Time was\nknown for its magazines, and nonfiction book series' published under the Time-\nLife imprint, while the TRP books were reprints of an eclectic set of\nliterature, both classic and contemporary, as well as nonfiction works and\ntopics in history. The books were chosen by National Book Award judge Max\nGissen, the chief book reviewer for Time from 1947 until the TRP began in 1962.\n\nThe books themselves were published by Time Inc. and followed a specific format\nacross their widely varying subject matter. The editions were trade paperbacks,\nwith covers constructed of very stiff plastic coated paper, for durability. The\nbooks were eight inches tall, just under than an inch taller than a standard mass-\nmarket or \"rack\" paperback. Each book had a wraparound cover with a continuous\npiece of artwork across both covers and the spine, generally a painting by a\ncontemporary artist, commissioned specifically for the TRP edition. The TRP\ncovers attracted a measure of acclaim at the time. According to Time, 19 TRP\ncovers were cited in 1964 for awards from The American Institute of Graphic\nArts, [[Commercial Art Magazine]] and the Society of Illustrators guild.\nTypography and other printing credits were given in a colophon on the end pages,\nin the manner of sophisticated publishing houses like Alfred A. Knopf. The\nWilliam Addison Dwiggins typeface Caledonia was typically used. The logo for the\nseries was in format of a monogram,\n'\" RT P\"', enclosed in a rounded slightly\nrectangular box.\n\nWhile not, strictly speaking, original publications, most of the TRP books had\nunique introductions written by various scholars specifically for the TRP\nedition. In a few cases, the texts had also been revised by the authors to\ncreate a definitive edition, and did not constitute abridgement.\n\nSubscribers to the TRP typically received four books a month, though some books\narrived as multi-volume sets. Included with shipments was a small newsletter\ndescribing the books and why they were chosen.\n\nTime revived the program in the early 1980s, with many of the same titles.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Time_Reading_Program","recorded":1362540367,"links":10,"instances":["typeface","publishing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct book publishing companies of the United States","Time (magazine)","Direct marketing","Publishing companies established in 1962","Series of books","Book clubs"],"headings":["Series bibliography<ref>[http://neglectedbooks.com/?page_id=84]</ref><ref>[http://www.volumelists.com/detail.php?ser=Time%20Reading%20Program]</ref>","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colophon","publishing"],["caledonia","typeface"]],"members":["caledonia","colophon"],"related":["Book_sales_club","Time–Life","National_Book_Award","Max_Gissen","Time_Inc.","Trade_paperback","American_Institute_of_Graphic_Arts","Society_of_Illustrators","Colophon_(publishing)","Alfred_A._Knopf","William_Addison_Dwiggins","Caledonia_(typeface)","Monogram","D._W._Brogan","Graham_Greene","Margaret_Leech","Robert_L._Heilbroner","Joyce_Cary","V.S._Pritchett","James_Spanfeller","Konrad_Lorenz","Julian_Huxley","Cecil_Woodham-Smith","Gordon_A._Craig","The_Crime_of_Galileo","Giorgio_de_Santillana","The_Ox-Bow_Incident","Walter_Van_Tilburg_Clark","Isaiah_Berlin","Robert_Heilbroner","Ray_Bradbury","Fred_Hoyle","John_P._Marquand","B._Traven","J._Christopher_Herold","Carlo_Levi","Pierre_Boulle","Xan_Fielding","Robert_Graves","Laurie_Lee","John_Stanton_Ward","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Robert_Cushman_Murphy","Walter_Kerr","Phyllis_McGinley","John_P._Marquand","Edward_Weeks","Franklin_Russell","Robert_W._Arnold","Gerald_Durrell"]}
