{"cursor":"21874","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'teleology' is any philosophical account that holds that final causes exist in\nnature, meaning that design and purpose analogous to that found in human actions\nare inherent also in the rest of nature. The adjective \"teleological\" has a\nbroader usage, for example in discussions where particular ethical theories or\ntypes of computer programs are sometimes described as teleological because they\ninvolve aiming at goals.\n\nTeleology was explored by Plato and Aristotle, by Saint Anselm during the 11th\ncentury AD, and later by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment. It was\nfundamental to the speculative philosophy of Hegel.\n\nA thing, process, or action is teleological when it is for the sake of an end,\ni.e., a telos or final cause. In general, it may be said that there are two\ntypes of final causes, which may be called intrinsic finality and extrinsic\nfinality. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14474a.htm and\nhttp://www.texttribe.com/routledge/T/Teleology.html\n\n*A thing or action has an extrinsic finality when it is for the sake of\nsomething external to itself. In a way, people exhibit extrinsic finality when\nthey seek the happiness of a child. If the external thing had not existed that\naction would not display finality.\n\n*A thing or action has an intrinsic finality when it is for none other than its\nown sake. For example, one might try to be happy simply for the sake of being\nhappy, and not for the sake of anything outside of that.\n\nSince the [[Novum Organum]] of Francis Bacon teleological explanations in\nscience tend to be deliberately avoided because whether they are true or false\nis argued to be beyond the ability of human perception and understanding to\njudge. \"The received intellectual tradition has it that, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, revolutionary philosophers began to\ncurtail and reject the teleology of the medieval and scholastic Aristotelians,\nabandoning final causes in favor of a purely mechanistic model of the Universe.\"\npages 23-24. Some disciplines, in particular within evolutionary biology,\nare still prone to use language that appears teleological when they describe\nnatural tendencies towards certain end conditions; but these arguments can\nalmost always be rephrased in non-teleological forms.\n","linknr":480,"url":"Teleology","recorded":1362485215,"links":58,"instances":["corporate","philosophy","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Teleology|","Metaphysical theories","Historiography","Causality"],"headings":["Classical teleology","Modern and postmodern philosophy","Teleology and ethics","Teleology and science","Etymology","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","philosophy"],["stakeholder","corporate"],["naturalism","philosophy"]],"members":["stakeholder","naturalism","nature"],"related":["Philosophy","Final_cause","Nature_(philosophy)","Plato","Aristotle","Anselm_of_Canterbury","Immanuel_Kant","Critique_of_Judgment","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Four_causes","Intrinsic_finality","Extrinsic_finality","Extrinsic_finality","Intrinsic_finality","Francis_Bacon","Plato","Aristotle","Democritus","Platonic_form","Democritus","Lucretius","Accidentalism","Aristotelianism","Immanuel_Kant","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Charles_Darwin","Dialectical_materialism","Karl_Marx","Friedrich_Engels","Analytic_philosophy","Hegelianism","Consciousness","Second_World_War","Grand_narrative","Postmodern","Jean-François_Lyotard","Alasdair_MacIntyre","Ethic","Management_by_objectives","Stakeholder_(corporate)","Utilitarianism","Utilitarian","John_Stuart_Mill","Deontological_ethics","Immanuel_Kant","Categorical_Imperative","Evolutionary_biology","Watchmaker_analogy","Richard_Dawkins","James_G._Lennox","James_G._Lennox","Francisco_J._Ayala","Francisco_J._Ayala","Karen_Neander","Karen_Neander","Ernst_Mayr","Ernst_Mayr","Julian_Bigelow","Arturo_Rosenblueth","Norbert_Wiener","Feedback","Cybernetics","Communication","Control_theory","Autonomy","Teleonomy","Greek_language","Anthropic_principle","Causality","The_chicken_or_the_egg","Cybernetics","Destiny","Dysteleology","Elohim","Ed_Ricketts","Efficient_cause","Final_cause","Emergence","Four_Causes","Moirai","Naturalism_(philosophy)","Orthogenesis","Rationalism","Telesis","Teleological_argument","Teleological_behaviorism","Arturo_Rosenblueth","Norbert_Wiener","Julian_Bigelow","Allan_Gotthelf","Georg_Lukács","Max_Horkheimer","Theodor_Adorno","Herbert_Marcuse"]}
