It is a constitutive equation which provides a\nmathematical relationship between two or more state functions associated with\nthe matter, such as its temperature, pressure, volume, or internal energy.\nEquations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures\nof fluids, solids, and even the interior of stars.\n",
