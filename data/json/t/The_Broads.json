The Broads, and some surrounding land, were\nconstituted as a special area with a level of protection similar to a National\nPark by The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act of 1988. The Broads Authority, a\nSpecial Statutory Authority responsible for managing the area, became\noperational in 1989. The Broads Authority. [http://www.broads-authority.gov.uk/authority/about-us/the-broads-\nact.html The Broads Act]. Retrieved 23 January 2006.\n\nThe total area is , most of which is in Norfolk, with over of navigable\nwaterways. There are seven rivers and 63 broads, mostly less than deep. Thirteen\nbroads are generally open to navigation, with a further three having navigable\nchannels. Some broads have navigation restrictions imposed on them in autumn and\nwinter. Living Lakes Partnership (1998â2005).\n[http://www.livinglakes.org/broads/ The Broads, England]. Retrieved 23 January\n2006.\n\nAlthough the terms 'Norfolk Broads' and 'Suffolk Broads' are used to identify\nspecific areas within the two counties respectively, the whole area is\nfrequently mistakenly referred to as the \"Norfolk Broads\". The Broads has the\nsame status as the national parks in England and Wales; the Broads Authority\nhas powers and duties almost identical to the national parks, but is also the\nthird-largest inland navigation authority. Because of its navigation role the\nBroads Authority was established under its own legislation on 1 April 1989.\nMore recently the Authority wanted to change the name of the area to The\nBroads National Park in recognition of the fact that the status of the area is\nequivalent to the rest of the national park family, but was unable to get\nagreement from all the different parties. The Broads Authority Act 2009, which\nwas promoted through Parliament by the Authority, improves public safety on\nthe
