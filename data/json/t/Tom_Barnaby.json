DCI Barnaby is featured in the Chief\nInspector Barnaby book series which began with The Killing at Badger's Drift in\n1987. Barnaby is also the main detective in [[Midsomer Murders]], a popular\ntelevision show based on the novels. There, Barnaby is played by John Nettles.\n\nIn both the books and the television series, Detective Chief Inspector Tom\nBarnaby is based in the fictional town of Causton in the southeast of England.\nFrom that base of operations, Barnaby travels out into the English countryside\nto solve murders as they occur in a variety of small villages. A genius in the\nfield of criminal investigation, he is a highly experienced and methodical\ndetective; prone to taking his time. However, despite his slow and steady\nnature, he is an extremely perceptive and sagacious individual, detecting even\nthe smallest of clues, which ultimately aid him in solving the gruesome and\nbarbarous crimes which are committed in the county of Midsomer. It is worthy of\nnote that in many cases, he has already reached a conclusion as to the identity\nof the murderer; only to reveal this fact later on after he has accumulated\nenough evidence.\n\nBarnaby has been happily married to Joyce for many years, and they have an adult\ndaughter named Cully. They may have lived or worked in London at one point, as\naround the time of their wedding Barnaby was trying to solve the case of the\n'Pimlico Poisoner'.\n\nIn the episode \"Picture of Innocence\" of the British drama Midsomer Murders, his\nfull name was revealed as was his date of birth, 20 April 1943.\n\nIn the episode \"Secrets and Spies\", Barnaby revealed to his wife and colleagues\nthat he previously worked for MI6.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Tom_Barnaby","recorded":1364050871,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Midsomer_Murders","/wiki/John_Nettles","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Detective_Chief_Inspector","/wiki/Retirement","/wiki/Detective_Chief_Inspector","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Midsomer_Murders","/wiki/John_Nettles","/wiki/Genius","/wiki/Murderer","/wiki/Pimlico","/wiki/Poison","/wiki/List_of_Midsomer_Murders_episodes","/wiki/Midsomer_Murders","/wiki/List_of_Midsomer_Murders_episodes","/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/The_Killings_at_Badger%27s_Drift","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Death_of_a_Hollow_Man","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Death_in_Disguise","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Written_in_Blood_(novel)","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/Faithful_unto_Death","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/A_Place_of_Safety","/wiki/Caroline_Graham","/wiki/A_Ghost_in_the_Machine","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Midsomer_Murders","/wiki/List_of_Midsomer_Murders_episodes","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&oldid=546439925","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Fictional_British_police_detectives","/wiki/Category:Inspector_Barnaby_series","/wiki/Category:Midsomer_Murders","/wiki/Category:Series_of_books","/wiki/Category:Fictional_characters_introduced_in_1987","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tom+Barnaby&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tom+Barnaby","/wiki/Tom_Barnaby","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Tom_Barnaby&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Tom_Barnaby","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tom_Barnaby","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tom_Barnaby","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&oldid=546439925","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Tom_Barnaby&id=546439925","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Tom+Barnaby","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Tom+Barnaby&oldid=546439925&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Tom_Barnaby&printable=yes","//sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Barnaby","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Tom
