When used in broadcast facilities to\nenable the airing of telephone callers, the broadcast-quality telephone hybrid\nis known as a 'broadcast telephone hybrid' or 'telephone balance unit'.\n\nThe need for hybrids comes from the nature of analog plain old telephone service\nhome or small business telephone lines, where the two audio directions are\ncombined on a single two-wire pair. Within the telephone network, switching and\ntransmission are almost always four-wire circuits with the two signals being\nseparated. Hybrids perform the necessary conversion. In older analog networks,\nconversion to four-wire was required so that repeater amplifiers could be\ninserted in long-distance links. In todayâs digital systems, each speech\ndirection must be processed and transported independently.\n\nThe line cards in a telephone central office switch that are interfaced to\nanalog lines include hybrids that adapt the four-wire network to the two-wire\ncircuits that connect most subscribers.\n\nThe search for better telephone hybrids and echo cancelers (a related\ntechnology) was an important motive for the development of DSP (digital signal\nprocessing) algorithms and hardware at Bell Labs, NEC, and other sites.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Telephone_hybrid","recorded":1362543121,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Broadcast engineering","Telephony equipment"],"headings":["Technology","Broadcast telephone hybrids","Related equipment","Notes","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Public_switched_telephone_network","Plain_old_telephone_service","Four-wire_circuit","Line_card","Echo_cancellation","Digital_signal_processing","Bell_Labs","NEC","Impedance_matching","Hybrid_coil","ITU-T","Least_mean_squares_filter","Echo_canceller","Echo_suppressor","VoIP","Private_branch_exchange","Pars_pro_toto","Acoustic_echo_cancellation","Audio_feedback","ISDN","VoIP","AES3","XLR_connector","DTMF","Caller_ID","Mix-minus","Radio_producer","POTS_codec","Remote_broadcast","Audio_data_compression","MP3","Advanced_Audio_Coding","Autopatch","Amateur_Radio","Adaptive_feedback_cancellation","Remote_pickup_unit"]}
