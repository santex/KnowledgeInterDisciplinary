In each of these, the UK's official\nname is as follows:\n* ;\n* ;\n* ; ** Ulster-Scots: {{lang|sco-UKN|Claught KÃ¤ngrick o Docht BrÃ¤tain an Norlin\n  Airlann}} or {{lang|sco-UKN|Unitet KÃ¤ngdom o Great Brittain an Norlin\n  Airlann}};\n* ;\n*  commonly known as the 'United Kingdom' ('UK') and 'Britain', is a\n  sovereign state located off the north-western coast of continental Europe.\n  The country includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of\n  the island of Ireland and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only\n  part of the UK that shares a land border with another stateâthe Republic of\n  Ireland. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that\n  shares a land border with another sovereign state, providing the dependencies\n  of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia are excluded. Gibraltar shares a\n  border with Spain, whereas Akrotiri and Dhekelia share borders with the\n  Republic of Cyprus, with Dhekelia also sharing borders with the\n  internationally unrecognised Turkish-administered Republic of Northern Cyprus\n  and the UN buffer zone separating the two Cypriot polities. Apart from\n  this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean in the west and\n  north, the North Sea in the east, the English Channel in the south and the\n  Irish Sea in the west.\n\nThe form of government is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.\nThe capital city is London. It consists of four countries: England, Scotland,\nWales and Northern Ireland. The latter three have\ndevolved administrations, each with varying powers, based\nin their capital cities, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast respectively. Guernsey,\nJersey and the Isle of Man are Crown dependencies and are not part of the\nUK. The United Kingdom has fourteen British Overseas\nTerritories. These are remnants of the British Empire which, at its\nheight in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, encompassed almost a quarter\nof the world's land surface and was the largest empire in history. British\ninfluence can still be observed in the prevalence of language, culture and legal\nsystems in many of its former colonies.\n\nThe UK is a developed country and has the world's seventh-largest economy by\nnominal GDP and eighth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It was the\nworld's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power\nduring the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK is\nstill referred to as a great power and retains considerable economic, cultural,\nmilitary, scientific and political influence\ninternationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state\nand its military expenditure ranks fourth in the world.\n\nThe UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since\nits first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union and its\npredecessor the European Economic Community since 1973. It is also a member of\nthe Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20,\nNATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the\nWorld Trade Organization.\n","linknr":4961,"url":"The_United_Kingdom","recorded":1362486258,"links":404,"instances":["united_kingdom","civil","uk","british_decimal_coin","1997_film","temporary_provisions_act_1972","historical","politician","sport","united_kingdom","united_kingdom_census","united_kingdom","newspaper_format","london","united_nations","arts","band","band","united_kingdom_census","rugby_union","ireland","artist","composer","2012","literature","r08","playwright","r09","financial_markets","composer","author","british_decimal_coin","composer","northern_ireland","band","geology","train_operating_company","airline","england","law","united_kingdom","artist","1800","government","ppp","director","world_war_i","legal_system","northern_ireland","singer","tennis","uk","artist","uk","british_political_party","united_kingdom_ethnicity_category"],"pdf":["http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/union_exhibition.pdf","http://vig.pearsoned.co.uk/catalog/uploads/Griffiths_C01.pdf","http://vig.pearsoned.co.uk/catalog/uploads/Griffiths_C01.pdf","http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/9th-uncsgn-docs/report%20of%209th%20uncsgn%20n0750902%20en.pdf","http://www.psa.ac.uk/2007/pps/Bennie.pdf","http://www.psa.ac.uk/2007/pps/Bennie.pdf","http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/about/moj/our-responsibilities/Background_Briefing_on_the_Crown_Dependencies2.pdf","http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf","http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/insights/pdfs/2008/MCWW_WCoC-Report_2008.pdf","http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/insights/pdfs/2008/MCWW_WCoC-Report_2008.pdf","http://www.world-tourism.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/2005_eng_high.pdf","http://www.asd-europe.org/site/fileadmin/user_upload/publications/ASD_Facts_And_Figures_2009.pdf","http://www.asd-europe.org/site/fileadmin/user_upload/publications/ASD_Facts_And_Figures_2009.pdf","http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_113133.pdf","http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_113133.pdf","http://www.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/foodfarm/general/auk/latest/documents/AUK-2009.pdf","http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/Influencing_Policy/Reports/2011-03-28-Knowledge-networks-nations.pdf","http://www.aci.aero/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/2008/TOP30_International%20Passengers_2007.pdf","http://www.aci.aero/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/2008/TOP30_International%20Passengers_2007.pdf","http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/tsgb/latest/tsgb2010vehicles.pdf","http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/tsgb/latest/tsgb2010vehicles.pdf","http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/201009/Table_01_Size_of_UK_Airports.pdf","http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/80/airport_data/201009/Table_01_Size_of_UK_Airports.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090104054403/http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//860AD/Response%20to%20Energy%20Review%20-%20Appendix%202.pdf","http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//860AD/Response%20to%20Energy%20Review%20-%20Appendix%202.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090104054403/http://www.coal.gov.uk/media//860AD/Response%20to%20Energy%20Review%20-%20Appendix%202.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_292378.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_292378.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/mid-2010-population-estimates/annual-mid-year-population-estimates--2010.pdf","http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/mid-2010-population-estimates/annual-mid-year-population-estimates--2010.pdf","http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/population-estimates/special-area/settlements-localities2010/2010-settlements-table2.pdf","http://www.nisra.gov.uk/archive/demography/publications/urban_rural/ur_gaz.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fow/WelshLanguage.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fow/WelshLanguage.pdf","http://www.brin.ac.uk/commentary/documents/development-of-religious-statistics.pdf","http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/new_europeans.pdf","http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/new_europeans.pdf","http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf","http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf","http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf","http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/4/38980557.pdf","http://www.britishpoliticssociety.no/British%20Politics%20Review%2001_2011.pdf","http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/cmr/753567/CMR_2010_FINAL.pdf","http://www.rrbltd.co.u
