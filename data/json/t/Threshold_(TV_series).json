Goyer and David\nHeyman, the series focuses on a secret government project investigating the\nfirst contact with an extraterrestrial species.\n\nThe series was first shown on Friday nights, but was moved to Tuesday in an\neffort to boost ratings. This plan backfired, with the show registering a\nsharp drop in its ratings on its first Tuesday night showing on November 22,\n2005, and CBS canceled the series on November 23,\n2005, [http://www.trektoday.com/news/241105_03.shtml \"CBS Cancels\nBraga's 'Threshold'\"; trektoday.com; November 24, 2005] with four\nepisodes left unaired.\n\nThe remaining episodes were aired on Sky1, a channel in the United Kingdom owned\nby Sky, who co-produced the series with CBS.
