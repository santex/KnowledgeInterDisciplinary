In January 2007, the band's song \"She Thinks I'm Famous\"\nwas a finalist in the Radiostar Songwriting Contest sponsored by Mix 99.9. Shortly after forming, the band received press in\nhigh profile publications, including Metro Daily and InsideE Magazine. The\nFramework headlined both Canadian Music Week and NXNE in Toronto in 2008 and\nwere named one of five top acts by InsideE Magazine.\n\nThe band's lineup consists of Ryan Isojima (vocals/guitar), Chris Graham\n(vocals/guitar/programming), Rayanne Lepieszo (synths), Scott Winter (bass) and\nJon Fedorsen (drums).\n\nThe Framework's live show has garnered attention for being energetic\nand enthralling.  Live, lead singer Isojima has been described as a\ncombination of frenetic dance moves, unparalleled charisma, inspired\nswagger, charm, stage presence and\nmagnetism. Singing lead on some songs, Graham has been described as\nbeing equally compelling but with a wholly differential energy, endearingly\ncoy.\n\nTo date the band has released two EPs, 2007's The Framework and 2008's The\nFramework Reworked, as well as their full length debut album in 2009 titled\nBefore Tonight, distributed by Last Gang Labels. The Framework has worked with\nhigh profile remixers The RAC and vitaminsforyou. Both the band's debut EP and\ndebut full-length album were self-produced by Chris Graham and Ryan Isojima and\nrecorded, mixed and mastered by Graham at a combination of rehearsal spaces and\nGraham's home studios.\n\nThe Framework's sound has been described as hooky, synth-heavy rock & roll, like\npacked club, sweaty college kids freaking the tight-pantsed funk type\nrock, containing melodic hooks, infectious guitar riffs, killer\nvocals and stadium-worthy instrumentation, as well as being incredibly catchy, but not annoying, hard\nrocking but still fun.\n","linknr":309,"url":"The_Framework","recorded":1362559203,"links":17,"instances":["rac"],"pdf":["http://www.sublimemediaworks.com/the_framework/theframework.pdf","http://www.sublimemediaworks.com/the_framework/theframework.pdf","http://www.yourwebperson.com/lornett/040909bLornettPR.pdf","http://www.yourwebperson.com/lornett/040909bLornettPR.pdf"],"categories":["Musical groups established in 2006","Canadian alternative rock groups","Canadian indie rock groups","Canadian New Wave musical groups","Musical groups from Toronto"],"headings":["History","Discography","Videos","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Atpol_framework11.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/Tower-wireless-can.png/24px-Tower-wireless-can.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_remix_artist_collective","rac"],["the_remix_artist_collective","rac"]],"members":["the_remix_artist_collective"],"related":["Toronto","Ontario","Canada","Indie_Rock","Alternative_rock","New_Wave_music","Last_Gang","Toronto","Ontario","CKFM-FM","Canadian_Music_Week","NXNE","The_Remix_Artist_Collective_(RAC)","Vitaminsforyou","Emm_Gryner","The_Remix_Artist_Collective_(RAC)","Vitaminsforyou","Atomic_Tom","CIUT","CFBX","CJSW","Last_Gang_Records","Music_of_Canada","Canadian_rock","List_of_Canadian_musicians","List_of_bands_from_Canada"]}
