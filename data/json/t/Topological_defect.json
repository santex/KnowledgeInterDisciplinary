{"cursor":"10466","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":": Also see [[topological excitations]] and the base concepts: [[topology]],\n: [[differential equation]]s, [[quantum mechanics]] & [[condensed matter]]\n: physics.\nIn mathematics and physics, a 'topological soliton' or a 'topological defect' is\na solution of a system of partial differential equations or of a quantum field\ntheory homotopically distinct from the vacuum solution; it can be proven to\nexist because the boundary conditions entail the existence of homotopically\ndistinct solutions. Typically, this occurs because the boundary on which the\nboundary conditions are specified has a non-trivial homotopy group which is\npreserved in differential equations; the solutions to the differential equations\nare then topologically distinct, and are classified by their homotopy class.\nTopological defects are not only stable against small s, but cannot decay or be\nundone or be de-tangled, precisely because there is no continuous transformation\nthat will map them (homotopically) to a uniform or \"trivial\" solution.\n\nExamples include the soliton or solitary wave which occurs in many exactly\nsolvable models, the screw dislocations in crystalline materials, the skyrmion\nand the WessâZuminoâWitten model in quantum field theory.\n\nTopological defects are believed to drive phase transitions in condensed matter\nphysics. Notable examples of topological defects are observed in Lambda\ntransition universality class systems including: screw/edge-dislocations in\nliquid crystals, magnetic flux tubes in superconductors, vortices in\nsuperfluids.\n","linknr":221,"url":"Topological_defect","recorded":1362563151,"links":18,"instances":["string_theory","cosmology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solitons|","Large-scale structure of the cosmos","Cosmic inflation"],"headings":["Cosmology","Condensed matter","Images","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Biaxial.png/180px-Biaxial.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/DoubleWellSoliton.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/0/2b04d73ab6ae570a0d70455af5ffa70b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/DoubleWellSolitonAntisoliton.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain_wall","string_theory"],["texture","cosmology"],["domain_wall","string_theory"],["texture","cosmology"]],"members":["domain_wall","texture"],"related":["Mathematics","Physics","Partial_differential_equation","Quantum_field_theory","Vacuum_solution","Boundary_conditions","Homotopy","Homotopy_group","Differential_equation","Homotopy_class","Soliton","Solitary_wave","Exactly_solvable_model","Skyrmion","Wess–Zumino–Witten_model","Phase_transition","Condensed_matter","Lambda_transition","Liquid_crystals","Magnetic_flux_tube","Superconductors","Superfluids","Grand_unified_theories","Universe","Big_Bang","Physical_cosmology","Phase_transition","Symmetry_breakdown","Soliton","Higgs–Kibble_mechanism","Magnetic_monopole","Cosmic_string","Domain_wall_(string_theory)","Skyrmion","Texture_(cosmology)","Speed_of_light","Domain_wall_(string_theory)","Foam","Cosmic_string","Magnetic_monopole","Magnetic_monopole","Extra-dimension","Dimensions","Cosmic_string","Large-scale_structure_of_the_cosmos","WMAP_cold_spot","Cosmic_microwave_background","Texture_(cosmology)","Homotopy_groups","Superfluid","Helium","Fundamental_group","Lie_group","Universal_cover","Homotopy_group","Conjugacy_class","Quantum_vortex","Dislocation","Vector_soliton","Quantum_topology","Topological_entropy_in_physics","Topological_order","Topological_quantum_field_theory","Topological_quantum_number","Topological_string_theory"]}
