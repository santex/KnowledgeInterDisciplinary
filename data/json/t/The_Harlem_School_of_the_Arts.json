{"cursor":"2878","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'The Harlem School of the Arts' (HSA) in Harlem, New York was founded in 1964 by\nsoprano Dorothy Maynor, and offers its programs to students of all ages. Mezzo-\nsoprano Betty Allen succeeded Maynor as President in 1979 when a new 37,000\nsquare foot facility designed by Ulrich Franzen was completed. Other Presidents\ninclude Allicia Adams, Camille Akjeu, and Daryl Durham. In January 2012, new\nPresident and CEO, Yvette L. Campbell, was named.\n\nAccording to its website, the mission of the Harlem School of the Arts is \"to\nenrich the lives of children and their families in the Harlem community and\nbeyond, through exposure to and instruction in the\narts.\" [http://www.hsanyc.org/Harlem School of the Arts website]. In\n2005, the school was among 406 New York City arts and social service\ninstitutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie\nCorporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City Mayor\nMichael Bloomberg. [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.htm-\nl?ex=1278302400&en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss N.Y.\nTimes]. [http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html Carnegie].\n\nIn April 2010, the school shut down temporarily due to financial difficulty. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/nyregion/03harlem.html?scp=1&sq=harlem%20s-\nchool%20of%20the%20arts&st=cse N.Y. Times]. But gifts totaling $1 million\nenabled the school to reopen later that\nmonth. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/nyregion/22harlem.html N.Y.\nTimes]. The plan to reopen the school came with a condition of replacing\nall of the members of the board of directors, which parents and teachers blamed\nfor the school's dismal financial health.\n\nThe school offers courses in classical, jazz, gospel, R & B, electronic and\nworld music, as well as dance (including ballet, modern, ethnic, jazz, and tap\ndance). In addition, classes are offered in theater arts, and visual arts\n(including sculpture and photography).\n\nThe school's students are of diverse cultural backgrounds, and tuition is\nrelatively inexpensive in contrast to similar educational institutions in the\nUnited States.\n","linknr":117,"url":"The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","recorded":1374762304,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:HSA_Theater_jeh.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/HSA_Theater_jeh.jpg/300px-HSA_Theater_jeh.jpg","/wiki/File:HSA_Theater_jeh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Harlem,_New_York","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Dorothy_Maynor","/wiki/Betty_Allen","/wiki/Ulrich_Franzen","#cite_note-1","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Carnegie_Corporation","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/J._D._Parran","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.hsanyc.org/Harlem","#cite_ref-2","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss","#cite_ref-3","http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/nyregion/03harlem.html?scp=1&sq=harlem%20school%20of%20the%20arts&st=cse","#cite_ref-5","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/nyregion/22harlem.html","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit&section=3","http://www.hsanyc.org","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&params=40_49_19.95_N_73_56_45.17_W_","/wiki/File:School.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/School.svg/30px-School.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit","/wiki/Template:NYC-school-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:NYC-school-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NYC-school-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&oldid=557449698","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Educational_institutions_established_in_1964","/wiki/Category:Art_schools_in_New_York","/wiki/Category:Schools_of_the_performing_arts_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Harlem","/wiki/Category:Education_in_Manhattan","/wiki/Category:Companies_established_in_1964","/wiki/Category:Hamilton_Heights,_Manhattan","/wiki/Category:New_York_City_school_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Harlem+School+of+the+Arts&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Harlem+School+of+the+Arts","/wiki/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","/wiki/Talk:The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","#","/wiki/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&oldid=557449698","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7738910","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Harlem_School_of_the_Arts&id=557449698","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Harlem+School+of+the+Arts","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Harlem+School+of+the+Arts&oldid=557449698&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Harlem_Scho
