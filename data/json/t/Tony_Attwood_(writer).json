He currently lives in Northamptonshire.\n\nAttwood was educated at what is now the University of Brighton, the Open\nUniversity, and London University Institute of Education, where he gained an\nM.Phil for his research in music education. In 2006 he was awarded a Fellowship\nof the Institute of Administrative Management for his work in setting up the\nNational Certificate in Educational Administration - effectively the first\ncomprehensive training programme for school secretaries and administrators.\n\nHis books have been varied, ranging from a [[Blake's 7]] programme guide and\nnovel, a 1986 ''Doctor Who'' spin-off novel, a series of music education titles\nwith Oxford University Press, and several works that introduced the notion of\nusing pop and rock music as a serious topic in education. Later work includes\nThe Improving Department, a radical re-working of school improvement ideas in\nthe UK which challenged mainstream views.\n\nIn 1981 Attwood set up Hamilton House Publishing, a company which not only\npublished his post-1981 work but also re-issued earlier work. Since 2000 much of\nAttwood's work has been in advertising and he has acted as copywriter for a\nnumber of national companies. As a result of this work he produced the web site\nhttp://www.theory.bz which sets out his theory of direct mail.\n\nAttwood is chairman of The AISA Arsenal History Society\n(www.arsenalhistory.info), The Dyscalculia Centre (www.dyscalculia.me.uk) The\nSchool of Education Administration (www.admin.org.uk) and The School of\nProfessional Writing www.exceptional.org.uk He is a director of Witchwood\nRecords Ltd, Hamilton House Mailings Ltd, Mandy Tobin Homes Ltd, and Websites &\nBlogs Ltd Attwood is editor of the blogs Untold Arsenal\n(www.blog.emiratesstadium.info) and Arsenal History\n(www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk) and author of âMaking the Arsenalâ and\nâWoolwich Arsenal: the club that changed footballâ.
