The object might be a projectile or a satellite, for example.\n<!-- Strictly speaking 'trajectory' refers only to that portion of the path\nduring which the body undergoes a transient movement between practically\nstationary or repetitive motions or until the body eventually stops moving. who\nsays this? cite a source please! --> It thus includes the meaning of orbit—the\npath of a planet, an asteroid or a comet as it travels around a central mass. A\ntrajectory can be described mathematically either by the geometry of the path,\nor as the position of the object over time.\n\nIn control theory a 'trajectory' is a time-ordered set of states of a dynamical\nsystem (see e.g. Poincaré map). In discrete mathematics, a 'trajectory' is a\nsequence <math>(f^k(x))_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> of values calculated by the\niterated application of a mapping <math>f</math> to an element <math>x</math> of\nits source.\n","title":"Trajectory","headings":["Physics of trajectories","Examples","Catching balls","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Moon","2: Parabola","2: Differential_calculus","2: Range_of_a_projectile","2: Trigonometric_identity","1: Projectile","1: Satellite","1: Orbit","1: Planet","1: Asteroid","1: Comet","1: Control_theory","1: Dynamical_system","1: Poincaré_map","1: Discrete_mathematics","1: Aerodynamics","1: Ballistics","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Laws_of_Kepler","1: Sun","1: Conic_section","1: Ellipse","1: Planets","1: Comets","1: Force","1: Solar_wind","1: Radiation_pressure","1: Theoretical_physics","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Reason","1: Phenomena","1: Mass","1: Potential_field","1: Inertia","1: Differential_equation","1: Gradient","1: Stokes'_law","1: Newtonian_fluid","1: Galileo_Galilei","1: Middle_Ages","1: Europe","1: Vacuum","1: Evangelista_Torricelli","1: Mechanics","1: Standard_gravity","1: Free_fall","1: Principle_of_equivalence","1: X-axis","1: Sine","1: Rifleman's_rule","1: Hypotenuse","1: Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Aft-crossing_trajectory","1: Planetary_orbit","1: Porkchop_plot","1: Rigid_body","1: Trajectory_of_a_projectile","1: The_Wolfram_Demonstrations_Project"]}
