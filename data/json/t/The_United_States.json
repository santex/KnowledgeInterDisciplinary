The country is situated mostly in central North America, where its\nforty-eight contiguous states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, lie\nbetween the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and\nMexico to the south. The state of Alaska is situated in the northwest portion of\nthe continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to its west across the Bering\nStrait. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country\nalso possesses several territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nAt 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km 2) and with\naround 315 million people, the United States is the third- or fourth-largest\ncountry by total area, and the third-largest by both land area and population.\nIt is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the\nproduct of large-scale immigration from many countries. Adams,\nJ.Q.; Strother-Adams, Pearlie (2001). Dealing with Diversity. Chicago:\nKendall/Hunt. ISBN 0-7872-8145-X. The geography and climate of the United\nStates is also extremely diverse and is home to a variety of species.\n\nPaleoindians migrated from Asia to what is now the United States mainland around\n15,000 years ago. After 1500, Old World diseases introduced by Europeans greatly\nreduced their populations. European colonization began around 1600 and came\nmostly from England. The United States emerged from thirteen British colonies\nlocated along the Atlantic seaboard, which developed their own economies and\ndemocratic political systems. Disputes between Great Britain and the American\ncolonies led to the American Revolution.\n\nOn July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the\nDeclaration of Independence, which established the United States of America. The\nnew country and its allies defeated Britain in the Revolutionary War, which\nbecame the first successful war of independence against a European\nempire. Jack P. Greene and J.R. Pole, eds. A Companion to the American\nRevolution (2008) pp. 352â361. The current Constitution was\nadopted on September 17, 1787; several Amendments were later added to the\nConstitution, modifying its effects but not changing the original text. The\nfirst ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in\n1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.\n\nDriven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a\nvigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing\nnative tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states.\nThe American Civil War ended legalized slavery in the United States. By the end\nof the nineteenth century, the American national economy was the world's\nlargest. The SpanishâAmerican War and World War I confirmed the\ncountry's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from\nWorld War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear\nweapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end\nof the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States\nas the sole superpower.\n\nThe United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national\neconomy, with an estimated 2012 GDP of $15.6 trillion 19% of global GDP at\npurchasing-power parity, as of 2011. The European Union has a larger collective\neconomy, but is not a single nation. The per capita GDP of the U.S. was\nthe world's sixth-highest as of 2010. The economy is\nfueled by an abundance of natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure,\nand high productivity; and while its economy is considered post-industrial it\ncontinues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The country accounts\nfor 41% of global military spending, and is a leading economic,\npolitical, and cultural force in the world, as well as a leader in scientific\nresearch and technological innovation.\n","linknr":3637,"url":"The_United_States","recorded":1362486280,"links":451,"instances":["united_states","united_states","entertainer","desert","united_states","mass","united_states_congress","classification_of_humans","cultural_idea","representative","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states","conference","united_states","united_states","river","united_states","united_states","united_states","arts","state","world_war_ii","united_states","1783","united_states","united_states","united_states","american_civil_war","international_relations","united_states","united_states","united_states","government","politician","plymouth_colony","region","united_states","desert","ppp_per_capita","service","united_states","united_states","united_states","united_states","name","united_states","ppp_per_capita","united_states","word","proposed_law"],"pdf":["http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf","http://www.ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/2007,0515-crs.pdf","http://www.ilw.com/immigrationdaily/news/2007,0515-crs.pdf","http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf","http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-02.pdf","http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2005/Table03.pdf","http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYB2005/Table03.pdf","http://www.fungaljungal.org/papers/National_Biological_Service.pdf","http://www.fungaljungal.org/papers/National_Biological_Service.pdf","http://johnshadegg.house.gov/rsc/Federal%20Land%20Ownership--May%202005.pdf","http://johnshadegg.house.gov/rsc/Federal%20Land%20Ownership--May%202005.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/06statab/pop.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/06statab/pop.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_02.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_02.pdf","http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/lpr_fr_2011.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/09statab/pop.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/09statab/pop.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf","http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/census/popestimate/copy_of_2008-subcounty-population-hawaii/SUB_EST2008_01.pdf","http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/census/popestimate/2008_MSA_Hawaii/CBSA_EST2008_05.pdf","http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/glossry2.pdf","http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/glossry2.pdf","http://www.adfl.org/resources/enrollments.pdf","http://www.adfl.org/resources/enrollments.pdf","http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/affiliations-all-traditions.pdf","http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/affiliations-all-traditions.pdf","http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/ARIS/ARIS-PDF-version.pdf?ext=.pdf","http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/ARIS/ARIS-PDF-version.pdf?ext=.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/09statab/pop.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/09statab/pop.pdf","http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf","http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf","http://www.census.gov/geo/www/maps/apport2010_map1.pdf","http://www.census.gov/geo/www/maps/apport2010_map1.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/96-397.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/96-397.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32876.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32876.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33233.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33233.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33436.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33436.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41481.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41481.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33476.pdf","http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/2009/May%202009/0509facts_fig.pdf","http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/2009/May%202009/0509facts_fig.pdf","http://www.defense.gov/pubs/BSR_2008_Baseline.pdf","http://www.defense.gov/pubs/BSR_2008_Baseline.pdf","http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst1003.pdf","http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst1003.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf","http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf","http://comptroller.defense.gov/defbudget/fy2012/FY2012_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf","http://comptroller.defense.gov/defbudget/fy2012/FY2012_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-239.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-239.pdf","
