{"cursor":"3206","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" __NOTOC__ The 'Treasure Act of 1996' is an Act of Parliament designed to deal\n with finds of treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It legally\n obliges finders of objects which constitute a legally defined term of treasure\n to report their find to their local coroner within fourteen days. An inquest\n led by the coroner then determines whether the find constitutes treasure or\n not. If it is declared to be treasure then the owner must offer the item for\n sale to a museum at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts\n (Treasure Valuation Committee). Only if a museum expresses no interest in the\n item, or is unable to purchase it, can the owner retain it.\n\n'Treasure' is defined as being:\n\n*All coins from the same hoard. A hoard is defined as two or more coins, as long\nas they are at least 300 years old when found. If they contain less than 10%\ngold or silver there must be at least 10 in the hoard for it to qualify. *Two or\nmore prehistoric base metal objects in association with one another *Any\nindividual (non-coin) find that is at least 300 years old and contains at least\n10% gold or silver. *Associated finds: any object of any material found in the\nsame place as (or which had previously been together with) another object which\nis deemed treasure. *Objects substantially made from gold or silver but are less\nthan 300 years old, that have been deliberately hidden with the intention of\nrecovery and whose owners or heirs are unknown.\n\nUnder English law a landowner has sole title to any archaeological artifacts\nfound on his or her property. Legitimate metal detectorists come to an\nagreement with the owners of the land they detect on to share any proceeds from\ntreasure sales.\n\nSuccessful cases involving the Treasure Act include that of the Ringlemere gold\ncup. Non-treasure finds are the remit of the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Treasure_Act_1996","recorded":1374963486,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Treasure","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Coroner","/wiki/Inquest_(England_and_Wales)","/wiki/Museum","/wiki/Treasure_Valuation_Committee","/wiki/Coin","/wiki/Hoard","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Silver","/wiki/Prehistory","/wiki/Base_metal","/wiki/Archaeological_association","/wiki/Archaeological_association","/wiki/Title_(property)","/wiki/Archaeology","/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)","/wiki/Ringlemere_Cup","/wiki/Portable_Antiquities_Scheme","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Treasure_trove#Scotland","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Scots_law#Common_law","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Hoxne_Hoard","/wiki/Staffordshire_hoard","/wiki/Vale_of_York_hoard","/wiki/Scheduled_Ancient_Monument","/wiki/Treasure_trove","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit&section=3","http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Staffordshire-Hoard-Largest-Ever-Anglo-Saxon-Gold-Find-Unearthed-With-Metal-Detector/Article/200909415388189","http://www.finds.org.uk/treasure/treasure_summary.php","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit&section=4","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/24","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/treasure-act-1996-code-of-practice-2nd-revision-england-and-wales","/w/index.php?title=Treasure_Act_1996&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1980%E2%80%931999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_2000%E2%80%93present","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_England_Measures","/wiki/Church_of_England_Assembly_(Powers)_Act_1919","/wiki/Devolution","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/List_of_Acts_and_Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Northern_Ireland_Assembly","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/List_of_Orders_in_Council_for_Nort
