It was\ndiscovered by G. D. Cassini in 1684 and is named after titan Tethys of Greek\nmythology.\n\nTethys has a low density of 0.98 g/cmÂ³ indicating that it is made of water\nice with just a small fraction of rock. This is confirmed by the spectroscopy of\nits surface, which identified water ice as the dominant surface material. A\nsmall amount of an unidentified dark material is present as well. The surface of\nTethys is very bright, being second brightest among the moons of Saturn after\nEnceladus, and neutral in color.\n\nTethys is heavily cratered and cut by a number of large scale faults/graben. The\nlargest impact craterâOdysseus is about 400 km in diameter, while the\nlargest grabenâIthaca Chasma is about 100 km wide and more than\n2000 km long. These two largest surface features may be related. A small\npart of the surface is covered by smooth plains that may be cryovolcanic in\norigin. Like all other regular moons of Saturn Tethys formed from the Saturnian\nsub-nebulaâa disk of gas and dust that surrounded Saturn soon after its\nformation.\n\nTethys has been approached by several space probes including Pioneer 11 (1979),\nVoyager 1 (1980), Voyager 2 (1981), and Cassini since 2004.\n","linknr":846,"url":"Tethys_(moon)","recorded":1362371905,"links":114,"instances":["geology","moon","moon","mythology","moon","unit","moon","moon","moon","crater","mechanics","moon","mythology","moon","moon","moon","geology","moon","geology","crater","craters"],"pdf":["http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2008/pdf/1968.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2008/pdf/1968.pdf","http://ciclops.org/media/sp/2007/4702_10268_0.pdf","http://ciclops.org/media/sp/2007/4702_10268_0.pdf","http://had.aas.org/hadnews/HADN32.pdf","http://had.aas.org/hadnews/HADN32.pdf","http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/40235/1/05-3668.pdf","http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/40235/1/05-3668.pdf","http://www.geoinf.fu-berlin.de/publications/denk/2007/ThomasEtAl_SaturnMoonsShapes_Icarus_2007.pdf","http://www.geoinf.fu-berlin.de/publications/denk/2007/ThomasEtAl_SaturnMoonsShapes_Icarus_2007.pdf","http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/tethys_comp.pdf"],"categories":["Moons
