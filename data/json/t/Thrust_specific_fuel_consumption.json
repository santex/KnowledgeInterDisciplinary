{"cursor":"4568","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Thrust specific fuel consumption' ('TSFC') or sometimes simply specific fuel\nconsumption, SFC, is an engineering term that is used to describe the fuel\nefficiency of an engine design with respect to thrust output. It allows the\nefficiency of different sized engines to be directly compared.\n\nTSFC may also be thought of as fuel consumption (grams/second) per unit of\nthrust (kilonewtons, or kN). It is thus thrust-specific, meaning that the fuel\nconsumption is divided by the thrust.\n\nTSFC or SFC for thrust engines (e.g. turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, rocket\nengines, etc.) is the mass of fuel needed to provide the net thrust for a given\nperiod e.g. lb/(hÂ·lbf) (pounds of fuel per hour-pound of thrust) or g/(sÂ·kN)\n(grams of fuel per second-kilonewton). Mass of fuel is used rather than volume\n(gallons or litres) for the fuel measure since it is independent of temperature-\n. [http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/Training/Aerodynamics/range_prop.htm Specific\nFuel Consumption ]\n\nSpecific fuel consumption of air-breathing jet engines at their maximum\nefficiency vary more or less inversely with speed, which in turn means that the\nfuel consumption per mile or km can be a more appropriate comparison metric for\naircraft that travel at very different speeds.\n\nThis figure is inversely proportional to specific impulse.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Thrust_specific_fuel_consumption","recorded":1362375096,"links":14,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":["http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/aero/events/encompat/soaeng.pdf"],"categories":["Engine technology","Power (physics)"],"headings":["Significance of SFC","Units","Typical values of SFC for thrust engines","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drag","physics"]],"members":["drag"],"related":["Specific","Engineering","Fuel_efficiency","Engine","Thrust","Specific","Reaction_engine","Turbojet","Turbofan","Ramjet","Rocket_engine","Fuel","Specific_impulse","Overall_pressure_ratio","Drag_(physics)","Concorde","Lift_to_drag_ratio","Brake_specific_fuel_consumption","Energies_per_unit_mass","Specific_impulse","Vehicle_metrics"]}
