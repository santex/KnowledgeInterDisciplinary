The trade union\nnamed after them is the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT or\nTeamsters), one of the largest unions in the United States.\n\nOriginally, the term \"teamster\" referred to a person who drove a team of draft\nanimals, usually a wagon drawn by oxen, horses, or mules. \"Macquarie\nDictionary\" 2nd edition, 1991 This term was common by the time of the Mexican-\nAmerican War (1848) and the Indian Wars throughout the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies on the American frontier.\n\nA teamster might also drive pack animals, such as a muletrain, in which case he\nwas also known as a muleteer or muleskinner. Another name for the occupation was\nbullwhacker, related to driving oxen. Today this person may be called an\noutfitter or packer.
