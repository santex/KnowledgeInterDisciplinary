{"cursor":"21097","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Trophic cascades' occur when predators in a food web suppress the abundance\nand/or alter traits (e.g., behavior) of their prey, thereby releasing the next\nlower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic\nlevel is an herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish\nis increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, zooplanktivorous fish,\nshould decrease, large zooplankton abundance should increase, and phytoplankton\nbiomass should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research in many areas\nof ecology. Trophic cascades may also be important for understanding the effects\nof removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places\nthrough hunting and fishing activities.\n\nA Top Down Cascade is a trophic cascade where the food chain or food web is\ndisrupted by the removal of a top predator, or a third or fourth level consumer.\nOn the other hand, a bottom up cascade occurs when a primary producer, or\nprimary consumer is removed, and there is a diminishment of population size\nthrough the community. An example could include Paine's study from the\nUniversity of Washington, where he removed several species in different plots\nalong the North-Western United States coast line, and realized that Pisaster, a\ncommon starfish, when removed, created a top-down cascade which involved a surge\nin barnacle and mussel population, but a decrease in the populations of chitons,\nlimpets, and whelks. This led to the conclusion that Pisaster was a keystone\nspecies in that food web.\n","linknr":841,"url":"Trophic_cascade","recorded":1362544234,"links":24,"instances":["ecology","genus","california","herbivory","biology","zoology","nutrition","biology","ocean"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trophic ecology"],"headings":["Origins and theory","Criticisms","Classic examples","Terrestrial trophic cascades","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Kelp_forest_and_sardines%2C_San_Clemente_Island%2C_Channel_Islands%2C_California.jpg/220px-Kelp_forest_and_sardines%2C_San_Clemente_Island%2C_Channel_Islands%2C_California.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/3875_aquaimages.jpg/140px-3875_aquaimages.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg/140px-Yellowfin_tuna_nurp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diet","nutrition"],["cannibalism","zoology"],["marine","ocean"],["eel_river","california"],["mutualism","biology"],["piper","genus"],["browsing","herbivory"],["recruitment","biology"],["cascade_effect","ecology"]],"members":["cascade_effect","piper","eel_river","browsing","mutualism","cannibalism","diet","recruitment","marine"],"related":["Food_web","Prey","Trophic_level","Predation","Herbivory","Piscivore","Lake","Zooplankton","Fish","Zooplankton","Phytoplankton","Biomass","Ecology","Chiton","Limpets","Whelk","Nelson_Hairston","Lawrence_B._Slobodkin","Plant","Biocoenosis","United_States_State_Department","Pond","Zooplankton","Phytoplankton","Food_chains","Primary_productivity","Ecosystem","Terrestrial_ecoregion","Ecosystems","Trophic_level","Plant","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Food_webs","Omnivory","Diet_(nutrition)","Cannibalism_(zoology)","Channel_Islands_of_California","Irruptive_growth","Marine_(ocean)","Aquatic_ecosystem","North_America","Piscivore","Freshwater","Zooplankton","Phytoplankton","Eel_River_(California)","California","Steelhead","California_Roach","Insect","Midge","Algae","Pacific_Ocean","Kelp_forest","Sea_otter","Sea_urchin","Hunting","Local_extinction","Kelp","Stream","Food_web","Biodiversity","Primary_producer","Plant_defense","California_coastal_prairie","Yellow_bush_lupine","Entomopathogenic_nematode","Seed","Costa_Rica","Rain_forest","Cleridae","Beetle","Ant","Mutualism_(biology)","Piper_(genus)","Caterpillar","Insect","Meta-analysis","Autoecology","River_morphology","Hydrology","Gray_wolf","Yellowstone_National_Park","Local_extinction","Wolf_reintroduction","Elk","Browsing_(herbivory)","Populus_tremuloides","Populus_sect._Aigeiros","Willows","Recruitment_(biology)","Riparian","Deciduous","Soda_Butte_Creek","Gallatin_Range","Lamar_River","Biodiversity","Scavengers","Corvus_corax","Bald_eagles","Grizzly_bears","American_bison","Interspecific_competition","American_Beaver","Keystone_species","Erosion","Sediment","Water_table","Zion_National_Park","Yosemite_National_Park","Cougar","Mule_deer","California_black_oak","Sub-Saharan_Africa","African_lion","Leopards","Olive_baboon","Mesopredator_release","Ungulate","Intestinal_parasite","New_South_Wales","South_Australia","Australian_Dingo","Red_fox","Dusky_hopping_mouse","Cascade_effect_(ecology)","Food_web","Lake_ecology","Mesopredator_release_hypothesis","Population_dynamics_of_fisheries","Soil_food_web","Stream_ecology"]}
