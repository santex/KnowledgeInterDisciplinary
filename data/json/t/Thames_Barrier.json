Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by\nexceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the sea. It needs to be\nraised (closed) only during high tide; at ebb tide it can be lowered to release\nthe water that backs up behind it. Its northern bank is in Silvertown in the\nLondon Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the New Charlton area of\nCharlton in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. The report of Sir Hermann Bondi on\nthe North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of\nLondon [http://www.westsilvertownfoundation.org.uk/Floods1953.pdf 1953\nfloods in Canning Town, Accessed 30 December 2010] was instrumental in the\nbuilding of the\nbarrier.
