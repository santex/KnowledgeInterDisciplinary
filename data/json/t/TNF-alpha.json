{"cursor":"25113","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Tumor necrosis factor' ('TNF', 'cachexin', or 'cachectin', and formerly known\nas 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha' or 'TNF-Î±') is a cytokine involved in systemic\ninflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the acute\nphase reaction. It is produced chiefly by activated macrophages (M1), although\nit can be produced by many other cell types as CD4+ lymphocytes, NK cells and\nneurons 9218250 .\n\nThe primary role of TNF is in the regulation of immune cells. TNF, being an\nendogenous pyrogen, is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, sepsis\n(through IL1 & IL6 production), cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit\ntumorigenesis and viral replication. Dysregulation of TNF production has been\nimplicated in a variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major\ndepression and inflammatory bowel disease\n(IBD). While still controversial, studies of\ndepression and IBD are currently being linked by TNF levels. Recombinant TNF is used as an immunostimulant under\nthe INN 'tasonermin'. Tumor necrosis factor-Î± can be produced ectopically in the\nsetting of malignancy and parallels parathyroid hormone both in causing\nsecondary hypercalcemia and in the cancers with which excessive production is\nassociated.\n","linknr":1070,"url":"TNF-alpha","recorded":1362485049,"links":39,"instances":["medicine","chemistry","genetics","circulatory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines","Immunostimulants"],"headings":["Discovery","Gene","Structure","Cell signaling","Enzyme regulation","Physiology","Pharmacology","Interactions","Issues with nomenclature","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/TNFa_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png/250px-TNFa_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/PBB_GE_TNF_207113_s_at.png/250px-PBB_GE_TNF_207113_s_at.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/TNF_signaling.jpg/400px-TNF_signaling.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/PDB_1a8m_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1a8m_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/PDB_1tnf_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1tnf_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/PDB_2az5_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_2az5_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/PDB_2tun_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_2tun_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/PDB_4tsv_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_4tsv_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/PDB_5tsw_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_5tsw_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clone","genetics"],["homology","chemistry"],["stress","medicine"],["shock","circulatory"]],"members":["stress","homology","clone","shock"],"related":["Cytokine","Inflammation","Acute_phase_reaction","Macrophages","CD4+_lymphocytes","NK_cells","Immune_cells","Apoptosis","Sepsis","Cachexia","Tumorigenesis","Viral_replication","Disease","Alzheimer's_disease","Cancer","Major_depression","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Immunostimulant","International_Nonproprietary_Name","Anti-tumor","Immune_system","William_B._Coley","University_of_California,_Irvine","Lymphocytes","Lymphotoxin","Yale_University","Lloyd_J._Old","Memorial_Sloan-Kettering_Cancer_Center","Macrophages","Fibrosarcoma","Ian_A._Clark","Australian_National_University","Elizabeth_Carswell","CDNA","Clone_(genetics)","Homology_(chemistry)","Bruce_A._Beutler","Anthony_Cerami","Cachexia","Endotoxin","Kevin_J._Tracey","Septic_shock","Gene","Chromosome","Exon","AU-rich_element","Amino_acid","Transmembrane_protein","ADAM17","Kilodalton","Beta_sheet","Beta_sheet","Viral_capsid","TNF_receptor","Immune_system","Ligand","Adaptor_protein","TRADD","TRAF2","TRAF2","Kinase","IκB_kinase","Kinase","IκBα","Phosphorylated","Transcription_factor","Cell_nucleus","Inflammatory_response","Apoptotic","MAPK","Stress_(medicine)","JNK","P38_MAPK_pathway","Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases","JNK","Kinases","MAP3K10","MAP3K11","MAP3K7","MEKK1","ASK1","Kinases","Phosphorylate","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase_kinase","JNK","JNK","Transcription_factors","C-Jun","ATF2","JNK","Cell_differentiation","Apoptotic","Fas_receptor","Apoptotic","FADD","Cysteine_protease","Caspase-8","Caspase","Caspases","Apoptosis","C-FLIP","Bcl-2","BIRC2","BIRC3","Cytokines","Reactive_oxygen_species","Inflammation","Morpheein","Allosteric_regulation","Macrophages","Lymphoid","Mast_cells","Endothelial_cell","Cardiac_myocyte","Adipose_tissue","Fibroblasts","Neuron","Lipopolysaccharide","Bacteria","Interleukin-1","Interleukin-6","Hypothalamus","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis","Corticotropin_releasing_hormone","Appetite","Fever","Liver","Acute_phase_response","C-reactive_protein","Insulin_resistance","Neutrophils","Endothelial_cell","Neutrophils","Phagocytosis","Prostaglandin_E2","Insulin_resistance","Shock_(circulatory)","Cachexia","Cancer","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Psoriasis","Hidradenitis_suppurativa","Asthma","TNF_inhibitor","Monoclonal_antibody","Infliximab","Adalimumab","Certolizumab_pegol","Fusion_protein","Etanercept","Protein-protein_interaction","TNFRSF1A"]}
