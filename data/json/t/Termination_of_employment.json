{"cursor":"8638","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Involuntary termination' or a 'pink slip' is the employee's departure at the\nhands of the employer. There are two basic types of involuntary termination,\nknown often as being \"'fired'\" and \"'laid off'.\" To be fired, as opposed to\nbeing laid off, is generally thought of to be the employee's fault, and\ntherefore is considered in most cases to be dishonorable and a sign of failure\n(compare dishonorable discharge). Often, it may hinder the new jobseeker's\nchances of finding new employment, particularly if he/she has been fired from\nearlier jobs. Jobseekers sometimes do not mention jobs which they were fired\nfrom on their rÃ©sumÃ©s; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment, and refusal\nto contact previous employers are often regarded as \"red flags\".
