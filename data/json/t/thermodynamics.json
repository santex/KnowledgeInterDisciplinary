      "text" : " showing the hot body (boiler), working body (system, steam), and cold body\n (water), the letters labeled according to the stopping points in Carnot cycle]]\n\n\n'Thermodynamics' is a branch of natural science concerned with heat and its\nrelation to energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables (such as\ntemperature, internal energy, entropy, and pressure) that characterize materials\nand radiation, and explains how they are related and by what laws they change\nwith time. Thermodynamics describes the average behavior of very large numbers\nof microscopic constituents, and its laws can be derived from statistical\nmechanics.\n\nThermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and\nengineering—such as engines, phase transitions, chemical reactions, transport\nphenomena, and even black holes. Results of thermodynamic calculations are\nessential for other fields of physics and for chemistry, chemical engineering,\naerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, cell biology, biomedical\nengineering, and materials science—and useful in other fields such as\neconomics.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nMuch of the empirical content of thermodynamics is contained in the four laws.\nThe first law asserts the existence of a quantity called the internal energy of\na system, which is distinguishable from the kinetic energy of bulk movement of\nthe system and from its potential energy with respect to its surroundings. The\nfirst law distinguishes transfers of energy between closed systems as heat and\nas work.<ref>Crawford, F.H. (1963).

Thermodynamics of Irreversible\nProcesses, translated in English, Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, pp.\n10–11.</ref><ref>Münster, A. (1970).</ref> The second law concerns two\nquantities called temperature and entropy. Entropy expresses the limitations,\narising from what is known as irreversibility, on the amount of thermodynamic\nwork that can be delivered to an external system by a thermodynamic\nprocess.<ref></ref> Temperature, whose properties are also partially described\nby the zeroth law of thermodynamics, quantifies the direction of energy flow as\nheat between two systems in thermal contact and quantifies the common-sense\nnotions of \"hot\" and \"cold\".\n\nHistorically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the\nefficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French\nphysicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that the efficiency of\nheat engines was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic\nWars.<ref></ref> Irish-born British physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to\nformulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854:<ref\nname=kelvin1854>{{cite book |title=Mathematical and Physical Papers |author=Sir\nWilliam Thomson, LL.D.

This concern was then\nlinked to the study of energy transfers in chemical processes, for example to\nthe investigation, published in 1840, of the heats of chemical\nreactions<ref>Hess, H. (1840).
