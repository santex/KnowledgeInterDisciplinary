There are about 28 TRP channels that share some structural similarity to\neach other. These are grouped into two broad\ngroups: group 1 includes, TRPC ( \"C\" for canonical), TRPV (\"V\" for vanilloid),\nTRPM (\"M\" for melastatin), TRPN and TRPA. In group 2 there are TRPP (\"P\" for\npolycystic) and TRPML (\"ML\" for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a\nvariety of sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness,\ndifferent kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels\nare thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense\nhot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like\ngarlic (allicin), chilli pepper (capsaicin), wasabi (allyl isothiocyanate);\nothers are activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet\nothers are activated by molecules found in cannabis (i.e. THC, CBD and CBN).\nSome act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration.\n\nThese ion channels are relatively non-selectively permeable to cations,\nincluding sodium, calcium and magnesium. TRP channels were initially discovered\nin trp mutant strain of the fruit fly [[Drosophila]]. Later, TRP channels were\nfound in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types\nand tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 membrane-spanning helices with\nintracellular N- and C-termini. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and\nregulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are expressed throughout the body.\n","linknr":523,"url":"Transient_receptor_potential_channel","recorded":1362540368,"links":16,"instances":["channel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Membrane biology","Ion channels"],"headings":["Sub-families","TRP-like channels in insect vision","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/TRP_P.Americana_retina.jpg/300px-TRP_P.Americana_retina.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trpa","channel"],["trpa","channel"]],"members":["trpa"],"related":["Ion_channel","Plasma_membrane","TRPC","TRPV","TRPM","TRPN","TRPA_(channel)","TRPP","TRPML","Allicin","Capsaicin","Allyl_isothiocyanate","Menthol","Camphor","Cannabis","THC","Carbohydrate-binding_module","Cannabinol","Ion_channel","Cation","Sodium","Calcium","Magnesium","Cell_membrane","Helice","C_terminus","Gene","TRPC","Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis","Hyperforin","Adhyperforin","TRPV","Capsaicin","Piperine","TRPA_(channel)","TRPM","Hypomagnesemia_with_secondary_hypocalcemia","TRPP","Polycystic_kidney_disease","TRPML","Mucolipidosis_type_IV","TRPN","Photoreceptor_cell","Synapse","Neuron","Rhodopsin","Diacylglycerol_lipase"]}
