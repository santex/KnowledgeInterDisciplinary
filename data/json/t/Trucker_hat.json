{"cursor":"5257","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'trucker cap' or 'mesh cap' is a type of baseball cap. It is also sometimes\nknown as a \"gimme [as in 'give me'] cap\" or a \"feed cap\" because this style of\nhat originated as a promotional give-away from feed or farming supply companies\nto farmers, truck drivers, or other rural workers.\n\nThe design of a trucker cap is similar to that of a baseball cap, with a\nslightly curved bill in front, a cap constructed from six almost triangular\ngores, and a button on top. Instead of being made of cotton fabric like a\ntypical baseball cap, the front section of a trucker hat above the bill is foam,\nand the rest is plastic mesh for breathability. The foam front of the hat stands\nup straight and stiff, which makes the trucker hat taller than most baseball\ncaps. There is an adjustable plastic snap closure in the back to ensure that one\nsize fits most.\n\nThe original feed caps bore company logos on the front foam section of the cap,\neither printed or as a patch sewn on. These companies typically had a rural\nclientele, such as the local feed store or John Deere tractors. Trucker-style\nhats can now be found with other pictures, logos, flags, camouflage, or humorous\nsayings on the front. Trucker hats are still available as promotional items.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Trucker_hat","recorded":1362566608,"links":11,"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps","2000s fashion"],"headings":["2000s trend","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Truckerhat.jpg/220px-Truckerhat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["weedeater","band"]],"members":["weedeater"],"related":["Baseball_cap","Deere_&_Company","Suburb","Blue_collar","Pharrell_Williams","Ashton_Kutcher","Urban_Dictionary","Justin_Timberlake","Celebuzz","Grand_Theft_Arlen","Hank_Hill","Judah_Friedlander","Redneck","Scott_H._Biram","Hank_Williams_III","Assjack","Assjack","Weedeater_(band)","Early_Cuyler","Drum_and_Bass","Andy_C"]}
