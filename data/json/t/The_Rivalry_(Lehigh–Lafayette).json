It is the most-played football rivalry\nin the nation and the longest uninterrupted annual rivalry series. As of 2012,\n\"The Rivalry\" has been played 148 times since 1884 with only a single\ninterruption in 1896. The college's football teams met twice annually (except\n1891, when they played three games, and 1896, when they did not play at all)\nuntil 1901. The two institutions are located seventeen miles apart in eastern\nPennsylvania. Though primarily alluding to football, \"The Rivalry\" pertains to a\nmeeting between the two schools in all sports and other endeavors.\n\nDespite popular belief, Harvard and Yale did not play The Game in four separate\nyears during The Rivalry's current streak of 121 consecutive games.\nFurthermore, Lehigh and Lafayette met twice per season in 1943 and 1944 during\nWorld War II. The Rivalry is so old that it predates football trophies; the\nwinning team just gets to keep the game ball. These are painted with the score\nand displayed in winning institution's hall of fame or in the case of\nLafayette, the President's house. The evolution of the shape of the football\ncan be seen in the displays of past game balls, since the early ones predate\neven the invention of the forward pass.\n\nThe football game is usually sold out months in advance and has inspired books\nand a PBS television documentary narrated by Harry Kalas. In 2006, ESPNU ranked\nThe Rivalry No. 8 in their Top Ten College Football Rivalries, and [[Sports\nIllustrated]] has told its readers that seeing it \"is something you have to do\nonce in your life.\"\n\nOn November 17, 2012, prior to the 148th game, the presidents of Lafayette\nCollege and Lehigh University, Daniel Weiss and Alice Gast, respectively,\njointly announced that the 150th game will be played on November 22, 2014 at\nYankee Stadium in New York City, and will be broadcast on ESPN.\n","linknr":535,"url":"The_Rivalry_(Lehigh–Lafayette)","recorded":1375078195,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Lafayette_college_leopard_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/Lafayette_college_leopard_logo.png/155px-Lafayette_college_leopard_logo.png","/wiki/File:LehighMountainHawks.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/LehighMountainHawks.png/90px-LehighMountainHawks.png","/wiki/File:Lafayette_Lehigh_MVP_Trophy.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Lafayette_Lehigh_MVP_Trophy.JPG/275px-Lafayette_Lehigh_MVP_Trophy.JPG","/wiki/File:Lafayette_Lehigh_MVP_Trophy.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/College_rivalry","/wiki/Lafayette_Leopards_football","/wiki/Lafayette_College","/wiki/Lehigh_Mountain_Hawks_football","/wiki/Lehigh_University","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Harvard-Yale_football_games_(The_Game)","/wiki/PBS","/wiki/Harry_Kalas","/wiki/ESPNU","/wiki/Sports_Illustrated","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Daniel_Weiss_(art_historian)","/wiki/Alice_Gast","/wiki/Yankee_Stadium","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/ESPN","#cite_note-2","#Series_history","#Early_days","#First_athletic_events","#Early_football","#Modern_era","#Memorable_moments","#No_game_in_1896","#Longest_run","#Overtime_catch","#Football_record","#Summary","#Individual_games","#All_Sports_Trophy","#All_Sports_Trophy_record","#Footnotes","#References","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Asa_Packer","/wiki/Jim_Thorpe,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Presbyterian","/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America","/wiki/Hazleton,_Pennsylvania","#cite_note-3","/wiki/William_Bacon_Stevens","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-March_1926_272-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Lafayette_Leopards_football","/wiki/Rugby_football","/wiki/Richard_Harding_Davis","/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Wilkes-Barre,_Pennsylvania","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Lehigh_University_Alumni_Building.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Lehigh_University_Alumni_Building.jpg/170px-Lehigh_University_Alumni_Building.jpg","/wiki/File:Lehigh_University_Alumni_Building.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Lehigh_University","/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/File:LafayetteCollegeTheQuad.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/LafayetteCollegeTheQuad.JPG/275px-LafayetteCollegeTheQuad.JPG","/wiki/File:LafayetteCollegeTheQuad.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Lafayette_College","/wiki/Easton,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/John_F._Kennedy","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Patriot_League","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-March_1926_272-4","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_note-gamenotes-7","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=9","#cite_note-gamenotes-7","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=11","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/7b155ca9a7d2f8dd1a2c40b37c57e743.png","/wiki/Lafayette_College","/wiki/Lehigh_University","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayette)&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/JFK_assassination","/wiki/John_F._Kennedy","/wiki/Artificial_turf","/w/index.php?title=The_Rivalry_(Lehigh%E2%80%93Lafayet
