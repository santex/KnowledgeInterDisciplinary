{"cursor":"1499","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn drumming, a 'trigger' is an electronic transducer that can be attached to a\ndrum, cymbal or other instrument to enable it to control an electronic drum unit\nor similar device.\n\nSpecialised triggers are produced for specific instruments. A snare drum\ntrigger, for example, needs two channels, one each for the rim and head, while a\ntom-tom drum trigger needs only to register strokes to the drum head.\n\nDrum triggers gained great attention in the beginning of the 1990 decade, being\nextensively used on the bass drum on Heavy Metal music, one exemple is the album\nDemanufacture by Fear Factory, released in 1995.\n\nThe advantage of using drum triggers is that less effort is required from the\ndrummer, since the sensitivity of the trigger can be adjusted to make even the\nsofter hit sound like a loud stroke, and the sound of each one of the drum\npieces can be individually equalized as the drummer wishes, and no matter how\nhard (or soft) the drummer hits, all the pieces will be heard with the same\nvolume. Triggers have a greater use in live performances than in studio\nrecordings, since some drummers dislike the processed triggered sound, labeled\nby some as artificial.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Trigger_(drums)","recorded":1362560396,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Audio transducers","Drum kit components"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Clavia_ddrum4_SE.jpg/220px-Clavia_ddrum4_SE.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Tom-tom_12x8.jpg/25px-Tom-tom_12x8.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Drum","Transducer","Electronic_drum","Snare_drum","Tom-tom_drum","Demanufacture","Fear_Factory","Trigger_pad","Ddrum"]}
