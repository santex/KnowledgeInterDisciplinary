The genre was often associated with the social realist-influenced\nBritish drama style known as \"kitchen sink realism\", which depicted the social\nissues facing working-class families. [[Armchair Theatre]] (ABC, later Thames,\n1956â1974), [[The Wednesday Play]] (BBC, 1964â1970) and [[Play for Today]] (BBC,\n1970â1984) received praise from critics for their quality. In the United States,\ntelevision plays were seen mainly from 1948 to 1961, the period of live TV\ndramas which framed the Golden Age of Television.\n\nThe term 'television play' is a partial misnomer. Although the earliest works\nwere marked by television drama drawing on its theatrical roots, with live\nperformances telecast from the television studio, a shift towards shooting on\nfilm occurred in the late 1970s, utilising techniques and working methods common\nin the cinema, but use of the term has persisted.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Television_play","recorded":1362482943,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anthology television series","BBC television dramas","English literary movements","Social realism","Television genres"],"headings":["''Armchair Theatre'': 1956–1974","''The Wednesday Play'': 1964–1970","''Play for Today'': 1970–1984","Decline of genre: mid-1980s","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d6/Cathycomehome.JPG/300px-Cathycomehome.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Television_program","Social_realism","Kitchen_sink_realism","Working_class","Associated_British_Corporation","Thames_Television","BBC","Golden_Age_of_Television","Television","ITV","Sydney_Newman","Angry_Young_Men","Kitchen_sink_realism","ITV","Alun_Owen","Harold_Pinter","BBC","Sydney_Newman","BBC_One","Sydney_Newman","James_MacTaggart","Ken_Loach","Nell_Dunn","British_television","BBC","BBC_One","Social_realism","Mike_Leigh","Channel_4","Quality_television","Golden_Age_of_Television","Radio_drama","BBC_television_drama","London","Penguin_Books","Oxford","Oxford_University_Press","British_Film_Institute"]}
