{"cursor":"2851","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'triple bond' in chemistry is a chemical bond between two chemical elements\ninvolving six bonding electrons instead of the usual two in a covalent single\nbond. The most common triple bond, that between two carbon atoms, can be found\nin alkynes. Triple bonds are also common with phosphorus atoms.Other functional\ngroups containing a triple bond are cyanides and isocyanides. Some diatomic\nmolecules, such as dinitrogen and carbon monoxide are also triple bonded. In\nskeletal formula the triple bond is drawn as three parallel lines (â¡) between the two connected atoms; in typography, this\nis accomplished with the identity operator. Organic Chemistry 2nd\nEd. John McMurry \n\nTriple bonds are stronger than single bonds or double bonds and they are also\nshorter. The bond order is three.\n\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n||  \n|-\n\n|| acetylene, H−C≡C−H cyanogen, N≡C−C≡N\n|| carbon monoxide, C≡O\n|-\n\n|Colspan=100%|'Chemical compounds with triple bonds'\n|}\n","linknr":187,"url":"Triple-bond","recorded":1362672534,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Bonding","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png/150px-Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Cyanogen-2D-dimensions.png/180px-Cyanogen-2D-dimensions.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg/100px-Carbon_monoxide_2D.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_bond","Chemical_elements","Bonding_electron","Covalent_bond","Carbon","Alkynes","Phosphorus","Functional_group","Cyanide","Isocyanide","Dinitrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Skeletal_formula","Triple_bar","Covalent_bond","Double_bond","Bond_order","Acetylene","Cyanogen","Carbon_monoxide","Orbital_hybridization","Sp_orbital","P-orbital","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Perpendicular","Sigma_bond","Pi-bond","Bent_bond"]}
