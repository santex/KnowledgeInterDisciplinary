{"cursor":"2875","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Hydroxylation' is a chemical process that introduces a hydroxyl group (-OH)\ninto an organic compound. In biochemistry, hydroxylation reactions are often\nfacilitated by enzymes called hydroxylases. Hydroxylation is the first step in\nthe oxidative degradation of organic compounds in air. It is extremely important\nin detoxification since hydroxylation converts lipophilic compounds into water-\nsoluble (hydrophilic) products that are more readily excreted. Some drugs (e.g.\nsteroids) are activated or deactivated by hydroxylation.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Hydroxylation","recorded":1362481932,"links":29,"instances":["medical","fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic redox reactions","Proteins","Posttranslational modification"],"headings":["Chemical concepts","Biological hydroxylation","Hydroxylation of proteins","Examples of hydroxylases","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"],["lime","fruit"]],"members":["hypoxia","lime"],"related":["Chemistry","Hydroxyl_group","Organic_compound","Biochemistry","Enzyme","Steroid","Cytochrome_P-450","Protein","Proline","Hydroxyproline","Collagen","Connective_tissue","Hypoxia_(medical)","Hypoxia_inducible_factor","Hydroxylysine","Prolyl_4-hydroxylase","Prolyl_3-hydroxylase","Lysyl_5-hydroxylase","Α-ketoglutarate","Ascorbic_acid","Scurvy","Sailor","Lime_(fruit)","17α-hydroxylase","Cholesterol_7_alpha-hydroxylase","Dopamine_β-hydroxylase","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Tyrosine_hydroxylase"]}
