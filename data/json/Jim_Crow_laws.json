{"cursor":"42575","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Jim Crow laws' were state and local laws in the United States enacted\nbetween 1876 and 1965. They mandated [[de jure]] racial segregation in all\npublic facilities in Southern states of the former Confederacy, with, starting\nin 1890, a \"separate but equal\" status for African Americans. The separation\nin practice led to conditions for African Americans that tended to be inferior\nto those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic,\neducational and social disadvantages. De jure segregation mainly applied to\nthe Southern United States. Northern segregation was generally [[de facto]],\nwith patterns of segregation in housing enforced by covenants, bank lending\npractices, and job discrimination, including discriminatory union practices\nfor decades.\n\nSome examples of Jim Crow laws are the segregation of public schools, public\nplaces, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms,\nrestaurants, and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was\nalso segregated.\n\nThese Jim Crow Laws followed the 1800â1866 Black Codes, which had previously\nrestricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans with no\npretense of equality. State-sponsored school segregation was declared\nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in [[Brown v.\nBoard of Education]]. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964
