It is also relevant for English\ncriminal law and English contract law.\n\nIn the English law of negligence, 'causation' proves a direct link between the\ndefendantâs negligence and the claimantâs loss and damage. For these purposes,\nliability in negligence is established when there is a breach of the duty of\ncare owed by the defendant to the claimant that 'causes' loss and damage, and it\nis reasonable that the defendant should compensate the claimant for that loss\nand damage.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Causation_in_English_law","recorded":1372152714,"links":[],"instances":["law","law","law","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English tort law","Causality"],"headings":["Public policy","The factual test of causation","Breaking the chain of causation","Remoteness","Loss of a chance","Loss of a right","Causation: law and science compared","References","See also","Notes"],"image":[],"tags":[["remoteness","law"],["public_policy","law"],["party","law"],["trial","law"],["conviction","law"]],"members":["trial","public_policy","remoteness","conviction","party"],"related":["Remoteness_(law)","Tort","English_criminal_law","English_contract_law","English_law","Negligence","Defendant","Negligence","Claimant","Negligence","Breach_of_duty_in_English_law","Duty_of_care_in_English_law","Claimant","Public_policy_(law)","Alfred_Denning,_Baron_Denning","Justice","Party_(law)","Trial_(law)","Damages","Conviction_(law)","Manslaughter_in_English_law","Diminished_responsibility_in_English_law","Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales","Balance_of_probabilities","Repetitive_strain_injury","Johan_Steyn,_Baron_Steyn","Legal_burden_of_proof","Pleadings","Bolam_Test","Professional_negligence","Damages"]}
