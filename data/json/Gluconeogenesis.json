{"cursor":"17551","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Gluconeogenesis' (abbreviated 'GNG') is a metabolic pathway that results in the\ngeneration of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate,\nlactate, glycerol,glucogenic amino acids, and odd-chain fatty acid.\n\nIt is one of the two main mechanisms humans and many other animals use to keep\nblood glucose levels from dropping too low (hypoglycemia). The other means of\nmaintaining blood glucose levels is through the degradation of glycogen\n(glycogenolysis).\n\nGluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi,\nbacteria, and other microorganisms. In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis\ntakes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of\nkidneys. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process. Young, J. W.\n1977. Gluconeogenesis in cattle: significance and methodology. J. Dairy Sci. 60:\n1-15. In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting,\nstarvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise. The process is highly\nendergonic until ATP or GTP are utilized, effectively making the process\nexergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate\nrequires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP. Gluconeogenesis is often\nassociated with ketosis. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type II\ndiabetes, such as metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates\nglucose uptake by cells.  In ruminants, because\nmetabolizable dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms,\ngluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise,\netc.\n","linknr":627,"url":"Gluconeogenesis","recorded":1362502975,"links":54,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metabolism","Biochemistry","Metabolic pathways","Carbohydrates","Glycobiology","Exercise physiology","Hepatology","Diabetes"],"headings":["Precursors","Location","Pathway","Regulation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Amino_acid_catabolism.png/300px-Amino_acid_catabolism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Gluconeogenesis_pathway.png/300px-Gluconeogenesis_pathway.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Metabolism_of_common_monosaccharides%2C_and_related_reactions.png/1000px-Metabolism_of_common_monosaccharides%2C_and_related_reactions.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Metabolism_790px_partly_labeled.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Gtk-dialog-info.svg/15px-Gtk-dialog-info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Metabolism_790px.png/50px-Metabolism_790px.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["lumen"],"related":["Metabolic_pathway","Glucose","Carbohydrate","Pyruvic_acid","Lactic_acid","Glycerol","Glucogenic_amino_acid","Glucose","Hypoglycemia","Glucose","Glycogen","Glycogenolysis","Liver","Kidney","Fasting","Starvation","Low-carbohydrate_diet","Exercise","Endergonic","Exergonic","Pyruvate","Ketosis","Metformin","Ketogenesis","Lipid_synthesis","Lactic_acid","Glycerol","Triacylglycerol","Alanine","Glutamine","Glucogenic_amino_acid","Citric_acid_cycle","Oxaloacetate","Pyruvate","Cori_cycle","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Transamination","Deamination","Fatty_acid","Odd-chain_fatty_acid","Propionyl_CoA","Succinyl_CoA","Glyoxylate_cycle","Acetate","Malate_synthase","Isocitrate_lyase","Citric_acid_cycle","Oxaloacetate","Pyruvate","Phosphoenolpyruvic_acid","Oxaloacetate","Oxaloacetate","Oxaloacetate","Malate","Asparate","Glycolysis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Pyruvate_carboxylase","Acetyl-CoA","Î’-oxidation","Redox","Malate","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Redox","Phosphoenolpyruvate","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase","Guanosine_triphosphate","Guanosine_diphosphate","Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase","Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate","Fructose_6-phosphate","Glucose-6-phosphate","Fructose_6-phosphate","Phosphoglucoisomerase","Lumen_(anatomy)","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Glucose-6-phosphatase","Glucose_transporter","Monosaccharide","Glycolysis","Glycogenesis","Glycogenolysis","Glycolysis","Hexokinase","Glucokinase","Phosphofructokinase","Pyruvate_kinase","Glucose-6-phosphatase","Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase","PEP_carboxykinase","Futile_cycle","Enzymes","Cytoplasm","Pyruvate_carboxylase","Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase","Mitochondrion","Cytosol","Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","Acetyl_CoA","Citrate","Pyruvate_kinase","Glucagon","Protein_kinase_A","Glucagon","Glucocorticoids"]}
