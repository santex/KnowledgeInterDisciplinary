Cicero followed\nPlato in defining the Great Year as a combination of solar, lunar and planetary\ncycles <ref name=\"archive.org\">http://archive.org/stream/denaturadeorumac00cice-\nuoft/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft_djvu.txt</ref> (61 XX) Nicholas Campion writes\nof \"periods of History, analogous to the solar year, known as 'Great Years' \"\n<ref name=\"Campion\">Nicholas Campion, \"The Great Year: Astrology, Millenarianism\nand History in the Western Tradition\" (Arkana/Penguin Books, 1994), p.6.</ref>\n\nPlato's description of the perfect year is found in his dialogue [[Timaeus\n(dialogue)|Timaeus]]\n\nIn De Natura Deorum, Cicero wrote\n\n\n\nBy extension, the term \"Great Year\" can also be used for any concept of eternal\nreturn in the world's mythologies or philosophies.
