Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the\nsinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared\nwith the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In\nhumans, the nose is located centrally on the face; on most other mammals, it is\non the upper tip of the snout.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Noses","recorded":1372152273,"links":[],"instances":["physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nose|","Human head and neck","Respiratory system","Olfactory system","Facial features"],"headings":["Air conditioning","Sense of direction","Structure in air-breathing forms","In fish","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration"],"related":["Dog","Vertebrate","Nostril","Respiration_(physiology)","Mouth","Olfactory_mucosa","Paranasal_sinus","Nasal_cavity","Pharynx","Respiratory_system","Mammal","Snout","Camel","Rhinarium","Amphibian","Lungfish","Choana","Caecilian","Vomeronasal_organ","Amniote","Salamander","Reptile","Crocodilian","Nasopharynx","Turbinate","Bird","Beak","Mammal","Dove","Fowl","Prehensile","Primate","Bat","Cetaceans","Palate","Oral_cavity","Paranasal_sinus","Cetacean","Elephant","Rodent","Teleost","Coelacanth","Mucus","Lamprey","Hagfish","Pituitary_gland","Heterostracan","Human_nose","Nasal_bridge","Rhinarium","Haplorrhini"]}
