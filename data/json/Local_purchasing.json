{"cursor":"9271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Local purchasing' is a preference to buy locally produced goods and services\nover those produced farther away. It is very often abbreviated as a positive\ngoal, \"buy local\", that parallels the phrase \"think globally, act locally\",\ncommon in green politics.\n\nOn the national level, the equivalent of local purchasing is import\nsubstitution, the deliberate industrial policy or agricultural policy of\nreplacing goods or services produced on the far side of a national border with\nthose produced on the near side, i.e., in the same country or trade bloc.\n\nHistorically, there have been so many incentives to buy locally that no one had\nto make any kind of point to do so, but with current market conditions, it is\noften cheaper to buy distantly produced goods, despite the added costs in terms\nof packaging, transport, inspection, retail facilities, etc. As such, one must\nnow often take explicit action if one wants to purchase locally produced goods.\n\nThese market conditions are based on externalized costs, argues local economy\nadvocates. Examples of externalized costs include the price of war, asthma, or\nclimate change, which are not typically included in the cost of a gallon of\nfuel, for instance. Most advocates for local economics address contracting and\ninvestment, as well as purchasing.\n\nAgricultural alternatives are being sought, and have manifested themselves in\nthe form of farmers' markets, farmed goods sold through the community\ncooperatives, urban gardens, and even school programs that endorse community\nagriculture.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Local_purchasing","recorded":1362574110,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Consumer behaviour","Localism"],"headings":["Rationale for local purchasing","Alternative viewpoints","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Think_globally,_act_locally","Green_politics","Import_substitution","Industrial_policy","Agricultural_policy","Trade_bloc","Packaging","Transport","Inspection","Retail","Asthma","Climate_change","Farmers'_market","Cooperatives","Urban_agriculture","Community_agriculture","Moral_purchasing","Agriculture","Manufacturing","Industrial_agriculture","Chemical_fertilizer","American_Independent_Business_Alliance","Deadweight_loss","Protectionism","Civic_agriculture","Community-based_economics","Comparative_advantage","Eco-communalism","Energy_economics","Fiscal_localism","Local_currency","Local_food","Local_ownership_import_substituting","There_is_no_alternative","Independent_Business_Alliance"]}
