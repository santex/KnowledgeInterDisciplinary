{"cursor":"15465","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In parliamentary procedure, a motion to 'table' has two different and\ncontradictory meanings: *In the United States, to table usually means the 'to\nlay [the topic] on the table' or 'to move for postponement of consideration'; a\nproposal to suspend consideration of a pending motion. Much less often, it\nmeans a motion to \"put on the table\": a proposal to begin consideration (or\nreconsideration), a usage consistent with the rest of the English-speaking\nworld. *In the rest of the English-speaking world such as the United Kingdom,\nto table means 'to move to place [the topic] upon the table' (or 'to move to\nplace on the table'): a proposal to begin consideration (or reconsideration) of\na proposal.\n\nBoth the American and the British dialects have the sense of \"to table\" as to\nlay [the topic] on the table or to cause [the topic] to lie on the table. The\ndifference is the idea of what the table is for, that of a shelf off to the\nside, or an active work bench.\n\nThe British meaning has the sense of the table as being an active work bench,\nwith the topic being the center of attention, considered and discussed by all\nuntil it can be resolved, at which point it is taken off the 'table'.\n\nThe American sense is that the table is like that of a shelf, archive, or long-\nterm storage device, where the topic has been disposed of by sending it to the\n'table' and leaving it there.\n","linknr":240,"url":"Table_(parliamentary_procedure)","recorded":1362478798,"links":13,"instances":["parliamentary_procedure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Subsidiary motions","Verbs"],"headings":["Use in the United States","Example of Anglo‚ÄêAmerican confusion","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["motion","parliamentary_procedure"]],"members":["motion"],"related":["Parliamentary_procedure","Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)","English-speaking_world","United_Kingdom","RONR","Main_motion","Subsidiary_motion","Nancy_Pelosi","United_States_Congress","Quarterly_time_interval","Objection_to_consideration_of_the_question","Postpone_indefinitely","Previous_question","United_States_Congress","Suspend_the_rules","Objection_to_consideration_of_the_question","Postpone_indefinitely","Previous_question","Temporary_majority","Postpone_indefinitely","The_Standard_Code_of_Parliamentary_Procedure","Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","Parliament","Westminster_system","Winston_Churchill"]}
