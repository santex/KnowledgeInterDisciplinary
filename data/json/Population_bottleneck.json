Such events are able to\nreduce the variation in the genepool of a population drastically. If there are\nnot enough individuals left or the ones that survived are not able to reproduce\nsufficiently to re-form the species population, that population may go\nextinct. [William R. Catton, Jr. âBottleneck: Humanity's Impending Impasseâ\nXlibris Corporation, 2009. 290 pp. ISBN 978-1-4415-2241-2] In consequence\nof such population size reductions and the loss of genetic variation the ability\nof a population to adapt to prevalent environment or selection like climatic\nchange or shift in available resources is reduced. This genetic drift can change\nthe proportional distribution of an allele by chance and even lead to fixation\nor loss of alleles. Due to the smaller population size after a bottleneck event,\nthe chance of inbreeding and genetic homogeneity increases and unfavoured\nalleles can accumulate. Thus an ecological bottleneck can lead to a genetic\nbottleneck in which the genetic variation within a population and the potential\nto adapt to a changing environment is decreasing.\n\nA slightly different form of a bottleneck can occur if a small group becomes\nreproductively (e.g. geographically) separated from the main population, for\nexample through a founder event. Population bottlenecks play an important role\nin conservation biology (see minimum viable population size) and in the context\nof agriculture (biological/pest control).
