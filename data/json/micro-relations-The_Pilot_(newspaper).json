Although the first\nCatholic newspaper in the United States, [[The Catholic Miscellany|The United\nStates Catholic Miscellany]] of Charleston, South Carolina, was founded seven\nyears earlier in 1822, it ceased publication in 1861.\n\nThe paper was founded by Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick, the second bishop of\nBoston, at a time of increased Irish immigration to the United States and rising\nanti-Catholic to the newcomers' church. In its first edition, Bishop Fenwick\nwrote that the newspaper's purpose was to defend against the \"crying calumnies\nand gross misrepresentations which in this section of the country have been so\nlong, so unsparingly, so cruelly heaped upon the Church.\" [http://infowanted.bc.edu/history/briefhistory/ A Brief History of\nthe Boston Pilot], Information Wanted, Database of Irish immigrants, Boston\nCollege, accessed 16 April 2011\n\nIn 1834, Fenwick sold the publication to two laymenâHenry Devereux, the\npublisher, and Patrick Donohue, an employee who quickly became the newspaper's\nsole proprietor. In 1838, Donohue became editor, and he maintained control of\nthe newspaper until his death in 1891. During much of the 19th century, The\nPilot acquired a reputation of being an Irish-American cultural newspaper. The\ngreat majority of Boston's Catholics were originally immigrants from Ireland,\nwith tens of thousands arriving during and after the Great Famine. Notable\neditors linked to the movement for Irish independence include John Boyle\nO'Reilly, James Jeffrey Roche and Thomas D'Arcy McGee.\n\nArchbishop William Henry O'Connell purchased the paper in 1908 and turned it\ninto the official voice of Boston's archdiocese. He closely monitored its\neditorial policies and sought to promote its readership among local Catholic\nfamilies. In 1979, The Pilot celebrated its 150th anniversary and featured\nspecial information about the newspaper's history. As of 2004, its circulation\nwas of 23,039 printed copies.\n\nIn 2006, the newspaper launched its online edition,\n[http://www.thebostonpilot.com/ TheBostonPilot.com], which offers expanded\ncontent and multimedia features.\n","linknr":127,"url":"The_Pilot_(newspaper)","recorded":1362576211,"links":17,"instances":["ireland","newspaper_format"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Roman Catholic newspapers in the United States","Publications established in 1829","Irish-American culture in Boston, Massachusetts"],"headings":["Titles","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/StPetersDomePD.jpg/30px-StPetersDomePD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Newspaper.svg/30px-Newspaper.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Flag_of_Massachusetts.svg/30px-Flag_of_Massachusetts.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tabloid","newspaper_format"],["great_famine","ireland"]],"members":["great_famine","tabloid"],"related":["Newspaper","Tabloid_(newspaper_format)","Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston","Seán_Patrick_O'Malley","Braintree,_Massachusetts","Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston","Charleston,_South_Carolina","Benedict_Joseph_Fenwick","Patrick_Donohue","Great_Famine_(Ireland)","John_Boyle_O'Reilly","James_Jeffrey_Roche","Thomas_D'Arcy_McGee","William_Henry_O'Connell","Archdiocese"]}
