Although approximation is most often applied to\nnumbers, it is also frequently applied to such things as mathematical functions,\nshapes, and physical laws.\n\nApproximations may be used because incomplete information prevents use of exact\nrepresentations. Many problems in physics are either too complex to solve\nanalytically, or impossible to solve using the available analytical tools. Thus,\neven when the exact representation is known, an approximation may yield a\nsufficiently accurate solution while reducing the complexity of the problem\nsignificantly.\n\nFor instance, physicists often approximate the shape of the Earth as a sphere\neven though more accurate representations are possible, because many physical\nbehaviours â e.g. gravity â are much easier to calculate for a sphere than for\nother shapes.\n\nIt is difficult to exactly analyze the motion of several planets orbiting a\nstar, for example, due to the complex interactions of the planets' gravitational\neffects on each other, so an approximate solution is effected by performing\niterations. In the first iteration, the planets' gravitational interactions are\nignored, and the star is assumed to be fixed. If a more precise solution is\ndesired, another iteration is then performed, using the positions and motions of\nthe planets as identified in the first iteration, but adding a first-order\ngravity interaction from each planet on the others. This process may be repeated\nuntil a satisfactorily precise solution is obtained. The use of perturbations to\ncorrect for the errors can yield more accurate solutions. Simulations of the\nmotions of the planets and the star also yields more accurate solutions.\n\nAs another example, in order to accelerate the convergence rate of evolutionary\nalgorithms, fitness approximationâthat leads to build model of the fitness\nfunction to choose smart search stepsâis a good solution.\n\nThe type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree\nof accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the\nsavings (usually in time and effort) that can be achieved by approximation.\n","linknr":191,"url":"approximation","recorded":1362676351,"links":43,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Approximations","Numerical analysis"],"headings":["Science","Mathematics","Unicode","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["limit","mathematics"],["proportionality","mathematics"]],"members":["proportionality","function","limit"],"related":["Number","Function_(mathematics)","Shape","Physical_law","Information","Physicists","Earth","Sphere","Gravity","Iteration","Perturbation_theory","Fitness_approximation","Information","Scientific_method","Measurement","Philosophy_of_science","Measurement","History_of_science","Mathematical_model","Newtonian_mechanics","Limit_(mathematics)","Experiment","Measurement","Correspondence_principle","Irrational_number","Pi","Significant_figures","Approximation_theory","Functional_analysis","Diophantine_approximation","Real_number","Rational_number","Asymptotic_analysis","≃","≃","≅","Isomorphism","Congruence_relation","~","Proportionality_(mathematics)","Japanese_language","Korean_language","Approximately_equals_sign","Approximation_error","Congruence_relation","Estimation","Fermi_estimate","Fitness_approximation","Least_squares","Linear_approximation","Newton's_method","Numerical_analysis","Orders_of_approximation","Runge–Kutta_methods","Successive_approximation_ADC","Taylor_series"]}
