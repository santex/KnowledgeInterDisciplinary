{"cursor":"31444","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Drug design', sometimes referred to as 'rational drug design' or more simply\nrational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on\nthe knowledge of a biological target. The drug\nis most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the\nfunction of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a\ntherapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design\ninvolves the design of small molecules that are complementary in shape and\ncharge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will\nbind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer\nmodeling techniques. This type of modeling is\noften referred to as 'computer-aided drug design'. Finally, drug design that\nrelies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular\ntarget is known as 'structure-based drug design'.\n\nThe phrase \"drug design\" is to some extent a misnomer. What is really meant by\ndrug design is ligand design (i.e., design of a small molecule that will bind\ntightly to its target). Although modeling\ntechniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there\nare many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, lack of\nside effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a\nsafe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to\noptimize using rational drug design techniques.\n","linknr":435,"url":"Drug_design","recorded":1362505165,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology","Design of experiments","Clinical research","Medicinal chemistry","Drug discovery"],"headings":["Background","Types","Rational drug discovery","Computer-aided drug design {{anchor|Computer-assisted drug design}}","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Flow_charts_of_two_strategies_of_structure_based_drug_design.jpg/500px-Flow_charts_of_two_strategies_of_structure_based_drug_design.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Flow_chart_for_structure_based_drug_design.jpg/500px-Flow_chart_for_structure_based_drug_design.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/8/e/08eb5c19a07998847fe0aefabd5b3eba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Wiki_Clustering.png/400px-Wiki_Clustering.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ligand","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry#selective_and_non-selective"]],"members":["ligand"],"related":["Rational_design","Invention","Medications","Biological_target","Organic_compound","Small_molecule","Biomolecule","Protein","Therapeutic_effect","Patient","Shape","Electric_charge","Molecular_modelling","Misnomer","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Bioavailability","Biological_half-life","Adverse_drug_reaction","Molecule","Metabolic_pathway","Signal_transduction","Pathology","Infectivity","Microorganism","Pathogen","Antitarget","Adverse_effect","Sequence_homology","Organic_compound","Small_molecule","Biologic_medical_product","MRNA","Gene_silencing","Pharmacophore","Quantitative_structure-activity_relationship","Tertiary_structure","Protein_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","Homology_modeling","Dissociation_constant","Medicinal_chemistry","Potential_energy_surface","Enthalpy","Entropy","Molecular_mechanics","Potential_of_mean_force","Drug_discovery","Trial-and-error","Cell_culture","Animal","Molecular_cloning","Protein_expression","Virtual_screening","Druglikeness","Oral_bioavailability","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","Lipophilic_efficiency","Bounded_rationality","Chemical_space","Adverse_effect","Computational_chemistry","Drugs","Molecule","Molecular_mechanics","Molecular_dynamics","Small_molecule","Semi-empirical_quantum_chemistry_method","Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods","Density_functional_theory","Polarizability","Scoring_functions_for_docking","Linear_regression","Machine_learning","Neural_net","Virtual_screening","Drug_discovery_hit_to_lead","Quantitative_structure-activity_relationship","Drug_development","QSAR","Dorzolamide","Imatinib","Tyrosine_kinase","Philadelphia_chromosome","Leukemia","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Acute_lymphocytic_leukemia","Cancer","Chemotherapy","Atypical_antipsychotic","Cimetidine","H2-receptor_antagonist","Cyclooxygenase","NSAID","Dorzolamide","Carbonic_anhydrase","Enfuvirtide","Nonbenzodiazepines","Zolpidem","Zopiclone","Probenecid","Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor","Antidepressant","Zanamivir","Antiviral_drug","Isentress","Development_of_nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor_agonists","Discovery_and_development_of_angiotensin_receptor_blockers","Bcr-Abl_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors","Discovery_and_development_of_CCR5_receptor_antagonists","Discovery_and_development_of_cyclooxygenase_2_inhibitors","Development_of_dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitors","Discovery_and_development_of_HIV_protease_inhibitors","Discovery_and_development_of_non-nucleoside_reverse_transcriptase_inhibitors","Discovery_and_development_of_proton_pump_inhibitors","Discovery_and_development_of_triptans","Discovery_and_development_of_TRPV1_antagonists","Discovery_and_Development_of_Renin_Inhibitors","C-Met_inhibitors","Bioinformatics","Cheminformatics","Drug_development","Drug_discovery","List_of_pharmaceutical_companies","Medicinal_chemistry","Molecular_Conceptor","Molecular_design_software"]}
