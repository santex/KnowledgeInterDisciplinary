WWFS'\n    studios are in the combined CBS Radio facility in the TriBeCa section of\n    Manhattan, and its transmitter sits atop the Empire State Building.\n\nWWFS is best remembered for its previous incarnation, rock music-formatted 'WNEW-\nFM'. The station shared the WNEW call letters between 1958 and 1986 with former\nsister AM station WNEW (1130Â kHz) and television station WNEW-TV (channel\n5), with all being owned by Metromedia. After WNEW-TV was sold to the News\nCorporation in 1986 (and became WNYW), and the AM station was sold to Bloomberg\nL.P. in 1992 (and became WBBR), 102.7 FM retained the WNEW-FM callsign until it\nwas changed in 2007.\n\nOn April 12, 2008, after an almost nine-year hiatus, the WNEW Rock format\nreturned on WWFS's 102.7 HD2 subchannel and wnew.com. CBS Radio has since reused\nthe WNEW call sign; the present-day WNEW-FM in the Washington, D.C., area is\nconnected to this station only through their common ownership.\n","linknr":925,"url":"WWFS","recorded":1362675602,"links":32,"instances":["singer","radio_format","band","am","am","am","fm","song","band","band","radio_personality","broadcasting","song","rosko_mercer","musician","united_states","radio"],"pdf":["http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/53-OCR/11-02-BC-0110.pdf","http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/55-OCR/1955-09-26-BC-0102.pdf","http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/55-OCR/1955-10-31-BC-0108.pdf","http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/56-OCR/1956-12-17-BC-0119.pdf","http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-11-18-BC-0096.pdf","http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/58-OCR/1958-01-06-BC-0095.pdf"],"categories":["Radio
