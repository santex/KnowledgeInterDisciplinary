{"cursor":"21317","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe '1280s' is the decade starting January 1, 1280 and ending December 31, 1289.\n\nEurope in the 1280s was marked by naval warfare on the Mediterranean and\nconsolidation of power by the major states. Ongoing struggles over the control\nof Sicily provoked lengthy naval warfare: after the Sicilian Vespers rebellion,\nthe French Angevins struggled against Aragon for control of the island. King\nRudolph I of Germany established the Habsburg dynasty in Austria when he\ninvested his two sons with power there. In England, King Edward I of England\ncompleted the conquest of Wales and annexed the territory via the Statute of\nRhuddlan; he also constructed a series of castles in Wales to suppress any\nfuture rebellions. Edward I also established several important legal traditions,\nincluding a court system to hear claims on the king's behalf and a codification\nof the separation of church and state legal powers. The death of King Alexander\nIII of Scotland fomented political wrangling in Scotland which would soon lead\nto increased English influence over Scotland. In Sweden, King Magnus I of Sweden\nfounded a Swedish nobility.\n\nIn Asia, the Mongols continued to expand their territories, although at a slower\npace and with less success than in previous decades. Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty\nestablished control over the Khmer Empire in Cambodia, the Pagan Empire in\nMyanmar, and a kingdom of Laos, but failed a second attempted invasion of Japan\nand was twice defeated in attempted invasions of Vietnam. The Thai kingdoms of\nLanna and Sukhothai also exercised power in the region, avoiding conflict with\nthe Yuan Dynasty to the north. Across the continent in the Middle East, the\nMamluk sultanate of Egypt continued to extinguish crusader states under the\nleadership of Qalawun, capturing Margat, Latakia, and the County of Tripoli. In\nAnatolia, Osman I became a local chief, or [[bey]], planting the seed that would\neventually grow into the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe 1280s was also a busy decade in culture. In Thailand, King Ramkhamhaeng the\nGreat invented the Thai alphabet. In the Netherlands, the St. Lucia's flood\nkilled 50,000 while creating the Zuider Zee, thus giving Amsterdam the sea\naccess it would later need to rise to prominence as an important port. In legal\nreforms, King Edward I of England started the use of drawing and quartering as\npunishment for traitors, King Philip IV of France created the gabelle, an\nonerous tax on salt, and the Scots Parliament passed laws allowing women to\npropose marriage to men, but only in leap years. The northern branch of the\nGrand Canal of China was constructed during the first half of the decade, the\nUppsala Cathedral was begun, and a partial collapse set back construction of the\nCathÃ©drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais in a blow to the aspirations of its Gothic\narchitecture. Colleges at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded.\nThe cities of Al Mansurah, Egypt and Guiyang, China were founded, while Hamburg,\nGermany burnt to the ground in a catastrophic fire. Jews continued to be\npersecuted across Europe, while Taoists suffered under Kublai Khan's Yuan\nDynasty in China.\n","linknr":552,"url":"1280s","recorded":1362572001,"links":73,"instances":["1284","cairo","habsburg","maid_of_norway","duchy","scotland","ethnic_group","coin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1280s|"],"headings":["War
