They are\ndistinct from one another in their relations of origin: as the Fourth Lateran\nCouncil declared, \"it is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and\nthe Holy Spirit who proceeds\". While distinct in their relations with one\nanother, they are one in all else. The whole work of creation and grace is a\nsingle operation common to all three divine persons, who at the same time\noperate according to their unique properties, so that all things are from the\nFather, through the Son and in the Holy Spirit.<ref\nname=\"Catholic_Catechism_Trinity\"/> The three persons are co-equal, co-eternal\nand consubstantial.\n\nTrinitarianism contrasts with nontrinitarian positions which include\nBinitarianism (one deity in two persons, or two deities), Unitarianism (one\ndeity in one person, analogous to Jewish interpretation of the [[Shema]] and\nMuslim belief in [[Tawhid]]), Oneness Pentecostalism or Modalism (one deity\nmanifested in three separate aspects), and social trinitarianism (three persons\nunited by mutual love and accord).\n",
