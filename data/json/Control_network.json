{"cursor":"1102","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In geodesy and surveying a 'control network' or simply 'control', is a set of\nreference-points of known geospatial coordinates. The higher-order (high\nprecision, usually millimeter-to-decimeter on a scale of continents) control\npoints are normally defined in both space and time using global or space\ntechniques, and are used for \"lower-order\" points to be tied into. The lower-\norder control points are normally used for engineering, construction and\nnavigation. The scientific discipline that deals with the establishing of\ncoordinates of points in a high-order control network is called geodesy, and the\ntechnical discipline that does the same for points in a low-order control\nnetwork is called surveying.\n\nClassically, a control is divided into horizontal (X-Y) and vertical (Z)\ncontrols (components of the control), however with the advent of satellite\nnavigation systems, GPS in particular, this division is becoming obsolete.\n","linknr":82,"url":"Control_network","recorded":1362477619,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geodesy","Surveying","Civil engineering"],"headings":[],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Geodesy","Surveying","Geospatial","Coordinates","Engineering","Construction","Navigation","Geodesy","Surveying","Satellite_navigation","GPS"]}
