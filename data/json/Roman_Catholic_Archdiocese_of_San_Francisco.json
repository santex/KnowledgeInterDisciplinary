It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties\nof Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was\ncanonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the\nCathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption.\n\nThe first church in the Archdiocese of San Francisco is older than the\nArchdiocese itself; Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s was founded on June 29, 1776\nby Franciscan Friars. The mission church that stands today was completed in 1791\nand attached next door is Mission Dolores Basilica. The Franciscans who founded\nthe mission also are credited with naming the City and County of San Francisco,\nand the entire region, after their patron, Saint Francis of\nAssisi.\n\nFrom his installation on February 15, 2006 until the acceptance of his\nresignation on July 27, 2012, the archdiocese was led by Archbishop Emeritus\nGeorge Hugh Niederauer, formerly the bishop of the Diocese of Salt Lake City.\nThe current auxiliary bishops of the archdiocese are William J.\nJustice and Robert W. McElroy. On July 27, 2012, the Holy\nSee announced that it had accepted the retirement of Niederauer and appointed\nSalvatore J. Cordileone as new archbishop of San Francisco, installed on October\n4, 2012, the patronal Feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi at the Cathedral of\nSaint Mary of the Assumption. http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/New-S-F-archbishop-\nappointed-by-pope-\n3740657.php http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1203179.htm He had previously been Bishop of Oakland, California.\n\nThe See of San Francisco is administered by the Archbishop of San Francisco, who\nas metropolitan oversees the entire ecclesiastical province of San Francisco.\nIts suffragans include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno,\nSacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Stockton.\n\nSan Francisco once included among its suffragans the former dioceses of Grass\nValley, Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, Monterey, Monterey-\nFresno, and Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles.\n\nThe Chancellery Office of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, originally located\nin 1853 at California and Dupont Streets, moved in 1891 to 1100 Franklin Street,\nin 1955 re-located to 445 Church Street, near Mission Dolores. The present\nheadquarters of the Archdiocese of San Francisco are located at One Peter Yorke\nWay, a short street in San Francisco named after Father Peter Yorke, an Irish-\nAmerican Catholic priest. Peter Yorke Way and Starr King Way are off of Geary\nStreet as it becomes Geary Boulevard.\n","linknr":332,"url":"Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco","recorded":1375084433,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_San_Francisco","/wiki/File:Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco.svg/175px-Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco.svg.png","/wiki/County_(United_States)","/wiki/San_Francisco_County,_California","/wiki/San_Mateo_County,_California","/wiki/Marin_County,_California","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_province","/wiki/San_Francisco,_California","/wiki/California","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Roman_Rite","/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Mary_of_the_Assumption","/wiki/Mission_San_Francisco_de_As%C3%ADs","/wiki/St._Francis_of_Assisi","/wiki/Pope_Francis","/wiki/Salvatore_Cordileone","/wiki/William_J._Justice","/wiki/Robert_W._McElroy","/wiki/George_Hugh_Niederauer","/wiki/John_Raphael_Quinn","/wiki/William_Levada","/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith","/wiki/Ignatius_C._Wang","/wiki/File:Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco_map_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco_map_1.png/220px-Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco_map_1.png","http://www.sfarchdiocese.org/","/wiki/File:St_Mary%27s_Cathedral_-_San_Francisco.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/St_Mary%27s_Cathedral_-_San_Francisco.jpg/220px-St_Mary%27s_Cathedral_-_San_Francisco.jpg","/wiki/File:St_Mary%27s_Cathedral_-_San_Francisco.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Diocese","/wiki/Catholic_Church","/wiki/California","/wiki/San_Francisco,_California","/wiki/Marin_County,_California","/wiki/San_Mateo_County,_California","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Pope","/wiki/Pius_IX","/wiki/Cathedral","/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Mary_of_the_Assumption","/wiki/Mission_San_Francisco_de_As%C3%ADs","/wiki/Franciscan","/wiki/Mission_Dolores","/wiki/City_and_County_of_San_Francisco","/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Archbishop","/wiki/George_Hugh_Niederauer","/wiki/Diocese_of_Salt_Lake_City","/wiki/Auxiliary_bishop","/wiki/William_J._Justice","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Robert_W._McElroy","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Holy_See","/wiki/Salvatore_J._Cordileone","/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi","/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Mary_of_the_Assumption","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Bishop","/wiki/Oakland","/wiki/California","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archbishop_of_San_Francisco","/wiki/Metropolitan_bishop","/wiki/Ecclesiastical_province","/wiki/Suffragan","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Honolulu","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Las_Vegas","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Oakland","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Reno","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Sacramento","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Salt_Lake_City","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_San_Jose_in_California","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Santa_Rosa_in_California","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Stockton","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Grass_Valley","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Monterey","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Monterey-Fresno","/wiki/Peter_Yorke","#Archbishops","#Cathedrals","#Parishes","#Secondary_schools","#Marin_County","#San_Francisco_County","#San_Mateo_County","#Seminaries","#Recognized_lay_ecclesial_movements","#Province_of_San_Francisco","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_San_Francisco&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Joseph_Sadoc_Alemany","/wiki/Patrick_William_Riordan","/wiki/Edward_Joseph_Hanna","/wiki/John_Joseph_Mitty","/wiki/Joseph_Thomas_McGucken","/wiki/John_Raphael_Quinn","/wiki/William_Joseph_Levada","/wiki/George_Hugh_Niederauer","/wiki/Salvatore_Joseph_Cordileone","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Episcopal_conference","/wiki/Edward_Hanna","/wiki/National_Catholic_Welfare_Council","/wiki/National_Catholic_Welfare_Conference","/wiki/John_R._Quinn","/wiki/National_Conference_of_Catholic_Bishops","/wiki/United_States_Catholic_Conference","#cite_note-Adoremus-9",
