The tool's axes of movement may be literally a straight line,\nor they may be along some set of curves or angles, but they are essentially\nlinear (in the nonmathematical sense). Usually the term \"turning\" is reserved\nfor the generation of external surfaces by this cutting action, whereas this\nsame essential cutting action when applied to internal surfaces (that is, holes,\nof one kind or another) is called \"boring\". Thus the phrase \"turning and boring\"\ncategorizes the larger family of (essentially similar) processes. The cutting of\nfaces on the workpiece (that is, surfaces perpendicular to its rotating axis),\nwhether with a turning or boring tool, is called \"facing\", and may be lumped\ninto either category as a subset.\n\nTurning can be done manually, in a traditional form of lathe, which frequently\nrequires continuous supervision by the operator, or by using an automated lathe\nwhich does not. Today the most common type of such automation is computer\nnumerical control, better known as CNC. (CNC is also commonly used with many\nother types of machining besides turning.)\n\nWhen turning, a piece of relatively rigid material (such as wood, metal,\nplastic, or stone) is rotated and a cutting tool is traversed along 1, 2, or 3\naxes of motion to produce precise diameters and depths. Turning can be either on\nthe outside of the cylinder or on the inside (also known as boring) to produce\ntubular components to various geometries. Although now quite rare, early lathes\ncould even be used to produce complex geometric figures, even the platonic\nsolids; although since the advent of CNC it has become unusual to use non-\ncomputerized toolpath control for this purpose.\n\nThe turning processes are typically carried out on a lathe, considered to be the\noldest machine tools, and can be of four different types such as straight\nturning, taper turning, profiling or external grooving. Those types of turning\nprocesses can produce various shapes of materials such as straight, conical,\ncurved, or grooved workpiece. In general, turning uses simple single-point\ncutting tools. Each group of workpiece materials has an optimum set of tools\nangles which have been developed through the years.\n\nThe bits of waste metal from turning operations are known as chips (North\nAmerica), or swarf (Britain). In some areas they may be known as turnings.\n","title":"turning","headings":["Turning operations","Lathes","Tooling","Dynamics of turning","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Machining","2: Tool_bit","1: Helix","1: Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis","1: Lathe","1: Computer_numerical_control","1: Platonic_solids","1: Swarf","1: Casting","1: Forging","1: Extrusion","1: Rockwell_scale","1: Heat_treatment","1: Drilling","1: Drill_bits","1: Knurling","1: Reaming","1: Polygonal_turning","1: Engine_lathe","1: Turret_lathe","1: Mass_production","1: Collet","1: Lathe_faceplate","1: Drive_center","1: Speeds_and_feeds","1: Hard_turning","1: Surface_feet_per_minute","1: Woodturning"]}
