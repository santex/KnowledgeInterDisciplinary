This occurs after dusk. The opposite of night\nis day (or \"daytime\" to distinguish it from \"day\" as used for a 24-hour period).\nThe start and end points of time of a night vary based on factors such as\nseason, latitude, longitude and timezone.\n\nAt any given time, one side of the planet Earth is bathed in light from the Sun\n(the daytime) and the other side of the Earth is in the shadow caused by the\nEarth blocking the light of the sun. This shadow is what we call the darkness of\nnight. Natural illumination is still provided by a combination of moonlight,\nplanetary light, starlight, diffuse zodiacal light, gegenschein, and airglow. In\nsome circumstances, bioluminescence, aurorae, and lightning can provide some\nillumination. The glow provided by artificial illumination is sometimes referred\nto as light pollution because it can interfere with observational astronomy and\necosystems.\n","title":"night","headings":["Duration and geography","On other celestial bodies","Impact on life","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Earth","2: Light_pollution","2: Midnight","1: Time","1: Sun","1: Horizon","1: Dusk","1: Day","1: Season","1: Latitude","1: Longitude","1: Timezone","1: Moonlight","1: Planet","1: Starlight","1: Zodiacal_light","1: Gegenschein","1: Airglow","1: Bioluminescence","1: Lightning","1: Observational_astronomy","1: Ecosystem","1: Arc_minute","1: Refraction","1: Autumnal_equinox","1: Vernal_equinox","1: Equinox","1: Equator","1: Geographical_pole","1: Solstice","1: North_Pole","1: South_Pole","1: High_latitude","1: Low_latitude","1: Northern_Hemisphere","1: Denmark","1: India","1: Southern_Hemisphere","1: Antarctica","1: Chile","1: Norse_mythology","1: Peter_Nicolai_Arbo","1: Celestial_body","1: Venus","1: Jupiter","1: Sidereal_day","1: Planetary_habitability","1: Extraterrestrial_life","1: Energy","1: Life","1: Physiology","1: Behavior","1: Sleep","1: Nocturnal_animal","1: Moth","1: Animal","1: Plant","1: Crassulacean_acid_metabolism","1: Carbon_fixation","1: Photosynthesis","1: Carbon_dioxide","1: Organic_acid","1: Carbohydrate","1: Stomata","1: Transpiration","1: Water","1: Lighting","1: Industrial_Revolution","1: Economy","1: Nightclub","1: Convenience_store","1: Filling_station","1: Police_station","1: Moon_light","1: Fear","1: Visual_perception","1: Spiritualism","1: Vampire","1: Werewolf","1: Ghost","1: Saxons","1: Night_club","1: Muhammad","1: Abraham","1: Earth_clock","1: Earth's_shadow","1: Night_Aviation_Regulations","1: Night_sky","1: Nightlife","1: Nocturne","1: Olbers'_paradox"]}
