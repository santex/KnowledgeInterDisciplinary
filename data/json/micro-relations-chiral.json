The word chirality is derived from the Greek, ÏÎµÎ¹Ï (kheir), \"hand\", a\nfamiliar chiral object.\n\nAn object or a system is 'chiral' if it is not identical to its mirror image,\nthat is, it cannot be onto it. A chiral object and its mirror image are called\n'enantiomorphs' (Greek opposite forms) or, when referring to molecules,\n'[[enantiomers]]'. A non-chiral object is called 'achiral' (sometimes also\n'amphichiral') and can be superposed on its mirror image.\n\nThe term was first used by Lord Kelvin in an address in 1904. In a lecture given\nin Johns Hopkins University on \"Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light\"\nhe stated:\n\nI call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say\nthat it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot\nbe brought to coincide with\nitself. [http://petitjeanmichel.free.fr/itoweb.petitjean.html The\nMathematical Theory of Chirality] by Michel Petitjean.\n\nHuman hands are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality:\nThe left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter\nhow the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of\nboth hands to coincide. Georges Henry WagniÃ¨re, On Chirality\nand the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image (2007).\nThis difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the\nright hand of a person using his left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed\non a right hand. In mathematics chirality is the property of a figure that is\nnot identical to its mirror image.\n","linknr":249,"url":"chiral","recorded":1362584130,"links":32,"instances":["mathematics","physics","mathematics","physics","knot_theory","waves","mathematics","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chirality|","Scientific terminology"],"headings":["Mathematics","Physics","Chemistry","Biology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Chirality_with_hands.svg/200px-Chirality_with_hands.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Orbifold_2X.2.svg/200px-Orbifold_2X.2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Knot_table.svg/200px-Knot_table.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light_Right.Handed.Animation.305x190.255Colors.gif/200px-Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light_Right.Handed.Animation.305x190.255Colors.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Betaine-Alanine.png/200px-Betaine-Alanine.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Neptunea_-_links%26rechts_gewonden.jpg/200px-Neptunea_-_links%26rechts_gewonden.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crossing_number","knot_theory"],["rotation","mathematics"],["translation","geometry"],["figure-eight_knot","mathematics"],["knot","mathematics"],["figure-eight_knot","mathematics"],["spin","physics"],["parity","physics"],["polarization","waves"],["orientation","geometry"],["orientation","mathematics"]],"members":["rotation","spin","knot","parity","crossing_number","polarization","orientation","translation"],"related":["Asymmetry","Greek_language","Mirror_image","William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin","Johns_Hopkins_University","Hand","Crossing_number_(knot_theory)","Mathematics","Rotation_(mathematics)","Translation_(geometry)","Helix","Möbius_strip","Tetris","Knot_theory","Right-hand_rule","Geometry","Symmetry_group","Axis_of_symmetry","Plane_of_symmetry","Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics)","Knot_(mathematics)","Amphichiral_knot","Unknot","Figure-eight_knot_(mathematics)","Trefoil_knot","Spin_(physics)","Parity_(physics)","Dirac_fermion","Light","Physics","Astronomy","Electromagnetic_radiation","Wave_propagation","Handedness","Polarization_(waves)","Circular_dichroism","Electromagnetic_wave","Orientation_(geometry)","Periodic_function","Euclidean_vector","Amplitude","Electric_field","Molecule","Mirror_image","Asymmetric_carbon","Enantiomer","Isomer","Right-handed","Stereochemistry","Inorganic_chemistry","Organic_chemistry","Physical_chemistry","Biochemistry","Supramolecular_chemistry","Neptunea_despecta","Gastropod","Fine_motor_skill","Hands","Dexterity","Facial_asymmetry","Summer_flounder","Halibut","Orientation_(mathematics)","Stereochemistry","Right-hand_rule","Handedness","Asymmetry"]}
