They include DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA\n(ribonucleic acid). Together with proteins, nucleic acids are the most important\nbiological macromolecules; each is found in abundance in all living things,\nwhere they function in encoding, transmitting and expressing genetic\ninformation.\n\nNucleic acids were discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1869.\nExperimental studies of nucleic acids constitute a major part of modern\nbiological and medical research, and form a foundation for genome and forensic\nscience, as well as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Nucleic_acids","recorded":1362504253,"links":78,"instances":["molecular_biology","nucleic_acid","nucleic_acid"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/291/5507/1304.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/291/5507/1304.pdf"],"categories":["Nucleic acids|","Genetics"],"headings":["Occurrence and nomenclature<ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book |author=Alberts, Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-8153-4105-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>","Molecular composition and size<ref name=\"Stryer\" />","Topology","Nucleic acid sequences","Types of nucleic acids","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/RNA-comparedto-DNA_thymineAndUracilCorrected.png/300px-RNA-comparedto-DNA_thymineAndUracilCorrected.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology"],["gna","nucleic_acid"],["tna","nucleic_acid"]],"members":["directionality","tna","gna"],"related":["Macromolecule","Life","DNA","RNA","Protein","Macromolecule","Friedrich_Miescher","Biological_research","Medical_research","Genomics","Forensic_science","Biotechnology","Pharmaceutical_industry","Biopolymer","Polynucleotide","Cell_nucleus","Cell_nucleus","Eukaryote","Bacteria","Archaea","Mitochondrion","Chloroplast","Virus","Viroid","Nucleotide","Ribose","Deoxyribose","Phosphate","Nucleobase","Enzyme","Solid-phase_synthesis","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Small_interfering_RNA","Chromosome_1","Reoviridae","M13_bacteriophage","Triple-stranded_DNA","G-quadruplex","Polymer","Purine","Pyrimidine","Nucleobase","Pentose","Sugar","Phosphate","Nucleoside","Deoxyribose","Ribose","Hydroxyl_group","Adenine","Cytosine","Guanine","Thymine","Uracil","Phosphodiester","Nucleic_acid_nomenclature","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Transfer_RNA","Base_pair","Nucleic_acid_double_helix","Nucleic_acid_tertiary_structure","Plasmid","Mitochondrial_DNA","RNA_splicing","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Genetics","DNA_sequencing","Messenger_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Noncoding_RNA","Nucleic_acid_analogues","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Morpholino","Locked_nucleic_acid","GNA_(nucleic_acid)","TNA_(nucleic_acid)","History_of_biochemistry","History_of_molecular_biology","History_of_RNA_biology","List_of_nucleic_acid_simulation_software","Molecular_biology","Nucleic_acid_structure","Nucleic_acid_methods","Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Quantification_of_nucleic_acids"]}
