During\nthe early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and especially\nNewton, laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. It is\na branch of classical physics that deals with the particles that are moving\neither with less velocity or that are at rest. It can also be defined as a\nbranch of science which deals with the motion and force of the particular\nobject.
