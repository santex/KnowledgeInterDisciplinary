For liquids, it corresponds to the informal\nnotion of \"thickness\". For example, honey has a higher viscosity than\nwater.<ref> {{cite book\n| author = Symon, Keith title = Mechanics edition = Third publisher = Addison-\n| Wesley year = 1971 isbn = 0-201-07392-7\n}} </ref>\n\nViscosity is due to friction between neighboring parcels of the fluid that are\nmoving at different velocities. When fluid is forced through a tube, the fluid\ngenerally moves faster near the axis and very slowly near the walls, therefore\nsome stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is\nneeded to overcome the friction between layers and keep the fluid moving. For\nthe same velocity pattern, the stress required is proportional to the fluid's\nviscosity. A liquid's viscosity depends on the size and shape of its particles\nand the attractions between the particles.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an 'ideal fluid' or\n'inviscid fluid'. Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures, in\nsuperfluids. Otherwise all fluids have positive viscosity. If the viscosity is\nvery high, for instance in pitch, the fluid will appear to be a solid in the\nshort term. A liquid whose viscosity is less than that of water is sometimes\nknown as a 'mobile' liquid, while a substance with a viscosity substantially\ngreater than water is called a 'viscous' liquid.\n","title":"viscosity","headings":["Etymology","Definition","Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids","Viscosity in solids","Viscosity measurement","Units","Molecular origins","Viscosity of selected substances","Viscosity of slurry","Viscosity of amorphous materials","Eddy viscosity","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Second","4: Fluid","4: Water","3: Shear_stress","3: Newtonian_fluid","3: Non-Newtonian_fluid","3: Glass","3: Celsius","2: Honey","2: Reynolds_number","2: Compressible_fluid","2: Gas","2: James_Clerk_Maxwell","2: Viscoelasticity","2: Amorphous_solid","2: Rheometer","2: Physical_unit","2: ASTM","2: Reyn","2: Viscosity_index","2: Kinematic_viscosity","2: Carbon_dioxide","2: Hydrogen","2: Helium","2: Motor_oil","1: Kilogram","1: Metre","1: Shear_modulus","1: Time","1: Tensile_stress","1: Friction","1: Velocity","1: Pressure","1: Cryogenics","1: Superfluid","1: Latin","1: Mistletoe","1: Birdlime","1: Couette_flow","1: Linear_function","1: Derivative","1: Perpendicular","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Differential_equation","1: IUPAC","1: Density","1: Inertia","1: Sound","1: Shock_wave","1: Strain_rate","1: Hydrostatic_pressure","1: Strain_rate_tensor","1: Gradient","1: Degrees_of_freedom","1: Isotropic","1: Constitutive_equation","1: Hooke's_law","1: Fick's_law","1: Ohm's_law","1: Shear_thickening","1: Shear_thinning","1: Thixotropic","1: Rheopectic","1: Bingham_plastic","1: Magnetorheological_fluid","1: Magnetic_field","1: Granite","1: Polymers","1: Linear_combination","1: Geology","1: Rheid","1: Viscometer","1: Newtonian_fluids","1: Zahn_cup","1: Efflux_time","1: Ford_viscosity_cup","1: Extensional_stress","1: Volume_viscosity","1: Acoustic_rheometer","1: Apparent_viscosity","1: Drilling_fluid","1: SI","1: Cgs","1: Jean_Louis_Marie_Poiseuille","1: George_Gabriel_Stokes","1: Thermal_diffusivity","1: Diffusion_coefficient","1: Dimensionless_number","1: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Centimetre","1: Gram","1: Engineering","1: Ideal_solution","1: GreenâKubo_relations","1: Transient_Time_Correlation_Function","1: Molecular_dynamics","1: Fluid_mechanics","1: Momentum","1: Ideal_gas","1: Air","1: Nitrogen","1: Oxygen","1: Carbon_monoxide","1: Ammonia","1: Sulfur_dioxide","1: Chapman-Enskog_theory","1: Boltzmann_constant","1: Temperature_dependence_of_liquid_viscosity","1: Semi-solid","1: Earth's_atmosphere","1: Argon","1: Xenon","1: Methane","1: Ethane","1: Blood","1: Molasses","1: Chocolate_syrup","1: Chocolate","1: Ketchup","1: Lard","1: Peanut_butter","1: Shortening","1: Liquid","1: Acetone","1: Benzene","1: Castor_bean","1: Corn_syrup","1: Ethanol","1: Ethylene_glycol","1: Glycerol","1: Fuel_oil","1: Methanol","1: Nitrobenzene","1: Liquid_nitrogen","1: Propan-1-ol","1: Olive_oil","1: Sulfuric_acid","1: Solid","1: Asthenosphere","1: Upper_mantle","1: Lower_mantle","1: Slurry","1: Slurry#Volumetric_fraction_from_mass_fraction","1: Arrhenius_equation","1: Glass_transition_temperature","1: Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann_equation","1: Enthalpy_of_formation","1: Enthalpy","1: Turbulence","1: Energy","1: Ocean","1: Deborah_number","1: Dilatant","1: HerschelâBulkley_fluid","1: Hyperviscosity_syndrome","1: Intrinsic_viscosity","1: Inviscid_flow","1: Morton_number","1: Relative_viscosity","1: Trouton's_ratio","1: Two-dimensional_point_vortex_gas","1: Joback_method","1: Microviscosity","1: Rheology","1: Superfluid_helium-4","1: Stokes_flow","1: Van_Nostrand","1: United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency"]}
