a\nsaloon or sedan car, the latter type often including derivatives with open backs\n(such as pick-up trucks). There are vans in all shapes and sizes, ranging from\nthe classic van version of the tiny Mini to much larger vehicles such as the\nMercedes Sprinter, Ford E-Series, and Nissan commercial vehicles. Vans run up to\nabout 4 tons and are classified as Light Duty Trucks (North America) or Light\nCommercial Vehicles (Europe). Similar larger vehicles are lorries (full sized\ntrucks), and are not known as vans.\n","title":"van","headings":["Word usage and etymology","Examples","Usage","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Minivan","3: Cutaway_van_chassis","2: British_English","2: Mercedes_Sprinter","2: Minibus","2: Second_stage_manufacturer","2: Ambulance","2: Panel_van","2: Safety_belt","1: Vehicle","1: Transporting","1: Sedan_car","1: Pick-up_truck","1: Mini","1: Ford_E-Series","1: Truck","1: Lublin_van","1: List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language","1: White_Van_Man","1: Working_class","1: Ford_Transit","1: Semi-trailer","1: Refrigeration","1: Car","1: Light_truck","1: Recreational_vehicle","1: School_bus","1: Front_wheel_drive","1: Four_wheel_drive","1: Seating_capacity","1: Mazda_Bongo","1: Subaru_360","1: Nissan_Prairie","1: Mitsubishi_Chariot","1: Microvan","1: Kei_car","1: Australian_English","1: Holden","1: Ford_Australia","1: Full_size_van","1: Travel_trailer","1: Crimea","1: Sedan_Delivery","1: Compact_van","1: Volkswagen_Type_2","1: Chevrolet_Greenbrier","1: Ford_Econoline#1961–1967_Compact_Van","1: Dodge_A100","1: Dodge_Sportsman","1: Custom_van","1: Harvard_Square","1: Cambridge,_Massachusetts","1: Sammy_Johns","1: Dodge_Sprinter","1: Carpool","1: Hotel","1: Airport","1: Commuter","1: Parking","1: Intermural","1: AgesandAges","1: United_States","1: Center_of_gravity","1: Cargo_barriers","1: Van_mat","1: Car_mats","1: Campervan","1: Conversion_van","1: Ice_cream_van","1: Kebab_van","1: List_of_vans","1: Public_light_bus","1: Sedan_delivery","1: Station_wagon"]}
