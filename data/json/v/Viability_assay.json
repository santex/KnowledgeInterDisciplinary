{"cursor":"5632","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'viability assay' is an assay to determine the ability of cells or tissues to\nmaintain or recover its . For example, examining the ratio of potassium to\nsodium in cells indicates viability. If the cells do not have high intracellular\npotassium and low intracellular sodium, then (1) the cell membrane may not be\nintact, and/or (2) the sodium-potassium pump may not be operating well\n As with many kinds of viability assays, quantitative\nmeasures of physiological function do not indicate whether damage repair and\nrecovery is possible. An assay of the ability of a cell line to\nadhere and divide may be more indicative of incipient damage than membrane\nintegrity.  Fluorescent-based assays do not require large sample\nsizes. Viability assays are used to assess the success of\ncryopreservation techniques, the toxicity of substances, or the effectiveness of\nsubstances in mitigating effects of toxic substances.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Viability_assay","recorded":1362481330,"links":13,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.21cm.com/pdfs/hippo_published.pdf","http://www.21cm.com/pdfs/hippo_published.pdf"],"categories":["Laboratory techniques","Microbiology techniques","Toxicology tests"],"headings":["Classification of viability assays","List of common viability assays","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["tissue","cell"],"related":["Assay","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Potassium","Sodium","Cell_membrane","Na+/K+-ATPase","Cell_culture","Fluorescence","Cryopreservation","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Propidium_iodide","Trypan_blue","7-Aminoactinomycin_D","Formazan","MTT_assay","Apoptosis","Fertility","Gamete","Red_blood_cell","Erythrocyte_deformability","Osmotic_fragility","Hemolysis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hemoglobin","DNA_microarray","ATP_test","Clonogenic_assay","Ethidium_homodimer_assay","Evans_blue","Fluorescein_diacetate_hydrolysis","Propidium_iodide","Flow_cytometry","Formazan","MTT_assay","Green_fluorescent_protein","Lactate_dehydrogenase","Propidium_iodide","Necrosis","Apoptosis","Cell_(biology)","Trypan_Blue","TUNEL_assay","Vital_stain"]}
