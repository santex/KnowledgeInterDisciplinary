Vicinity Corporation provided the [[MapBlast]] web\n:mapping service in the late 1990s.\n\n'Surroundings' are the area around a given physical or geographical point or\nplace. The exact definition depends on the field. Surroundings can also be used\nin geography (when it is more precisely known as vicinity, or vicinage) and\nmathematics, as well as philosophy, with the literal or metaphorically extended\ndefinition.\n\nIn thermodynamics, the term (and its synonym, environment) is used in a more\nrestricted sense, meaning everything outside the thermodynamic system. Often,\nthe simplifying assumptions are that energy and matter may move freely within\nthe surroundings, and that the surroundings have a uniform composition.\n","title":"Surroundings","headings":["See also"]},"micro-relation":["1: Geography","1: Thermodynamics","1: Energy","1: Matter","1: Biophysical_environment","1: Social_environment","1: Proximity"]}
