Examples of systems\nfor which vulnerability assessments are performed include, but are not limited\nto, information technology systems, energy supply systems, water supply systems,\ntransportation systems, and communication systems. Such assessments may be\nconducted on behalf of a range of different organizations, from small businesses\nup to large regional infrastructures. Vulnerability from the perspective of\ndisaster management means assessing the threats from potential hazards to the\npopulation and to infrastructure. It may be conducted in the political, social,\neconomic or environmental fields.\n\nVulnerability assessment has many things in common with risk assessment.\nAssessments are typically performed according to the following steps:\n\n# Cataloging assets and capabilities (resources) in a system. Assigning\n# quantifiable value (or at least rank order) and importance to those resources\n# Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each resource\n# Mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for the most\n# valuable resources\n\n\"Classical risk analysis is principally concerned with investigating the risks\nsurrounding a plant (or some other object), its design and operations. Such\nanalysis tend to focus on causes and the direct consequences for the studied\nobject. Vulnerability analysis, on the other hand, focus both on consequences\nfor the object itself and on primary and secondary consequences for the\nsurrounding environment. It also concerns itself with the possibilities of\nreducing such consequences and of improving the capacity to manage future\nincidents.\" (LÃ¶vkvist-Andersen, et al., 2004) In general, a vulnerability\nanalysis serves to \"categorize key assets and drive the risk management\nprocess.\" (United States Department of Energy, 2002) 1\n\nIn the United States, guides providing valuable considerations and templates for\ncompleting a vulnerability assessment are available from numerous agencies\nincluding the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the\nUnited States Department of Transportation, just to name a few.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Vulnerability_assessment","recorded":1362580363,"links":16,"instances":["engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.esisac.com/publicdocs/assessment_methods/VA.pdf"],"categories":["Security"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Crystal_Clear_action_run.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_action_run.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["risk_analysis","engineering"]],"members":["risk_analysis"],"related":["Vulnerability","Information_technology","Energy_supply","Water_supply","Transportation","Communication","Disaster_management","Risk_assessment","Risk_analysis_(engineering)","Vulnerability","Vulnerability_index","Vulnerability_scanner"]}
