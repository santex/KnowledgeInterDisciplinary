Invented in Japan in 1967, the displays became common on\ncalculators and other consumer electronics devices. Joseph A. Castellano\n(ed), Handbook of display technology Gulf Professional Publishing, 1992 ISBN\n0-12-163420-5 page 9 Unlike liquid crystal displays, a VFD emits a very\nbright light with high contrast and can support display elements of various\ncolours. VFDs can display seven-segment numerals, multi-segment alpha-numeric\ncharacters or can be made in a dot-matrix to display different alphanumeric\ncharacters and symbols. In practice, there is little limit to the shape of the\nimage that can be displayed: it depends solely on the shape of phosphor on the\nanode(s). Hundreds of millions of units are made yearly.
