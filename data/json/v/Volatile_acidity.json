{"cursor":"27150","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'wine fault' or 'defect' is an unpleasant characteristic of a wine often\nresulting from poor winemaking practices or storage conditions, and leading to\n'wine spoilage'. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already\nnaturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to adversely affect\nit. In fact, depending on perception, these concentrations may impart positive\ncharacters to the wine. However when the concentration of these compounds\ngreatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure the flavors and\naromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine\nto express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less\nappealing and sometimes undrinkable. M. Baldy\n''\"The University Wine Couse\" Third Edition pgs 37-39, 69-80, 134-140 The Wine\nAppreciation Guild 2009 ISBN 0-932664-69-5\n\nThere are many causes for the perception in wine faults, including poor hygiene\nat the winery, excessive and/or insufficient exposure of the wine to oxygen,\nexcessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended\nmaceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining,\nfiltering and stabilization of the wine, the use of dirty oak barrels, over-\nextended barrel aging and the use of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery,\nother factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can\ncontribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage\nof the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as\nwell as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce\nmaterials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.
