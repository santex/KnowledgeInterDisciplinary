A set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is\nspecified beforehand and for each seed there will be a corresponding region\nconsisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. The regions are\ncalled Voronoi cells. It is dual to the Delaunay triangulation.\n\nIt is named after Georgy Voronoy, and is also called a 'Voronoi\n[[tessellation]]', a 'Voronoi decomposition', or a 'Dirichlet tessellation'\n(after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet). Voronoi diagrams can be found in a large\nnumber of fields in science and technology, even in art, and they have found\nnumerous practical and theoretical applications.<ref>Franz Aurenhammer (1991).\nVoronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure.
