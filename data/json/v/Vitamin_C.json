Vitamin C refers to a number of vitamers\n   that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its\n   salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid.\n   Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when\n   either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert\n   according to pH.\n\nVitamin C is a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions including several\ncollagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe\nsymptoms of scurvy. In animals, these reactions are\nespecially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from\ncapillaries. Ascorbate may also act as an antioxidant against oxidative\nstress. However, the fact that the enantiomer ' D'-\nascorbate (not found in nature) has identical antioxidant activity to ' L'-\nascorbate, yet far less vitamin activity,\nunderscores the fact that most of the function of ' L'-ascorbate\nas a vitamin relies not on its antioxidant properties, but upon enzymic\nreactions that are stereospecific. \"Ascorbate\" without the letter for the\nenantiomeric form is always presumed to be the chemical ' L'-\nascorbate.\n\nAscorbate (the anion of ascorbic acid) is required for a range of essential\nmetabolic reactions in all animals and plants. It is made internally by almost\nall organisms; the main exceptions are bats, guinea pigs, capybaras, and the\nAnthropoidea (i.e., Haplorrhini, one of the two major primate suborders,\nconsisting of tarsiers, monkeys, humans and other apes). Ascorbate is also not\nsynthesized by some species of birds and fish. All species that do not\nsynthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. Deficiency in this vitamin causes\nthe disease scurvy in humans.\n\nAscorbic acid is also widely used as a food additive, to prevent oxidation.
