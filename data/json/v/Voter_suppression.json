Voter turnout was considered high despite widespread concerns\n of violence.]]\n\n'Voter suppression' is a strategy to influence the outcome of an election by\ndiscouraging or preventing people from exercising their right to vote. It is\ndistinguished from political campaigning in that campaigning attempts to change\nlikely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through\npersuasion and organization. Voter suppression instead attempts to reduce the\nnumber of voters who might vote against the candidate or proposition advocated\nby the suppressors.\n\nThe tactics of voter suppression can range from minor \"dirty tricks\" that make\nvoting inconvenient, up to blatantly illegal activities that physically\nintimidate prospective voters to prevent them from casting ballots. Voter\nsuppression could be particularly effective if a significant amount of voters\nare intimidated individually because the voter might not consider his or her\nsingle vote important.\n","linknr":505,"url":"Voter_suppression","recorded":1362903004,"links":24,"instances":["politician","united_states","united_states"],"pdf":["http://polsci.umass.edu/uploads/profiles/sites/schaffer_frederic_c/Files/Vol3_2-SchafferWang_HLPR.pdf","http://polsci.umass.edu/uploads/profiles/sites/schaffer_frederic_c/Files/Vol3_2-SchafferWang_HLPR.pdf","http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_bs_fdlawsinusMarch2010.pdf","http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_bs_fdlawsinusMarch2010.pdf","http://greely.msad51.org/Pages/MSAD51_GHSEnglish/Deborah_Pinkham/English9HSupplementaryMaterials/CreatingJimCrow.pdf","http://greely.msad51.org/Pages/MSAD51_GHSEnglish/Deborah_Pinkham/English9HSupplementaryMaterials/CreatingJimCrow.pdf","http://resources.news.com.au/files/2011/07/22/1226099/942923-aus-file-young-voters.pdf"],"categories":["Political
