The first\ncomponent features tiny hooks; the second features even smaller and \"hairier\"\nloops. When the two components are pressed together, the hooks catch in the\nloops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated,\nby pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the velcro strips make a\ndistinctive \"ripping\" sound.\n\nThe first Velcro sample was made of cotton, which proved impractical and was replaced by Nylon and polyester. Velcro\nfasteners made of Teflon loops, polyester hooks, and glass backing are used in\naerospace applications, e.g. on space shuttles.\n\nVariations on the standard Velcro hook and loop fasteners include hooks on both\nfaces, buttons, zippers, laces, and buckles.\n\nThe term Velcro is commonly used to mean any type of hook and loop fastener, but\nremains a registered trademark in many countries used by the Velcro company to\ndistinguish their brand of fasteners from their competitors. The\nVelcro company headquarters is in Manchester, New Hampshire, USA.\n","linknr":818,"url":"Velcro","recorded":1362569159,"links":62,"instances":["geometry","orthopaedic","fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Swiss inventions","Brand name materials","Textile closures","1941 introductions"],"headings":["History","Genericized trademark","Strength","Advantages and disadvantages","Applications","Variations on Velcro","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Velcro_Hooks.jpg/200px-Velcro_Hooks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Velcro_Loops.jpg/200px-Velcro_Loops.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg/200px-Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Metalzipper.jpg/170px-Metalzipper.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Velcro_hooks.jpg/200px-Velcro_hooks.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Velcro_loops.jpg/200px-Velcro_loops.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Sneakers_velcro.jpg/220px-Sneakers_velcro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Chamitoff_ISS_Chess_Game.jpg/220px-Chamitoff_ISS_Chess_Game.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/FasTrak_transponder.jpg/220px-FasTrak_transponder.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Sewing_tools.jpg/100px-Sewing_tools.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["burr","fruit"],["parallel","geometry"],["brace","orthopaedic"]],"members":["parallel","brace","burr"],"related":["Electrical_engineer","George_de_Mestral","Portmanteau","Cotton","Nylon","Polyester","Space_shuttle","Button","Zipper","Shoelaces","Buckle","Trademark","Manchester,_New_Hampshire","United_States","Engineer","Georges_de_Mestral","Alps","Burr_(fruit)","Burdock","Bionics","Biomimesis","Steven_Vogel","Werner_Nachtigall","Lyons","Cotton","Synthetic_fiber","Nylon","Trial_and_error","Patent","Germany","Switzerland","United_Kingdom","Sweden","Italy","Netherlands","Belgium","Canada","Manchester,_New_Hampshire","United_States","Sylvia_Porter","Aerospace","Astronaut","Space_suit","Scuba_diving","NASA","Pierre_Cardin","André_Courrèges","Paco_Rabanne","Polyester","Taiwan","China","South_Korea","Hook-and-eye_closure","Force","Stiffness","Surface","Parallel_(geometry)","Pulley","Mechanical_advantage","Pickpocketing","Woven","Sweater","Allergenic","Oeko-tex","International_Space_Station","Shoe","Adaptive_clothing","Heart","Artificial_heart","Surgery","Nuclear_power_plant","Tank","Flashlight","Diaper","Tag_rugby","Surfboard","Brace_(orthopaedic)","NASA","Teflon","Polyester","Glass","United_States_Army","Army_Combat_Uniform","American_flag","Uniform","Adaptive_clothing","Biomimicry","Metaklett"]}
