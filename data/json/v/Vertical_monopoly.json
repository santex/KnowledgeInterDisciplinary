In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. In law, a monopoly is\na business entity that has significant market power, that is, the power, to\ncharge high prices. Barak Orbach & Grace Campbell,\n[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1856553 The Antitrust Curse of Bigness], Southern\nCalifornia Law Review (2012). Although monopolies may be big businesses,\nsize is not a characteristic of a monopoly. A small business may still have the\npower to raise prices in a small industry (or market). Orbach & Campbell\n(2012).\n\nA monopoly is distinguished from a monopsony, in which there is only one buyer\nof a product or service; a monopoly may also have monopsony control of a sector\nof a market. Likewise, a monopoly should be distinguished from a cartel (a form\nof oligopoly), in which several providers act together to coordinate services,\nprices or sale of goods. Monopolies, monopsonies and oligopolies are all\nsituations such that one or a few of the entities have market power and\ntherefore interact with their customers (monopoly), suppliers (monopsony) and\nthe other companies (oligopoly) in ways that leave market interactions\ndistorted.\n\nWhen not coerced legally to do otherwise, monopolies typically maximize their\nprofit by producing fewer goods and selling them at higher prices than would be\nthe case for perfect competition.\n\nMonopolies can be established by a government, form naturally, or form by\nintegration.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, competition laws restrict monopolies. Holding a dominant\nposition or a monopoly of a market is not illegal in itself, however certain\ncategories of behavior can, when a business is dominant, be considered abusive\nand therefore incur legal sanctions. A government-granted monopoly or legal\nmonopoly, by contrast, is sanctioned by the state, often to provide an incentive\nto invest in a risky venture or enrich a domestic interest group. Patents,\ncopyright, and trademarks are sometimes used as examples of government granted\nmonopolies, but they rarely provide market power. The government may also\nreserve the venture for itself, thus forming a government monopoly.\n","linknr":718,"url":"Vertical_monopoly","recorded":1362574862,"links":93,"instances":["south_africa","aristotle","economics","commerce","united_states","social_sciences","european_union","economics"],"pdf":["http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/consumer_en.pdf","http://www.mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_2_3.pdf"],"categories":["Market
