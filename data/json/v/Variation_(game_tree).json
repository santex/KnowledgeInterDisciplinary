{"cursor":"2133","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'Variation' can refer to a specific sequence of successive moves in a turn-\nbased game, often used to specify a hypothetical future state of a game that is\nbeing played. Although the term is most commonly used in the context of Chess\nanalysis, it has been applied to other games. It also is a useful term used when\ndescribing computer tree-search algorithms (for example minimax) for playing\ngames such as Go or Chess.\n\nA variation can be any number of steps as long as each step would be legal if it\nwere to be played. It is often as far ahead as a human or computer can\ncalculate; or however long is necessary to reach a particular position of\ninterest. It may also lead to a terminal state in the game, in which case the\nterm \"Winning Variation\" or \"Losing Variation\" is sometimes used.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Variation_(game_tree)","recorded":1362667053,"links":12,"instances":["board_game"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Combinatorial game theory","Game artificial intelligence","Search algorithms","Computer chess","Trees (graph theory)"],"headings":["Principal variation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Principle_variation_16bit.PNG/220px-Principle_variation_16bit.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["go","board_game"]],"members":["go"],"related":["Chess","Game_tree","Minimax_algorithm","Go_(board_game)","Chess","Game_tree","Game_tree","Artificial_Intelligence","Game_tree","Backtracking","Minimax","Negamax","Alpha-beta_pruning","Negascout"]}
