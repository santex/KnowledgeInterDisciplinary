{"cursor":"10886","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Value}}\n\n\n\nA personal 'value' is absolute or relative and ethical value, the assumption of\nwhich can be the basis for ethical action. A [[value system]] is a set of\nconsistent values and measures. A [[principle value]] is a foundation upon which\nother values and measures of integrity are based. Those values which are not\nphysiologically determined and normally considered objective, such as a desire\nto avoid physical pain, seek pleasure, etc., are considered subjective, vary\nacross individuals and cultures and are in many ways aligned with belief and\nbelief systems. Types of values include ethical/moral value,\ndoctrinal/ideological (religious, political) values, social values, and\naesthetic values. It is debated whether some values which are not clearly\nphysiologically determined are intrinsic such as altruism and whether some such\nas acquisitiveness should be valued as vices or virtues. Values have typically\nbeen studied in sociology, anthropology, social psychology, moral philosophy,\nand business ethics.\n\nValues can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of\naction or outcomes. As such, values reflect a personâs sense of right and wrong\nor what âoughtâ to be. âEqual rights for allâ, \"Excellence deserves\nadmiration\", and âPeople should be treated with respect and dignityâ are\nrepresentative of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior. For\nexample, if you value equal rights for all and you go to work for an\norganization that treats its managers much better than it does its workers, you\nmay form the attitude that the company is an unfair place to work;\nconsequently, you may not produce well or may perhaps leave the company. It is\nlikely that if the company had a more egalitarian policy, your attitude and\nbehaviors would have been more positive.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Value_(personal_and_cultural)","recorded":1362560498,"links":44,"instances":["ethics","social","ethics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Value|","Social philosophy","Philosophy of life","Sociological terminology"],"headings":["Personal values","Cultural values","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg/300px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["value","ethics#absolute_and_relative"],["value","ethics"],["norm","sociology"],["intrinsic_value","ethics"],["norm","social"]],"members":["intrinsic_value","norm","value"],"related":["Value_(ethics)","Integrity","Subjectivity","Beliefs","Ethics","Morality","Doctrine","Ideology","Norm_(sociology)","Aesthetics","Intrinsic_value_(ethics)","Altruism","Vice","Virtue","Sociology","Anthropology","Social_psychology","Moral_philosophy","Business_ethics","Morris_Massey","Wyatt_Woodsmall","World_Values_Survey","Culture","Society","United_States_of_America","Moral_education","Personal_life","McGraw-Hill","Democracy","Justice","Chaveen_Dissanayake","Norm_(social)","Good_and_evil","Culture","Global_economy","International_law","Paideia","Rokeach_Value_Survey","Value_theory","The_Cock_and_the_Jewel","Spiral_Dynamics"]}
