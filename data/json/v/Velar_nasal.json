The symbol in the\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is â¨â©, and the\nequivalent X-SAMPA symbol is N .\n\nAs a phoneme, the velar nasal does not occur in many of the indigenous languages\nof the Americas or in a large number of European or Middle Eastern languages,\nbut it is extremely common in Australian Aboriginal languages. While almost all\nlanguages have and , is rarer. The oral counterparts, are found together in\nalmost all languages. Only half of the 469 languages surveyed in had a\nvelar nasal phoneme; as a further curiosity, a large proportion of them limits\nits occurrence to the syllable coda.\n\nAs with the voiced velar stop , the relative rarity of the velar nasal is\nbecause the small oral cavity, used to produce velar consonants, makes it more\ndifficult for voicing to be sustained. It also makes it much more difficult to\nallow air to escape through the nose, as is required for a nasal.\n\nIn many languages that do not have the velar nasal as a phoneme, it occurs as an\nallophone of other nasals before velar consonants.\n","linknr":720,"url":"Velar_nasal","recorded":1362552513,"links":49,"instances":["north_frisian_dialect"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Velar consonants","Nasal consonants"],"headings":["Features","Occurrence","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Braille_%C3%8B.svg/25px-Braille_%C3%8B.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Xsampa-N2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Blank_vowel_trapezoid.svg/320px-Blank_vowel_trapezoid.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mooring","north_frisian_dialect"]],"members":["mooring"],"related":["Consonant","Speech_communication","Language","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","X-SAMPA","Phoneme","Australian_Aboriginal_languages","Syllable_coda","Voiced_velar_stop","Velar_consonant","Greek_language","Retroflex_nasal","Palatal_nasal","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","Albanian_language","Aleut_language","Armenian_language","Eastern_Armenian","Bambara_language","Basque_language","Catalan_language","Catalan_phonology","Chinese_language","Yue_Chinese","Cantonese_phonology","Mandarin_Chinese","Beijing","Mandarin_phonology","Wu_Chinese","Chinese_characters","Chukchi_language","Cyrillic_script","Czech_language","Czech_phonology","Dinka_language","Danish_language","Danish_phonology","Dutch_language","Dutch_phonology","English_language","Syllable_coda","English_phonology","Fijian_language","Filipino_language","Finnish_language","Finnish_phonology","French_language","French_phonology","Galician_language","Grammatical_gender","German_language","German_phonology","Greek_language","Modern_Greek_phonology","Hebrew_language","Modern_Hebrew_phonology","Hindustani_language","Hindi–Urdu_phonology","Hungarian_language","Hungarian_phonology","Icelandic_language","Icelandic_phonology","Indonesian_language","Inuktitut_language","Inuktitut_syllabics","Inuvialuktun","Irish_language","Irish_phonology","Italian_language","Italian_phonology","Itelmen_language","Japanese_language","Japanese_phonology","Kagayanen_language","Ket_language","Korean_language","Korean_phonology","Macedonian_language","Macedonian_phonology","Malay_language","Malayalam_language","Malayalam_script","Māori_language","Marathi_language","Marathi_phonology","Mari_language","Cyrillic_script","Nganasan_language","Cyrillic_script","Nivkh_language","Cyrillic_script","North_Frisian_language","Mooring_(North_Frisian_dialect)","Norwegian_language","Norwegian_phonology","Persian_language","Persian_phonology","Polish_language","Polish_phonology","Occitan_language","Provençal_language","Rapa_Nui_language","Russian_language","Russian_phonology","Seri_language","Shona_language","Slovene_language","Spanish_language","Spanish_phonology","Swahili_language","Swedish_language","Swedish_phonology","Thai_language","Tundra_Nenets_language","Turkmen_language","Venetian_language","Vietnamese_language","Vietnamese_phonology","Welsh_language","West_Frisian_language","Yi_language","Yupik_language","Zapotec_language","Tilquiapan_Zapotec","List_of_phonetics_topics"]}
