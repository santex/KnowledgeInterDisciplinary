{"cursor":"5601","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In quantum field theory, and specifically quantum electrodynamics, 'vacuum\npolarization' describes a process in which a background electromagnetic field\nproduces virtual electron–positron pairs that change the distribution of\ncharges and currents that generated the original electromagnetic field. It is\nalso sometimes referred to as the '[[self energy]]' of the gauge boson (photon).\n\nThe effects of vacuum polarization were first observed experimentally prior to\n1947 before they were theoretically calculated (by Hans Bethe on the return\ntrain ride from the Shelter Island Conference to Cornell) after developments in\nradar equipment for World War II resulted in higher accuracy for measuring the\nenergy levels of the hydrogen atom (the Lamb shift) and the anomalous magnetic\ndipole moment of the electron (corresponding to the deviation from the Dirac\nequation predicted value of 2 of the spectroscopic electron g-factor value),\nmeasured by I.I. Rabi.\n\nThe effects of vacuum polarization have been routinely observed experimentally\nsince then as very well understood background effects. Vacuum polarization\nreferred to below as the one loop contribution occurs with leptons (electron-\npositron pairs) or quarks, the former (leptons) first observed in 1940s but also\nrecently observed in 1997 using the TRISTAN particle accelerator in\nJapan, {{cite journal\n | last=Levine | first=I. | coauthors=TOPAZ Collaboration title=Measurement of\n | the Electromagnetic Coupling at Large Momentum Transfer journal=Physical\n | Review Letters | year=1997 volume=78 | pages=424â427\n | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.424 | bibcode=1997PhRvL..78..424L issue=3}}\nthe latter (quarks) along with multiple quark-gluon loop contributions from the\nearly 1970s to mid 1990s using the VEPP-2M particle accelerator at the Budker\nInstitute of Nuclear Physics in Siberia in Russia and many other accelerator\nlaboratories worldwide. {{cite journal\n | last=Brown | first=Douglas H | coauthors=Worstell, William A title=The Lowest\n | Order Hadronic Contribution to the Muon g â 2 Value with Systematic Error\n | Correlations journal=Physical Review D | year=1996 volume=54 |\n | pages=3237â3249 doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.54.3237 issue=5}}\n","linknr":171,"url":"Vacuum_polarization","recorded":1362903892,"links":21,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quantum field theory","Quantum electrodynamics"],"headings":["Explanation","Vacuum polarization tensor","Note","References","Further reading","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Vacuum_polarization.svg/144px-Vacuum_polarization.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/8/1/d814056a0dd870c634a1f63c98c1bfbd.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"]],"members":["spin"],"related":["Quantum_field_theory","Quantum_electrodynamics","Electromagnetic_field","Virtual_particle","Positron","Gauge_boson","Photon","Hans_Bethe","Shelter_Island_Conference","World_War_II","Lamb_shift","Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment","Dirac_equation","G-factor","I.I._Rabi","TRISTAN","Budker_Institute_of_Nuclear_Physics","Siberia","Russia","Quantum_field_theory","Virtual_particle","Leptons","Quarks","Gluons","Uncertainty_principle","Color_charge","QCD","Quarks","Gluons","Leptons","Quarks","Lepton","Electron","Mass","Uncertainty_principle","Electric_dipole","Electromagnetic_field","Dielectric","Dielectric_constant","Fine_structure_constant","Ward_identity","Quantum_chromodynamics","Hadron","Spin_(physics)","Renormalization","QED_vacuum","QCD_vacuum","Virtual_particles"]}
