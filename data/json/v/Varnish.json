{"cursor":"20411","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Varnish' is a transparent, hard, protective finish or film primarily used in\nwood finishing but also for other materials. Varnish is traditionally a\ncombination of a drying oil, a resin, and a thinner or solvent. Varnish finishes\nare usually glossy but may be designed to produce satin or semi-gloss sheens by\nthe addition of \"flatting\" agents. Varnish has little or no colour, is\ntransparent, and has no added pigment, as opposed to paints or wood stains,\nwhich contain pigment and generally range from opaque to translucent. Varnishes\nare also applied over wood stains as a final step to achieve a film for gloss\nand protection. Some products are marketed as a combined stain and varnish.\n\nAfter being applied, the film-forming substances in varnishes either harden\ndirectly, as soon as the solvent has fully evaporated, or harden after\nevaporation of the solvent through certain curing processes, primarily chemical\nreaction between oils and oxygen from the air (autoxidation) and chemical\nreactions between components of the varnish. Resin varnishes \"dry\" by\nevaporation of the solvent and harden almost immediately upon drying. Acrylic\nand waterborne varnishes \"dry\" upon evaporation of the water but experience an\nextended curing period. Oil, polyurethane, and epoxy varnishes remain liquid\neven after evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to cure, undergoing\nsuccessive stages from liquid or syrupy, to tacky or sticky, to dry gummy, to\n\"dry to the touch\", to hard. Environmental factors such as heat and humidity\nplay a very large role in the drying and curing times of varnishes. In classic\nvarnish the cure rate depends on the type of oil used and, to some extent, on\nthe ratio of oil to resin. The drying and curing time of all varnishes may be\nsped up by exposure to an energy source such as sunlight, ultraviolet light, or\nheat. Many varnishes rely on organic oils or resins for their binder in\ncombination with organic solvents; these are highly flammable in their liquid\nstate. In addition, all drying oils, certain alkyds, and many single-component\npolyurethanes produce heat during the curing process. Therefore, oil-soaked rags\nand paper can smolder and ignite hours after use if they are bunched or piled\ntogether, or, for example, placed in a container where the heat cannot\ndissipate.\n","linknr":433,"url":"Varnish","recorded":1362481423,"links":52,"instances":["optics","sailing","material_appearance","plant_resin","chemistry","optics","paint","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Varnishes","Art materials","Painting materials","Wood finishing materials","Printing materials"],"headings":["History","Etymology","Components of classic varnish","Types","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Varnish.jpg/220px-Varnish.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transparency","optics"],["gloss","material_appearance"],["opacity","optics"],["opacity","optics"],["curing","chemistry"],["mastic","plant_resin"],["primer","paint"],["spar","sailing"],["elasticity","physics"]],"members":["transparency","spar","gloss","mastic","curing","opacity","primer","elasticity"],"related":["Transparency_(optics)","Wood_finishing","Drying_oil","Resin","Turpentine_substitute","Solvent","Gloss_(material_appearance)","Colour","Pigment","Paint","Wood_stain","Opacity_(optics)","Opacity_(optics)","Evaporated","Curing_(chemistry)","Autoxidation","Acrylic_paint","Sunlight","Ancient_Egypt","Ancient_India","Ancient_China","Ancient_Japan","Lacquer","Anno_Domini","Ancient_Korea","Benghazi","Linseed_oil","Tung_oil","Walnut_oil","Polyunsaturated","Fatty_acids","Amber","Gum-digging","Dammar","Copal","Rosin","Sandarac","Balsam_of_Mecca","Elemi","Mastic","Turpentine","Turpentine_substitute","White_spirit","Paint_thinner","Mineral_spirit","Violin","Amber","Copal","Rosin","Resin","Solution","Vernice_bianca","Alcohol","Petroleum","Mineral_spirits","Paint_thinner","Amber","Dammar","Copal","Rosin","Sandarac","Elemi","Benzoin","Mastic_(plant_resin)","Shellac","Lacquer","Chemical_synthesis","Phenolic_resin","Waxes","Lac","Assam","Thailand","French_polish","Primer_(paint)","Ammonia","Alkyd","Ultraviolet","Ship","Boat","Spar_(sailing)","Elasticity_(physics)","Tung_oil","Phenolic_resin","Ultraviolet","Brand","Linseed_oil","Tung_oil","Exothermic_reaction","Oxygen","Polymerized","Siccative","Catalyst","Polyurethane","Hardwood","Pine","Epoxy","Evaporation","Chemical","Moisture","Ultra-violet","Film","Polymer","Wood_stain","Plastic","Pigment","Egyptian_pyramids","Butyl_acetate","Xylene","Toluene","Acryl_group","Refractive_index","Formaldehyde","The_Artist's_Handbook_of_Materials_and_Techniques","Desert_varnish","Tack_cloth","UV_Coating","Brightwork"]}
