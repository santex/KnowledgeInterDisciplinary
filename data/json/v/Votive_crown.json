Out of view are chains\n for suspension above, and a Byzantine pendant cross below. Alternate\n view. ]] A 'votive crown' is a votive offering in the form of a\n crown, normally in precious metals and often adorned with jewels. Especially in\n the Early Middle Ages, they are of a special form, designed to be suspended by\n chains at an altar, shrine or image. Later examples are more often typical\n crowns in the style of the period, either designed to be placed on the head of\n a statue, or re-used in this way after donation.\n\nThere were pagan votive crowns in the ancient world, although these are\nessentially known only from literary references. Vitruvius records that when\nHiero II of Syracuse (died 215 BC) suspected his goldsmith of cheating him over\nthe making of a votive crown for a statue in a temple, for which he had supplied\nthe gold to be used, he asked Archimedes to devise a test. This led Archimedes\nto his famous [[Eureka (word)|eureka]] moment, after he realized he could test\nthe crown by comparing its displacement of water to that of the same weight of\npure gold; in fact the goldsmith had taken some gold and added silver\ninstead. Rossi & Russo, 11-12.\n[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html Vitruvius\ntext], see sections 9-12. From other references it seems that in classical\ntimes not just statues of the gods, but also living rulers were presented with\ncrowns in the hope of a favourable response to a request.\n\nThe largest number of surviving examples of the Christian Early Medieval\nsuspended type come from 7th century Visigothic Hispania, especially the\nTreasure of Guarrazar, from near Toledo, which includes no fewer than twenty-six\nexamples in gold, probably hidden as the Muslim invasion drew near. These were\nexcavated in 1859, and are now divided between the National Archaeological\nMuseum of Spain in Madrid and the MusÃ©e de Cluny in Paris. MusÃ©e\nde Cluny, [http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm webpage with\nanother crown], accessed May 20, 2010 (in French). However the type was\noriginally Roman or Byzantine, and adopted widely across Europe; Stokstad, 84 nearly all these have been lost, as the\nobjects were naturally extremely vulnerable to theft or looting. These could not\nbe worn, as they were too small and also very often had pendilia, or dangling\nornaments on chains hanging from the main crown, often with jewels and perhaps\nformed into letters which spelled a word or phrase. In the example above, the\nletters on the pendilia spell \"RECCESVINTUVS REX OFFERET\", or \"King Recceswinth\noffered this\". These royal donations signified the\nsubmission of the monarchy to God. Such objects were probably\ninfluenced by the thirty suspended gold crowns placed round the main altar of\nHagia Sophia by Justinian, now lost, Stokstad, 84; Beckwith, 345\nalthough the Christian practice is at least as old as the 4th\ncentury. Chopin, Danielle Gaborit.[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qtgot-\nOF0MKQC&pg=PA390&dq=Votive+crown&hl=en&ei=6zn0S528K4KC8gan7737DQ&sa=X&oi=book_r-\nesult&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Votive%20crown&f=false\nEncyclopedia of the Middle Ages] \"Crown, art\", edited by AndrÃ© Vauchez, Richard\nBarrie Dobson, Michael Lapidge, Volume 1, page 390.\n\nThe main body of suspended crowns is usually flat around the top as well as the\nbottom rim; some are merely an open framework of flexibly linked metal pieces.\nSuch crowns were probably found widely across Christian Europe in this period;\nthe will of 572 of Aredius, a wealthy friend of Gregory of Tours in Gaul,\ndescribes a crown that sounds very similar in form to the Spanish\nexamples. Fletcher, 62 The Iron Crown of Lombardy was perhaps\noriginally made as a votive crown, although it was later used for the coronation\nof monarchs including Napoleon I. Another gold crown was a source of contention\nin Constantinople; it was given to the Emperor Maurice (r. 582-602) by his wife\nConstantina and the dowager Empress Sophia for Easter 601, intended to be worn\nby him. Instead he had it suspended by chains over the main altar of Hagia\nSophia, upsetting the two ladies. Garland, Linda [http://www.roman-\nemperors.org/tina.htm Online biography of Constantina] It hung there for\nnearly two centuries, until Emperor Leo IV coveted it and took it for his own\nuse. In a suspiciously neat story, the crown was richly decorated with\ncarbuncles (jewels), and Leo, who was an iconoclast, soon after died of an\noutbreak of carbuncles (abcesses), allowing the church to draw the obvious\nconclusion; other stories said his wife had poisoned him. Treadgold, 370,\nthough he says the crown was a different one, given by Heraclius Another\nByzantine votive crown, given by Leo VI (r. 886-912) is now in the Treasury of\nSan Marco, Venice, and is decorated with cloisonnÃ©\nenamels. [http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s279/desniza/VI.jpg Image of\nLeo VI's crown]\n\n carried in the processions of Holy Week in Seville.]] In England, a later\n medieval source says that King Canute gave a, or \"his\", crown to be placed on\n or over (\"super caput\") the head of the rood, or large crucifix, in Winchester\n Cathedral (other notables decorated statues with their jewellery or a\n sword). Dodwell, 212, The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] records that\n Hereward the Wake's men looted a solid gold crown from the head of the rood on\n the main altar of Peterborough Cathedral in 1070. Dodwell, 213, The\n Romanesque period saw the height of crowned images of Christ, who is often\n shown wearing a crown on the cross in wood and metal figures, and manuscript\n illuminations, and also the introduction of crowned images of the Virgin Mary\n in the West, as the concept of Mary as Queen of Heaven became increasingly\n prominent.\n\nA very small late medieval crown now in the Treasury of Aachen Cathedral was\nmade for the famously lavish wedding celebrations in 1468 of Margaret of York,\nDuchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV of England, and later placed on a\nstatue of the Virgin Mary as a votive offering. It was designed to be worn on\ntop of an elaborate headress and hairstyle, or perhaps on a hennin, and is much\nsmaller than a conventional crown for wearing directly on the\nhead. [http://www.culture24.org.uk/asset_arena/7/88/22887/v0_master.jpg\nImage of Margaret's crown] Schitker, 105-111 explores the donation in\ndetail. This is now a rare example of a medieval votive crown that has\nsurvived above ground. A few years later, in 1487, the crown that had been used\nby the pretender Lambert Simnel was given to a statue of the Virgin in\nDublin. Schnitker, 110\n\nCrowns for designed solely for statues became increasingly elaborate, especially\nin the Baroque period, and in the Spanish world; they often have a flat\nradiating \"sunburst\" around them, in the style used for monstrances, as in the\nexample illustrated. Statues of the Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus, of the\nInfant Jesus of Prague type, are among those most commonly crowned. The Crown of\nthe Andes is a votive crown from Colombia in gold with 450 emeralds, apparently\nmade between the late 16th and 18th centuries, perhaps originally as an offering\nin thanks for the city of PopayÃ¡n being spared from a plague. It is now in\nprivate hands in the US. Norman, Geraldine, [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/crowning-glory-of-the-andes-\n1587131.html âCrowning Glory of the Andesâ]: The Independent on Sunday, 18 June\n1995. The crown was not in fact sold.\n\nVotive crowns have continued to be produced in Catholic countries in modern\ntimes. Often such crowns were kept in the church treasury except for special\noccasions such as relevant feast-days, when they are worn by the statue. Christ\nand the Virgin Mary are frequently conventionally shown wearing crowns in\nChristian art, in subjects such as the Coronation of the Virgin, and are the\nmost common figures to be crowned, but other saints may also be given crowns,\nespecially if the saint was royal, or a martyr, as martyrs are promised crowns\nin heaven by many texts.\n\nIn Greece a ''tama'' or votive offering of, or depicting, two small wedding\ncrowns, as used locally, indicates a request for a good marriage. Actual crowns\nused in ceremonies were normally retained by the couple.
