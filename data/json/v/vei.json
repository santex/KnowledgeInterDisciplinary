The scale is open-ended with the largest volcanoes in history\ngiven magnitude 8. A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions, defined as\nless than of tephra ejected; and 8 representing a mega-colossal explosive\neruption that can eject of tephra and have a cloud column height of over . The\nscale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold\nincrease in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception of between VEI 0, VEI 1\nand VEI 2.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Christopher G. last = Newhall coauthors = Self, Steve year = 1982\n | title = The volcanic explosivity index (VEI): An estimate of explosive\n | magnitude for historical volcanism journal = Journal of Geophysical Research\n | volume = 87 issue = C2 pages = 1231–1238 url =\n | http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1982/JC087iC02p01231.shtml doi =\n | 10.1029/JC087iC02p01231\n |bibcode = 1982JGR....87.1231N }}</ref>\n\nAsh, volcanic bombs, and ignimbrite are all treated alike. Density and\nvesicularity (gas bubbling) of the volcanic products in question is not taken\ninto account. In contrast, the DRE (Dense-Rock Equivalent) is sometimes\ncalculated to give the actual amount of magma erupted. Another weakness of the\nVEI is that it does not take into account the power output of an eruption, which\nmakes it extremely difficult to determine with prehistoric or unobserved\neruptions.\n","title":"Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index","headings":["Classification","List of eruptions","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Supervolcano","2: Oruanui_eruption","2: Holocene","1: Christopher_G._Newhall","1: US_Geological_Survey","1: Stephen_Self","1: University_of_Hawaii_at_Manoa","1: Volcano","1: Tephra","1: Journal_of_Geophysical_Research","1: Volcanic_ash","1: Volcanic_bomb","1: Ignimbrite","1: Dense-Rock_Equivalent","1: Magma","1: Smithsonian_Institution","1: Hawaiian_eruption","1: KÄ«lauea","1: Piton_de_la_Fournaise","1: Mount_Erebus","1: Strombolian_eruption","1: Stromboli","1: Mount_Nyiragongo","1: Vulcanian_eruption","1: Galeras","1: Mount_Sinabung","1: PelÃ©an_eruption","1: Nevado_del_Ruiz","1: SoufriÃ¨re_Hills","1: Plinian_eruption","1: Mount_PelÃ©e","1: 2010_eruptions_of_EyjafjallajÃ¶kull","1: Mount_Vesuvius","1: 1980_eruption_of_Mount_St._Helens","1: Ultra-Plinian","1: Huaynaputina","1: 1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa","1: Mount_Pinatubo","1: Mount_Mazama","1: Minoan_eruption","1: 1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora","1: Yellowstone_Caldera","1: Toba_catastrophe_theory","1: Ordovician","1: Pleistocene","1: Lake_Taupo","1: List_of_largest_volcanic_eruptions","1: List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions","1: List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_of_the_19th_Century","1: List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_of_the_20th_Century","1: List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_of_the_21st_Century","1: Lists_of_volcanoes","1: List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll","1: United_States_Geological_Survey"]}
