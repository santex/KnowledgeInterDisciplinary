In humans, vitamin D is unique because it\ncan be ingested as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol\n(vitamin D 2) and because the body can also synthesize it (from\ncholesterol) when sun exposure is adequate (hence its nickname, the \"sunshine\nvitamin\").\n\nAlthough vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin, it is not actually an essential\ndietary vitamin in the strict sense, as it can be synthesized in adequate\namounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight (cats and dogs cannot synthesize\nvitamin D and must receive it in their diet). An organic chemical compound (or\nrelated set of compounds) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it cannot\nbe synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained\nfrom their diet. However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins,\nvitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was\nlacking in a disease, namely, rickets, the childhood form of osteomalacia. Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins,\nin the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods, such as milk, to\navoid disease due to deficiency.\n\nMeasures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight\nas well as intake from the diet, and it is believed that synthesis may\ncontribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations. The\nevidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a\nfeedback loop that prevents toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the\ncancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of\nMedicine, USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D\nrequirements. Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume\nthat no synthesis occurs and that all of a person's vitamin D is from their\ndiet, although that will rarely occur in practice.\n\nIn the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol, which is also known as\ncalcifediol (INN), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin Dâabbreviated\n25(OH)D; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in\nserum to determine a person's vitamin D status. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medl-\nineplus/ency/article/003569.htm Part of the calcidiol is\nconverted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin\nD. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the\nblood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream\nand promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcidiol is also\nconverted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes, such as the\nproliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells; calcitriol also affects\nneuromuscular function and inflammation.\n\nBeyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets, the evidence for other health\neffects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is\ninconsistent. The best evidence of\nbenefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in\nelderly women.\n","linknr":1708,"url":"Vitamin_D","recorded":1362373616,"links":152,"instances":["physician","bone","biology","symptom","accident","united_kingdom","skin","food"],"pdf":["http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/vitamind/vitdfact.pdf","http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/vitamind/vitdfact.pdf","http://pain-topics.org/pdf/vitamind-report.pdf","http://pain-topics.org/pdf/vitamind-report.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/69/5/842.full.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/69/5/842.full.pdf","http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/home/oldsc/upper_level_opinions_full-part33.pdf","http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/home/oldsc/upper_level_opinions_full-part33.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/61/3/638S.full.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/61/3/638S.full.pdf","http://www.aspergillus.org.uk/pdfs/18191972.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/84/4/694.full.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/84/4/694.full.pdf","http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/n35.pdf","http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/n35.pdf","http://www.caa.go.jp/en/pdf/syokuhin338.pdf","http://www.caa.go.jp/en/pdf/syokuhin338.pdf","http://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/11/2739S.full.pdf","http://jn.nutrition.org/content/135/11/2739S.full.pdf","http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110706/pdf/475023a.pdf"],"categories":["Vitamin
