{"cursor":"70519","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nA 'video game' is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user\ninterface to generate visual feedback on a video device. The word video in video\ngame traditionally referred to a cathode ray tube (CRT) display\ndevice, but it now implies any type of display device that can\nproduce two or three dimensional images. The electronic systems used to play\nvideo games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and\nvideo game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to\nsmall handheld devices. Specialized video games such as arcade games, while\npreviously common, have gradually declined in use. Video games have gone on to\nbecome an art form and industry.\n\nThe input device used to manipulate video games is called a game controller, and\nvaries across platforms. For example, a controller might consist of only a\nbutton and a joystick, while another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more\njoysticks. Early personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay,\nor more commonly, required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one\nbutton. *Patrick Stack. [http://web.archive.org/web/20090226064943/http://t-\nime.com/time/covers/1101050523/console_timeline \"History of video game\nconsoles\"] Time 2005 / Many modern\ncomputer games allow or require the player to use a keyboard and a mouse\nsimultaneously. A few of the most common game controllers are gamepads, mouses,\nkeyboards, and joysticks.\n\nVideo games typically use additional means of providing interactivity and\ninformation to the player. Audio is almost universal, using sound reproduction\ndevices, such as speakers and headphones. Other feedback may come via haptic\nperipherals, such as vibration or force feedback, with vibration sometimes used\nto simulate force feedback.\n\nIn the early days of cartridge consoles, they were sometimes called 'TV games'.\n","linknr":1181,"url":"Video_game","recorded":1362540326,"links":123,"instances":["online_gaming","third_generation","software","web_series","multiplayer_mode","computer_gaming","media","computing","games","computing","computer_gaming"],"pdf":["http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_winter81.pdf","http://www.digitpress.com/library/magazines/electronic_games/electronic_games_winter81.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080228191914/http://intl-nms.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/117.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080228191914/http://intl-nms.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/117.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/resources/elearning/pdfs/serious_games_wp.pdf","http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf","http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf","http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080624233600/http://www.elspa.com/assets/files/c/computerandvideogamesabritishphenomenonaroundthewo_174.pdf","http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~aaronights/2007-8-11_report_into_software_releases.pdf"],"categories":["Video
