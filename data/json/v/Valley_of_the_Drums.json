{"cursor":"3138","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Valley of the Drums' is a 23 acre (9.3 hectare) toxic waste site in\nnorthern Bullitt County, Kentucky, near Louisville, named after the waste-\ncontaining drums strewn across the area. It is known as one of the primary\nmotivations for the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation, and Liability Act, or Superfund Act of 1980. While the widely\npublicized Love Canal disaster is often credited as the reason the Superfund law\nwas passed, Love Canal activist Lois Gibbs has said that Love Canal looked like\na suburban community, while \"Valley of the Drums became the visualization of the\nproblem.\"\n\nThe site became a collection point for toxic wastes starting sometime in the\n1960s. It caught the attention of state officials when some of the drums caught\nfire and burned for more than a week in 1966. However, at that time there were\nno laws to address the storage or containment of toxic wastes, and the site\ncontinued to be unregulated for another decade.\n\nIn 1979 conditions at the site became so bad that the Environmental Protection\nAgency initiated an emergency clean-up of the worst of the leaking drums.\nWorkers on the ground quickly realized that the scope of the problem was far\nbeyond their abilities at the time, and after news of the problems there became\npublic the site was used by members of Congress as one of the reasons the\nproposed Superfund law was needed.\n\nCleanup began at the site in 1983 and officially ended in 1990, although\nproblems continued to be reported for many years. An environmental audit of the\nsite in 2003 found PCBs in the sediment surrounding the area, and further\ntesting was ordered.\n\nIn December, 2008, EPA inspectors found about four dozen rusted metal drums on\nland just outside the part of the dump that it capped and fenced in the 1980s,\nincluding a portion of Jefferson Memorial Forest. New cleanup work is being\nconsidered at the site as of December 15, 2008.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Valley_of_the_Drums","recorded":1375090357,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Valley_of_the_Drums&params=38.082229_N_-85.723625_E_","/wiki/File:Valleyofdrums.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Valleyofdrums.jpg/325px-Valleyofdrums.jpg","/wiki/File:Valleyofdrums.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Toxic_waste","/wiki/Bullitt_County,_Kentucky","/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky","/wiki/Drum_(container)","/wiki/Superfund","/wiki/Love_Canal","/wiki/Lois_Gibbs","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency","/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl","/wiki/Sediment","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Superfund_sites_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Hazardous_waste_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit&section=2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","#cite_ref-1","http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20081214/NEWS01/81214001&referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL","/wiki/The_Courier-Journal","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit&section=3","http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=B2&Dato=20081213&Kategori=NEWS01&Lopenr=812130810&Ref=PH","http://bullittcountyhistory.org/bchistory/valleydrum.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&oldid=565888707","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Bullitt_County,_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:History_of_Louisville,_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:Waste_processing_sites","/wiki/Category:Superfund_sites_in_Kentucky","/wiki/Category:Environmental_disasters_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Valley+of+the+Drums&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Valley+of+the+Drums","/wiki/Valley_of_the_Drums","/wiki/Talk:Valley_of_the_Drums","#","/wiki/Valley_of_the_Drums","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Valley_of_the_Drums","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Valley_of_the_Drums","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&oldid=565888707","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7912344","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Valley_of_the_Drums&id=565888707","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Valley+of+the+Drums","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Valley+of+the+Drums&oldid=565888707&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Drums&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7912344#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafou
