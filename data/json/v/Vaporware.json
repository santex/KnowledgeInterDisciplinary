[[Network World]] magazine called vaporware an\n\"epidemic\" in 1989, and blamed the press for not investigating whether\ndevelopers' claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990\nsaying they felt vaporware had hurt the industry's credibility. The United\nStates accused several companies of announcing vaporware early in violation of\nantitrust laws, but few have been found guilty.

It became popular among writers in the industry as\na way to describe products they felt took too long to be released.
