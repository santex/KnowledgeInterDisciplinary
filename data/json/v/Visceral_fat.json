In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue\ncontains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes,\nfibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and variety of immune cells (i.e.\nadipose tissue macrophages (ATMs)). Adipose tissue is derived from\npreadipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although\nit also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose\ntissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine\norgan, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin,\nand the cytokine TNFÎ±. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems\nof the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and\nmost animals does not depend on body weight, but on the amount of body fatâto be\nspecific, adipose tissue. The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose\ntissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue\nappears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue, more\nspecifically brown adipose tissue, was first identified by the Swiss naturalist\nConrad Gessner in 1551.\n","linknr":714,"url":"Visceral_fat","recorded":1362484932,"links":59,"instances":["biochemistry","biological","anatomy","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obesity","Connective tissue"],"headings":["Anatomical features","Physiology","Body fat meter","Additional images","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Illu_connective_tissues_1.jpg/390px-Illu_connective_tissues_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fatmouse.jpg/220px-Fatmouse.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Overweight_teenage_male.jpg/220px-Overweight_teenage_male.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Excess_abdominal_fat.jpg/220px-Excess_abdominal_fat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Gray940.png/106px-Gray940.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Yellow_adipose_tissue_in_paraffin_section_-_lipids_washed_out.jpg/120px-Yellow_adipose_tissue_in_paraffin_section_-_lipids_washed_out.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Body_Fat_meter.jpg/120px-Body_Fat_meter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["dorsum","biology"],["hip","anatomy"],["stress","biological"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","stress","hip","dorsum","organ"],"related":["Connective_tissue","Adipocyte","Adipose_tissue_macrophages","Energy","Lipid","Thermal_insulation","Endocrine","Hormone","Leptin","Estrogen","Resistin","Cytokine","TNF-alpha","Obesity","Overweight","White_adipose_tissue","Brown_adipose_tissue","Adipose_gene","Conrad_Gessner","Human_skin","Subcutaneous_fat","Organ_(anatomy)","Visceral_fat","Yellow_bone_marrow","Fibroblast","Macrophage","Endothelial_cell","Blood_vessel","Integumentary_system","Subcutaneous","Mouse","Mouse","Abdominal_cavity","Uterus","Ovary","Epididymis","Testes","Dorsum_(biology)","Intestine","Stomach","Spleen","Lymphoid_tissue","Milky_spot","Skin","Pericardium","Muscle","Lymph_node","Obese","Person","Panniculus","Pannus","Gastric_bypass_surgery","Abdominal_cavity","Subcutaneous_fat","Skin","Intramuscular_fat","Skeletal_muscle","Abdomen","Mesenteric","Epididymal","White_adipose_tissue","Perirenal_fat","Central_obesity","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Insulin_resistance","Estrogen","Buttocks","Thighs","Hip_(anatomy)","Sex_differences_in_humans","Menopause","Abdomen","Metabolic_equivalent","Aerobic_exercise","Epicardial","Leptin","Resistin","Free_fatty_acid","Lipoprotein","Lipoprotein_lipase","Triglyceride","Ester","Glycerol","Physiology","Insulin_resistance","Abdomen","Metabolism","Central_obesity","Cardiovascular_disease","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Wake_Forest_University","Stress_(biological)","Time_magazine","Adult_stem_cell","Induced_pluripotent_stem_cells","Embryonic_stem_cell","Peripheral","Aromatase","Estradiol","Adipose_derived_hormones","Adiponectin","Resistin","Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1","TNF-alpha","Interleukin_6","Leptin","Estradiol","Cytokine","Adipokine","Hibernating","Brown_adipose_tissue","Thorax","Respiratory_chain","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Mitochondria","Adenosine_triphosphate","Shivering","Pharmacology","Weight_loss","Infant","Thrifty_gene_hypothesis","James_V._Neel","Jeffrey_M._Friedman","Rockefeller_University","Leptin","Hypothalamus","Satiety","Hypothalamus","Mutation","Melanocortin","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Ligand","Leptin","Melanocortin","WDTC1","Muscular_tissue","Body_fat_percentage","Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis","Electric_current","Ohm","Apelin","Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis","Blubber","Body_fat_percentage","Cellulite","Human_fat","Obesity","Starving","Steatosis","Stem_cells","Subcutaneous_fat","Adipose_differentiation-related_protein","Adiposopathy"]}
