{"cursor":"14981","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Virtual water trade' (also known as trade in embedded or embodied water) refers\nto the hidden flow of water if food or other commodities are traded from one\nplace to another. For instance, it takes 1,600 cubic meters of water on average\nto produce one metric tonne of wheat. The precise volume can be more or less\ndepending on climatic conditions and agricultural practice. Hoekstra and\nChapagain have defined the virtual-water content of a product (a commodity, good\nor service) as \"the volume of freshwater used to produce the product, measured\nat the place where the product was actually produced\". It refers to\nthe sum of the water use in the various steps of the production chain.\n\nProfessor John Anthony Allan from King's College London and the School of\nOriental and African Studies introduced the virtual water concept, [http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19926700.100-\nlooming-water-crisis-simply-a-management-problem.html \"Looming water crisis\nsimply a management problem\"] by Jonathan Chenoweth, New Scientist 28 Aug.,\n2008, pp. 28-32.  to support his argument that countries in the Middle\nEast can save their scarce water resources by relying more on import of food.\nFor his contributions he was awarded the 2008 Stockholm Water\nPrize. http://www.siwi.org/sa/node.asp?node=25 Allan stated: \"The\nwater is said to be virtual because once the wheat is grown, the real water used\nto grow it is no longer actually contained in the wheat. The concept of virtual\nwater helps us realize how much water is needed to produce different goods and\nservices. In semi-arid and arid areas, knowing the virtual water value of a good\nor service can be useful towards determining how best to use the scarce water\navailable.\"\n\nThere are, however, significant deficiencies with the concept of virtual water\nthat mean there is a significant risk in relying on these measures to guide\npolicy conclusions. Accordingly, Australia's National Water Commission considers\nthat the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision\nmaking regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Virtual_water","recorded":1362372178,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/42650/Virtual-Water-The-Concept-of-Virtual-Water.pdf","http://www.nwc.gov.au/resources/documents/DistilledJuly2008.pdf","http://www.die-gdi.de/DIE_Homepage.nsf/6f3fa777ba64bd9ec12569cb00547f1b/01b3da26dc5fe93bc1256f81003065d4/$FILE/2005-12-07-Virtueller-Wasserhandel-Vortrag-Abbadi.pdf","http://www.osd.com.jo/vertual_water.pdf","http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report12.pdf","http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/ChapagainHoekstra-2008-GlobalVirtualWaterFlows.pdf","http://www.isoe.de/ftp/vwt-documentation.pdf","http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Zygmunt_2007.pdf","http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Zygmunt_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Agricultural terminology","Water development and sustainability"],"headings":["Virtual water trade","Limitations of the virtual water measure","Water Footprint","Embodied energy","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["John_Anthony_Allan","King's_College_London","School_of_Oriental_and_African_Studies","Jonathan_Chenoweth","New_Scientist","Stockholm_Water_Prize","GTAP","Governance","Frankfurt","Integrated_Water_Resources_Management","Energy_analysis","Embodied_energy","Peak_water","Water_footprint","Water_management","Deficit_irrigation","Water_resource_policy","UNESCO-IHE","Jonathan_Chenoweth","New_Scientist","UNESCO-IHE"]}
