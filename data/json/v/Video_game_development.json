{"cursor":"76010","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Video game development' is the process of creating a video game. Development is\nundertaken by a game developer, which may range from a single person to a large\nbusiness. Mainstream games are normally funded by a publisher and take several\nyears to develop. Indie games can take less time and can be produced cheaply by\nindividuals and small developers. The indie game industry has seen a rise in\nrecent years with the growth of new online distribution systems and the mobile\ngame market.\n\nThe first video games were developed in the 1960s, but required mainframe\ncomputers and were not available to general public. Commercial game development\nbegan in 1970s with the advent of first generation video game consoles and home\ncomputers. Due to low costs and low capabilities of computers, a lone programmer\ncould develop a full game. However, approaching the 21st century, ever-\nincreasing computer processing power and heightened consumer expectations made\nit impossible for a single developer to produce a mainstream game. The average\nprice of game production slowly rose from US$1Mâ4M in 2000 to over 5M in 2006 to\nover 20M in 2010.\n\nMainstream games are generally developed in phases. First, in pre-production,\npitches, prototypes, and game design documents are written. If the idea is\napproved and the developer receives funding, a full-scale development begins.\nThis usually involves a 20â100 person team of various responsibilities, such as\ndesigners, artists, programmers, testers, etc. The games go through development,\nalpha, and beta stages until finally being released. Modern games are\nadvertised, marketed, and showcased at trade show demos. Even so, many games do\nnot turn a profit.\n","linknr":1443,"url":"Video_game_development","recorded":1362477578,"links":38,"instances":["development","console","computer_graphics","arts","video_game","third_generation","software","visual_arts","video_gaming","computer_and_video_games","nutrition","computing","computing","computer_gaming","webcomic"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080228191914/http://intl-nms.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/117.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080228191914/http://intl-nms.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/117.pdf"],"categories":["Video
