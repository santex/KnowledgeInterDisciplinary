Technically, many of these materials are only 'vapor retarders' as\nthey have varying degrees of permeability.\n\nMaterials have a moisture vapor transmission rate that is established by\nstandard test methods. One common set of units is g/mÂ²Â·day or g/100inÂ²Â·day.\nPermeability can be reported in perms, a measure of the rate of transfer of\nwater vapor through a material (1.0 US perm = 1.0 grain/square-\nfootÂ·hourÂ·inch of mercury â 57 SI perm =\n57 ng/sÂ·m 2Â·Pa). American building codes have classified vapor\nretarders as having a water vapor permeance of 1 perm or less when tested in\naccordance with the ASTM E96 desiccant, or dry cup method. Vapor\nretarding materials are generally categorized as: *Impermeable\n(â¤1 US perm, or â¤57 SI perm) (Materials such as asphalt-\nbacked kraft paper, vapor-retarding paint, oil-based paints, vinyl wall\ncoverings, extruded polystyrene, plywood, OSB), *Semi-permeable (1-\n10 US perm, or 57-570 SI perm) (Materials such as unfaced\nexpanded polystyrene, fiberfaced isocyanurate, heavy asphalt-impregnated\nbuilding papers, some latex-based paints), *Permeable (>10 US perm,\nor >570 SI perm) (Materials such as unpainted gypsum board and\nplaster, unfaced fiber glass insulation, cellulose insulation, unpainted\nstucco, cement sheathings, spunbonded polyolefin or some polymer-based exterior\nair barrier films).\n","linknr":180,"url":"Vapor_barrier","recorded":1362890098,"links":24,"instances":["hvac","firestop","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/digests/bsd-106-understanding-vapor-barriers/files/BSD-106_Understanding%20Vapor%20Barriers_r2011.pdf","http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/digests/bsd-106-understanding-vapor-barriers/files/BSD-106_Understanding%20Vapor%20Barriers_r2011.pdf","http://www.nuwool.com/pdf/VaporBarrierJournalPaper.pdf","http://www.nuwool.com/pdf/VaporBarrierJournalPaper.pdf"],"categories":["Moisture protection","Construction","Psychrometrics","Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning"],"headings":["Materials","Building construction","Confusion between Vapor barrier and Air barrier","Packaging","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Vapour_barrier.JPG/200px-Vapour_barrier.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Fs195_cp25_fibreglass_pc.jpg/200px-Fs195_cp25_fibreglass_pc.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Vapor_barrier_replace.jpg/200px-Vapor_barrier_replace.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["penetration","firestop"],["perm","unit"],["infiltration","hydrology"],["infiltration","hvac"]],"members":["infiltration","penetration","perm"],"related":["Thermal_insulation","Steel","Piping","Concrete","Penetration_(firestop)","Firestop","Kraft_paper","Damp_proofing","Packaging","Permeation","Moisture_vapor_transmission_rate","Perm_(unit)","Inch_of_mercury","Aluminium_foil","Polyethylene","Kraft_process","Metallised_film","Plywood","Air_barrier","Capillary_action","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Building_code","Dew_point","Purlin","Air_barriers","Permeation","Air_barrier","HVAC","Infiltration_(HVAC)"]}
