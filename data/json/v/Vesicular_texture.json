Scale box in millimeters.]]\n\n'Vesicular texture' is a volcanic rock texture characterized by a rock being\npitted with many cavities (known as vesicles) at its surface and inside. See\n[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:u3Vmkj1x25EJ:www.elmhurst-\n.edu/~richs/EC/102/Lectures/Igneous.ppt+vesicular+igneous+texture&cd=10&hl=en&c-\nt=clnk&gl=uk&source=www.google.co.uk \"Elmhurst College Powerpoint via google\nviewer\"], retrieved May 8, 2011 The texture is often found in extrusive\naphanitic, or glassy, igneous rock. These vesicles form during the extrusion of\nmagma to the surface; as the pressure decreases dissolved, magmatic gases are\nable to come out of solution, forming gas bubbles (the cavities) in the magma.\nWhen the magma is extruded as lava and cools, the lava solidifies around the gas\nbubbles, preserving them as vesicles.

Pearson Education Limited,\n2008, p. 76.\n\nA related texture is amygdaloidal in which the volcanic rock, usually basalt or\nandesite, has cavities, or vesicles, that are filled with secondary minerals,\nsuch as zeolites, calcite, quartz, or chalcedony. Individual cavity fillings are\ntermed amygdules (American usage), or amygdales (British usage). Sometimes these\ncan be sources of semi-precious stones such as agate.\n\nRock types that display a vesicular texture include pumice and scoria.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Vesicular_texture","recorded":1362560043,"links":19,"instances":["geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Volcanology"],"headings":["Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Olivine_basalt2.jpg/220px-Olivine_basalt2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/LvMS-Lvm.jpg/220px-LvMS-Lvm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Volcano_scheme.svg/29px-Volcano_scheme.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"]],"members":["rock"],"related":["Volcanic","Rock_(geology)","Aphanite","Igneous_rock","Amygdule","Basalt","Andesite","Zeolite","Calcite","Quartz","Chalcedony","Agate","Pumice","Scoria"]}
