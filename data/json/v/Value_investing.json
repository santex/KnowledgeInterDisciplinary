{"cursor":"21255","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Value investing' is an investment paradigm that derives from the ideas on\ninvestment that Ben Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business\nSchool in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text [[Security Analysis\n(book)|Security Analysis]]. Although value investing has taken many forms since\nits inception, it generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced\nby some form of fundamental analysis. Graham, Benjamin (1934). [[Security\nAnalysis (book)|Security Analysis]] New York: McGraw Hill Book Co., 4. ISBN 0-07-144820-\n9. As examples, such securities may be stock in public companies that\ntrade at discounts to book value or tangible book value, have high dividend\nyields, have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios.\n\nHigh-profile proponents of value investing, including Berkshire Hathaway\nchairman Warren Buffett, have argued that the essence of value investing is\nbuying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. Graham (1949). [[The\nIntelligent Investor]] New York: Collins, Ch.20. ISBN 0-06-055566-1. The\ndiscount of the market price to the intrinsic value is what Benjamin Graham\ncalled the \"margin of safety\". The intrinsic value is the discounted value of\nall future distributions. However, the future distributions and the appropriate\ndiscount rate can only be assumptions. ( Graham never recommended using future\nnumbers, only past ones). For the last 25 years, Warren Buffett has taken the\nvalue investing concept even further with a focus on \"finding an outstanding\ncompany at a sensible price\" rather than generic companies at a bargain price.\n\nNote that \"Value investing\" is a term that Graham himself never used. The term\nwas coined later for Graham's ideas and has resulted in significant\nmisinterpretation of his principles, the foremost being that Graham simply\nrecommended cheap stocks.\n","linknr":362,"url":"Value_investing","recorded":1362560498,"links":29,"instances":["finance","money","economics","businessman","financial","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.advisorperspectives.com/newsletters09/pdfs/Burton_Malkiel_Talks_the_Random_Walk.pdf","http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~rountree/FSA/Piotroski%20value%20investing%202000.pdf"],"categories":["Valuation (finance)","Stock market","Investment","Business terms","Finance","Corporate finance and governance","Financial markets","Market trends","Mathematical finance","Personal finance","Financial risk","Securities","Financial terminology","Finance theories"],"headings":["History","Value investing performance","Well-known value investors","Criticism","Value investing books and resources","See also","Value Investors at Wikiquote","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/BenjaminGraham.jpg/130px-BenjaminGraham.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["security","finance"],["intrinsic_value","finance"],["margin_of_safety","financial"],["michael_larson","businessman"],["saving","money"],["value","economics"]],"members":["intrinsic_value","saving","value","michael_larson","margin_of_safety","security"],"related":["Investment","Investor_profile","Benjamin_Graham","David_Dodd","Columbia_Business_School","Security_(finance)","Fundamental_analysis","Benjamin_Graham","Book_value","Tangible_Common_Equity","Dividend_yield","PE_ratio","Price-to-book_ratio","Berkshire_Hathaway","Warren_Buffett","Intrinsic_value_(finance)","Benjamin_Graham","Margin_of_safety","Benjamin_Graham","David_Dodd","Columbia_Business_School","Margin_of_safety_(financial)","Book_value","Discounted_cash_flow","Cash_flow","PE_ratio","Price-to-book_ratio","Growth_stocks","Warren_Buffett","The_Superinvestors_of_Graham-and-Doddsville","The_New_York_Times","William_J._Ruane","Irving_Kahn","Charles_Brandes","Berkshire_Hathaway","Charlie_Munger","Mario_Gabelli","Bruce_Greenwald","Mutual_Series","Max_Heine","Michael_F._Price","Franklin_Templeton_Investments","Seth_Klarman","The_Baupost_Group","BusinessWeek","John_Templeton","Michael_Larson_(businessman)","Cascade_Investment","Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation","Claremont_McKenna_College","Booth_School_of_Business","University_of_Chicago","Berkshire_Hathaway","Martin_J._Whitman","Joel_Greenblatt","Joel_Greenblatt","Charles_de_Vaulx","Jean-Marie_Eveillard","Speculation","Christopher_H._Browne","Tweedy,_Browne","Tweedy,_Browne","Benjamin_Graham","Tweedy,_Browne","Christopher_H._Browne","Peter_Cundill","Mason_Hawkins","Whitney_Tilson","Mohnish_Pabrai","Li_Lu","Guy_Spier","Markel","Growth_investing","Efficient-market_hypothesis","Bear_market","Bull_market","Stanford","Joseph_Piotroski","American_Association_of_Individual_Investors","John_Burr_Williams","Benjamin_Graham","Joel_Greenblatt","David_Dreman","Joel_Greenblatt","Capital_accumulation","Capital_appreciation","Contrarian_investing","Financial_economics","Graham_number","Growth_investing","Index_investing","Investment_management","Investor_profile","Investor_relations","Joseph_Piotroski","Magic_Formula_investing","Momentum_investing","Quality_investing","Return_on_investment","Saving_(money)","Speculation","Stock_investor","Value_(economics)","Value_averaging"]}
