Varshneya. Fundamentals of\ninorganic glasses. Sheffield: Society of Glass Technology, 2006. Usually,\nit is achieved by rapidly cooling a liquid through the glass transition. Certain\nchemical reactions also result in glasses. An important application is the\nvitrification of an antifreeze-like liquid in cryopreservation.\n\nVitrification is characteristic for amorphous materials or disordered systems\nand occurs when bonding between elementary particles (atoms, molecules, forming\nblocks) becomes higher than a certain threshold value. M.I. Ojovan, W.E.\nLee. Connectivity and glass transition in disordered oxide systems J. Non-Cryst.\nSolids, 356, 2534-2540 (2010). Thermal fluctuations break the bonds;\ntherefore, the lower the temperature, the higher the degree of connectivity.\nBecause of that amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature\ntermed glass transition temperature (T g): below T g\namorphous materials are glassy whereas above T g they are molten.\n\nIn a wider sense, the embedding of material in a glassy matrix is also called\nvitrification. An important application is the vitrification of radioactive\nwaste to obtain a stable compound that is suitable for ultimate disposal.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Vitrification","recorded":1362481628,"links":27,"instances":["season","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-15198.pdf","http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-15198.pdf"],"categories":["Glass","Cryobiology"],"headings":["Examples","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","season"],["organ","anatomy"]],"members":["spring","organ"],"related":["Latin_language","French_language","Glass","Glass_transition","Cryopreservation","Sucrose","Sugar","Rock_candy","Cotton_candy","Ice","Freezing","Cryobiology","Polar_region","Cryoprotectant","Arctic","Frog","Ectotherm","Glycerol","Glucose","Liver","Insulin","Spring_(season)","Insect","Antifreeze_protein","Soda-lime_glass","Glass","Sodium_carbonate","Calcium_oxide","Silicon_dioxide","Nuclear_waste","Obsidian","Leaching","Air_pollution","Groundwater","Radioactive_contamination","Electrode","Pacific_Northwest_National_Labs","PDF","Ethylene_glycol","Antifreeze","Propylene_glycol","Ice_cream","Vitrification_in_cryopreservation","Oocyte","Oocyte_cryopreservation","Embryo_cryopreservation","Glycerol","Cryobiology","Nitrogen","Organ_(anatomy)","Cryogenics","Organ_transplant","Xenobiotic","Twenty-First_Century_Medicine","Rabbit","Kidney","Neurovitrification","Alcor_Life_Extension_Foundation","Cryonics_Institute","Cells_Alive_System","Cryogenics","Crystalization","Supercooling","Vitrified_fort"]}
