{"cursor":"8722","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water' ('VSMOW') is a water standard defining the\nisotopic composition of freshwater. It was promulgated by the International\nAtomic Energy Agency in 1968, and, since 1993, continues to be evaluated and\nstudied by the IAEA along with the European Institute for Reference Materials\nand Measurements and the American National Institute for Standards and\nTechnology. The standard includes both the established values of stable isotopes\nfound in waters and calibration materials provided for standardization and\ninterlaboratory comparisons of instruments used to measure these values in\nexperimental materials.\n\nThe designation ocean water refers only to the evaporation of ocean waters in\nthe hydrologic cycle as the original source of fresh surface and ground waters\nand precipitation, but VSMOW is not a standard for seawater. Fresh distilled\nVSMOW water is also used for making high accuracy measurement of water's\nphysical properties and for defining laboratory standards since it is\nconsidered to be representative of average ocean water, in effect representing\nall water on Earth.\n\nPreviously to its definition, average ocean water and melted snow were used as\nreferences. These conventions were refined in the 1960s by the standardized\ndefinition of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). The U.S. National Bureau of\nStandards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) created\nphysical water standards for global use. However, the physical integrity of the\nU.S. standards came into question. The use of the SMOW standard was\ndiscontinued. {{cite journal |year=1995|title=New manuscript guidelines for\nthe reporting of stable hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotope-ratio\ndata|journal=Limnol.
