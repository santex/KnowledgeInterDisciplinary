He was nominated for the\nNobel Prize in the late 1960s. He was a member of the Communist Party of\nCzechoslovakia.\n\nHolan was born in Prague, but he spent most of his childhood outside the\nCapital. When he moved back in the 1920s he studied law and started a job as a\nclerk, a position that was a large source of dissatisfaction for the poet. He\nlost his father and in 1932 married VÄra PilaÅovÃ¡. In the same year he published\nthe collection of poems VanutÃ­ (Breezing), which he considered his first piece\nof poetic art (there were two books preceding it: BlouznivÃ½ vÄjÃ­Å /1926/ and\nTriumf smrti /1930/). It was his only collection to be reviewed by the knight of\nCzech critics, FrantiÅ¡ek Xaver Å alda, who compared Holan favorably with the\nFrench poet StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©.\n\nIn the 1930s Holan continued writing obscure lyrical poetry and slowly started\nto express his political feelings (reacting to the Spanish Civil War at\nfirst). Political poems OdpovÄÄ Francii (The Reply to France), ZÃ¡ÅÃ­ 1938\n(September 1938) and ZpÄv tÅÃ­krÃ¡lovÃ½ (Twelfth Night Song) were reactions to\nthe situation in Czechoslovakia from September 1938 till March 1939. They also\nmade him more intelligible and popular. The poem called Sen (The Dream) is a\npresage of a cruel war (amazingly published in the Protectorate of Bohemia and\nMoravia in April 1939). During the war he published several poetic stories in\nverse inspired by national humiliation. After the war he published an\napocalyptic record of events in his Panychida and chanted about the Red Army\nin TobÄ (To You), RudoarmÄjci (Red Army Soldiers) and DÃ­k SovÄtskÃ©mu svazu\n(Thanks to the Soviet Union). He left the Catholic Church and became a member\nof the Communist Party.\n\nIn 1949 after the communist takeover he was involved in an incident against\nSoviet influence in the new regime and his work was on the index of Czech\nliterature. He left the Communist Party and reentered the Catholic Church. In\nthe last years of his life he lived in reclusive poverty in the very heart of\nPrague on the island of Kampa.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he wrote longer poems with a mixture of reality and\nlyrical abstraction. He is best known in English for his postwar works, both the\noften teasingly obscure longer poem Noc s Hamletem (A Night with Hamlet, 1964)\nwhich became the most often translated Czech\npoem, [http://www.reflex.cz/Clanek21052.html JiÅÃ­ Rulf, VladimÃ­r\nHolan] and his short, gnomic lyrical reflections, with occasional\nsubmerged notes of political protest. He became a legendary poet-recluse.\n\nHe had a daughter KateÅina born in 1949 in his bad years and in addition to the\nsocial problems she suffered from Down's syndrome (he wrote a poem called Bajaja\nfor her which is with Jaroslav Seifert's Maminka one of the basic Czech children\npoetical works of Czech modern literature - also illustrated by JiÅÃ­ Trnka. When\nshe died in 1977, Holan lost the sense of life and ceased writing. He died in a\nKampa flat in 1980 and was buried in OlÅ¡any Cemetery.\n\n----\n\n\n'A Night with Hamlet' (first lines, English translation) :When crossing over\nfrom nature to existence, :walls are rather unkind, :walls wet from the urine of\ntalents, walls bespattered :by eunuchs revolting against the spirit, walls not\ndiminished :even though they may not yet be born, :and still walls already\nrounding out the fruit of the womb...\n","linknr":121,"url":"Vladimír_Holan","recorded":1375067780,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:VLADIMIR_HOLAN.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/VLADIMIR_HOLAN.jpg/250px-VLADIMIR_HOLAN.jpg","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Czech_and_Slovak","/wiki/Czech_people","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia","/wiki/Prague","/w/index.php?title=Franti%C5%A1ek_Xaver_%C5%A0alda&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Mallarm%C3%A9","/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War","/wiki/Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia","/wiki/Catholic_Church","/wiki/Kampa_Island","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Gnomic","/wiki/Down%27s_syndrome","/wiki/Jaroslav_Seifert","/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Trnka","/wiki/Ol%C5%A1any_Cemetery","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.reflex.cz/Clanek21052.html","http://www.artofeurope.com/holan/index.html","http://www.artofeurope.com/holan/index.html","http://poets.ir/index.php?q=node/1257","http://holan.shamlou.org","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/12227","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vladimír_Holan&oldid=541306582","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1905_births","/wiki/Category:1980_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Prague","/wiki/Category:Czech_writers","/wiki/Category:Czech_poets","/wiki/Category:Czech_Roman_Catholics","/wiki/Category:Czechoslovak_writers","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Order_of_Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1_Garrigue_Masaryk","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vladim%C3%ADr+Holan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vladim%C3%ADr+Holan","/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","/wiki/Talk:Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","#","/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&oldid=541306582","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q471450","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&id=541306582","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Vladim%C3%ADr+Holan","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Vladim%C3%ADr+Holan&oldid=541306582&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%A5%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//kk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD,_%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80","//sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Holan","#","//www.wikidat
