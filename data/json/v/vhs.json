Like many other technological innovations, each of several\ncompanies made an attempt to produce a television recording standard that the\nmajority of the world would embrace. At the peak of it all, the home video\nindustry was caught up in a series of videotape format wars. Two of the formats,\nVHS and Betamax, received the most media exposure. VHS would eventually win the\nwar, and therefore succeed as the dominant home video format, lasting throughout\nthe tape format period.<ref name=\"jchyung\"></ref>\n\nIn later years, optical disc formats began to offer better quality than video\ntape. The earliest of these formats, Laserdisc, was not widely adopted, but the\nsubsequent DVD format eventually did achieve mass acceptance and replaced VHS as\nthe preferred method of distribution after 2000.<ref></ref>\n","title":"VHS","headings":["History","Initial releases of VHS-based devices","Technical details","Recording process","Variations","Signal standards","Uses in marketing","VHS vs. Betamax","Decline","Successors","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: PAL","4: NTSC","3: JVC","3: S-VHS","2: Magnetic_tape","2: Betamax","2: Optical_disc","2: Compact_cassette","2: Signal-to-noise_ratio","2: MTV","2: Personal_computer","2: SECAM","2: MPEG-2","1: Video_recording","1: Home_video","1: Home_movies","1: Analog_recording","1: Videotape","1: Videotape_format_war","1: Laserdisc","1: DVD","1: Ampex","1: Kinescope","1: Kenjiro_Takayanagi","1: Sony_Corporation","1: Matsushita_Electric","1: U-matic","1: Blackboard","1: Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry","1: Consumer_confusion","1: Open_standard","1: Hitachi","1: Mitsubishi","1: Sharp_Corporation","1: Inches_per_second","1: JVC_HR-3300","1: Akihabara","1: General_Electric","1: Phillips_head","1: Photodiode","1: Incandescent_bulb","1: Light_emitting_diode","1: Video_cassette_recorder","1: Tape_transport","1: M","1: Multi-standard_television","1: Degaussing","1: Helix","1: Rpm","1: Azimuth_recording","1: Helical_scan","1: Tape_head","1: Megahertz","1: Frequency_modulation","1: Heterodyne#Heterodyning_in_analog_videotape_recording","1: Chrominance","1: Raster_scan","1: Overscan","1: Original_Equipment_Manufacturer","1: Baseband","1: Dolby_noise-reduction_system","1: Prosumer","1: Linear_video_editing","1: Control_track","1: Television_program","1: Compact_disc","1: Dynamic_range","1: Professional_audio","1: Sound_recording","1: Home_recording","1: Master_recording","1: Multitrack_recording","1: PCM_adapter","1: Digital_Audio_Tape","1: NICAM","1: ADAT","1: VHS-C","1: Camcorder","1: Gramophone_record","1: Synthpop","1: The_Human_League","1: Justify_My_Love","1: U2","1: Lead_single","1: CD_Video","1: LaserDisc","1: DVD_single","1: W-VHS","1: Multiple_sub-nyquist_sampling_Encoding_system","1: D-VHS","1: Digital-S","1: Sel-Sync","1: Video_editing","1: Fox_Broadcasting_Company","1: VHS_tape_rewinder","1: Data_backup","1: ArVid","1: Commonwealth_of_Independent_States","1: Alpha_Microsystems","1: Danmere_Ltd.","1: Broadcast_television_system","1: PAL-M","1: Monochrome","1: Closed_captioning","1: Teletext","1: Video_CD","1: Compression_artifact","1: Color_banding","1: Disc_rot","1: DVD-Video","1: Macroblocking","1: Mosquito_noise","1: Ringing_artifacts","1: DVD-5","1: Discrete_Cosine_Transform","1: 1080p","1: High-definition_video","1: Hard_disk","1: Set-top_box","1: Home_theater_PC","1: Portable_media_players","1: TiVo","1: Digital_video_recorder","1: Gigabyte","1: Megabit_per_second"]}
