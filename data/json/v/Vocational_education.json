{"cursor":"36147","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is a traditional trade.]]\n\n'Vocational education' (also known as 'vocational education and training' or\n'VET') is education that prepares people for specific trades, crafts and careers\nat various levels from a trade, a craft, technician, or a professional position\nin engineering, accountancy, nursing, medicine, architecture, pharmacy, law etc.\nCraft vocations are usually based on manual or practical activities,\ntraditionally non-academic, related to a specific trade, occupation, or\n[[vocation]]. It is sometimes referred to as technical education as the trainee\ndirectly develops expertise in a particular group of techniques. In the UK some\nhigher technician engineering positions that require 4-5 year apprenticeship\nrequire academic study to HNC / HND or higher City and Guilds level.\n\nVocational education may be classified as teaching procedural knowledge. This\ncan be contrasted with declarative knowledge, as used in education in a usually\nbroader scientific field, which might concentrate on theory and abstract\nconceptual knowledge, characteristic of tertiary education. Vocational education\ncan be at the secondary, post-secondary level, further education level and can\ninteract with the apprenticeship system. Increasingly, vocational education can\nbe recognised in terms of recognition of prior learning and partial academic\ncredit towards tertiary education (e.g., at a university) as credit; however, it\nis rarely considered in its own form to fall under the traditional definition of\nhigher education.\n\nVocational education is related to the age-old apprenticeship system of\nlearning. Apprenticeships are designed for many levels of work from manual\ntrades to high knowledge work.\n\nHowever, as the labor market becomes more specialized and economies demand\nhigher levels of skill, governments and businesses are increasingly\ninvesting in the future of vocational education through publicly funded\ntraining organizations and subsidized apprenticeship or traineeship\ninitiatives for businesses. At the post-secondary level vocational education\nis typically provided by an institute of technology, university, or by a\nlocal community college.\n\nVocational education has diversified over the 20th century and now exists in\nindustries such as retail, tourism, information technology, funeral services and\ncosmetics, as well as in the traditional crafts and cottage industries.\n","linknr":746,"url":"Vocational_education","recorded":1362543086,"links":46,"instances":["learning_theory","inventor","education","uk","btec"],"pdf":["http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/11/41631383.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/27/41738329.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/45/34/41506628.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/5/42578681.pdf"],"categories":["Alternative education","Vocational education|","Life skills"],"headings":["VET internationally","See also","References","Further reading","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/VII_%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_36.JPG/220px-VII_%D1%84%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C_%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_36.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["credit","education"],["william_stanley","inventor"],["business_and_technology_education_council","btec"],["conservative_party","uk"],["constructivism","learning_theory"]],"members":["constructivism","william_stanley","credit","conservative_party","business_and_technology_education_council"],"related":["Tradesman","Career","Tradesman","Craft","Technician","Engineering","Accountancy","Nursing","Medicine","Architecture","Pharmacy","Law","Academics","Employment","Procedural_knowledge","Declarative_knowledge","Science","Theory","Concept","Tertiary_education","Secondary_education","Post-secondary_education","Further_education","Apprenticeship","Recognition_of_prior_learning","Credit_(education)","Tertiary_education","University","Higher_education","Apprenticeship","Institute_of_technology","University","Community_college","Industry","Retailer","Tourism","Information_technology","Funeral","Cosmetics","Cottage_industry","Australia","Registered_training_organisation","TAFE","Australian_Qualifications_Framework","Northern_Melbourne_Institute_of_TAFE","Box_Hill_Institute_of_TAFE","William_Angliss_Institute_of_TAFE","The_Age","Soviet_Union","Professional`no-tehnicheskoye_uchilische","Tehnikum","Market_economy","Finland","Air_traffic_control","Municipalities_of_Finland","Austria","Germany","Liechtenstein","Switzerland","Industrie-_und_Handelskammer","Hong_Kong","Industrial_training_institutes","India","AAFT","Japan","Higher_education","Computer_technology","Fashion","English_language","Paraguay","Secondary_education","Campus","Harris_Academy_South_Norwood","William_Stanley_(inventor)","Royal_Society_for_the_encouragement_of_Arts,_Manufactures_&_Commerce","City_&_Guilds","Education_Act_1944","Tripartite_System","Grammar_school","Secondary_technical_school","Secondary_modern_school","HM_Government","Business_And_Technology_Education_Council_(BTEC)","Further_education","Higher_education","Further_education","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Youth_Training_Scheme","National_Vocational_Qualification","General_National_Vocational_Qualification","Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","Department_for_Children,_Schools_and_Families","England","Agricultural_education","Apprenticeship","Internship","Community_college","Constructivism_(learning_theory)","Employability","Environmental_education","Family_and_consumer_science","Finishing_school","Further_education","Institute_of_technology","Life_skills","Renewable_energy","Technical_and_Further_Education","Australia","Training","Retraining","Vocational_school","Vocational_university","Widening_participation","Philipp_Gonon","Asian_Academy_Of_Film_&_Television"]}
