Some\nVADs are intended for short term use, typically for patients recovering from\nheart attacks or heart surgery, while others are intended for long-term use\n(months to years and in some cases for life), typically for patients suffering\nfrom advanced congestive heart failure.\n\nVADs need to be clearly distinguished from artificial hearts, which are designed\nto completely take over cardiac function and generally require the removal of\nthe patient's heart.\n\nVADs are designed to assist either the right (RVAD) or left (LVAD) ventricle, or\nboth at once (BiVAD). Which of these types is used depends primarily on the\nunderlying heart disease and the pulmonary arterial resistance that determines\nthe load on the right ventricle.\n\nLVADs are most commonly used, but when pulmonary arterial resistance is high,\nright ventricular assistance may become necessary. Long term VADs are normally\nused to keep patients alive with a good quality of life while they wait for a\nheart transplantation (known as a \"bridge to transplantation\"). However, LVADs\nare sometimes used as destination therapy, meaning they will never undergo heart\ntransplant, and sometimes as a bridge to recovery.
