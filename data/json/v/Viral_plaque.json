{"cursor":"2190","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'viral plaque' is a visible structure formed within a cell culture, such as\nbacterial cultures within some nutrient medium (e.g. agar). The bacteriophage\nviruses replicate and spread, thus generating regions of cell destructions known\nas 'plaques'.\n\nCounting the number of plaques can be used as a method of virus quantification.\nThese plaques can sometimes be detected visually using colony counters, in much\nthe same way as bacterial colonies are counted; however, they are not always\nvisible to the naked eye, and sometimes can only be seen through a microscope,\nor using techniques such as staining (e.g. neutral red for\neukaryotes or giemsa for bacteria ) or\nimmunofluorescence. Special computer systems have been designed with the\nability to scan samples in batches.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of the plaque depends on the host strain, virus and the\nconditions. Highly virulent or lytic strains give clear plaques while strains\nthat only kill a fraction of their hosts (due to partial resistance/lysogeny) or\nonly reduce the rate of cell growth give turbid plaques. Some partially\nlysogenic phages give bull's-eye plaques with spots or rings of growth in the\nmiddle of clear regions of complete lysis.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Viral_plaque","recorded":1362481385,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Virology","Bacteriophages"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/M._smegmatis_plaque.jpg/220px-M._smegmatis_plaque.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cell_culture","Bacterium","Agar","Bacteriophage","Virus","Virus_quantification","Colony_counter","Microscope","Giemsa","Immunofluorescence","Assay","Viral_culture","Virus","Virus_quantification","Virology"]}
