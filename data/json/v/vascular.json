{"cursor":"997","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Vascular' in zoology and medicine means \"related to blood vessels\", which are\npart of the circulatory system. Its origin is in the Latin word vasculum,\nmeaning little vessel. http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vascular\n\nThe vascular system is a network of blood vessels; arteries, veins and\ncapillaries, that carry blood to organs around the body. An organ or tissue that\nis vascularized is heavily endowed with blood vessels and thus richly supplied\nwith blood.\n\nIn botany, plants with a dedicated transport system for water and nutrients are\ncalled vascular plants. Vascular plants include ferns, gymnosperms and flowering\nplants. A vascular bundle is part of such a transport system.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"vascular","recorded":1363385345,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Zoology","Blood_vessel","Circulatory_system","Latin","Vasculum","Arteries","Veins","Capillaries","Blood","Botany","Plant","Vascular_tissue","Vascular_plant","Fern","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Vascular_diseases","Vascular_headache","Vascular_surgery","Vascular_tissue"]}
