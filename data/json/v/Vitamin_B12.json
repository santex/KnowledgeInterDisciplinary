It\nis one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of\nevery cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation,\nbut also fatty acid synthesis and energy production. Neither fungi, plants nor\nanimals are capable of producing vitamin B 12 . Only bacteria and\narchaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis, although many foods are a\nnatural source of B 12 because of bacterial symbiosis. The vitamin is\nthe largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced\nindustrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis.\n\nVitamin B 12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds\n(vitamers), all of which have vitamin activity. It contains the biochemically\nrare element cobalt. Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is\naccomplished only by bacteria (which usually produce hydroxocobalamin), but\nconversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the\nhuman body. A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, does\nnot occur in nature, but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then\nused in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, because of\nits stability and lower production cost. In the body it is converted to the\nhuman physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind\nthe cyanide, albeit in minimal concentration. More recently, hydroxocobalamin,\nmethylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive\npharmacological products and food supplements. The extra utility of these is\ncurrently debated.\n\nVitamin B 12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease\npernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the\nstomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed. Intrinsic\nfactor is crucial for the normal absorption of B 12 , so a lack of\nintrinsic factor, as seen in pernicious anemia, causes a vitamin B 12\ndeficiency. Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B 12 deficiency and\ntheir biochemical effects have since been elucidated.\n","linknr":1211,"url":"Vitamin_B12","recorded":1362509988,"links":73,"instances":["biochemistry","scientist","mood","medical","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf","http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR23/nutrlist/sr23w418.pdf","http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR23/nutrlist/sr23w418.pdf","http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_14/issue_2/0224.pdf","http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_14/issue_2/0224.pdf"],"categories":["Organocobalt
