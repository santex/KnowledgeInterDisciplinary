{"cursor":"21757","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'volumetric display device' is a graphical display device that forms a visual\nrepresentation of an object in three physical dimensions, as opposed to the\nplanar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of\ndifferent visual effects. One definition offered by pioneers in the field is\nthat volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or\nrelaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space. Though\nthere is no consensus among researchers in the field, it may be reasonable to\nadmit holographic and highly multiview displays to the volumetric display\nfamily if they do a reasonable job of projecting a three-dimensional light\nfield within a volume.\n\nMost, if not all, volumetric 3D displays are either autostereoscopic or\nautomultiscopic; that is, they create 3D imagery visible to the unaided eye.\nNote that some display technologists reserve the term âautostereoscopicâ for flat-\npanel spatially multiplexed parallax displays, such as lenticular-sheet\ndisplays. However, nearly all 3D displays other than those requiring headwear,\ne.g. stereo goggles and stereo head-mounted displays, are autostereoscopic.\nTherefore, a very broad group of display architectures are properly deemed\nautostereoscopic.\n\nVolumetric 3D displays embody just one family of 3D displays in general. Other\ntypes of 3D displays are: stereograms / stereoscopes, view-sequential displays,\nelectro-holographic displays, parallax \"two view\" displays and parallax\npanoramagrams (which are typically spatially multiplexed systems such as lenticular-\nsheet displays and parallax barrier displays), re-imaging systems, and others.\n\nAlthough first postulated in 1912, and a staple of science fiction, volumetric\ndisplays are still under development, and have yet to reach the general\npopulation. With a variety of systems proposed and in use in small quantities â\nmostly in academia and various research labs â volumetric displays remain\naccessible only to academics, corporations, and the military.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Volumetric_display","recorded":1362684440,"links":23,"instances":["physics","journal","semiconductor","optics","optics"],"pdf":["http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110707081707/http://www.actuality-systems.com/site/content/pdf/Broyles_VanOrden_Article.pdf","http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi/papers/uist2004%20volumetric.pdf","http://www.hologlyphics.com/Hologlyphics_6803-51.pdf","http://www6.in.tum.de/pub/Main/Rothe/Volumetric-Display-Inkjet-Technology-Term-Paper_Roth-2006.pdf"],"categories":["Display technology","3D imaging"],"headings":["Types","Human-computer interfaces","Artistic use","Drawbacks","Market","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Laser_plasma_volumetric_display.jpeg/220px-Laser_plasma_volumetric_display.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/PerspectaRAD_mouse_Phantom.JPG/220px-PerspectaRAD_mouse_Phantom.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Hologlyphics_Coils.jpg/220px-Hologlyphics_Coils.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["doping","semiconductor"],["plasma","physics"],["focus","optics"],["lens","optics"],["science","journal"]],"members":["plasma","science","doping","lens","focus"],"related":["Display_device","Three-dimensional_space","3D_display","Holography","Autostereoscopic","Automultiscopic","Lenticular_lens","Science_fiction","Taxonomy","Permutation","Rpm","Spherical","Persistence_of_vision","Voxel","Photon_upconversion","Rare_earth_element","Doping_(semiconductor)","Fog_display","Pulse","Infrared","Laser","Nanosecond","Plasma_(physics)","Focus_(optics)","Mirror","Lens_(optics)","User_interface_techniques","Holography","Music","Video_synthesis","Sculpture","Improvisation","Film","Video","Special_effects","Video_synthesizer","24-bit","MB/s","Voxel","Order_of_magnitude","GB/s","MPEG","CPU","GPU","Sharp_Electronics","Zebra_imaging","Hologram","Virtual_retinal_display","Holodeck","Display_device","3D_display","Heliodisplay","Science_(journal)","Voxel","LED"]}
