{"cursor":"5288","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nTransport economics In transport economics, the 'value of time' is the\nopportunity cost of the time that a traveller spends on his/her journey. In\nessence, this makes it the amount that a traveller would be willing to pay\nin order to save time, or the amount they would accept as compensation for\nlost time.\n\nOne of the main justifications for transport improvements is the amount of time\nthat travellers will save. Using a set of values of time, the economic benefits\nof a transport project can be quantified in order to compare them to the costs\n(thus forming the basis of cost-benefit analysis). In particular, savings (or,\nfor that matter, increases) in travel time form part of the change in consumer\nsurplus for a transport project.\n\nValues of time are used to calculate the non-monetary costs incurred as part of\na journey, so that the generalised cost of the journey (a combination of both\nmonetary and non-monetary costs) can be calculated.\n\nThe value of time varies considerably from person to person and depends upon the\npurpose of the journey, but can generally be divided into two sets of\nvaluations: 'working time' and 'non-working time'. This division is appropriate\nbecause the value of working time (i.e. time spent travelling in the course of\nwork) is calculated differently from the value of non-working time (i.e. time\nspent travelling outside work).\n\nWorking time Working time is subject to the forces of the labour market, and can\nthus be valued in a relatively straightforward manner. The value of working time\nis the opportunity cost of that time to the employer, which is generally\nequivalent to the wages of the worker.\n\nFor example, if a worker on a salary of Â£20 per hour travels to a meeting, the\nvalue of time in that case is Â£20 per hour, because that is the amount the\nemployer would be willing to pay to reduce travel time (as travel time can be\nconsidered to be \"wasted\", i.e. not spent working).\n\nIn practice, time spent travelling on certain modes (especially train, but also\nbus and car passengers) can sometimes be used to carry out some work, while time\nspent using certain other modes (especially car drivers, cyclist and walkers)\ncannot be used to carry out work. This means the value of travel time (and thus\nthe value of travel time reductions) for modes where the employee could carry on\ndoing some work is lower for employees already using any such mode. Conversely\nthe value of travel time reductions for such modes for employees currently using\na mode that does not allow carry out work (and who would switch mode) is larger.\n\nThe UK Department for Transport calculates average values of time for travel on\nvarious modes of transport so that these values can be used to appraise\ntransport projects as part of its New Approach to Appraisal [http://web.archive-\n.org/web/20080309224315/http://www.webtag.org.uk/webdocuments/3_Expert/5_Econom-\ny_Objective/3.5.6.htm]. Some examples are given below in 2002 prices:\n\n* Car drivers: Â£26.43 per hour\n* Car passengers: Â£18.94 per hour\n* Bus passengers: Â£20.22 per hour\n* Rail passengers: Â£36.96 per hour*\n* Underground passengers: Â£35.95 per hour*\n* Walkers: Â£29.64 per hour\n* Cyclists: Â£17.00 per hour\n\nâ Skewed by London wages\n\nNon working time This is time spent outside work, which might include journeys\nto and from work and leisure journeys. Since this time is not valued in a\nmarket, it can only be estimated from revealed preference or stated preference\nanalysis techniques, where the real or hypothetical choices of travellers\nbetween faster, more expensive modes and slower, cheaper modes can be examined.\n\nFor example, if a traveller has a choice between a coach which takes six hours\nand costs Â£10, or a train which takes four hours and costs Â£30, we can deduce\nthat if the traveller chooses the train, their value of time is Â£10 per hour\nor more (because they are willing to spend at least Â£20 to save two hours'\ntravel time).\n\nThe difficulty in narrowing down the actual value of time from a pair of choices\nmeans that hypothetical situations are generally used (the stated preference\ntechnique) to deduce values of time.\n\nThe value of non-working time is linked strongly to utility theory.\n\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/unit3.5.6.php Values of time\n  and operating costs] -
