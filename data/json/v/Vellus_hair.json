Notice the lack of subcutaneous tissue on the vellus hair.]]\n\n\n'Vellus hair' is short, fine, light-colored, and barely noticeable hair that\ndevelops on most of a person's body from his/her childhood. Exceptions include\nthe lips, the back of the ear, the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, some\nexternal genital areas, the navel and scar tissue. The density of hair â the\nnumber of hair follicles per area of skin â varies from person to person. Each\nstrand of vellus hair is usually less than 2 mm (1/13 inch) long and the\nfollicle is not connected to a sebaceous gland.\n\nVellus hair is most easily observed on children and adult women, as they\ngenerally have less terminal hair to obscure it. Vellus hair is not lanugo hair.\nLanugo hair is a much thicker type of hair that, in human forms, normally grows\nonly on fetuses.\n\nVellus hair is differentiated from the more visible terminal or androgenic hair,\nwhich develops only during and after puberty, usually to a greater extent on men\nthan it does on women.\n\nThe Latin language uses the word vellus to designate \"a fleece\" or \"wool\".\n","linknr":293,"url":"Vellus_hair","recorded":1362897740,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hair anatomy"],"headings":["Production","Function","Complications","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/VellushaarTerminalhaar-translation.JPG/300px-VellushaarTerminalhaar-translation.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Huid.jpg/300px-Huid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Subcutaneous_tissue","Hair","Childhood","Lip","Ear","Hand","Genitals","Navel","Scar","Hair_follicle","Area","Milimetre","Hair_follicle","Sebaceous_gland","Terminal_hair","Lanugo","Terminal_hair","Androgenic_hair","Puberty","Latin_language","Lanugo_hair","Gestation","Terminal_hair","Puberty","Androgen","Terminal_hair","Pubic_hair","Sweat","Cortisol","Cushing's_syndrome","Anorexia_nervosa","Male_pattern_baldness","Hirsutism"]}
