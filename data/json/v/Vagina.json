In humans, this passage leads from the opening of\nthe vulva to the uterus (womb), but the vaginal tract ends at the cervix. Unlike\nmen, who have only one genital orifice, women have two, the urethra and the\nvagina. The vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening, and both\nopenings are protected by the labia. Clinical pediatric urology: A. Barry\nBelman, Lowell R. King, Stephen Alan Kramer (2002) The inner\nmould of the vagina has a foldy texture which can create friction for the penis\nduring intercourse. During arousal, the vagina gets moist to facilitate the\nentrance of the penis.
