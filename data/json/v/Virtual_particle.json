{"cursor":"21141","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physics, a 'virtual particle' is a transient fluctuation that exhibits many\nof the characteristics of an ordinary particle, but that exists for a limited\ntime. The concept of virtual particles arises in perturbation theory of quantum\nfield theory where interactions between ordinary particles are described in\nterms of exchanges of virtual particles. Any process involving virtual particles\nadmits a schematic representation known as a Feynman diagram, in which virtual\nparticles are represented by internal lines.

Quantum Field Theory, John\nWiley & Sons, Chichester UK, revised edition, ISBN 0-471-94186-7, pp. 56,\n176.\n\nVirtual particles do not necessarily carry the same mass as the corresponding\nreal particle, although they always conserve energy and momentum. The longer the\nvirtual particle exists, the closer its characteristics comes to those of\nordinary particles. Virtual particles may be thought of as arising due to the\ntime-energy uncertainty principle. Larry Gilman\"[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7195/Virtual-\nParticles.html Virtual Particles]\" David\nRaymond(2006)\"[http://physics.nmt.edu/~raymond/classes/ph13xbook/node144.html\nVirtual Particles]\" They are important in the physics of many processes,\nincluding particle scattering and Casimir forces. In quantum field theory, even\nclassical forces â such as the electromagnetic repulsion or attraction between\ntwo charges â can be thought of as due to the exchange of many virtual photons\nbetween the charges.\n\nThe term is somewhat loose and vaguely defined, in that it refers to the view\nthat the world is made up of \"real particles\": it is not; rather, \"real\nparticles\" are better understood to be excitations of the underlying quantum\nfields. Virtual particles are also excitations of the underlying fields, but are\n\"temporary\" in the sense that they appear in calculations of interactions, but\nnever as asymptotic states or indices to the scattering matrix. As such the\naccuracy and use of virtual particles in calculations is firmly established, but\ntheir \"reality\" or existence is a question of philosophy rather than science.\n\nAntiparticles have been proven to exist and should not be confused with virtual\nparticles or virtual antiparticles.\n","linknr":305,"url":"Virtual_particle","recorded":1362676071,"links":34,"instances":["physics","quantum_mechanics","quantum_mechanics"],"pdf":["http://www.cfin.au.dk/medias/media1206.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Particle physics","Quantum field theory"],"headings":["Properties","Manifestations","History","Feynman diagrams","Vacuums","Pair production","Actual and virtual particles compared","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/1pxchg.svg/220px-1pxchg.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Vacuum_polarization.svg/220px-Vacuum_polarization.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["perturbation_theory","quantum_mechanics"],["hamiltonian","quantum_mechanics"],["virtual_state","physics"]],"members":["virtual_state","hamiltonian","perturbation_theory"],"related":["Physics","Perturbation_theory","Feynman_diagram","Casimir_force","Scattering_matrix","Antiparticle","Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)","Quantum_field_theory","Feynman_diagram","Destructive_interference","Quantum_tunnelling","Scattering_matrix","Feynman_diagram","Near_and_far_field","Coulomb_force","Photon","Inverse_square_law","Magnetic_field","Dipole","Photon","Inverse_square_law","Near_and_far_field","Dipole","Electromagnetic_waves","Near_and_far_field","Near_field_communication","Near_and_far_field","Photon","MRI","Electromagnetic_induction","Electronic_article_surveillance","MRI","Resonant_inductive_coupling","Wireless_energy_transfer","Strong_nuclear_force","Quark","Gluon","Pi_meson","Rho_meson","Weak_nuclear_force","W_and_Z_bosons","Spontaneous_emission","Photon","Casimir_effect","Ground_state","Van_der_Waals_force","Vacuum_polarization","Pair_production","Decay_of_the_vacuum","Lamb_shift","Hawking_radiation","Solid-state_physics","Semiconductor","Conduction_band","Valence_band","Phonon","Two-photon_absorption","Probability_amplitude","Günter_Nimtz","Paul_Dirac","Dirac_sea","Electronic_band_structure","Crystalline","Solid_state_physics","Conduction_electron","Electron_hole","Scattering_amplitude","Particle_physics","Feynman_diagram","On-shell","Propagator","Momentum","Electron","Electromagnetic_interaction","Photon","Nucleon","Pion","Quark","Strong_force","Gluon","Meson","Vector_boson","Fermion","One-loop_diagram","Eigenstate","Particle_number_operator","Annihilation_operator","Creation_operator","Ladder_operator","Commutator","Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)","Observable","Probability_distribution","Vacuum_energy","Casimir_effect","Zero-point_energy","Dielectric","Fermion_number","Fermion","Pair_creation","Normal_order","Elementary_particle","Antiparticle","Frame_of_reference","Unruh_effect","Gas","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Pair_production","Vacuum_decay","Atomic_nucleus","Fine_structure_constant","Dimensionless_quantity","Dirac_sea","Julian_Schwinger","Conservation_law","Electric_charge","Beta_decay","Neutron","W_particle","Electron","Antineutrino","Proton","Photon","Uncertainty_principle","Force_carrier","QCD_vacuum","QED_vacuum","Static_forces_and_virtual-particle_exchange","Vacuum_Rabi_oscillation","Vacuum_state","Virtual_State_(physics)"]}
