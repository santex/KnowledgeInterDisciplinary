It was a development of and a follow-\non to the Vostok spacecraft. Voskhod capsules were only used for two manned\nspace flights and were superseded by the Soyuz spacecrafts.\n\nThe Voskhod craft consisted of a spherical descent module (diameter 2.3 meters),\nwhich housed the cosmonauts, and instruments, and a conical instrument module\n(mass 2.27 tonnes, 2.25 m long, 2.43 m wide), which contained propellant and the\nengine system.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Voskhod_spacecraft","recorded":1362267845,"links":36,"instances":["spacecraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Manned spacecraft","Voskhod programme"],"headings":["Design","Vostok 3KV (1964)","Voskhod 3KD (1965)","General data","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Voskhod_1_and_2.png/250px-Voskhod_1_and_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Voskhod_spacecraft_diagram.png/110px-Voskhod_spacecraft_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["soyuz","spacecraft"]],"members":["soyuz"],"related":["Space_capsule","S.P._Korolev_Rocket_and_Space_Corporation_Energia","Sergei_Korolev","Soviet_space_program","Vostok_spacecraft","Foton","Spacecraft","Soviet_Union","Human_spaceflight","Voskhod_programme","Vostok_spacecraft","Soyuz_(spacecraft)","Astronaut","Braking_rocket","Space_suit","Aleksei_Leonov","Voskhod_rocket","Vostok_rocket","R-7_rocket","ICBM","Kosmos_47","Voskhod_1","Voskhod_Spacecraft_\"Globus\"_IMP_navigation_instrument","Kosmos_57","Voskhod_2","Voskhod_2","Voskhod_rocket","Voskhod_programme","Spacecraft","Voskhod_Spacecraft_\"Globus\"_IMP_navigation_instrument"]}
