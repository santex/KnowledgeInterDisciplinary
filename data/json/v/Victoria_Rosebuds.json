Club owner Tom O'Connor, Jr., a local\nrancher, suffered a heart attack in 1961, and without his continued support, the\nteam was unable to remain in Victoria. Two weeks later, on June 10, 1961,\nVictoria received another club struggling at the gate, the Rio Grande Valley\nGiants, who transferred from Harlingen, Texas. The Rosebuds had originally moved\nto Victoria from Shreveport, Louisiana. after the 1957 season.\n\nBoth the Ardmore Rosebuds (who drew a total of almost 49,000 fans for the\nseason) and Victoria Giants (a total of 43,000) disappeared from the TL map in\n1962, succeeded by the Albuquerque Dukes and El Paso Sun Kings.\n\nSeveral other minor league teams also called themselves the Victoria Rosebuds,\nindluding teams in the Southwest Texas League in 1910-11, the Gulf Coast League\nin 1926, (not to be confused with the present-day GCL in Florida), the Big State\nLeague in 1956-7, and the Lone Star League in 1977.\n\nHowever, the Rosebuds/Giants' four years in the Texas League during the 1958-61\nperiod (along with a return to the Texas loop in 1974 for one season as the\nVictoria Toros) represented the highest level of minor league team to represent\nthe city. Victoria has always been by far the smallest market base in its\nrespective leagues. The Texas League Rosebuds competed in a league against\nHouston and Dallas, with less than 20,000 inhabitants in Victoria. In 1910, the\ncity supported the Rosebuds with a population of less than 5,000.\n\nThe Rosebuds' most successful season was in 1959, when they won the TL's regular-\nseason championship before falling in the playoffs to the San Antonio Missions.\nThe '59 Buds were managed by \"Pistol Pete\" Reiser, the former star Dodger\ncenterfielder, who won the 1959 ''Sporting News'' Minor League Manager of the\nYear Award for his efforts. Outfielder Carl Warwick, a future major leaguer, was\nthe league Most Valuable Player, while Carroll Beringer, later a long-time MLB\ncoach, was the TL's top pitcher.\n\nA number of major league stars advanced from the Rosebuds, including Frank\nHoward and Tommy Davis\n\nIn , Victoria was represented in the Class A Lone Star League by a team\nnicknamed the Rosebuds. Although the team finished under .500, at 38â42, the\nRosebuds compiled the best overall record in the Lone Star's North Division and\ndraw 14,000 fans. The league lasted only that one campaign before disbanding.\n\nThe Rosebuds played their games in Riverside Stadium, which was built in 1946.\nRiverside Stadium is still in use by the Victoria Generals in the Texas\nCollegiate League and by the University of HoustonâVictoria Jaguars.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Victoria_Rosebuds","recorded":1375076028,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/1910_in_baseball","/wiki/1977_in_baseball","/wiki/Victoria,_Texas","/wiki/Lone_Star_League","/wiki/Gulf_States_League","/wiki/Texas_League","/wiki/Big_State_League","/wiki/Gulf_Coast_League","/w/index.php?title=Southwest_Texas_League&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_York_Mets","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Riverside_Stadium_(Victoria)","/wiki/Minor_league_baseball","/wiki/Texas_League","/wiki/Victoria,_Texas","/wiki/1958_in_baseball","/wiki/Ardmore,_Oklahoma","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley_Giants","/wiki/Harlingen,_Texas","/wiki/1962_in_baseball","/wiki/Albuquerque_Dukes","/wiki/El_Paso_Diablos","/w/index.php?title=Southwest_Texas_League&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gulf_Coast_League","/wiki/Big_State_League","/wiki/1974_in_baseball","/wiki/1959_in_baseball","/wiki/San_Antonio_Missions","/wiki/Pete_Reiser","/wiki/Centerfielder","/wiki/The_Sporting_News","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/Carl_Warwick","/wiki/Carroll_Beringer","/wiki/Coach_(baseball)","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Frank_Howard","/wiki/Tommy_Davis","/wiki/1977_in_baseball","/wiki/Lone_Star_League","/wiki/Riverside_Stadium_(Victoria)","/wiki/Victoria_Generals","/wiki/Texas_Collegiate_League","/wiki/University_of_Houston%E2%80%93Victoria","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Major_league_baseball","/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Baseball_America","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit&section=3","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?city=Victoria&state=TX&country=US","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&oldid=565495322","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Texas_League_teams","/wiki/Category:Victoria,_Texas","/wiki/Category:Defunct_baseball_teams_in_Texas","/wiki/Category:Baltimore_Orioles_minor_league_affiliates","/wiki/Category:New_York_Mets_minor_league_affiliates","/wiki/Category:Detroit_Tigers_minor_league_affiliates","/wiki/Category:Brooklyn_Dodgers_minor_league_affiliates","/wiki/Category:Los_Angeles_Dodgers_minor_league_affiliates","/wiki/Category:Sports_clubs_established_in_1958","/wiki/Category:Sports_clubs_disestablished_in_1977","/wiki/Category:1958_establishments_in_Texas","/wiki/Category:1977_disestablishments_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Victoria+Rosebuds&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Victoria+Rosebuds","/wiki/Victoria_Rosebuds","/wiki/Talk:Victoria_Rosebuds","#","/wiki/Victoria_Rosebuds","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Victoria_Rosebuds","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Victoria_Rosebuds","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&oldid=565495322","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7927015","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Victoria_Rosebuds&id=565495322","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Victoria+Rosebuds","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Victoria+Rosebuds&oldid=565495322&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Rosebuds&printable=yes","
