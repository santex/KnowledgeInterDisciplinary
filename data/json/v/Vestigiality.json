{"cursor":"23942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is a vestigial structure; it has lost much of its ancestral function.]]\n\nThe concept of 'vestigiality' applies to genetically determined structures or\nattributes that have apparently lost most or all of its ancestral function in a\ngiven species. Assessment of the vestigial status must generally rely on\ncomparison with homologous features in related species. The emergence of\nvestigiality occurs by normal evolutionary processes, typically by loss of\nfunction of a feature that is no longer subject to positive selection pressures\nwhen it loses its value in a changing environment. More urgently the feature\nmay be selected against when its function becomes definitely harmful. Typical\nexamples of both types occur in the loss of flying capability in island-\ndwelling species.\n","linknr":462,"url":"Vestigiality","recorded":1362483443,"links":47,"instances":["medicine","anatomy","biology","natural_selection","biology","biographer","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Overview","History","Common descent and evolutionary theory","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Gray536.png/300px-Gray536.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Blindmaus-drawing.jpg/250px-Blindmaus-drawing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Whale_skeleton.png/350px-Whale_skeleton.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Gray906.png/225px-Gray906.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["negative_selection","natural_selection"],["organ","anatomy"],["fitness","biology"],["james_moore","biographer"],["homology","biology"],["colon","anatomy"],["stress","medicine"],["spandrel","biology"]],"members":["stress","colon","fitness","negative_selection","homology","james_moore","spandrel","organ"],"related":["Homology_(biology)","Evolution","Directional_selection","Evolutionary_pressure","Negative_selection_(natural_selection)","Island_ecology","Ontogeny","Ontogeny","Vermiform_appendix","Nucleic_acid","Junk_DNA","Noncoding_DNA","Pseudogenes","Organ_(anatomy)","Genetic_variation","Exaptation","Penguin","Emu","Ostrich","Fitness_(biology)","Genetic_drift","Evolutionary_pressure","Evidence_of_common_descent","Darwinian_evolution","Aristotle","Aristotle","Ã‰tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Guillaume-Antoine_Olivier","Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck","Charles_Darwin","Intrinsic_muscles_of_external_ear","Wisdom_teeth","Vermiform_appendix","Tail_bone","Body_hair","Nictitating_membrane","Human_eye","Charles_Darwin","Inheritance_of_acquired_characters","Adrian_Desmond","James_Moore_(biographer)","Robert_Wiedersheim","Robert_Wiedersheim","Scopes_Trial","Homology_(biology)","Evolution","Energy","Infection","Cancer","Natural_selection","Horses","Toe","Common_descent","Douglas_Futuyma","English_language","Latin","Old_Norse","Adaptation","Animal","Whale","Cetacean","Ostrich","Emu","Flightless_bird","Cavefish","Salamander","Boidae","Pythonidae","Pelvic_spur","Amphisbaenia","Adaptation","Mutation","Human_evolution","Human","Primate","Caecum","Omnivore","Ileum","Colon_(anatomy)","Cellulose","Charles_Darwin","CNN","Associated_Press","Coccyx","Plica_semilunaris_of_the_conjunctiva","Human_eye","Nictitating_membrane","Auricular_muscles","Ear","Occipitofrontalis_muscle","Goose_bump","Stress_(medicine)","Reflex_action","Infant","L-gulonolactone_oxidase","Enzyme","Vitamin_C","Simian","Genome","Human_genome","Pseudogene","Stipules","Gynoecium","Equisetum","Paraphyses","Fungi","Atavism","Dewclaw","Maladaptation","Plantaris_muscle","Recessive_refuge","Spandrel_(biology)","Human_vestigiality","Exaptation","TalkOrigins_Archive"]}
