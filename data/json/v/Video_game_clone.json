This is an unofficial handheld game console cloning a Nintendo DS and\n  featuring LED games]]\n\nA 'video game clone' is either a video game (or series) which is very similar to\nor heavily inspired by a previous popular game or series. It also applies to a\nthird-party remake of a video game console.\n\nThe term is sometimes derogatory, implying a lack of originality; however,\nclones can be anything from a pure \"ripoff\", to a legitimate derivative or\nimprovement on the original or even a homage.\n\nCloning a game in digital marketplaces is common, because it is hard to prevent\nand easy to compete with existing games. Developers can copyright the graphics,\ntitle, story, and characters, but they cannot easily protect software design and\ngame mechanics. A patent for the mechanics is possible, but acquiring one is\nexpensive and time-consuming.
