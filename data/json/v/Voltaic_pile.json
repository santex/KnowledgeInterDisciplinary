It was invented by Alessandro Volta,\nwho published his experiments in 1800. The voltaic pile then enabled a rapid\nseries of discoveries including the electrical decomposition (electrolysis) of\nwater into oxygen and hydrogen by Nicholson and Carlisle (1800) and the\ndiscovery or isolation of the chemical elements sodium (1807), potassium (1807),\ncalcium (1808), boron (1808), barium (1808), strontium (1808), and magnesium\n(1808) by Davy. The entire 19th\ncentury electrical industry was powered by batteries related to Volta's until\nthe advent of the dynamo (the electrical generator) in the 1870s.\n\nVolta's invention built on Luigi Galvani's 1780s discovery of how a circuit of\ntwo metals and a frog's leg can cause the frog's leg to respond, Volta\ndemonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and brine-soaked cloth or cardboard\nare arranged in a circuit they produce an electric current. In 1800, Volta\nstacked several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs\n(electrodes) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in brine (electrolyte) to\nincrease the electrolyte conductivity. When the top and\nbottom contacts were connected by a wire, an electric current flowed through the\nvoltaic pile and the connecting wire.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Voltaic_pile","recorded":1362485592,"links":43,"instances":["electricity","chemist"],"pdf":["http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/hist/hist-01-Volta-1.pdf","http://electrochem.cwru.edu/estir/hist/hist-01-Volta-1.pdf","http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/823202-DHllYA/native/823202.pdf"],"categories":["Battery types"],"headings":["History","Applications","Electrochemistry","Dry pile","Electromotive force","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Voltaic_pile.svg/250px-Voltaic_pile.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/VoltaBattery.JPG/250px-VoltaBattery.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/28px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Galvanic_Cell.svg/150px-Galvanic_Cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_nicholson","chemist"],["current","electricity"],["william_nicholson","chemist"]],"members":["current","william_nicholson"],"related":["Zinc","Como","Alessandro_Volta","Electrolysis_of_water","William_Nicholson_(chemist)","Anthony_Carlisle","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Boron","Barium","Strontium","Magnesium","Humphry_Davy","Dynamo","Luigi_Galvani","Electric","Copper","Silver","Zinc","Electrode","Brine","Electrolyte","Current_(electricity)","London","Royal_Society","William_Nicholson_(chemist)","Anthony_Carlisle","Electrolysis","Humphry_Davy","Electromotive_force","William_Hyde_Wollaston","Friction","Vasily_Vladimirovich_Petrov","Electric_arc","Humphry_Davy","Andrew_Crosse","Royal_Institution","Arc_discharge","Electrochemistry","Electricity","Johann_Wilhelm_Ritter","Zamboni_pile","Dry_cell","Electromotive_force","Contact_tension","Ions","Electron","Redox","Hydrogen"]}
