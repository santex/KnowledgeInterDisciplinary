A vocal socialist, Childe accepted the socio-\neconomic theory of Marxism and was an early, though unorthodox, proponent of\nMarxist archaeology, which he combined with his culture-historical\narchaeological perspective. Childe worked for most of his life as an academic in\nthe United Kingdom, initially at the University of Edinburgh, and later at the\nInstitute of Archaeology, London. He also wrote a number of groundbreaking books\non the subject of archaeology and prehistory, most notably Man Makes Himself\n(1936) and What Happened in History (1942).\n\nBorn in Sydney, New South Wales into a middle-class family of English descent,\nChilde studied at the University of Sydney before moving to England where he\nstudied at the University of Oxford. Upon returning to Australia he was\nprevented from working in academia because of his political views and so took up\nemployment working for the Australian Labor Party before he once more returned\nto England, settling down in London. Here he proceeded through a variety of\njobs, all the time continuing his research into European prehistory by making\nvarious journeys across the continent, and eventually publishing his findings in\nacademic papers and books.\n\nFrom 1927 through to 1946 he was employed as the Abercromby Professor of\nArchaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and at that time was responsible for\nthe excavation of the unique Neolithic settlement of Skara Brae and the\nchambered tomb of Maeshowe, both in Orkney, northern Scotland. Becoming a co-\nfounder and president of the Prehistoric Society, it was also at this time that\nhe came to embrace Marxism and became a noted sympathiser with the Soviet Union,\nparticularly during the Second World War. In 1947 he was offered the post of\ndirector at the Institute of Archaeology, something that he took up until 1957,\nwhen he retired. That year he committed suicide by jumping off of a cliff in the\nAustralian Blue Mountains near where he was born.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most important archaeologists and prehistorians of\nhis generation, he became known as the \"great synthesizer\" for his work in\nsynthesizing regional research into a broader picture of Near Eastern and\nEuropean prehistory. He was also renowned for his emphasis on revolutionary\ntechnological and economic developments in human society, such as the Neolithic\nRevolution and the Urban Revolution, in this manner being influenced by Marxist\nideas on societal development.\n","linknr":1024,"url":"V._Gordon_Childe","recorded":1362480867,"links":50,"instances":["new_south_wales","uk","australian_politician","politician","uk","archaeology","uk","archaeologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1892
