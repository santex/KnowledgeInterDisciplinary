Harris was regarded as one of the finest soccer\nplayers of his generation and in 1906 became the first Shelbourne player capped\nby Ireland. He still remains the club's most capped player. In 1913 he captained\nthe first Ireland team to beat England and in 1914 he was a member of the\nIreland team that won the British Home Championship. Harris has been described\nas an extremely hard player in the mode of Kevin Moran or Paul McGrath and like\nhis Shelbourne, Everton and Ireland team mate, Bill Lacey, he was also very\nversatile, covering just about every outfield position during his career.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Val_Harris","recorded":1362685419,"links":12,"instances":["soccer","footballer","ifa","footballer_born_1884","football_ground","footballer","soccer","irish_footballer","footballer","footballer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1884 births","Year of death missing","Sportspeople from County Dublin","Irish association footballers (before 1923)","Republic of Ireland association footballers","Pre-1950 IFA international footballers","League of Ireland players","Shelbourne F.C. players","West Bromwich Albion F.C. players","Everton F.C. players","Republic of Ireland football managers","Republic of Ireland national football team managers","League of Ireland managers","Shelbourne F.C. managers","Dublin Gaelic footballers","Isles of the Sea Gaelic footballers","Gaelic football players who switched code","League of Ireland XI players"],"headings":["Playing career","Coaching career","Honours","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Ireland_1914.png/330px-Ireland_1914.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ireland_national_football_team","ifa"],["football","soccer"],["ireland_national_football_team","ifa"],["kevin_moran","footballer"],["paul_mcgrath","footballer"],["ireland_national_football_team","ifa"],["bill_lacey","footballer"],["football","soccer"],["kevin_moran","footballer"],["leinster_senior_league","soccer"],["bill_lacey","footballer"],["bill_lacey","footballer"],["ireland_national_football_team","ifa"],["billy_scott","footballer_born_1884"],["bill_lacey","footballer"],["ireland_national_football_team","ifa"],["solitude","football_ground"],["robert_milne","footballer"],["billy_scott","footballer_born_1884"],["patrick_o'connell","1887-1959"],["bill_lacey","footballer"],["mick_o'brien","1893-1940"],["jimmy_kelly","irish_footballer"]],"members":["leinster_senior_league","paul_mcgrath","ireland_national_football_team","billy_scott","solitude","bill_lacey","football","jimmy_kelly","robert_milne","kevin_moran"],"related":["Ringsend","Dublin","Republic_of_Ireland","Dublin_GAA","Shelbourne_F.C.","Everton_F.C.","Shelbourne_F.C.","Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)","Irish_League_XI","League_of_Ireland_XI","Irish_Free_State_national_football_team","Shelbourne_F.C.","Ringsend","Dublin","Republic_of_Ireland","Gaelic_football","Dublin_GAA","Football_(soccer)","Shelbourne_FC","Everton_F.C.","Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)","England_national_football_team","1914_British_Home_Championship","Kevin_Moran_(footballer)","Paul_McGrath_(footballer)","Shelbourne_F.C.","Everton_F.C.","Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)","Bill_Lacey_(footballer)","Football_(soccer)","Gaelic_football","Ringsend","All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship","Dublin_GAA","Jack_Kirwan","Con_Martin","Kevin_Moran_(footballer)","Shelbourne_FC","Leinster_Senior_League_(soccer)","West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.","IFA_Premiership","Glentoran_F.C.","Irish_Cup","Belfast_Celtic","Dalymount_Park","Joseph_Ledwidge","Bill_Lacey_(footballer)","Everton_F.C.","Irish_Cup","Belfast_Celtic","Glentoran_F.C.","League_of_Ireland","Bill_Lacey_(footballer)","Bob_Fullam","Ed_Brookes","Louis_Bookman","Irish_Football_League","League_of_Ireland","Irish_Cup","Everton_F.C.","Arsenal_F.C.","FA_Cup","Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)","Billy_Scott_(footballer_born_1884)","Bill_Lacey_(footballer)","Shelbourne_F.C.","FA_Cup","Ireland_national_football_team_(IFA)","Solitude_(football_ground)","Robert_Milne_(footballer)","Jack_Kirwan","Billy_Scott_(footballer_born_1884)","Billy_Gillespie","Windsor_Park","1914_British_Home_Championship","Patrick_O'Connell_(1887-1959)","Louis_Bookman","Bill_Lacey_(footballer)","Irish_Free_State_national_football_team","Shelbourne_F.C.","Netherlands_national_football_team","Alex_Stevenson","Mick_O'Brien_(1893-1940)","Jimmy_Kelly_(Irish_footballer)","Paddy_Moore","FAI_Cup","Dublin_GAA_Honours","Ringsend","Dublin","Republic_of_Ireland"]}
