His ideas of noosphere were\nan important contribution to Russian cosmism. He also worked in Ukraine, where\nhe founded the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (now National Academy of Sciences\nof Ukraine). He is most noted for his 1926 book The Biosphere in which he\ninadvertently worked to popularize Eduard Suessâ 1885 term biosphere, by\nhypothesizing that life is the geological force that shapes the earth. In 1943\nhe was awarded the Stalin Prize.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Vladimir_I._Vernadsky","recorded":1362505499,"links":39,"instances":["solid_mechanics","science","publisher"],"pdf":["http://www.im.microbios.org/13march01/09%20Lapo%20(P).pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/13march01/09%20Lapo%20(P).pdf","http://www.geochemsoc.org/downloads/gn125.pdf"],"categories":["1863 births","1945 deaths","Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery","Cosmists","Geochemists","Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine","Full Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences","Full Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1917–1925)","Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences","People from Saint Petersburg","Russian biologists","Russian Constitutional Democratic Party members","Russian mineralogists","Russian people of Ukrainian descent","Soviet mineralogists","Stalin Prize winners","Ukrainian scientists|Vernadsky","Ukrainian biologists"],"headings":["Biography","Works (selected)","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vernadsky.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["elastic","solid_mechanics"],["nauka","publisher"],["gaia_theory","science"]],"members":["elastic","gaia_theory","nauka"],"related":["Saint_Petersburg","Russian_Empire","Moscow","Soviet_Union","Russian_Empire","Soviet_Union","Ukrainians","Ukrainians","Geology","Crystallography","Mineralogy","Geochemistry","Nuclear_geology","Biology","Biogeochemistry","Philosophy","Moscow_State_University","National_Academy_of_Science_of_Ukraine","Tavrida_National_V.I._Vernadsky_University","Saint_Petersburg_State_University","Noosphere","Biogeochemistry","Ukraine","Soviet_Union","Mineralogist","Geochemist","Geochemistry","Biogeochemistry","Radiogeology","Noosphere","Russian_cosmism","Ukraine","Ukrainian_Academy_of_Sciences","Eduard_Suess","Biosphere","Stalin_Prize","Saint_Petersburg","Russian_Empire","Russians","Ukrainians","Zaporozhian_Cossacks","Political_economy","Kiev","Saint_Petersburg_State_University","Mineralogist","Vasily_Dokuchaev","Crystallography","Dementia","Paul_Groth","Optical","Thermal","Elastic_(solid_mechanics)","Magnetic","Electrical","Crystal","Noosphere","Biosphere","Austria","Geologist","Eduard_Suess","Noosphere","Geosphere","Biosphere","Cognition","Evolution","Charles_Darwin","Natural_selection","Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","Ukrainian_Academy_of_Sciences","Kiev","Vernadsky_National_Library_of_Ukraine","Tavrida_University","Crimea","Russian_Civil_War","Eurasianism","Ukrainian_War_of_Independence","Soviet_atomic_bomb_project","Nuclear_power","Uranium","Nuclear_fission","George_Vernadsky","United_States","Moscow","Tavrida_National_University","Crimea","Naukova_dumka","Nauka_(publisher)","Gaia_theory_(science)","Noosphere","Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin","Russian_philosophy","Vernadsky_Research_Base"]}
