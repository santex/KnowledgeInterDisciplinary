In\ncomparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an\ninfection by themselves are around 2 kilobases in size. The human pathogen\nHepatitis D Virus is similar to viroids. Viroids\nare extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleotide (nt) long genome\nand consisting of fewer than 10,000 atoms.\n\nViroids were discovered and named by Theodor Otto Diener, a plant pathologist at\nthe Agricultural Research Service in Maryland, in 1971. -\n[http://www2.oakland.edu/biology/chaudhry/pics/Viroids%5B-\n1%5D.pdf Discovery of Viroids]\n\nViroid RNA does not code for any protein. The replication mechanism\ninvolves RNA polymerase II, an enzyme normally associated with synthesis of\nmessenger RNA from DNA, which instead catalyzes \"rolling circle\" synthesis of\nnew RNA using the viroid's RNA as template. Some viroids are ribozymes, having\ncatalytic properties which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes\nfrom larger replication intermediates.\n\nThe first viroid to be identified was [[Potato spindle tuber viroid]] (PSTVd).\nSome 33 species have been identified.\n","linknr":256,"url":"Viroid","recorded":1362374374,"links":46,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www2.oakland.edu/biology/chaudhry/pics/Viroids%5B1%5D.pdf"],"categories":["Viroids|"],"headings":["Taxonomy","Viroids and RNA silencing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["satellite","biology"]],"members":["satellite"],"related":["Subviral_agent","Plant","Pathogens","Nucleobase","RNA","Kilobase","Hepatitis_D","Theodor_Otto_Diener","Protein","RNA_polymerase_II","Messenger_RNA","Rolling_circle","Ribozymes","Catalytic","Pospiviroidae","Avsunviroidae","Symptom","Protein","RNA_silencing","Genome","Virulence","SiRNA","Base_pairing","Messenger_RNA","SiRNA","Transgenic","Hairpin_RNA","Potato_spindle_tuber_viroid","RNA","Dicer","RNA-induced_silencing_complex","Virus","Virusoid","Virus_classification","Satellite_(biology)","Prion","Microparasite","Plant_pathology"]}
