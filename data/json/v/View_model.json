{"cursor":"36559","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n Matrix of Views and Perspectives.]] A 'view model' or 'viewpoints framework' in\n systems engineering, software engineering, and enterprise engineering is a\n framework which defines a coherent set of views to be used in the construction\n of a system architecture, software architecture, or enterprise architecture. A\n view is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related\n set of concerns. ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011, Systems and\n software engineering â Architecture description ISO/IEC 10746-1,\n Information technology â Open Distributed Processing â Reference model:\n Overview\n\nSince the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts to prescribe\napproaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. These recent\nefforts define a set of views (or viewpoints). They are sometimes referred to as\narchitecture frameworks or enterprise architecture frameworks, but are not\nusually called \"view models\".\n\nUsually a view is a work product that presents specific architecture data for a\ngiven system. However, the same term is sometimes used to refer to a view\ndefinition, including the particular viewpoint and the corresponding guidance\nthat defines each concrete view. The term view model is related to view\ndefinitions.\n","linknr":468,"url":"View_model","recorded":1362476909,"links":38,"instances":["information_science","visual","computing"],"pdf":["http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AMIS-Concepts.pdf","http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf","http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf","http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf","http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf","http://www.cio.gov/Documents/fedarch1.pdf","http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/jitc_dri/pdfs/dodaf_v1v1.pdf","http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/omb/egov/documents/FEA_Practice_Guidance.pdf","http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39798/1/06-1543.pdf"],"categories":["Enterprise
