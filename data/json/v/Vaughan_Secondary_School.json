The main lobby of the school is the atrium of a mall (the building's\noriginal purpose) has four trees and a glass ceiling. Situated on the first\nfloor are the main lobby, the principal stage and the cafeteria. The second\nfloor consist of the library and the radio station.\n\nStarting in 2006, a number of regions previously associated with Vaughan\nSecondary were reassigned to Stephen Lewis Secondary School (aka Block 10).\nStudents entering Grade 9 and 10 in 2006 residing in \"Vaughan Block 10\" were\ntransferred from Vaughan Secondary School to Stephen Lewis Secondary School.\nThis reduced the Vaughan Secondary population drastically from its former\nstudent body of approximately over 2000 in 1999. \n\nOwing to the increased number of students enrolled in French Immersion programs\nin York Region, in 2008 it was proposed that a French Immersion program be\nestablished at Vaughan Secondary. Previously, Langstaff Secondary School is the\nonly high school with a French Immersion program and is accepting graduating\nstudents pursuing a French diploma from both Julliard PS and Louis-Honore\nFrechette PS. However, increased enrollment in French programs has made it\ndifficult for Langstaff SS to accommodate all French Immersion students in York\nRegion. As such, French Immersion grade eight students are now enrolling in the\nVaughan Secondary School French Immersion Secondary Program for the school year\nbeginning September 2009.\n\nVaughan Secondary School offers the Advanced Placement program to its students.\nStarting from Grade 9, students can enroll in pre-AP courses for English, Math\nand Science. High level courses are offered through Grade 12 in Science\n(Chemistry, Biology and Physics), English, History and Math (Advanced functions,\nCalculus and Vectors). Like other AP programs, students who complete the Grade\n12 courses are eligible to write the AP exam.\n\nVaughan also has very strong boys basketball teams. Their senior basketball team\nwon the OFSAA championships in both 2011 and 2012.\n\nAt Vaughan Secondary School, there are a number of extra-curricular Clubs and\nSports, including:\n\n'Sports': Archery, Athletic Association, Badminton, Basketball, Cheer Squad,\nCross Country, Curling, Golf, Skiing/Snowboarding, Outdoor and Indoor Soccer,\nTennis, Track and Field, Ultimate, Vaughan Gamer's Club, Co-Ed Volleyball, and\nWrestling.\n\n'People/Interpersonal clubs': Student activity council, CAYRE, Music Council,\nCharacter Matters, DECA, Debate Team, Drama Club, Earth Charter, Gay/Straight\nAlliance, The Student Newspaper and Stage Crew.\n\n'Academic': Band, Drama Club (R.I.P), Library Reading Club and The Scribbler\n\n'Cultural': Christian Club, Earth Charter, Gay/Straight Alliance, Jewish Club,\nChinese Club, Korean Club\n\n'Musical': Band, GLEE and Guitar Club\n\n'Other': CAYRE, Curling, DECA, Earth Charter, OSAID, The Scribbler, Stage Crew,\nUltimate, Vaughan Gamer's Club and Wrestling, Improv Club\n\n\"Clubs that sponsor other clubs\" Student Academic Club (a.k.a. S.A.C.) and the\nAthletic Association\n\nVaughan Secondary School is also regionally and provincially famous for its\nsuccessful basketball team. A basketball skills related course is offered at the\nhigh school, encouraging students to stay physically active.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Vaughan_Secondary_School","recorded":1364179594,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","#cite_note-1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Vaughan_logo.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Vaughan_logo.PNG/100px-Vaughan_logo.PNG","/wiki/Vaughan","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/York_Region_District_School_Board","/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Education_in_Canada#Levels_in_education","/wiki/Thornhill,_Ontario","http://www.vaughan.ss.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Vaughan,_Ontario","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/York_Region_District_School_Board","/wiki/RAV-FM","/wiki/FM_radio","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Stephen_Lewis_Secondary_School_(Vaughan)","#cite_note-boundaries-2","/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.vaughan.ss.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/","http://www.vaughan.ss.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/","#cite_ref-boundaries_2-0","http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/w/schools/boundary/318boundary.pdf","http://www.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/pdfs/w/schools/boundary/318boundary.pdf","/wiki/Template:Yorkregionsecondaryschools","/wiki/Template_talk:Yorkregionsecondaryschools","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Yorkregionsecondaryschools&action=edit","/wiki/York_Region_District_School_Board","/wiki/Aurora,_Ontario","/wiki/Aurora_High_School_(Aurora,_Ontario)","/wiki/Dr._G.W._Williams_Secondary_School","/wiki/Keswick,_Ontario","/wiki/Keswick_High_School","/wiki/King_City,_Ontario","/wiki/King_City_Secondary_School","/wiki/Maple,_Ontario","/wiki/Maple_High_School","/wiki/Markham,_Ontario","/wiki/Bill_Crothers_Secondary_School","/wiki/Bur_Oak_Secondary_School","/wiki/Markham_District_High_School","/wiki/Markville_Secondary_School","/wiki/Middlefield_Collegiate_Institute","/wiki/Milliken_Mills_High_School","/wiki/Pierre_Elliott_Trudeau_High_School","/wiki/Unionville_High_School_(Ontario)","/wiki/Newmarket,_Ontario","/wiki/Dr._John_M._Denison_Secondary_School","/wiki/Huron_Heights_Secondary_School","/wiki/Newmarket_High_School","/wiki/Sir_William_Mulock_Secondary_School","/wiki/Richmond_Hill,_Ontario","/wiki/Alexander_Mackenzie_High_School","/wiki/Bayview_Secondary_School","/wiki/Langstaff_Secondary_School","/wiki/Richmond_Green_Secondary_School","/wiki/Richmond_Hill_High_School_(Richmond_Hill,_Ontario)","/wiki/Whitchurch%E2%80%93Stouffville","/wiki/Stouffville_District_Secondary_School","/wiki/Sutton,_Ontario","/wiki/Sutton_District_High_School","/wiki/Thornhill,_Ontario","/wiki/Stephen_Lewis_Secondary_School_(Vaughan)","/wiki/Thornhill_Secondary_School","/wiki/Thornlea_Secondary_School","/wiki/Westmount_Collegiate_Institute","/wiki/Woodbridge,_Ontario","/wiki/Emily_Carr_Secondary_School","/wiki/Woodbridge_College","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Vaughan_Secondary_School&params=43_47_53_N_79_28_7_W_","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&oldid=522550549","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:York_Region_District_School_Board","/wiki/Category:High_schools_in_York_Region","/wiki/Category:Education_in_Vaughan","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_October_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vaughan+Secondary+School&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vaughan+Secondary+School","/wiki/Vaughan_Secondary_School","/wiki/Talk:Vaughan_Secondary_School","#","/wiki/Vaughan_Secondary_School","/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_Secondary_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vaughan_S
