      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Vacuum' is space that is empty of matter. The word stems from the Latin\nadjective vacuus for \"vacant\" or \"void\". An approximation to such vacuum is a\nregion with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure.<ref\nname=\"chambers\"></ref> Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would\noccur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or 'free\nspace', and use the term 'partial vacuum' to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum\nas one might have in a laboratory or in space. The Latin term 'in vacuo' is used\nto describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum.\n\nThe quality of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect\nvacuum. Other things equal, lower gas pressure means higher-quality vacuum. For\nexample, a typical vacuum cleaner produces enough suction to reduce air pressure\nby around 20%.<ref> Note that 1 inch of water is ≈0.0025 atm.</ref> Much higher-\nquality vacuums are possible. Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry,\nphysics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10<sup>−12</sup>) of\natmospheric pressure (100&nbsp;nPa), and can reach around 100\nparticles/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name=Gabrielse/> Outer space is an even higher-\nquality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter\non average.<ref name=tadokoro>{{cite journal\n | last=Tadokoro | first=M. | title=A Study of the Local Group by Use of the\n | Virial Theorem journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan\n | volume=20 | page=230 | year=1968 bibcode=1968PASJ...20..230T }} This source\n | estimates a density of for the Local Group. An atomic mass unit is , for\n | roughly 40 atoms per cubic meter.</ref> Some theories predict that even if\n | all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be \"empty\" due\n | to vacuum fluctuations, dark energy, and other phenomena in quantum physics.\n | In modern particle physics, the vacuum state is considered as the ground\n | state of matter.\n\nVacuum has been a frequent topic of philosophical debate since ancient Greek\ntimes, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. Evangelista\nTorricelli produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental\ntechniques were developed as a result of his theories of atmospheric pressure. A\n'torricellian vacuum' is created by filling with mercury a tall glass container\nclosed at one end and then inverting the container into a bowl to contain the\nmercury.<ref>How to Make an Experimental Geissler Tube, Popular Science monthly,\nFebruary 1919, Unnumbered page, Scanned by Google Books:\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3</ref>\n\nVacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the\nintroduction of incandescent light bulbs and vacuum tubes, and a wide array of\nvacuum technology has since become available. The recent development of human\nspaceflight has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on\nlife forms in general. ]]\n",
