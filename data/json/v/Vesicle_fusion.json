{"cursor":"8525","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Vesicle fusion' is the merging of a vesicle with other vesicles or a part of a\ncell membrane. In the latter case, it is the end stage of secretion from\nsecretory vesicles, where their contents are expelled from the cell through\nexocytosis. Vesicles can also fuse with other target cell compartments, such as\na lysosome.\n\nVesicle fusion may depend on SNARE proteins in the presence of increased\nintracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) concentration.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Vesicle_fusion","recorded":1362486565,"links":13,"instances":["protein","biology"],"pdf":["http://pdbio.byu.edu/Faculty/djw82/Woodbury%20Rognlien%202000%20CBI%20color.pdf","http://pdbio.byu.edu/Faculty/djw82/Woodbury%20Rognlien%202000%20CBI%20color.pdf"],"categories":["Biochemistry"],"headings":["Triggers","Model systems","Mechanisms","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Exocytosis-machinery.jpg/360px-Exocytosis-machinery.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vesicle","biology"],["snare","protein"],["snare","protein"]],"members":["snare","vesicle"],"related":["Vesicle_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Secretion","Exocytosis","Lysosome","SNARE_(protein)","Calcium","Synaptic_vesicle","Nerve_impulse","Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","Endocrine_system","Releasing_hormone","G_protein_coupled_receptors","Gq_alpha_subunit","IP3/DAG_pathway","Gonadotropin_releasing_hormone","Thyrotropin_releasing_hormone","Growth_hormone_releasing_hormone","CAMP_dependent_pathway","Phospholipid","Mitochondrion","Phase_changes","Synaptic_vesicle","Action_potential","Synaptotagmin","Synaptotagmin","\"zipper\"_hypothesis","Syntaxin","Synaptotagmin","Synaptic_vesicle","Presynaptic_membrane","Synaptic_cleft","Endocytosis","Clathrin-mediated_endocytosis","Endosome","SNARE_(protein)","Active_zone","Membrane_fusion"]}
