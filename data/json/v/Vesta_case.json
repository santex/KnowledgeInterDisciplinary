{"cursor":"3674","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Vesta cases', 'vesta boxes', or 'pocket match safes' or 'matchsafes' were small\nportable boxes made in a great variety of forms with snapshut covers to contain\nvestas (short matches) and keep them dry.\n\nSo called after the name of one of the early makers (which was taken from the\ngoddess Vesta, a Roman deity of fire and the hearth), they came into use around\nthe 1830s and were produced extensively between 1890 and 1920. During this\nperiod, almost everyone carried strike anywhere matches, so they could light\nstoves, lanterns and other devices. Early matches were unreliable and prone to\nignite from rubbing on one another or spontaneously. Accordingly, most people\ncarried a match safe to house their matches. Wealthy people had match safes made\nof gold or silver, while common folk had ones made of tin or brass.\n\nSignificant American manufacturers of match safes include Wm. B. Kerr, Gorham,\nUnger Brothers, Battin, Blackington, Whiting, George Scheibler and Shreve & Co.\n\nThe different patterns and types must run into many thousands. As well as plain\nand decorated square, oblong and round cases, a myriad of novelty shapes have\nbeen recorded; silver, brass or white metal pigs with hinged heads were popular,\nas were vesta cases in the form of Mr Punch, skulls, musical instruments, boots\nand shoes, bottles, ladies' legs and so on.\n\nThey were also made in every conceivable material, including pressed brass,\npressed tin, gunmetal, nickel silver, gold, ivory, wood of varying types, early\nplastics like tortoiseshell and bakelite, and ceramics. The more unusual\nmaterials included leather and the seed from the Australian supplejack tree.\nAlthough the majority were made of inexpensive materials, some were made of\nprecious metals or enameled. These precious metal cases typically had a gold\nwash interior to prevent corrosion by the chemically active match heads.\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of match safes is that they have a ribbed\nsurface, usually on the bottom, for lighting the matches. Some match safes\nincorporated a cigar cutter or a small knife blade as well. Often made to be\ncarried in the pocket, some were small enough to be suspended from a fob chain\nor an [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Albert_chain Albert chain]. Others were\nmade to be left in a handy position in the home, such as the kitchen or close to\na fireplace. These were usually larger than the pocket vestas, and were\nsometimes referred to as standing or table vestas. Pocket vestas and sovereign\ncases were sometimes combined into the one item.\n\nPromotional vestas were sometimes produced by different companies, e.g.\nchampagne producers. The Gillette company produced a brass razor blade case with\na ribbed bottom that could be used as a vesta case after the razor blades had\nbeen used.\n\nOccasionally a vesta case was made to double as a go-to-bed matchbox.\n\nVesta cases are still to be found in a vast array of shapes, sizes and\nmaterials, and many are extremely attractive.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Vesta_case","recorded":1374965420,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Boxes","/w/index.php?title=Snapshut&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Matches","/wiki/Vestal_Virgin","/w/index.php?title=Strike_anywhere_matches&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Stove","/wiki/Lantern","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Silver","/wiki/Tin","/wiki/Brass","/w/index.php?title=Wm._B._Kerr&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gorham","/w/index.php?title=Unger_Brothers&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Battin&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Blackington&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Whiting","/w/index.php?title=George_Scheibler&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Shreve_%26_Co.","/wiki/Punch_and_Judy","/wiki/Gunmetal","/wiki/Nickel_silver","/wiki/Wood","/wiki/Tortoiseshell_material","/wiki/Bakelite","/wiki/Supplejack_tree","/wiki/Metal","/wiki/Vitreous_enamel","http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Albert_chain","/wiki/Go-to-bed_matchbox","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=edit&section=1","http://www.matchsafe.org/","http://www.matchcovers.com/match_safes.htm","http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/types/35287419/","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Signorina_in_viola.svg/19px-Signorina_in_viola.svg.png","/wiki/Fashion","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Fashion-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Fashion-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Fashion-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&oldid=552376561","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Antiques","/wiki/Category:Matches_(firelighting)","/wiki/Category:Fashion_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vesta+case&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vesta+case","/wiki/Vesta_case","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vesta_case&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Vesta_case","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Vesta_case","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Vesta_case","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&oldid=552376561","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7923379","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Vesta_case&id=552376561","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Vesta+case","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Vesta+case&oldid=552376561&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Vesta_case&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7923379#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_case","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antiques","Matches
