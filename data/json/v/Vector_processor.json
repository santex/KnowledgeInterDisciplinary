{"cursor":"16809","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'vector processor', or 'array processor', is a central processing unit (CPU)\nthat implements an instruction set containing instructions that operate on one-\ndimensional arrays of data called vectors. This is in contrast to a scalar\nprocessor, whose instructions operate on single data items. Vector processors\ncan greatly improve performance on certain workloads, notably numerical\nsimulation and similar tasks. Vector machines appeared in the early 1970s and\ndominated supercomputer design through the 1970s into the 90s, notably the\nvarious Cray platforms. The rapid rise in the price-to-performance ratio of\nconventional microprocessor designs led to the vector supercomputer's demise in\nthe later 1990s.\n\nToday, most commodity CPUs implement architectures that feature instructions for\na form vector processing on multiple (vectorized) data sets, typically known as\nSIMD ('S'ingle 'I'nstruction, 'M'ultiple 'D'ata). Common examples include VIS,\nMMX, SSE, AltiVec and AVX. Vector processing techniques are also found in video\ngame console hardware and graphics accelerators. In 2000, IBM, Toshiba and Sony\ncollaborated to create the Cell processor, consisting of one scalar processor\nand eight vector processors, which found use in the Sony PlayStation 3 among\nother applications.\n\nOther CPU designs may include some multiple instructions for vector processing\non multiple (vectorised) data sets, typically known as MIMD ('M'ultiple\n'I'nstruction, 'M'ultiple 'D'ata) and realized with VLIW. Such designs are\nusually dedicated to a particular application and not commonly marketed for\ngeneral purpose computing. In the Fujitsu FR-V VLIW/vector processor both\ntechnologies are combined.\n","linknr":411,"url":"Vector_processor","recorded":1362540260,"links":36,"instances":["computing","parallel_computing","instruction_set","computer_science","microprocessor","vector_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parallel computing","Central processing unit"],"headings":["History","Description","Real world example: vector instructions usage with the x86 architecture","Programming Heterogeneous Computing Architectures","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Cray_J90_CPU_module.jpg/220px-Cray_J90_CPU_module.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg/200px-AmdahlsLaw.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["instruction","computer_science"],["mmx","instruction_set"],["cell","microprocessor"],["scalar","computing"],["vectorization","parallel_computing"],["chaining","vector_processing"]],"members":["scalar","vectorization","mmx","instruction","cell","chaining"],"related":["Central_processing_unit","Instruction_set","Instruction_(computer_science)","Array_data_structure","Scalar_processor","Supercomputer","Cray","Price-to-performance_ratio","Microprocessor","SIMD","Visual_Instruction_Set","MMX_(instruction_set)","Streaming_SIMD_Extensions","AltiVec","Advanced_Vector_Extensions","Video_game_console","Graphics_accelerator","IBM","Toshiba","Sony","Cell_(microprocessor)","PlayStation_3","MIMD","VLIW","Fujitsu","FR-V","Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation","Coprocessor","Central_processing_unit","Arithmetic_logic_unit","Algorithm","Data_set","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","ILLIAC_IV","GFLOPS","Computational_fluid_dynamics","Massively_parallel","Computer_for_operations_with_functions","Control_Data_Corporation","CDC_STAR-100","Texas_Instruments","Advanced_Scientific_Computer","CDC_7600","Cray-1","Control_Data_Corporation","ETA-10","Fujitsu","Hitachi,_Ltd.","Nippon_Electric_Corporation","Oregon","Floating_Point_Systems","Minicomputer","Minisupercomputer","Cray-2","Cray_X-MP","Cray_Y-MP","Massively_parallel","IBM_ViVA","CPU","SIMD","Scalar_(computing)","CPU","Instruction_pipelining","Assembly_line","Address_decoder","Functional_unit","Supercomputer","X86","Streaming_SIMD_Extensions","Floating_point","GNU_Compiler_Collection","Fujitsu","Heterogeneous_computing","Stream_processing","SIMD","Vectorization_(parallel_computing)","Chaining_(vector_processing)","Computer_for_operations_with_functions"]}
