The human\n voice is specifically that part of human sound production in which the vocal\n folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. Generally speaking, the\n mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts;\n the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx, and the articulators. The lung\n (the pump) must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal\n folds (this air pressure is the fuel of the voice). The vocal folds (vocal\n cords) are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs into\n audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source. The muscles of the larynx\n adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to ‘fine tune’ pitch and tone.\n The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of\n tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating\n from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to\n strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.\n\nThe vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing\nhighly intricate arrays of sound.<ref>Stevens, K.N.(2000), Acoustic Phonetics,\nMIT Press, ISBN 0-262-69250-3, 978-0-262-69250-2 </ref><ref>Titze, I.R.
