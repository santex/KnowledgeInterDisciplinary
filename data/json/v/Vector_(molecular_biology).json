{"cursor":"10837","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular cloning, a 'vector' is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to\nartificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be\nreplicated and/or expressed. A vector containing foreign DNA is termed\nrecombinant DNA. The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors,\ncosmids, and artificial chromosomes. Common to all engineered vectors are an\norigin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker.\n\nThe vector itself is generally a DNA sequence that consists of an insert\n(transgene) and a larger sequence that serves as the \"backbone\" of the vector.\nThe purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is\ntypically to isolate, multiply, or express the insert in the target cell.\nVectors called expression vectors (expression constructs) specifically are for\nthe expression of the transgene in the target cell, and generally have a\npromoter sequence that drives expression of the transgene. Simpler vectors\ncalled transcription vectors are only capable of being transcribed but not\ntranslated: they can be replicated in a target cell but not expressed, unlike\nexpression vectors. Transcription vectors are used to amplify their insert.\n\nInsertion of a vector into the target cell is usually called transformation for\nbacterial cells, transfection for eukaryotic cells, although insertion of a\nviral vector is often called transduction.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Vector_(molecular_biology)","recorded":1362480574,"links":24,"instances":["molecular_biology","genetics","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","biology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Gene delivery"],"headings":["Characteristics","Transcription","Expression","Features","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["insert","molecular_biology"],["promotor","biology"],["transformation","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"]],"members":["insert","transcription","transformation","promotor","promoter","transduction","translation","vector"],"related":["Molecular_cloning","DNA_replication","Gene_expression","Recombinant_DNA","Plasmid","Viral_vectors","Cosmid","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Origin_of_replication","Multiple_cloning_site","Selectable_marker","DNA","Insert_(molecular_biology)","Transgene","Expression_vector","Promotor_(biology)","Transformation_(genetics)","Transfection","Eukaryotic_cells","Transduction_(genetics)","Plasmid","Viral_vector","Plasmid","Origin_of_replication","Restriction_enzyme","Polyadenylation","Viral_vectors","Genetic_marker","Retrovirus","Retroviral_integration","Transcription_(genetics)","Murine_mammary_tumor_virus","Dexamethasone","Expression_vector","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Ribosomal_binding_site","Lac_operon","T7_phage","Shine-Dalgarno_sequence","Polyadenylation","Exonuclease","Non-coding_RNA","Kozak_consensus_sequence","Ribosome","Origin_of_replication","Promoter_(biology)","Cloning_vectors","Multiple_cloning_site","Genetic_marker","Antibiotic","Open_reading_frame","Epitope","Reporter_gene","Î’-galactosidase","Galactose","Blue_white_screen","Structural_analog","X-gal","Reporter_gene","Green_fluorescent_protein","Luciferase","Periplasmic_space","Protein_tag","Polyhistidine-tag","Glutathione-S-transferase","Maltose_binding_protein","Plasmid","Viral_vector","Cloning_vector","Expression_vector","Minicircle","Recombinant_DNA","Naked_DNA","Vector_(epidemiology)"]}
