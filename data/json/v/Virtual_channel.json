{"cursor":"20573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn most telecommunications organizations, a 'logical channel number' (LCN) [as\nused by private European DVB extensions such as NorDig or NDS] also known as a\n'virtual channel' [as used in ATSC SI metadata], for ATSC is a channel\ndesignation which differs from that of the actual radio channel (or range of\nfrequencies) on which the signal travels. In the case of Pay TV and other\nchannel bundling systems they are merely a method of channel reassignment\nand/or rearrangement that suits whatever purpose the service operator has for\ntheir viewers.\n\nThe term is most often applied to free-to-air North American television, where\ndigital television (DTV) channels may operate on different physical channels\nfrom the displayed channels. A station branded as Channel 8, for example, might\nactually use channel 32 for its ATSC, DVB or ISDB transmission, but a 'virtual\nchannel map' or 'virtual channel table' (VCT) allows viewers to tune in the\nstation on channel 8, displayed as 8.1 on a digital set. DTV tuners have a menu\nitem that scans all channels for this information and stores it in memory for\ninstant access later on.\n\nThe most common reason for a television station using a virtual channel is to\nminimize viewer confusion when a digital transmission is airing on a different\nchannel from the one the station used in analog mode. The virtual channel thus\nenables viewers to tune in the station by choosing the same channel number as\nthey would have previously. In the case of pay TV and joint broadcaster\nservices such as Freeview the channel number is also a way of locking in the\nordering of channels to an order that suits the provider rather than to what\nthe viewer may prefer.\n\nAn official LCN option has never been added to DVB SI metadata due to the fact\nthat the Program number and Transport Stream ID which are already defined within\nH.222 Program Association and Mapping tables are more than sufficient to be used\nin channel numbering. Further one can hide channels not meant for direct viewing\nsimply by omitting the reference from the Transport's Program Association table,\nthis practice is referred as a hidden service. One can also make the argument\nthan the LCN does nothing more than promote the practice of locking down a\nviewer's channel order to one chosen by either a broadcaster or network\noperator, which is what Pay TV operators and channel bundling systems such as\nFreeview currently do.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Virtual_channel","recorded":1362676071,"links":24,"instances":["tv_station","radio","communications","telecommunication","australia","electronics","new_zealand","new_south_wales"],"pdf":["http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a_65-2009.pdf","http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a_65-2009.pdf","http://www.freetv.com.au/SiteMedia/w3svc087/Uploads/Documents/18efb4b4-cd30-4da4-a3ae-5fb4f4b64884.pdf","http://www.arib.or.jp/english/html/overview/doc/8-TR-B14v2_8-3p3-E2.pdf","http://www.freeviewnz.tv/media/3500/freeview_service_provider_code_of_practice_september11.pdf"],"categories":["ATSC","Digital television","Television technology","Broadcast engineering","Television terminology"],"headings":["Digital TV subchannels","Digital radio","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["channel","communications"],["signalling","telecommunication"],["transmission","radio"],["tuner","electronics"],["freeview","uk"],["channel_1","ntsc-m"],["central_coast","new_south_wales"],["wow","tv_station"],["channel_31","australia"],["freeview","uk"],["freeview","new_zealand"]],"members":["wow","transmission","channel","signalling","channel_31","tuner","freeview","central_coast","channel_1"],"related":["Telecommunications","Channel_(communications)","Radio","Frequency","Signalling_(telecommunication)","Digital_television","ATSC_Standards","Digital_Video_Broadcasting","ISDB","Transmission_(radio)","Tuner_(electronics)","Freeview_(UK)","H.222","Multiplexing","FM_broadcasting","LED","Set-top_box","WNYZ-LP","United_States","Channel_1_(NTSC-M)","Channel_37","Australia","Free_TV_Australia","Digital_Video_Broadcasting","Nine_Network","Network_Ten","One_HD","ABC_Television","ABC1","WIN_Television","NBN_Television","Gold_Coast,_Queensland","Sunshine_Coast,_Queensland","Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales)","Special_Broadcasting_Service","Imparja_Television","QQQ","Golden_West_Network","WOW_(TV_station)","Digital_Forty_Four","Channel_31_(Australia)","West_TV","Foxtel","Austar","Optus_Television","ITV","ITV2","Freeview_(UK)","Direct_broadcast_satellite","Dish_Network","DirecTV","SES_Astra","Digital_cable","Satellite_radio","Kanto_region","NHK_Educational_TV","ISDB-T","Standard_definition","Freeview_(New_Zealand)","Kordia","TVNZ","SKY_Network_Television","First_TV","ISDB","DZCE-TV","ISDB","People's_Television_Network","High-definition_television","Digital_radio","Digital_audio_broadcasting","HD_Radio","In-band_on-channel","Digital_Radio_Mondiale"]}
