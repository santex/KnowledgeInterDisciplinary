The main\nfunction of the PNS is to connect the central nervous system (CNS) to the limbs\nand organs. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the bone of spine and\nskull, or by the bloodâbrain barrier, leaving it exposed to toxins and\nmechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic\nnervous system and the autonomic nervous system; some textbooks also include\nsensory systems. It is also a part of the nervous system. {{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors = Jean Hopkins, Charles\n  | William McLaughlin, Susan Johnson, Maryanna Quon Warner, David LaHart, Jill\n  | D.

Cranial nerve ganglia originate in the CNS.\nHowever, the remaining eleven cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and\nare therefore considered part of the PNS.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Peripheral_nervous_system","recorded":1362482108,"links":64,"instances":["anatomy","nerves","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nervous system","Peripheral nervous system|"],"headings":["Specific nerves and plexi","Neurotransmitters","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Nervous_system_diagram.png/250px-Nervous_system_diagram.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["head","anatomy"],["diaphragm","anatomy"],["pudendal_plexus","nerves"]],"members":["head","pudendal_plexus","diaphragm"],"related":["Ganglia","Brain","Spinal_cord","Central_nervous_system","Bone","Blood–brain_barrier","Toxin","Somatic_nervous_system","Autonomic_nervous_system","Sensory_system","Nervous_system","Cranial_nerve","Axons","Cranial_nerves","Brainstem","Sternocleidomastoid_muscle","Trapezius_muscle","Spinal_nerve","Spinal_cord","Suboccipital_nerve","Human_skull","Greater_occipital_nerve","Head_(anatomy)","Lesser_occipital_nerve","Ear","Greater_auricular_nerve","Lesser_auricular_nerve","Occipital_neuralgia","Phrenic_nerve","Diaphragm_(anatomy)","Breathing","Myelopathy","Brachial_plexus","Brachial_plexus_injuries","Anterior","Lumbar_nerves","Sacral_nerves","Coccygeal_nerve","Lumbosacral_plexus","Lumbar_plexus","Sacral_plexus","Pudendal_plexus_(nerves)","Neurotransmitters","Acetylcholine","Noradrenaline","Non-noradrenergic,_non-cholinergic_transmitter","Peptides","Adenosine_triphosphate","Gamma_aminobutyric_acid","Dopamine","Nitric_oxide","Neuropeptide_Y","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","Gonadotropin_releasing_hormone","Substance_P","Calcitonin_gene_related_peptide","Spinal_nerves","Cranial_nerves","Autonomic_nervous_system","Connective_tissue_in_the_peripheral_nervous_system"]}
