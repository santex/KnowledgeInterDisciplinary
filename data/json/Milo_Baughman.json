{"cursor":"9827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Milo Ray Baughman, Jr.', was one of the leading modern furniture designers of\nthe second-half of the 20th century. His uniquely American designs were forward-\nthinking and distinctive, yet unpretentious and affordable. His prolific and\nhighly influential work continues to be copied, reinvented and revived in the\nnew and secondary decorative arts markets by contemporary furniture designers\nand dealers alike. Baughman designed for a number of furniture companies\nstarting in the mid-1940s until his death, including Mode Furniture, Glenn of\nCalifornia, The Inco Company, Pacific Iron, Murray Furniture of Winchendon, Arch\nGordon, Design Institute America, George Kovacs, Directional, Henredon and\nDrexel, among others. He is most famous, however, for his longtime association\nwith Thayer Coggin Inc., of High Point, NC, which began in 1953, and lasted\nuntil his death in 2003. He also lectured broadly on the state of modern design,\nextolling the positive benefits of good design on the lives of human beings, and\nhelping to define and shape the discussion for years to come.\n\nBorn in Goodland, Kansas on October 7, 1923, Baughman moved with his family\nin his infancy to Long Beach, California. At the age of thirteen, his family\nbuilt their house and young Milo was handed the task of designing both the\ninterior and exterior. Following high school he served for four years in the\nArmy Air Forces during World War II, during which time he was active in\ndesigning officer's clubs. After the war he returned to Southern California\nto study product and architectural design at the Art Center School of Los\nAngeles and at Chouinard Art Institute, which later became the California\nInstitute of the Arts.\n\n Upon completing his studies, he was hired to\nwork at the Frank Brothers furniture store as an interior and custom furniture\ndesigner. The store had the distinction of being the first west coast all-modern\nspecialty store, and proved to be a good launch pad for his career. While there\nhe established \"Furniture Forum\" with Georgia Christensen, an important early\npublication on modern design complete with photos, dimensions, pricing, as well\nas designer photos and biographies. He left Frank Brothers in 1947 to establish\n\"Milo Baughman Design Inc.,\" and quickly did commissions for Glenn of California\nand Pacific Iron, helping to place these companies at the forefront of a new\nCalifornia modernist design movement. The \"California Modern\" collection created\nfor Glenn of California in 1948, along with Greta Magnusson-Grossman, using\nmainly walnut, iron and formica, and put forth a distinctive Los Angeles style.\n\nNext, the large furniture manufacturer Drexel invited him to their North\nCarolina headquarters to create a major collection. Following this, Murray\nFurniture of Winchendon Massachusetts introduced \"The Milo Baughman Collection\"\nin 1952. An earlier desk design from 1948 for Winchendon was later included in\nthe Whitney Museum exhibition \"High Styles: Twentieth Century American Design,\"\nin 1985. During this time, Milo found time to run his own custom design shop\nwith Olga Lee (his wife at the time) in Los Angeles from 1951-1953. Lee\ncontributed hand printed fabrics, wallpaper, lamps and accessories to go\nalongside Baughman's furniture designs; both offered their services as interior\nconsultants. The Baughman-Lee showroom was located at 744 1/2 North La Cienega\nBlvd., Los Angeles. [http://mid-centuryonline.com/blog/milo-\nbaughman/ Mid-Century Online Magazine, Milo Baughman, May 15, 2012]\n\n      \n\nIn 1953, his 50 year association with Thayer Coggin Inc. began. \"In a way,\nThayer and Milo got their start together,\" according to Dot Coggin, Thayerâs\nwife and spokeswoman for the 59 year old, furniture business success story.\n\"Milo came here when the company was in its organisational stage. Thayer was\nlooking for a designer and their relationship began with a handshake\nagreement.\" By the 1960s and 1970s, his new collection\nwas eagerly awaited at the High Point Market every year. Some of his most famous\nand iconic designs come from this period, including the \"951-103\" chair, c.\n1962, \"820-400\" chaise (1954), \"989-103\" Lounge Chair, and \"955-304\" Sofa. He\nwas highly regarded among his peers, and his quick wit and clear reflection were\nalways in demand as he spoke about modern design.\n\nIn 1965, Baughman converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n(LDS Church), and was active and passionate about his newfound Christian faith\nuntil his death. In 1969, he was invited by Brigham Young University in Provo,\nUtah to establish the Department of Environmental Design, where he continued as\nchairman and adjunct professor for six years while he continued his professional\ndesign business. He then moved to Virginia for twelve years, and then back to\nUtah, where he was a senior lecturer at BYU for another nine years. Baughman has\nalso lectured at Rhode Island School of Design, the University of Tennessee, the\nUniversity of WisconsinâMadison and North Carolina State, among others. He\nremained in Utah where he maintained a professional design studio until his\ndeath on July 23, 2003.\n\nIn addition to the \"High Styles\" show at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York,\nBaughman's furniture has been exhibited in museums and shows throughout the\nUnited States, including the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-\nSalem, NC; the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh. Milo Baughman was\ninducted into the Furniture Designer's Hall of Fame in 1987.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Milo_Baughman","recorded":1375075424,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Modern_furniture","/wiki/Decorative_arts","/wiki/Furniture_designer","/wiki/High_Point,_NC","/wiki/Goodland,_Kansas","/wiki/Long_Beach,_California","/wiki/Army_Air_Forces","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Southern_California","/wiki/Architectural_design","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Chouinard_Art_Institute","/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts","/wiki/Greta_Magnusson-Grossman","/wiki/Walnut","/wiki/Iron","/wiki/Formica","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/Massachusetts","/wiki/Whitney_Museum","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Fabric","/wiki/Wallpaper","/wiki/Lamp_(fixture)","/wiki/Fashion_accessory","#cite_note-Mid-Century-1","#cite_note-Mid-Century-1","/wiki/High_Point_Market","/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","/wiki/Brigham_Young_University","/wiki/Provo,_Utah","/wiki/Virginia","/wiki/Utah","/wiki/Rhode_Island_School_of_Design","/wiki/University_of_Tennessee","/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison","/wiki/North_Carolina_State","/wiki/Design_studio","/wiki/Whitney_Museum_of_Art","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Southeastern_Center_for_Contemporary_Art","/wiki/Winston-Salem,_NC","/wiki/North_Carolina_Museum_of_Art","/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Mid-Century_1-0","#cite_ref-Mid-Century_1-1","http://mid-centuryonline.com/blog/milo-baughman/","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit&section=3","http://www.thayercoggin.com/index.html","http://www.architonic.com/mus/8101257/1","http://www.artnet.com/ag/fulltextsearch.asp?searchstring=milo+baughman","http://www.r20thcentury.com/bios/designer.cfm?article_id=114","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=636","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=568","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=550","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=455","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=612","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=554","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=456","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=546","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=589","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=508","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=267","http://www.nohomodern.com/details.php?id=264","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/96519770","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&oldid=558078287","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_furniture_designers","/wiki/Category:Brigham_Young_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:Chouinard_Art_Institute_alumni","/wiki/Category:Artists_from_Utah","/wiki/Category:American_Latter_Day_Saints","/wiki/Category:Converts_to_Mormonism","/wiki/Category:1923_births","/wiki/Category:2003_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Milo+Baughman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Milo+Baughman","/wiki/Milo_Baughman","/wiki/Talk:Milo_Baughman","#","/wiki/Milo_Baughman","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Milo_Baughman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Ra
