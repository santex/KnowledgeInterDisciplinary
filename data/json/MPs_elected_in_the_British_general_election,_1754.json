The candidates returned in contested\nelections are listed in the descending order of the number of votes received.\nWhere vote totals are unknown, the MPs received the same number of votes or were\nreturned unopposed the order is that given by Namier and Brook.\n\nThe Tory versus Whig party division, which had originated in the Exclusion Bill\ndebates in the seventeenth century, was almost extinct by 1754. Whilst some\nmembers were still identifiable as being of a Tory or Whig persuasion, few\ncontested elections turned on party cries. The hotly contested Oxfordshire and\nReading elections were amongst the few where party in the old sense mattered at\nall and 1754 was the last such election in those areas. Identification by party\nin the list below is therefore of limited significance, particularly as to the\nfuture loyalties of the politician concerned.\n\nFor what it is worth the government electoral manager, Viscount Dupplin,\nreported to the Whig Prime Minister (Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of\nNewcastle) that the outcome of the election was Administration 368, Tory 106,\nOpposition Whig 42 and doubtful 26.\n\nPeers of Ireland are differentiated from the holders of courtesy titles by\nincluding the succession number to the peerage, i.e. The 1st Earl of Upper\nOssory is an Irish peer and Viscount Dupplin is the holder of a courtesy title.\n\n\n__NOTOC__ {| border=\"0\" id=\"toc\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" align=center\n| 'Table of contents:'\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U
