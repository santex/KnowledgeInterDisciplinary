Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on\nprevious observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available\nscientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often\nused synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific\ntheory]]. A scientific hypothesis is a proposed explanation of a phenomenon\nwhich still has to be rigorously tested. In contrast, a scientific theory has\nundergone extensive testing and is generally accepted to be the accurate\nexplanation behind an observation.<ref></ref> A 'working hypothesis' is a\nprovisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.<ref\nname=\"HilbornMangel1997\"/>\n\nA different meaning of the term hypothesis is used in formal logic, to denote\nthe antecedent of a proposition; thus in the proposition \"If P, then Qs (or\nantecedent);Qcan be called a [[consequent]].Pis the\n[[:wikt:assumption|assumption]] in a (possibly [[Counterfactual\nconditional|counterfactual]])'' question.\n\nThe adjective hypothetical, meaning \"having the nature of a hypothesis\", or\n\"being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis\", can refer\nto any of these meanings of the term \"hypothesis\".\n","title":"Hypothesis","headings":["Uses","Scientific hypothesis","Working hypothesis","Hypotheses, concepts and measurement","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["5: Conceptual_framework","3: Scientific_method","2: Theory","2: Proposition","2: Confirmation_holism","2: Thought_experiment","2: Working_hypothesis","2: Patricia_M._Shields","1: Orbit","1: Explanation","1: Phenomenon","1: Testable","1: Observation","1: Research","1: Formal_logic","1: Theatre_of_ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Plato","1: Socrates","1: Virtue","1: Wilbur_Knorr","1: Gregory_Vlastos","1: Calculation","1: Morris_Raphael_Cohen","1: Ernest_Nagel","1: Robert_Bellarmine","1: Galileo_Galilei","1: Mathematical_model","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: Constant_of_motion","1: Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot","1: James_Prescott_Joule","1: Emmy_Noether","1: Existential_quantification","1: Universal_quantification","1: Prediction","1: Reasoning","1: Deductive_reasoning","1: Experiment","1: Laboratory","1: Nature","1: Karl_Popper","1: Falsificationism","1: Verificationism","1: Crucial_experiment","1: Experience","1: Hans_Christian_Ørsted","1: Richard_Feynman","1: Testability","1: Falsifiability","1: Parsimony","1: Occam's_razor","1: Entity","1: The_Century_Company","1: Exploratory_research","1: Journal_of_Public_Affairs_Education","1: Imre_Lakatos","1: Paul_Feyerabend","1: Concept","1: D-N","1: Carl_Gustav_Hempel","1: Correlation","1: Statistical_test","1: Null_hypothesis","1: Alternative_hypothesis","1: Gideon_J._Mellenbergh","1: Sample_size","1: Axiom","1: Case_study","1: Conjecture","1: Explanandum","1: Hypothesis_theory","1: Cognitive_psychology","1: Logic","1: Logical_positivism","1: Operationalization","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Reductionism","1: Research_design","1: Scientific_theory","1: Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge","1: Theorem"]}
