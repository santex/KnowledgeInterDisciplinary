{"cursor":"3342","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Forced retention' refers to the act of applying pressure to employees to deter\nthem from leaving a company. The most common way to do this is through legal\nmeans, such as non-compete and non-disclosure agreements. Given an adequately\nbroad agreement, a company may threaten employees who try to leave for\ncompetitors (or in some cases, non-competitors) with legal action. In some\ncountries, the government may implement similar laws or policies to prevent or\ndiscourage employees from leaving certain companies or government organizations.\nIt has also been applied to companies which offers significant financial\nbenefits to employees to encourage them to stay, in particular after a merger\n(for example, a minimum period to qualify for stock options), but this usage is\ncommonly considered incorrect.\n\nForced retention is most commonly used by companies on the decline, or at least\nwith limited growth prospects. Top employees will often join a small or mid-size\ncompany, with significant growth potentials. They will also often join\nfinancially stable companies, which can afford to provide employees with very\ngood remuneration packages, and large amounts of freedom (for instance, in pure\nR & D departments). Once the company begins to decline, many of the top\nemployees will want to leave for greener pastures, while the poor-performing\nemployees (who may have a difficult time finding employment) will cling to their\njobs, radically speeding the decline. Companies will occasionally implement\nforced retention policies to try to stem the brain drain.\n\nA recent example of forced retention involves Microsoft Corporation, when its\nstock price levelled off, limiting the value of its stock options and stock\ngrants. Microsoft began scaling back on its employee benefits, resulting in a\nnumber of key Microsoft employees, leaving for Google, Yahoo!, and a number of\nstartups. Eventually, Microsoft began to threaten, and in some cases, filed\nlawsuits against departing employees. While the actual number of lawsuits filed\nwas fairly small, they were chosen to serve as examples. Due to Microsoft's\nbroad scope (virtually all technology companies compete with Microsoft in one\nform or another), Microsoft was able to threaten lawsuits even for departing\nemployees whose new jobs did not substantially overlap with their work at\nMicrosoft. This had a chilling effect on the culture of the remaining employees,\nwho were uncertain if similar lawsuits would be filed against them, if they\nleave. The most publicized example was the case of former vice-president Kai-Fu\nLee, who left Microsoft for Google. As Microsoft had, at this point, been\nengaging in forced retention policies for some time, Kai-Fu Lee negotiated to\nhave Google cover all legal costs, should Microsoft file a lawsuit to prevent\nhis defection.\n\nAnother example involves the US military in Iraq. After invading Afghanistan and\nIraq, U.S. military resources were stretched. As a result, the military\nimplemented a stop-loss policy, under which it could unilaterally extend a\nsoldier's contract.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Forced_retention","recorded":1363409551,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Employment","/wiki/Non_complete_clause","/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement","/wiki/Merger","/wiki/Stock_options","/wiki/R%26D","/wiki/Brain_drain","/wiki/Microsoft_Corporation","/wiki/Bid_price","/wiki/Employee_benefits","/wiki/Google","/wiki/Yahoo!","/wiki/Chilling_effect_(term)","/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee","/wiki/US_military","/wiki/Iraq","/wiki/Afghanistan","/wiki/Stop-loss_policy","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Employee_retention","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&oldid=520157614","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Employment","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Forced+retention&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Forced+retention","/wiki/Forced_retention","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Forced_retention&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Forced_retention","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Forced_retention","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Forced_retention","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&oldid=520157614","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Forced_retention&id=520157614","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Forced+retention","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Forced+retention&oldid=520157614&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Forced_retention&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_retention","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["term"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Employment"],"headings":["See
