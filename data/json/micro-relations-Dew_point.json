Condensed water is called dew\nwhen it forms on a solid surface.\n\nThe dew point is a water-to-air saturation temperature. The dew point is\nassociated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the\ndew point is closer to the current air temperature. Relative humidity of 100%\nindicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is\nmaximally saturated with water. When the dew point remains constant and\ntemperature increases, relative humidity decreases.\n\nGeneral aviation pilots use dew-point data to calculate the likelihood of\ncarburetor icing and fog, and to estimate the height of the cloud base.\n\n\n\nAt a given temperature but independent of barometric pressure, the dew point is\na consequence of the absolute humidity, the mass of water per unit volume of\nair. If both the temperature and pressure rise, however, the dew point will rise\nand the relative humidity will lower accordingly. Reducing the absolute humidity\nwithout changing other variables will bring the dew point back down to its\ninitial value. In the same way, increasing the absolute humidity after a\ntemperature drop brings the dew point back down to its initial level. If the\ntemperature rises in conditions of constant pressure, then the dew point will\nremain constant but the relative humidity will drop. For this reason, a constant\nrelative humidity (%) with different temperatures implies that when it's hotter,\na higher fraction of the air is water vapor than when it's cooler.\n\nAt a given barometric pressure but independent of temperature, the dew point\nindicates the mole fraction of water vapor in the air, or, put differently,\ndetermines the specific humidity of the air. If the pressure rises without\nchanging this mole fraction, the dew point will rise accordingly; Reducing the\nmole fraction, i.e., making the air less humid, would bring the dew point back\ndown to its initial value. In the same way, increasing the mole fraction after a\npressure drop brings the relative humidity back up to its initial level.\nConsidering New York (33 ft elevation) and Denver (5,280 ft\nelevation), for example, this means that if the dew\npoint and temperature in both cities are the same, then the mass of water vapor\nper cubic meter of air will be the same, but the mole fraction of water vapor in\nthe air will be greater in Denver.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Dew_point","recorded":1362480475,"links":60,"instances":["phase_transition","unit","chemistry","phase_transition","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/epz/wxcalc/rhTdFromWetBulb.pdf","https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/pzuidema/Bolton.pdf","http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~tcs3/tcs3/Misc/Dewpoint_Calculation_Humidity_Sensor_E.pdf","http://www.public.iastate.edu/~bkh/teaching/505/arden_buck_sat.pdf"],"categories":["Atmospheric thermodynamics","Psychrometrics","Threshold temperatures"],"headings":["Relationship to human comfort","Measurement","Calculating the dew point","Frost point","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Dewpoint.jpg/300px-Dewpoint.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Dewpoint-RH.svg/396px-Dewpoint-RH.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/9/2/9924f8997f97e65dceebe1d3615a75ad.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/b/36bb2a9a47b6992189986dbee2e3acd8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/4/844dec3015c1b5a208d9de5805fdf282.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/8/b48c88a046c76c4911628af8234aff21.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/1/4/d14ada7173bf10ce3f9e8473ee27af54.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/b/53b692d44937b700a4187b8df8f79488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/5/885c6d69ee2c2137fb2743358dd62d1e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/0/4/404bd3ce03fb963f2436f7396ebe118b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/7/3/2736c2a8d33ad2d6246b8fe175e82c94.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/e/f9e0f3379bfcea746d7b107df293527c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/b/b0b5c85c691202b0dbdb570e09927e70.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/f/fbfa42ffd7316d2b55255b50acecc112.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/8/a5841ed797eada6163ea41c9fb13bc2b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saturation","chemistry"],["bar","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["deposition","phase_transition"],["sublimation","phase_transition"]],"members":["deposition","bar","saturation","sublimation","pascal"],"related":["Temperature","Water_vapor","Air","Barometric_pressure","Condensation","Dew","Humidity","Relative_humidity","General_aviation","Carburetor_icing","Fog","Cloud_base","Barometric_pressure","Mole_fraction","Specific_humidity","Perspiration","Humidity","Wet_bulb_thermometer","Evaporative_cooling","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Continental_climate","Asthma","Relative_humidity","Saturation_(chemistry)","Bar_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","Wet-bulb_temperature","Arden_Buck_equation","NOAA","Deposition_(phase_transition)","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Bubble_point","Carburetor_heat","Hydrocarbon_dew_point","Psychrometrics","Thermodynamic_diagrams"]}
