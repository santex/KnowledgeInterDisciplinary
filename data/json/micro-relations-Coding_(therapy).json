{"cursor":"3916","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Coding' (also known as the 'Dovzhenko method') is a catch-all term for various\nRussian alternative therapeutic methods used to treat addictions, in which the\ntherapist attempts to scare patients into abstinence from a substance they are\naddicted to by convincing them that they will be harmed or killed if they use it\nagain. Each method involves the therapist\npretending to insert a \"code\" into patients' brains that will ostensibly provoke\na strong adverse reaction should it come into contact with the addictive\nsubstance. The methods use a combination of theatrics, hypnosis, placebos, and\ndrugs with temporary adverse effects to instil the erroneous beliefs. Therapists\nmay pretend to \"code\" patients for a fixed length of time, such as five\nyears.\n\nCoding was created by Alexander Dovzhenko, a psychiatrist in the former Soviet\nUnion. It has been widely used to treat alcohol addiction\nin Russia, but 16 percent of Russian narcologists also report using it in their\npractices to treat heroin addiction, and it has also\nbeen used to treat gambling addiction. Coding is not\nbased on any scientific evidence, and is not recommended under either Russian or\nWestern therapeutic guidelines.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Coding_(therapy)","recorded":1362896637,"links":11,"instances":["psychiatrist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Addiction","Alternative medical treatments","Therapy","Hypnosis","Russian inventions"],"headings":["Methods","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alexander_dovzhenko","psychiatrist"]],"members":["alexander_dovzhenko"],"related":["Russia","Alternative_medicine","Addiction","Adverse_reaction","Hypnosis","Placebo","Drug","Alexander_Dovzhenko_(psychiatrist)","Psychiatrist","Soviet_Union","Alcohol_addiction_in_Russia","Narcologist","Heroin_addiction","Gambling_addiction","Respiratory_system","Blindness","Paralysis","Local_anaesthetic","Electrode"]}
