{"cursor":"7011","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]]\n\n'Lynches River', named for Thomas Lynch, Jr., signer of the Declaration of\nIndependence, rises in North Carolina near Waxhaw, North Carolina, at about 700\nfeet (210 m) elevation, flowing only a short distance to the South Carolina\nborder, and thence to join the Pee Dee River near Johnsonville. It is about\n140 mi (225 km) long and the drainage area is 1030 square miles\n(2670 kmÂ²).\n\nSeveral sections of the river have been designated by South Carolina as wild\nand scenic rivers, and thus have some protection from development. The river\nis a favorite for canoeing, but Hurricane Hugo in 1989 felled many trees,\nblocking the flow at places, making navigation difficult at low water and\ndangerous at high water. River enthusiasts have been gradually cleaning up the\nstorm debris. The river is also a popular fishing spot, with sunfish,\nredbreast, catfish and bass.\n\nThe upper reaches of the River are on the Piedmont, an area of worn down\nmountains, consisting mostly of metamorphic rocks, overlain by rocky clay soils.\nMuch of the Piedmont is forested but patches of good land can be found,\nespecially around Pageland, site of an annual watermelon festival.\n\nThis section of the river was an important gold, and minor iron mining area in\nthe 19th century, with the first known gold being mined by placer in Lynches\nRiver and its tributaries near Pageland and Jefferson starting about 1828.\nBefore the Civil War, 58 gold mines operated in South Carolina. All commercial\nmining ceased in 1942 when the Federal Government's War Labor Board and PL-208\noutlawed gold mining across the coutnry. With the value of gold locked at $35\nper ounce, and federal law prohibiting private citizens from holding gold\nbetween the 1930s and 1980s, nearly all gold mines in the United States became\nimpractical and unprofitable to operate.\n\nWhen the price of gold was released by the federal government, prices rose, and\nfeasibility studies were begun on some of the old sites. At the Brewer gold\nmine, between Jefferson and Lynches River, it was deemed to have sufficient\nreserves to open it with modern machinery and technology. Between 1987 and 1991\nthe mine produced 118,000 troy ounces (3670 kg) of gold, by crushing the\nore and leaching it with a cyanide solution to dissolve the gold. In 1990 an\naccidental spill released cyanide into Lynches River and 11,000 fish died. The\nmine was closed for a few months for cleanup and repair.\n\nThe river drops off the Piedmont between Bethune and McBee, cutting through the\nsand hills region, an old ocean shoreline with hills that are thought to be\nformer beach dunes, now used for peach orchards and pine plantations. Near the\nriver is the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge and the Sandhills State\nForest both in Chesterfield County.\n\nAt Bethune, South Carolina is the only bridge in the world that crosses the same\nriver three times and the river does not fork. The Lynches river forms a large S\nat the place where US Highway #1 crosses the river one mile north of Bethune.\n\nBelow this the river valley widens and it begins to meander more, as it finishes\nits course through the coastal plain. As it passes Bishopville, South Carolina\nand Lynchburg, South Carolina, it flows through a traditional cotton farming\nbelt. Bishopville is the site of the South Carolina Cotton Museum.\n\nLee State Natural Area (formerly Lee State Park), located 4 miles southeast of\nBishopville is a gateway to the Lynches River. Although river access is limited\nat the park, several boat ramps are located nearby. Fishing may be enjoyed from\nthe park's riverbanks. Children under 14 may fish in the Artesian Lake which has\nbeen stocked with catfish. There is a boardwalk out into the Lynches River\nfloodplain that visitor can enjoy. At Effingham, Florence County maintains\nLynches River County Park, with nature trails, elevated boardwalk, swimming,\ncanoeing, and nature programs.\n\nAs the floodplain widens, the riversides become forested with tupelo, bald\ncypress, red maple, and other water loving vegetation. The uplands from\nEffingham to Johnsonville, South Carolina are also rich agricultural areas.\nTobacco is the primary money crop for farmers, but cotton, corn, wheat, hay, and\nvegetables are also grown. Effingham is the site of South Carolina's only\ncanning factory. At Johnsonville, the stream passes the largest factory along\nits length, that of Wellman Industries, a fiber processing and recycling plant.\nJust below Johnsonville, Lynches River empties into the Pee Dee River.\n\nPart of Lynches River has been designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nas critical habitat for the federally endangered Carolina heelsplitter,\nLasmigona decorata, a freshwater mussel. The Carolina heelsplitter is a medium\nsized freshwater mussel, reaching almost 4.5 inches (110 mm) in length,\nwith a greenish brown to dark brown shell. It is threatened by pollution and\nsilting and only six small populations still are known to exist.\n\nAnother aquatic invertebrate that inhabits the Lynches River is the Ridged\nLioplax, Lioplax subcarinata,a gastropod. South Carolina has designated it a\nspecies of concern. It has only been found in the Lynches and Waccamaw Rivers.\n","linknr":174,"url":"Lynches_River","recorded":1375080148,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lynches_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lynches_River&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lynches_River&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Lynches_River_Johonsonville_Winter.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Lynches_River_Johonsonville_Winter.jpg","/wiki/File:Lynches_River_Johonsonville_Winter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Johnsonville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/File:Peedeerivermap.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Peedeerivermap.png/300px-Peedeerivermap.png","/wiki/File:Peedeerivermap.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Thomas_Lynch,_Jr.","/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/Waxhaw","/wiki/South_Carolina","/wiki/Pee_Dee_River","/wiki/Johnsonville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Canoe","/wiki/Hurricane_Hugo","/wiki/Tree","/wiki/Navigation","/wiki/Centrarchidae","/wiki/Bass_(fish)","/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)","/wiki/Mountain","/wiki/Metamorphic_rock","/wiki/Clay","/wiki/Soil","/wiki/Forest","/wiki/Pageland,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Watermelon","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Iron","/wiki/Mining","/wiki/Placer_mining","/wiki/Pageland,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Jefferson,_South_Carolina","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Gold_mine","/wiki/Machinery","/wiki/Technology","/wiki/Ore","/wiki/Cyanide","/wiki/Fish","/wiki/Sand_hills","/wiki/Ocean","/wiki/Beach","/wiki/Dune","/wiki/Peach","/wiki/Orchard","/wiki/Pine","/wiki/Plantation","/wiki/Carolina_Sandhills_National_Wildlife_Refuge","/w/index.php?title=Sandhills_State_Forest&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Bethune,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Meander","/wiki/Plain","/wiki/Bishopville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Lynchburg,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Cotton","/wiki/Agriculture","/w/index.php?title=South_Carolina_Cotton_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Effingham,_South_Carolina&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Floodplain","/wiki/Tupelo","/wiki/Bald_cypress","/wiki/Red_maple","/wiki/Johnsonville,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Tobacco","/wiki/Maize","/wiki/Wheat","/wiki/Hay","/wiki/Vegetable","/w/index.php?title=Wellman_Industries&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fiber","/wiki/Recycling","/wiki/Pee_Dee_River","/wiki/U.S._Fish_and_Wildlife_Service","/wiki/Carolina_heelsplitter","/wiki/Mussel","/wiki/Pollution","/w/index.php?title=Lynches_River&action=edit&section=1","http://www.dnr.sc.gov/water/envaff/river/scenic/lynches.html","http://www.sc.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/LynchesRiverWater.html","http://www.house.gov/list/press/sc05_spratt/042905_brewer_gold_mine.html","http://www.fws.gov/endangered/r/fr93505.html","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Lynches_River&params=34.8206931_N_-80.5535716_E_","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lynches_River&oldid=554568855","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Rivers_of_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Rivers_of_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Chesterfield_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Darlington_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Florence_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Kershaw_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Lancaster_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Lee_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Sumter_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Williamsburg_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Union_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Yadkin-Pee_Dee_River_Basin","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:
