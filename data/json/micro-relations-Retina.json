The vertebrate 'retina' ( , pl. retinae, ; from Latin rÄte, meaning\n\"net\") is a light-sensitive layer of tissue, lining the inner surface of the\neye. The optics of the eye create an image of the visual world on the retina,\nwhich serves much the same function as the film in a camera. Light striking the\nretina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately\ntrigger nerve impulses. These are sent to various visual centres of the brain\nthrough the fibres of the optic nerve.\n\nIn vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and the optic nerve originate as\noutgrowths of the developing brain, so the retina is considered part of the\ncentral nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. \"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human\nEye\" vol. 27, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1987 http://www.uphs.upenn.ed-\nu/news/News_Releases/jul06/retinput.htm It is the only part of the CNS\nthat can be visualized non-invasively.\n\nThe retina is a layered structure with several layers of neurons interconnected\nby synapses. The only neurons that are directly sensitive to light are the\nphotoreceptor cells. These are mainly of two types: the rods and cones. Rods\nfunction mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision, while cones\nsupport daytime vision and the perception of colour. A third, much rarer type of\nphotoreceptor, the photosensitive ganglion cell, is important for reflexive\nresponses to bright daylight.\n\nNeural signals from the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons of\nthe retina. The output takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion\ncells whose axons form the optic nerve. Several important features of visual\nperception can be traced to the retinal encoding and processing of light.\n","linknr":843,"url":"Retina","recorded":1362482105,"links":73,"instances":["eye","mathematics","vision","medical","computing","biology","eye","eye"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Visual
