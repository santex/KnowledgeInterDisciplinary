{"cursor":"40382","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n 3.6.]]\n\n'Rendering' is the process of generating an image from a model (or models in\nwhat collectively could be called a scene file), by means of computer programs.\nAlso, the results of such a model can be called a rendering. A scene file\ncontains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would\ncontain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as a\ndescription of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then\npassed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or\nraster graphics image file. The term \"rendering\" may be by analogy with an\n\"artist's rendering\" of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering\nmethods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a\n3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline\nalong a rendering device, such as a GPU. A GPU is a purpose-built device able to\nassist a CPU in performing complex rendering calculations. If a scene is to look\nrelatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering\nsoftware should solve the rendering equation. The rendering equation doesn't\naccount for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-\ngenerated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of\ncalculating effects in a video editing program to produce final video output.\n\nRendering is one of the major sub-topics of 3D computer graphics, and in\npractice is always connected to the others. In the graphics pipeline, it is the\nlast major step, giving the final appearance to the models and animation. With\nthe increasing sophistication of computer graphics since the 1970s, it has\nbecome a more distinct subject.\n\nRendering has uses in architecture, video games, simulators, movie or TV visual\neffects, and design visualization, each employing a different balance of\nfeatures and techniques. As a product, a wide variety of renderers are\navailable. Some are integrated into larger modeling and animation packages, some\nare stand-alone, some are free open-source projects. On the inside, a renderer\nis a carefully engineered program, based on a selective mixture of disciplines\nrelated to: light physics, visual perception, mathematics and software\ndevelopment.\n\nIn the case of 3D graphics, rendering may be done slowly, as in pre-rendering,\nor in real time. Pre-rendering is a computationally intensive process that is\ntypically used for movie creation, while real-time rendering is often done for\n3D video games which rely on the use of graphics cards with 3D hardware\naccelerators.\n","linknr":602,"url":"Rendering_(computer_graphics)","recorded":1362562960,"links":71,"instances":["optics","graphic","optics","graphics","computer_graphics","computer_graphics"],"pdf":["http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf","http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/Appel.pdf","http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~cwyman/classes/spring05-22C251/papers/ContinuousShadingOfCurvedSurfaces.pdf","http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~cwyman/classes/spring05-22C251/papers/ContinuousShadingOfCurvedSurfaces.pdf","http://www.pixartouchbook.com/storage/catmull_thesis.pdf","http://www.pixartouchbook.com/storage/catmull_thesis.pdf","http://jesper.kalliope.org/blog/library/p311-phong.pdf","http://jesper.kalliope.org/blog/library/p311-phong.pdf","http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/crow-shadows.pdf","http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/crow-shadows.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/73939/p286-blinn.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/73939/p286-blinn.pdf","http://keithp.com/~keithp/porterduff/p253-porter.pdf","http://keithp.com/~keithp/porterduff/p253-porter.pdf","http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~nealen/teaching/cs428_fall09/readings/cook84.pdf","http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~nealen/teaching/cs428_fall09/readings/cook84.pdf","http://www.arnetminer.org/dev.do?m=downloadpdf&url=http://arnetminer.org/pdf/PDFFiles2/--g---g-Index1255026826706/The%20hemi-cube%20%20a%20radiosity%20solution%20for%20complex%20environments1255058011060.pdf","http://www.arnetminer.org/dev.do?m=downloadpdf&url=http://arnetminer.org/pdf/PDFFiles2/--g---g-Index1255026826706/The%20hemi-cube%20%20a%20radiosity%20solution%20for%20complex%20environments1255058011060.pdf","http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Reyes/paper.pdf","http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Reyes/paper.pdf","http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~jnkautz/projects/prt/prtSIG02.pdf","http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~jnkautz/projects/prt/prtSIG02.pdf"],"categories":["3D
