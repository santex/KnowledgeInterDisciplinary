It was listed on the\nAustralian Securities Exchange with its market capitalisation reaching 2.5\nbillion in March 2006. The company went into administrative receivership after\na fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis caused debt repayments to overwhelm\nthe company, and the auditors failed to sign off on the financial reports\nciting the need to recast previous year's reported profits. ABC Learning is now operated by the not-for-profit\nsyndicate GoodStart Childcare Limited.\n\nABC Learning went into voluntary liquidation in 2008 and was bought by Goodstart\nLimited in December 2009. Goodstart was created by a partnership of\norganisations - The Benevolent Society, Mission Australia, the Brotherhood of St\nLaurence and Social Ventures Australia - and now operates over 650 former ABC\nLearning centres across Australia.\n","linknr":250,"url":"ABC_Learning","recorded":1362581042,"links":16,"instances":["australia","australia"],"pdf":["http://childcare.com.au/Annual-Reports/2005%20Annual%20Report.pdf","http://childcare.com.au/Annual-Reports/2005%20Annual%20Report.pdf"],"categories":["Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange","Child care"],"headings":["History","Controversy and criticisms","Financial troubles","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/ABC_Learning.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Ashmont_Central_ABC_Learning_Centre.jpg/220px-Ashmont_Central_ABC_Learning_Centre.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["department_of_defence","australia"],["national_basketball_league","australia"]],"members":["national_basketball_league","department_of_defence"],"related":["Early_Childhood_Education","Brisbane","Australia","Eddy_Groves","Australian_Securities_Exchange","Administrative_receivership","Subprime_mortgage_crisis","The_Benevolent_Society","Mission_Australia","The_Brotherhood_of_St_Laurence","Brisbane,_Queensland","The_Age","United_States","Chicago","La_Petite_Academy","United_Kingdom","Department_of_Defence_(Australia)","Adelaide_36ers","National_Basketball_League_(Australia)","Morgan_Stanley","Brotherhood_of_St_Laurence","Mission_Australia","The_Benevolent_Society","Tax_rebate","Monopoly","Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission","Vicarious_liability","Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission","Margin_call","Eddy_Groves","S&P/ASX_200"]}
