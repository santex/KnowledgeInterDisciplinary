{"cursor":"12739","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe term 'Third World' arose during the Cold War to define countries that\nremained non-aligned with either NATO (with the United States, Western European\nnations and their allies representing the First World), or the Communist Bloc\n(with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Cuba and their allies\nrepresenting the Second World). This obsolete terminology provided a way of\nbroadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on social,\npolitical, and economic divisions, which has contributed to political bias. Due\nto many of the \"Third World countries\" being extremely poor, it became a\nstereotype such that people commonly refer to undeveloped countries as \"third\nworld countries\", often used in a pejorative way. [http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/no-running-water/degrading-third-\nworld-conditions-one-more-hurdle-for-disabled-man-on-reserve-132369633.html\nUsage in a Canadian newspaper] [http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/255320/two-\ncalifornias-victor-davis-hanson Usage in the National Review] Over the\nlast few decades, the term Third World has been mistakenly used interchangeably\nwith the Global South and Developing Countries to describe poorer countries that\nhave struggled to attain steady economic development. The politically acceptable\nterm for the twenty-first century has become the \"Emerging World\", the Global\nSouth and Developing Countries. Tomlinson, B.R. (2003).\n\"What was the Third World\", Journal of Contemporary History, 38(2):\n307â321.\n\nThird World countries were never polled or consulted as to whether or not their\npopulace and citizenry were in agreement with being listed or referred to as\nsuch; this included most of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. [change]However, it\nis considered extremely impolite to use the term Third World anymore and the\ncorrect phrasing may include the Emerging World, Global South or Developing\nCountries[change]. Historically, some European countries were part of the non-\naligned movement and a few were and are very prosperous, including Switzerland\nand Austria. In the so-called dependency theory of thinkers like Raul Prebisch,\nTheotonio dos Santos, and Andre Gunder Frank, the Third World has also been\nconnected to the world economic division as \"periphery\" countries in the world\nsystem that is dominated by the \"core\" countries. Tomlinson, B.R. (2003). \"What was the Third World\", Journal of\nContemporary History, 38(2): 307â321. Due to the complex history of\nevolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed upon definition of\nthe Third World and the term is now less popular than it was during the 1970s\nand 1980s.\n","linknr":391,"url":"Third_world","recorded":1362373545,"links":59,"instances":["france"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Country classifications","Political terminology","Politics by region","Cold War terminology"],"headings":["Etymology","Third World vs. Three Worlds","Third Worldism","History","Foreign aid and development","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Cold_War_alliances_mid-1975.svg/260px-Cold_War_alliances_mid-1975.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/An_abandoned_MOGADISHU_Street_known_as_the_Green_Line%2C_Jan_1993.JPEG/220px-An_abandoned_MOGADISHU_Street_known_as_the_Green_Line%2C_Jan_1993.JPEG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["estates_general","france"],["estates_general","france"],["estates_general","france"]],"members":["estates_general"],"related":["Cold_War","NATO","United_States","Western_Europe","First_World","Communist_Bloc","Soviet_Union","People's_Republic_of_China","Cuba","Second_World","Pejorative","National_Review","Global_South","Developing_Countries","Global_South","Developing_Countries","Africa","Latin_America","Asia","Switzerland","Austria","Alfred_Sauvy","Estates_General_(France)","French_Revolution","Estates_General_(France)","Estates_General_(France)","Non-Aligned_Movement","Mao_Zedong","Peter_Bauer","Sergey_Zagraevsky","Modernization_Theory","Dependency_Theory","Rostow's_stages_of_growth","W._W._Rostow","Developing_country","First_World","Fourth_World","Non-Aligned_Movement","North-South_divide","Second_World","Third_World_Socialism","Three_Worlds_Theory","Modernization_Theory","Dependency_Theory","Alan_Whaites"]}
