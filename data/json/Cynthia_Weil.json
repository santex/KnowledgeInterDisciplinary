{"cursor":"8670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Carole Bayer Sager, and Barry Mann in December 2012]] 'Cynthia Weil' (born\nOctober 18, 1940, New York) is a prominent American songwriter. She is famous\nfor having written many songs together with her husband Barry Mann.\n\nWeil was trained as an actress and dancer but soon demonstrated a songwriting\nability that led to her collaboration with Barry Mann whom she would marry in\nAugust 1961. . The couple has one daughter, Dr Jenn Berman,\nAKA \"Dr. Jenn\". Weil became one of the Brill Building songwriters of the 1960s,\nand one of the most important writers during the emergence of rock and roll.\n\nShe and her husband went on to create songs for numerous contemporary artists,\nwinning a number of Grammy Awards and Academy Award nominations for their\ncompositions for film. As their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography put it, in\npart: \"Mann and Weil ... [works went from] epic ballads (âOn Broadway,â âYouâve\nLost That Lovinâ Feelinââ) to outright rockers (âKicks,â âWeâve Gotta Get Out of\nThis Placeâ) [and they also] placed an emphasis on meaningful lyrics in their\nsongwriting. With Weil writing the words and Mann the music, they came up with a\nnumber of songs that addressed such serious subjects as racial and economic\ndivides[,] âUptown,â ... and the difficult reality of making it in the big city\n(âOn Broadway,â ...). âOnly in Americaâ ... tackled segregation and racism,\nmaking it rather too controversial for the Drifters, who were the intended\nartists. âWe Gotta Get Out of This Placeâ ... became an anthem for [the] Vietnam\nsoldier, antiwar protesters, and young people who viewed it as an anthem of\ngreater opportunities.\"\n\nIn 1987, she was inducted with her husband, Mann, into the Songwriters Hall of\nFame. In 2004, Mann and Weilâs They Wrote That?, a musical revue based on their\nsongs, opened in New York. In it, Mann sang and Weil related stories about the\nsongs and their personal history.\n\nWeil and Mann were named among the 2010 recipients of Ahmet Ertegun Award from\nthe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the ceremony at the Waldorf-\nAstoria, which was telecast on the Fuse TV cable network, songwriter Carole King\ninducted Mann and Weil and other songwriting colleagues from the 1950s and early\n1960s, including Ellie Greenwich (posthumously) and Jeff Barry, Otis Blackwell\n(posthumously), Mort Shuman, and Jesse Stone (posthumously).
