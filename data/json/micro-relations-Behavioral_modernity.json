It\nis the point at which [[Homo sapiens]] began to demonstrate an ability to use\ncomplex symbolic thought and express cultural creativity. These developments are\noften thought to be associated with the origin of language.\n\nThere are two main theories regarding when modern human behavior emerged. One theory holds that behavioral modernity occurred as a\nsudden event some 50 kya (50,000 years ago) in prehistory, possibly as a result\nof a major genetic mutation or as a result of a biological reorganization of the\nbrain that led to the emergence of modern human natural languages. Proponents of this theory refer to this event as the\n'Great Leap Forward' or the 'Upper Paleolithic\nRevolution'.\n\nThe second theory holds that there was never any single technological or\ncognitive revolution. Proponents of this view argue that modern human behavior\nis the result of the gradual accumulation of knowledge, skills and culture\noccurring over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution. Proponents of this view include Stephen Oppenheimer\nin his book Out of Eden, and John Skoyles and Dorion Sagan in their book [[Up\nfrom Dragons|Up from Dragons: The evolution of human intelligence]].\n","linknr":302,"url":"Behavioral_modernity","recorded":1362373317,"links":41,"instances":["disambiguation","scientist","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~steve/files/mcbrearty.pdf","http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~steve/files/mcbrearty.pdf","http://web.wits.ac.za/nr/rdonlyres/36b3565b-4c9e-4e18-b220-fbc75ab094aa/0/klein2000.pdf"],"categories":["Anthropology","Recent single origin hypothesis","Human behavior","Upper Paleolithic","Human evolution","Sociocultural evolution"],"headings":["Definition","Timing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lascaux_painting.jpg/240px-Lascaux_painting.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/BBC-artefacts.jpg/220px-BBC-artefacts.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/BBC-shell-beads.jpg/220px-BBC-shell-beads.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_skoyles","scientist"],["barter","economics"],["symbolism","disambiguation"]],"members":["symbolism","john_skoyles","barter"],"related":["Anthropology","Archeology","Sociology","Human","Primate","Hominid","Abstraction","Origin_of_language","Tya","Prehistory","Natural_language","Stephen_Oppenheimer","John_Skoyles_(scientist)","Dorion_Sagan","Cultural_universals","Language","Religion","Art","Music","Mythology","Cooking","Game","Jokes","Ethology","Africa","Stone_tool","Barter_(economics)","Pigment","Ochre","Self-ornamentation","Art_of_the_Upper_Paleolithic","Cave_painting","Petroglyph","Venus_figurines","Prehistoric_music","Seasoned","Paleolithic_burial","Tya","Africa","Europe","Neanderthals","Associated_Press","Jared_Diamond","Acheulean","Mousterian","Australia","Eurasia","Neanderthal","Cro-Magnon_interaction_with_Neanderthals","Anatomically_modern_humans","Sociocultural_evolution","Sociobiological","Industrial_revolution","Middle_Stone_Age","Levant","Qafzeh","Symbolic_behavior","Southern_Africa","Archaic_Homo_sapiens","Blombos_Cave","Cultural_universal","Evolution_of_human_intelligence","Human_evolution","Origin_of_language","Origin_of_music","Paleolithic_religion","Recent_African_origin","Sibudu_Cave","Sociocultural_evolution","Symbolism_(disambiguation)","Steven_Mithen"]}
