Animals may also hunt\nother animal species but this is usually called predation. In present-day use,\nlawful hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the killing, trapping or\ncapture of the hunted species contrary to applicable law. The species that are\nhunted are referred to as game, and are usually mammals and migratory or non-\nmigratory gamebirds.\n\nHunting can also involve the elimination of vermin, as a means of pest control\nto prevent diseases caused by overpopulation. Hunting advocates state that\nhunting can be a necessary component Williams, Ted. \"Wanted: More Hunters,\"\nAudubon magazine, March 2002, [http://classic-\nweb.archive.org/web/20071013120158/http://magazine.audubon.org/incite/incite020-\n3.html copy] retrieved 26 October 2007. of modern wildlife management, for\nexample to help maintain a population of healthy animals within an environment's\necological carrying capacity when natural checks such as predators are\nabsent. In the United States, wildlife managers are frequently part\nof hunting regulatory and licensing bodies, where they help to set rules on the\nnumber, manner and conditions in which game may be hunted.\n\nThe pursuit, capture and release, or capture for food of fish is called fishing,\nwhich is not commonly categorised as a form of hunting. Trapping is also usually\nconsidered a separate activity. It is also not considered hunting to pursue\nanimals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography or birdwatching.\nThe practice of foraging or gathering materials from plants and mushrooms is\nalso considered separate.\n\nSkilful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word hunt\nto be used in the vernacular as a metaphor, as in treasure hunting, \"bargain\nhunting\", and even \"hunting down corruption and waste.\"\n","linknr":1233,"url":"Hunting","recorded":1362373425,"links":134,"instances":["mythology","profession","medieval","land","device","animal","hunting","sociology","textile","ethic","ecology","penalty","disambiguation","nutrition","literature","carrier","reward","weapon","food","architect"],"pdf":["http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/pbfiles/PB1643.pdf","http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/pbfiles/PB1643.pdf","http://www.responsivemanagement.com/download/news/newsrls_09_06.pdf","http://www.uga.edu/scwds/documents/chardonnet2002.pdf","http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_279.pdf","http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/hsp/soa_ii_chap01.pdf"],"categories":["Hunting|","Blood
