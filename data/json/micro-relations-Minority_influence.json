There are two types of social influence:\nmajority influence (conformity) and minority influence (innovation). Majority\ninfluence refers to the majority trying to produce conformity on the minority,\nwhile minority influence is converting the majority to adapt the thinking of the\nminority group. Sampson, E. (1991). Social worlds,\npersonal lives: An introduction to social psychology. (6th Ed.) San Diego, CA:\nHarcourt Brace Jovanovich. Unlike other forms of influence, minority\ninfluence usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. Minority\ninfluence is also a central component of identity politics.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Minority_influence","recorded":1362481821,"links":16,"instances":["human_resources","cognitive","psychology","behavior"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social psychology","Identity politics","Majorityâ€“minority relations"],"headings":["How minority influence works","Factors that affect minority influence","Studies on minority influence","Yielding to minority influence","Broadening views in organizations","Further research","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["perspective","cognitive"],["eccentricity","behavior"],["dissociation","psychology"],["competence","human_resources"]],"members":["competence","perspective","dissociation","eccentricity"],"related":["Social_influence","Minority_group","Beliefs","Behaviour","Conformity","Innovation","Social_influence","Identity_politics","Majority","Opinion","Appeal","Adaption","Conform","Normative_social_influence","Perspective_(cognitive)","Informational_social_influence","Social_proof","Attention","Elizabeth_Mannix","Advocacy","Decision_making","Attention","Eccentricity_(behavior)","Consistency","Credibility","Asch_conformity_experiments","Serge_Moscovici","Credibility","Research","Natural_deduction","Psychologists","Serge_Moscovici","Heterosexual","Gay_rights","Homosexual","In-group","Dissociate","Socio-cognitive","Psychological_resistance","Dissociation_(psychology)","Latency_stage","Zeitgeist","Theory","Organizations","Social_groups","Multiculturalism","Social_change","Corporate","Competence_(human_resources)","Leadership","Criterion_validity","Biased","Weaknesses","Values","Culture","Jury","Conformity","Culture_jamming","Identity_politics","Normative_social_influence","Social_proof"]}
