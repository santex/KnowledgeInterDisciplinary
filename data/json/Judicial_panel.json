{"cursor":"2286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'judicial panel' is a set of judges who sit together to hear a cause of\naction, most frequently an appeal from a ruling of a trial court judge. Panels\nare used in contrast to single-judge appeals, and hearings, which involves all\nof the judges of that court.\n\nIn the United States, most federal appellate cases are heard by three-judge\npanels. The governing statute, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 46(c), provides:  Cases\nand controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or panel of not more\nthan three judges (except that the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit may sit in panels of more than three judges if its rules so\nprovide), unless a hearing or rehearing before the court is ordered by a\nmajority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regular active\nservice.\n\nMost trials in the United States District Courts are held before a single judge,\nbut there are some circumstances where the trial itself is required to be held\nbefore a three judge panel. For example, 28 U. S. C. Â§ 2284(a) states:\n\nA district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise\nrequired by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the\nconstitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the\napportionment of any statewide legislative body.\n\nTypically, if the chief judge is a member of the panel, that person will chair\nthe panel and call hearings to order; if the chief judge is not on the panel,\nthis duty falls to the senior-most judge. Following oral arguments, the judges\nwill meet briefly to confer and determine what the likely majority opinion in\nthe case will be. If the judge who chairs the panel is in the majority at this\ntime, that judge may assign the writing of the opinion for that case.\n\nSome bodies, such as the British leasehold valuation tribunal, may have\njudicial functions carried out by a single member. Although most cases consists\nof a panel of three; one with a background in property law (generally a\nsolicitor); one with a background in property valuation generally a qualified\nsurveyor; and a layman.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Judicial_panel","recorded":1374785149,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Cause_of_action","/wiki/Trial_court","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/En_banc","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit","/wiki/United_States_District_Court","/wiki/Chief_judge","/wiki/Leasehold_valuation_tribunal","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Law-term-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Law-term-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Law-term-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&oldid=556816784","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Legal_procedure","/wiki/Category:Legal_term_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_French-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judicial+panel&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Judicial+panel","/wiki/Judicial_panel","/wiki/Talk:Judicial_panel","#","/wiki/Judicial_panel","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Judicial_panel","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Judicial_panel","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&oldid=556816784","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6303000","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Judicial_panel&id=556816784","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Judicial+panel","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Judicial+panel&oldid=556816784&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Judicial_panel&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kammer_(Gericht)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6303000#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_panel","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal
