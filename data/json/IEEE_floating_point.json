{"cursor":"26592","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic' ('IEEE 754') is a technical\nstandard for floating-point computation established in 1985 by the Institute of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Many hardware floating point units\nuse the IEEE 754 standard. The current version, 'IEEE 754-2008' published in\nAugust 2008, includes nearly all of the original IEEE 754-1985 standard and the\nIEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 854-1987).\nThe international standard 'ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011' (with identical content to\nIEEE 754) has been approved for adoption through JTC1/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE\nPSDO Agreement [http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html FW:\nISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)] and published. [http://www.is-\no.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469\nISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology - Microprocessor Systems - Floating-\nPoint arithmetic]\n\nThe standard defines\n* arithmetic formats: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which\n  consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers),\n  infinities, and special \"not a number\" values (NaNs)\n* interchange formats: encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-\n  point data in an efficient and compact form\n* rounding rules: properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during\n  arithmetic and conversions\n* operations: arithmetic and other operations on arithmetic formats\n* exception handling: indications of exceptional conditions (such as division by\n  zero, overflow, etc.)\n\nThe standard also includes extensive recommendations for advanced exception\nhandling, additional operations (such as trigonometric functions), expression\nevaluation, and for achieving reproducible results.\n\nThe standard is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-1985, the previous version,\nfollowing a seven-year revision process, chaired by Dan Zuras and edited by Mike\nCowlishaw. The binary formats in the original standard are included in the new\nstandard along with three new basic formats (one binary and two decimal). To\nconform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one\nof the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n","linknr":398,"url":"IEEE_floating_point","recorded":1362480307,"links":40,"instances":["programming_language","microprocessor","microprocessor"],"pdf":["http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf","http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf","http://chrishecker.com/images/f/fb/Gdmfp.pdf","http://chrishecker.com/images/f/fb/Gdmfp.pdf","http://www.freecollab.com/dr-chuck/papers/columns/r3114.pdf","http://www.freecollab.com/dr-chuck/papers/columns/r3114.pdf","http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/acsel/arithmetic/arith16/papers/ARITH16_Cowlishaw.pdf","http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/acsel/arithmetic/arith16/papers/ARITH16_Cowlishaw.pdf"],"categories":["Computer arithmetic","IEEE standards"],"headings":["Formats","Rounding rules","Operations","Exception handling","Recommendations","Character representation","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ibm_z10","microprocessor"],["ibm_z196","microprocessor"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["java","ibm_z196","ibm_z10"],"related":["Technical_standard","Floating_point","Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers","Floating_point_unit","IEEE_754-1985","Radix","IEEE_854-1987","ISO/IEC_JTC1","Binary_code","Decimal","Signed_zero","Subnormal_number","Infinity","NaN","Division_by_zero","Trigonometric_functions","IEEE_754-1985","IEEE_754_revision","Mike_Cowlishaw","NaN","Subnormal_number","Signed_zero","Binary32","Binary64","IEEE_754-1985","Half_precision_floating-point_format","Single_precision_floating-point_format","Double_precision_floating-point_format","Quadruple_precision_floating-point_format","Decimal32_floating-point_format","Decimal64_floating-point_format","Decimal128_floating-point_format","X87","Extended_precision","Densely_packed_decimal","Fused_multiplyâ€“add","Total_order","Dot_product","IEEE_754-1985","X87","Coprocessor","Half_precision","Single_precision","Double_precision","Quadruple_precision","Extended_precision","IBM_System_z9","IBM_z10_(microprocessor)","IBM_z196_(microprocessor)","ISO/IEC_10967","Minifloat","POWER6","POWER7","Strictfp","Java_(programming_language)","ACM_Computing_Surveys","Chris_Hecker","IEEE_Computer","Mike_Cowlishaw","Algorism","ACM_Transactions_on_Programming_Languages_and_Systems"]}
