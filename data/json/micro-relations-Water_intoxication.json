Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal\nindividuals have resulted either from water drinking contests in which\nindividuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or long bouts of\nintensive exercise during which electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet\nhuge amounts of fluid are still\nconsumed. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11732457?dopt=Abstract A\nstudy] refers to a renal excretion capacity of 3 ml/hr Moreover, water\ncure, a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive\namounts of water, can cause water intoxication.\n\nWater, just like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-\nconsumed in a specific period of time. Water intoxication mostly occurs when\nwater is being consumed at a high quantity without giving the body its proper\nnutrients it needs to be\nhealthy. http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html\n\nExcess of body water may also be a result of a medical condition or improper\ntreatment; see \"hyponatremia\" for some examples. Water is considered the least\ntoxic chemical compound, with a LD 50 of 90 g/kg or more in\nrats.
