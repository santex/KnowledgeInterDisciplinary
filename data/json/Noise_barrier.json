{"cursor":"8390","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'' in Melbourne, Australia, designed to reduce roadway noise without detracting\nfrom the area's aesthetics.]]\n\nA 'noise barrier' (also called a 'soundwall', 'sound berm', 'sound barrier', or\n'acoustical barrier') is an exterior structure designed to protect inhabitants\nof sensitive land use areas from noise pollution. Noise barriers are the most\neffective method of mitigating roadway, railway, and industrial noise sources â\nother than cessation of the source activity or use of source controls.\n\nIn the case of surface transportation noise, other methods of reducing the\nsource noise intensity include encouraging the use of hybrid and electric\nvehicles, improving automobile aerodynamics and tire design, and choosing low-\nnoise paving material. Extensive use of noise barriers began in the United\nStates after noise regulations were introduced in the early 1970s.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Noise_barrier","recorded":1362890098,"links":32,"instances":["medicine","california","railroad","material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Environmental engineering","Noise pollution","Noise reduction","Road infrastructure","Acoustics"],"headings":["History","Theory of design","Tradeoffs","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/TullamarineFwy.jpg/310px-TullamarineFwy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/Noisebarrierm.jpg/290px-Noisebarrierm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Noisercrazorback.jpg/310px-Noisercrazorback.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Geluidscherm_Overschie.jpg/310px-Geluidscherm_Overschie.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pavement","material"],["county_route_g5","california"],["right-of-way","railroad"],["stress","medicine"]],"members":["stress","county_route_g5","pavement"],"related":["Melbourne","Australia","Land_use","Noise_pollution","Roadway_noise","Hybrid_vehicles","Electric_vehicle","Automotive_aerodynamics","Tire","Pavement_(material)","United_States","Noise_regulation","United_States","Acoustics","Roadway","Denmark","Roadway_noise","County_Route_G5_(California)","Santa_Clara_County","Geometry","Topography","Vehicle","Roadway_surface","Meteorology","Caltrans","Sacramento,_California","Palo_Alto,_California","Bolt,_Beranek_and_Newman","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","University_of_Florida","Los_Altos,_California","Santa_Clara_County","ESL_Inc.","Sunnyvale,_California","National_Environmental_Policy_Act","National_Environmental_Policy_Act","Noise_pollution","Federal-Aid_Highway_Act","Noise_Control_Act","Noise_regulation","Computer_model","Noise_pollution","Computer_model","Line_source","Sensory_receptor","Diffraction","Sound_waves","Refraction","Atmosphere","Wind_shear","Thermocline","Engine","Tire","Aerodynamic","Computer_model","Equations","Sonoma_County","Berm","Cut-and-cover","Right-of-way_(railroad)","Logarithmic_scale","Decibel","Noise_pollution","Aesthetics","Sleep_disturbance","Speech_interference","Stress_(medicine)","Hearing_impairment","Blood_pressure","Cardiovascular","Berm","Noise_health_effects","Soundproofing"]}
