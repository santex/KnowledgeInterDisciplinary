Rotational speed is a cyclic\nfrequency measured in hertz (\"rotations per minute or per second\") in the SI\nSystem or revolutions per minute or per second (rpm or 1/min), the latter of\nwhich is more common in everyday life. Scientists, however, generally prefer to\nmeasure rotational speed in radians per second. The symbol for rotational speed\nis Ï (the Greek letter \"omega\").\n\nWhen proper units are used for tangential speed v, rotational speed Ï, and\nradial distance r, the direct proportion of v to both r and Ï becomes the exact\nequation: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/rotq.html\n\n: v = r\\omega_{rad}\n\nAn algebraic rearrangement of this equation allows us to solve for\nrotational speed:\n\n: v = r\\omega_{rad} \\to \\omega_{rad} = v/r\n\nThus, the tangential speed will be directly proportional to r when all parts of\na system simultaneously have the same Ï, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand. It\nis important to note that the direct proportionality of v to r is not valid for\nthe planets, because the planets have different rotational speeds (Ï).\n\nRotational speed can measure, for example, how fast a motor is running.\nRotational speed and angular speed are sometimes used as synonyms, but typically\nthey are measured with a different unit. Angular speed, however, tells the\nchange in angle per time unit, which is measured in radians per second in the SI\nsystem. Since there are 2Ï radians per cycle, or 360 degrees per cycle, we can\nconvert angular speed to rotational speed by:\n\n: \\omega_{cyc} = \\omega_{rad}/2\\pi\\,\nand\n: \\omega_{cyc} = \\omega_{deg}/360\\,\n\nwhere\n* \\omega_{cyc}\\, is rotational speed in cycles per second\n* \\omega_{rad}\\, is angular speed in radians per second\n* \\omega_{deg}\\, is angular speed in degrees per second\n\nFor example, a stepper motor might turn exactly one complete revolution each\nsecond. Its angular speed is 360 degrees per second (360Â°/s), or 2Ï radians per\nsecond (2Ï rad/s), while the rotational speed is 60 rpm.\n\nRotational speed is not to be confused with tangential speed, despite some\nrelation between the two concepts. Imagine a rotating merry-go-round. No matter\nhow close or far you stand from the axis of rotation, your rotational speed will\nremain constant. However, your tangential speed does not remain constant. If you\nstand two meters from the axis of rotation, your tangential speed will be double\nthe amount if you were standing only one meter from the axis of rotation.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Rotational_speed","recorded":1362568439,"links":24,"instances":["angular_velocity","angle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical quantities"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/9/2194f23e8df2baf9abe4629d9f4915fa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/0/8400d4b36c768d949e331d2ac87f26f1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/3/7/c3758ec1e054bdcbea6f4b2c43fe2fe2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/1/c/61c3f4659a801751174da3ba30e2d4aa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/b/5ebf45cfac5a8a2c0e99ec3f4be7a2ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/8/fa81893a868876ca36dfbb81af5e8bdc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/d/e2d6c92ef1b2ca0a900acafa3d0e9950.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degree","angle"],["orders_of_magnitude","angular_velocity"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude","degree"],"related":["Hertz","Omega","Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis","Frequency","Hertz","Rotations_per_minute","International_System_of_Units","Revolutions_per_minute","Revolutions_per_second","Radians_per_second","Greek_alphabet","Planet","Angular_speed","Angle","Radian_per_second","Stepper_motor","Degree_(angle)","Radian","Angular_velocity","Orders_of_magnitude_(angular_velocity)"]}
