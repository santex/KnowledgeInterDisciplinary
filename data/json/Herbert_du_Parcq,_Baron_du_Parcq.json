He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey and\nExeter College, Oxford (BA Literae Humaniores) (2nd class)) and Jesus College,\nOxford (BCL, Senior Scholar). He was president of the Oxford Union in 1902. He\nwas called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1906 and admitted to the Jersey Bar in\nthe same year.\n\nIn 1911 he married Lucy Renouf, from St Helier. They had two daughters Helen\nand Catherine and a son John Renouf. Herbert died in a London nursing home on\nApril 27, 1949.\n\nHe became a specialist in commercial litigation in London, took silk as a Q.C.\nin 1926 and was appointed Recorder for Portsmouth in 1928 and Recorder for\nBristol in 1929. A mutiny in Dartmoor Prison on 24 January 1932 led to the\nsetting up of a commission of enquiry under Herbert du Parcq. His report was\nconsidered satisfactory and he was rewarded with an appointment to the King's\nBench Division as a judge.\n\nInvested to the Privy Council in 1938, du Parcq was Lord Justice of Appeal from\n1938 to 1946. On 5 February 1946, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary\nand was created a life peer with the title 'Baron du Parcq', of Grouville in the\nIsland of Jersey.\n\nDuring World War 2, he chaired the Channel Islands Refugees Committee which\nraised funds, gave financial relief, distributed clothing, traced relatives and\ngave guidance and help to refugees. The UK government relied on the Committee\nfor information on the Channel Islands and in September 1940 his first appeal\nfor funds on the BBC's 'The Week's Good Cause' programme raised what was then a\nrecord result.\n\nIn 1946 he became chairman of a Royal Commission into justices of the peace. He\nwas a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, and was an\nHonorary Fellow of Exeter College and Jesus College.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","recorded":1375075968,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/King%27s_Counsel","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Saint_Helier","/wiki/Jersey","/wiki/Victoria_College,_Jersey","/wiki/Exeter_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Literae_Humaniores","/wiki/Jesus_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law","/wiki/Oxford_Union","/wiki/Middle_Temple","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Q.C.","/wiki/Recorder_(judge)","/wiki/Dartmoor_Prison","/wiki/King%27s_Bench_Division","/wiki/Privy_Council","/wiki/Lord_Justice_of_Appeal","/wiki/Lord_of_Appeal_in_Ordinary","/wiki/Life_peer","/wiki/Grouville","/wiki/Royal_Commission","/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration","/wiki/The_Hague","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1479-1234%281949%2935%3Cxv%3ATRHLDP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Q","/wiki/The_Times","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/61077867","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&oldid=552434993","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1880_births","/wiki/Category:1949_deaths","/wiki/Category:Law_lords","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Exeter_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Jesus_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:People_from_St_Helier","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herbert+du+Parcq%2C+Baron+du+Parcq&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herbert+du+Parcq%2C+Baron+du+Parcq","/wiki/Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","/wiki/Talk:Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","#","/wiki/Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&oldid=552434993","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1103936","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Herbert_du_Parcq%2C_Baron_du_Parcq&id=552434993","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Herbert+du+Parcq%2C+Baron+du+Parcq","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Herbert+du+Parcq%2C+Baron+du+Parcq&oldid=552434993&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_du_Parcq,_Baron_du_Parcq","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1103936#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/
