This is required by all living cells and associated viruses.]]\n\nThe 'ribosome' (from ''ribo''nucleic acid and the Greek soma, meaning \"body\") is\na large and complex molecular machine, found within all living cells, that\nserves as the primary site of biological protein synthesis (translation).\nRibosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA\n(mRNA) molecules. Ribosomes consist of two major subunitsâthe small ribosomal\nsubunit reads the mRNA, while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a\npolypeptide chain. Each subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA (rRNA)\nmolecules and a variety of proteins.\n\nThe sequence of DNA encoding for a protein may be copied many times into\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) chains of a similar sequence. Ribosomes can bind to an mRNA\nchain and use it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino\nacids in a particular protein. Amino acids are selected, collected and carried\nto the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA molecules), which enter one part of the\nribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain. The attached amino acids are then\nlinked together by another part of the ribosome. Once the protein is produced,\nit can then 'fold' to produce a specific functional three-dimensional structure.\n\nA ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a\nribonucleoprotein. Each ribosome is divided into two subunits: the smaller\nsubunit binds to the mRNA pattern, while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA\nand the amino acids. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these\ntwo subunits split apart. Ribosomes are ribozymes, because the catalytic\npeptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by\nthe ribosomal RNA.\n\nRibosomes from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (the three domains of life on\nEarth) differ in their size, sequence, structure, and the ratio of protein to\nRNA. The differences in structure allow some antibiotics to kill bacteria by\ninhibiting their ribosomes, while leaving human ribosomes unaffected. In\nbacteria and archaea, more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain\nat one time, each \"reading\" its sequence and producing a corresponding protein\nmolecule. The ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells functionally\nresemble many features of those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary\norigin of mitochondria.\n\nAlbert Claude, Christian de Duve, and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded\nthe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 1974, for the discovery of the\nribosomes. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to\nVenkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath for determining the\ndetailed structure and mechanism of the\nribosome.
