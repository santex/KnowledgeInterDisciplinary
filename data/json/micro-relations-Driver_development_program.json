{"cursor":"2765","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'Driver development program' is a program used by racing teams to develop\nyounger drivers. It is widely used in both Formula One (primarily by Red Bull\nRacing and Renault) and NASCAR, usually consisting of a team signing a driver to\na multi-year contract in which they run in minor-league racing divisions (such\nas the Formula 3 Euro Series & GP2 in Europe, and Late models & ARCA in stock\ncar racing) and gradually work up to the highest levels of motorsport. Some have\ncriticized the contracts as being unfairly long-term and low-paying for the\nyoung drivers (who likely don't yet have professional representation from an\nagent).
