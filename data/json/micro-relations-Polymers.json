Chain contour length for this polymer is\n ~204 nm; thickness is ~0.4 nm. ]] A 'polymer' is a chemical\n compound or mixture of compounds consisting of repeating structural units\n created through a process of polymerization. http://www.merriam-\n webster.com/dictionary/polymer  The term derives from the ancient Greek\n word ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ (polus, meaning \"many, much\") and Î¼Î­ÏÎ¿Ï (meros, meaning \"parts\"),\n and refers to a molecule whose structure is composed of multiple repeating\n units, from which originates a characteristic of high relative molecular mass\n and attendant properties. http://goldbook.iupac.org/M03667.html; accessed 7\n October 2012. Per the IUPAC Gold Book and PAC sources referenced therein, \"In\n many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded as\n having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a\n few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties.\" However,\n they note that the \"statement fails in the case of certain macromolecules for\n which the properties may be critically dependent on fine details of the\n molecular structure.\" The units composing polymers derive, actually or\n conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass. The\n term was coined in 1833 by JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition\n distinct from the modern IUPAC definition. If two substances had empirical\n formulae that were integer multiples of each other -- e.g., acetylene\n (C 2H 2) and benzene (C 6H 6) --\n Berzelius called them \"polymeric\". See: JÃ¶ns Jakob Berzelius (1833) \"Isomerie,\n Unterscheidung von damit analogen VerhÃ¤ltnissen\" (Isomeric, distinction from\n relations analogous to it), Jahres-Bericht Ã¼ber die Fortschitte der physischen\n Wissenschaften â¦, '12' : 63-67. [http://books.google.com/books?id=1vs4AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-\n PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false From page 64]: \"Um diese Art von Gleichheit in der\n Zusammensetzung, bei Ungleichheit in den Eigenschaften, bezeichnen zu kÃ¶nnen,\n mÃ¶chte ich fÃ¼r diese KÃ¶rper die Benennung polymerische (von ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ mehrere)\n vorschlagen.\" (In order to be able to denote this type of similarity in\n composition [which is accompanied] by differences in properties, I would like\n to propose the designation \"polymeric\" (from ÏÎ¿Î»ÏÏ, several) for these\n substances.) Originally published in 1832 in Swedish as: JÃ¶ns Jacob\n Berzelius (1832) \"Isomeri, dess distinktion frÃ¥n dermed analoga fÃ¶rhÃ¥llanden,\"\n ÃrsberÃ¤ttelse om Framstegen i Fysik och Kemi, pages 65-70 ; the word\n \"polymeriska\" appears on\n [http://books.google.com/books?id=PZUHAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false page\n 66]. See also: William B. Jensen (2008) \"Ask the Historian: The\n origin of the polymer concept,\" Journal of Chemical Education, '88' : 624-625.\n Available on-line at:\n [http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/141.%20Polymer.pdf\n University of California.edu]. Polymers are studied in the fields of\n biophysics and macromolecular science, and polymer science (which includes\n polymer chemistry and polymer physics).\n\nHistorically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent\nchemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science; emerging\nimportant areas of the science now focus on non-covalent links. Because of the\nstipulation as to repeating substructures, polymers are formally a subclass of\nthe category of macromolecules; the polyisoprene of latex rubber and the\npolystyrene of styrofoam are examples of polymeric natural/biological and\nsynthetic polymers, respectively. In biological contexts, essentially all\nbiological macromoleculesâi.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids\n(polynucleotides), and polysaccharidesâare purely polymeric, or are composed in\nlarge part of polymeric componentsâe.g., isoprenylated/lipid-modified\nglycoproteins, where small lipidic molecule and oligosaccharide modifications\noccur on the polyamide backbone of the protein.\n\nHence, the terms polymer and polymeric material encompass very large, broad\nclasses of compounds, both natural and synthetic, with a wide variety of\nproperties. Because of the extraordinary range of properties of polymeric\nmaterials, they play an essential and ubiquitous roles in\neveryday life, from those of familiar synthetic plastics\nand other materials of day-to-day work and home life, to the natural biopolymers\nthat are fundamental to biological structure and function.\n","linknr":676,"url":"Polymers","recorded":1362511581,"links":93,"instances":["chemistry","disambiguation","2dp","saxs","chemistry","genetics","sans","biology","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/141.%20Polymer.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/pbook/PurpleBook-C4.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/pbook/PurpleBook-C4.pdf","http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/img/assets/3900/Glossary.pdf"],"categories":["Polymers|"],"headings":["Common
