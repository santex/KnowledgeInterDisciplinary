Edinburgh University Press. p.241 ff.\n\nOne of his translators, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics (Oxford University),\nRoy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of\nlanguage in the following way:\n\n \"Language is no longer regarded as peripheral to our grasp of the\nworld we live in, but as central to it. Words are not mere vocal labels or\ncommunicational adjuncts superimposed upon an already given order of things.\nThey are collective products of social interaction, essential instruments\nthrough which human beings constitute and articulate their world. This typically\ntwentieth-century view of language has profoundly influenced developments\nthroughout the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in\nlinguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology\". Harris, R.\n1988. Language, Saussure and Wittgenstein. Routledge. pix. \n\nThe fundamental dimensions of linguistic organization introduced by Saussure are\nstill basic to many approaches to how the phenomenon of language can be\napproached, even though they have naturally been extended and refined\nconsiderably over time. Prague school linguist Jan MukaÅovskÃ½ wrote that\nSaussure's \"discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign\ndifferentiated the sign both from mere acoustic \"things\" ... and from mental\nprocesses\", and that in this development \"new roads were thereby opened not only\nfor linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of\nliterature. Mukarovsky, J. 1977. On Poetic Language. The Word and Verbal\nArt: Selected Essays by Jan Mukarovsky. Translated and edited by J. Burbank and\nPeter Steiner. p. 18. Ruqaiya Hasan argues that \"the impact of Saussureâs\ntheory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their\ntheories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-\nSaussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure\".
