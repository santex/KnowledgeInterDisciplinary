{"cursor":"3558","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Afzal Khan Khattak' was a Pashtun chief of the Khattak tribe, Pashtoon poet,\nand author of Tarikh-e-morassa was the eldest son of Ashraf Khan \"Hejri\" (1044-\n1105/1635 to 1693-94). In 1083/1672-73 Ashraf succeeded his father Khushal Khan\nin the chieftaincy of the Khattak tribe, but in 1092/1681 he was betrayed into\nthe hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb by his brother Bahram and died in\ncaptivity.\n\nAfzal Khan was arrested by the Mughals in 1098/1686-87 and carried to Kabul. He\nreturned two years after the death of Khoshal Khan (1100/1689) to assume the\nchieftainship of the Khattak tribe, which he held for sixty-one years. Based on\na reading of a tarikh in the divan of Afzal's son Kazem Khan Sayda, Sidiqullah\nRishtin and A. Habibi (Paxtane su 'ara, Kabul, 1941â42, I, pp. 229â30) gave\nthe date of Afzal's death as 1183/1769-70, but this divan had already been put\ninto final form in 1181. Thus the date of his death is uncertain.\n\nH. G. Raverty's statement (Selections from the Poetry of the Afghans, London,\n   1867, p. 269) that Afzal, upon the assumption of the chieftainship, put\n   his uncle (and rival) Abdul Qader to death does not bear examination; the\n   latter translated the Golestan of Sheikh Saadi in 1124/1712. Another uncle of\n   Afzal's; Gawhar Khan's writing in 1120/1708, gives testimony to Afzal's good\n   chieftainship and to his consuming literary interests, which were aimed at\n\nCollecting his illustrious grandfather's works and having them copied to save\nthem from oblivion, and Inspiring Gawhar Khan and other members of the family to\nuse their talents in translating into Pashto some of the great works in Persian\nand Arabic. Afzal himself made a number of translations chiefly historical when\nhe had ruled for twenty-five years and was fifty three years old; the Tarikh of\nA`tam Kufi, the Siar of Mullah Mo'in, and a tafsir of the Koran. He began a\ntranslation of the Iar-e danes; Abu'l-Fazl's simplified Persian version of the\nAnwar-e Sohayly by Hosayn Wa`ez Kashefi, which was completed in 1128/1716 under\nthe name 'Flmkana da Danes.\n\nAfzal Khan Khattak began writing his main work, the Tarikh-e morassa, about\n1120/1708. It is an uneven history of the Afghans in Pashto, compiled from\nvarious sources. The first and last parts are translations from the Persian work\nMakhzan-e Afgani (or Tarikh-e-Khan Jahani) written by Niamatullah in 1020/1611.\nThe second part (about half the volume) contains an account of the Yousafzai's\nand kindred tribes, based mainly upon the Tazkirat-ul Abrar by Akhund Darweza,\nthe Tabaqat-e-Akbari, the Jahangir-nama, and other Persian sources, and an\nextensive account of the history of the Khattaks, particularly of the author's\ngrandfather.\n\nIt includes long extracts from the bayaz (notebook) of Khushal Khan and relates\nevents up to the year 1136/1723-24. This part of the book was used by H. G.\nRaverty as source material for his Notes on Afghanistan (London, 1888). Afzal\nKhan Khattak is buried in Ziarat Kaka Saheb near Nowshera.\n\nBibliography\n\n{{Persondata\n| NAME = Khattak, Afzal Khan ALTERNATIVE NAMES = SHORT DESCRIPTION = DATE OF\n| BIRTH = PLACE OF
