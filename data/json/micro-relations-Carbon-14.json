Its presence in\norganic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by\nWillard Libby and colleagues (1949) to date archaeological, geological and\nhydrogeological samples. Carbon-14 was discovered on 27 February 1940, by Martin\nKamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in\nBerkeley, although its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in\n1934.\n\nThere are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth: 99% of the\ncarbon is carbon-12, 1% is carbon-13, and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts,\ni.e., making up about 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%) of the carbon in the\natmosphere. The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730Â±40 years. Carbon-14\ndecays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay. The primary natural\nsource of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the\natmosphere, and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide. However, open-air nuclear\ntesting between 1955â1980 contributed to this pool.\n\nThe different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical\nproperties. This is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique\ncalled carbon labeling: carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive\ncarbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon\natoms from any given organic compound.\n","linknr":356,"url":"Carbon-14","recorded":1362500091,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/carbon14.pdf","http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/carbon14.pdf","http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/7114972-2rlK4h/7114972.pdf","http://interactive.snm.org/docs/pg_ch07_0403.pdf","http://interactive.snm.org/docs/pg_ch07_0403.pdf"],"categories":["Isotopes of carbon","Environmental isotopes"],"headings":["Origin and radioactive decay","Other carbon-14 sources","Radiocarbon dating","Formation during nuclear tests","Occurrence","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Carbon_14_formation_and_decay.svg/220px-Carbon_14_formation_and_decay.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/f/04fe8a96285b14c56242be085fe1be8f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Radiocarbon_bomb_spike.svg/300px-Radiocarbon_bomb_spike.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Radioactive_isotope","Carbon","Atomic_nucleus","Protons","Neutrons","Radiocarbon_dating","Willard_Libby","Martin_Kamen","Sam_Ruben","University_of_California_Radiation_Laboratory","Berkeley,_California","Franz_N._D._Kurie","Isotope","Carbon-12","Carbon-13","Parts_per_notation","Half-life","Nitrogen-14","Beta_decay","Cosmogenic_nuclide","Carbon","Carbon_label","Troposphere","Stratosphere","Thermal_neutron","Nitrogen","Cosmic_ray","Neutron","Neutron","Geomagnetism","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon_dioxide","Ocean","Beta_decay","Electron","Antineutrino","Half-life","Nitrogen-14","Curie","Exa-","Becquerel","Global_carbon_budget","Supernova","Earth's_magnetic_field","Carbon_cycle","Carbon-13","Oxygen-17","Thermal_neutron","Nitrogen-15","Oxygen-16","Fast_neutron","Radiometric_dating","Carbonaceous","Willard_Libby","University_of_Chicago","Nobel_Prize_in_chemistry","Carbon_fixation","Dendrochronology","Speleothem","Austria","Nuclear_testing","List_of_nuclear_tests","Tooth_enamel","Fossil_fuel","Petroleum","Coal","Isotopic_signature","Borexino","Petroleum_reservoir","MSv","Equivalent_dose","Ionizing_radiation","Isotopes_of_potassium","Radon","Radioactive_tracer","Urea_breath_test","Urease","Ammonia","Carbon_dioxide","Isotopic_labeling","Radiocarbon_dating","Woods_Hole_Oceanographic_Institute","Carbon-13","Carbon-15","Boron-14","Nitrogen-18","Nitrogen-14"]}
