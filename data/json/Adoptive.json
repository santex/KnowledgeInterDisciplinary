{"cursor":"90046","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n of New York Foundling Hospital with children. Sister Irene is among the\n pioneers of modern adoption, establishing a system to board out children rather\n than institutionalize them.]]\n\n\n'Adoption' is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting for another and,\nin so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with\nfiliation, from the biological parent or parents. Unlike guardianship or other\nsystems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a\npermanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either\nthrough legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted\nspecific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption\nthrough less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance\nrights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of\nfiliation. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be\ngoverned by comprehensive statutes and regulations.\n\nAdoption has a long history in the Western world, closely tied with the legacy\nof the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. Its use has changed considerably\nover the centuries with its focus shifting from adult adoption and inheritance\nissues toward children and family creation; its structure moving from a\nrecognition of continuity between the adopted and kin toward allowing\nrelationships of lessened intensity.\n","linknr":1231,"url":"Adoptive","recorded":1362543934,"links":96,"instances":["access_and_custody","social_science","law","adoption"],"pdf":["http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/cws/aa07-08/aa07-08.pdf","http://www.adoptionboard.ie/booklets/adoption_report_nov_25.pdf","http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/s_adopted/s_adopted.pdf","http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/cooperativeall.pdf","http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/cooperativeall.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_027.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_027.pdf","http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/s_disrup.pdf","http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~accase/downloads/How_Hungry_Is_the_Selfish_Gene.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~accase/downloads/How_Hungry_Is_the_Selfish_Gene.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070221194844/http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/Feb07ASRAdoption.pdf","http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/Feb07ASRAdoption.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070221194844/http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/Feb07ASRAdoption.pdf","http://www.apa.org/journals/features/dev364429.pdf","http://www.cs.brown.edu/~jadrian/docs/papers/old/20030212%20Miles%20-%20Adoptive%20Identity.pdf","http://www.triadoption.com/Misc/AAC%201979%20Resolution.pdf","http://www.sacredhealing.com/triadoption/Misc./Origin%20of%20the%20Term%20Birthparent.pdf","http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/pdf/PositiveLanguage.pdf","http://www.jaffari.org/files/literature/Adoption%20in%20Islam.pdf"],"categories":["Adoption|","Family
