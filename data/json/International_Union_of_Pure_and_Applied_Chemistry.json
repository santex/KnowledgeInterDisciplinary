It is a member of the International Council\nfor Science (ICSU). The international headquarters of\nIUPAC is located in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. The administrative office, known as the\n\"IUPAC Secretariat\", is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,\nUnited States. This administrative office is headed by the IUPAC executive\ndirector. As of 1 August 2012, the Executive Director is Dr. John D.\nPetersen. http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/john-d-petersen-\nappointed-iupac-executive-director.html\n\nIUPAC was established in 1918 as the successor of the International Congress of\nApplied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry. Its members, the National\nAdhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies\nof sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four\nNational Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering\nOrganizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on\nNomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority\nin developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds.\nSince its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with\ndifferent responsibilities. [http://www.iupac.org/Organization/Committees IUPAC Committees list]\nretrieved 15 April 2010 These committees run different projects which\ninclude standardizing nomenclature, [http://www.iupac.org/web/ins/027 Interdivisional Committee on\nTerminology web page] retrieved 15 April 2010 finding ways to bring\nchemistry to the world, [http://www.iupac.org/news/archives/2007/44th_council/Item_12-\n2_2007.pdf Chemdrawn] retrieved 15 April 2010 and publishing works.

Some\nimportant work IUPAC has done in these fields includes standardizing nucleotide\nbase sequence code names; publishing books for environmental scientists,\nchemists, and physicists; and leading the way in improving education in\nscience.
