{"cursor":"20356","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Cytochrome complex', or 'cytc' is a small heme protein found loosely\nassociated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. It belongs to the\ncytochrome c family of proteins. Cytochrome c is a highly soluble protein,\nunlike other cytochromes, with a solubility of about 100 g/L and is an essential\ncomponent of the electron transport chain, where it carries one electron. It is\ncapable of undergoing oxidation and reduction, but does not bind oxygen. It\ntransfers electrons between Complexes III (Coenzyme Q - Cyt C reductase) and IV\n(Cyt C oxidase). In humans, cytochrome c is encoded by the CYCS gene.\n","linknr":616,"url":"Cytochrome_c","recorded":1362534895,"links":39,"instances":["anatomy","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/molb.ws.pdf"],"categories":["Cellular respiration","Cytochromes","Programmed cell death","Peripheral membrane proteins","Moonlighting proteins"],"headings":["Function","Species distribution","Classes","Applications","Interactions","Extramitochondrial localization","See also","References","Further reading","Additional images","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Cytochrome_C.png/250px-Cytochrome_C.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/PBB_GE_CYCS_208905_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_CYCS_208905_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Signal_transduction_pathways.svg/500px-Signal_transduction_pathways.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Etc2.svg/120px-Etc2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/PDB_1j3s_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1j3s_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/PDB_2b4z_EBI.png/180px-PDB_2b4z_EBI.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dalton","unit"],["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["lumen","dalton"],"related":["Heme","Protein","Mitochondrion","Cytochrome_c_family","Cytochrome","Electron_transport_chain","Oxidation","Redox","Oxygen","Coenzyme_Q_-_cytochrome_c_reductase","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Gene","Electron_transport_chain","Heme","Apoptosis","Hydroxylation","Aromatic","Oxidation","Peroxidase","ABTS","Dalton_(unit)","Cladistics","Amino_acid","Low-level_laser_therapy","Protein-protein_interaction","COX4I2","Apoptosis","Calcium","Inositol_triphosphate_receptor","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Caspase_9","Protease","Caspase_3","Caspase_7","Caspase","Proteases","Anterior_pituitary","Zymogen","Growth_hormone","Vacuoles","Lumen_(anatomy)","PEGylation","The_Proteolysis_Map"]}
