Listed at 5' 10\", 175 lbs., he\n  batted and threw right-handed.\n\nChristopher is credited as the first baseball player from the Virgin Islands to\nappear in a major league game. He reached the majors in 1959 with the Pittsburgh\nPirates, spending three years with them before moving to the New York Mets\n(1962â65) and Boston Red Sox (1966).\n\nWhile in Pittsburgh, Christopher was used as a backup in all three outfield\npositions for Bob Skinner (LF), Bill Virdon (CF) and Roberto Clemente (RF). He\nwas first called up when Clemente was injured, making his debut in nothing less\nthan Harvey Haddixâs pitching masterpiece of 12 perfect innings on May 26, 1959.\nAs a member of the 1960 World Series Champion Pirates, he was a utility player,\npinch-running in three games and scoring two runs (games 2 and 5).\n\nChristopher became the Metsâ fifth pick in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft. In 1964\nhe enjoyed easily his finest season as a major-leaguer, hitting .300 with 16\nhome runs, 76 RBI, 78 runs, 163 hits, 26 doubles, and eight triples in 154\ngames, all career-highs. He had a career-best day on August 19, collecting two\ntriples, a double, and a home run in an 8â6 victory over his former Pirates\nteammates. Then, on September 25 he broke up the no-hit bid of Cincinnati Reds\npitcher Jim Maloney at Shea Stadium. His second-inning single was the only hit\nagainst Maloney, who had to settle for a 3â0 shutout.\n\nChristopher played briefly in 1966 for the Red Sox and was dealt with pitcher\nEarl Wilson to the Detroit Tigers, who sent Julio Navarro as part of the\npackage. Although Christopherâs major league career had come to an end on\nJune 9, 1966 (he never played for Detroit), he stayed active in the minors\nthrough 1968. He also played winter baseball in Dominican Republic, Mexico\nand Puerto Rico.\n\nIn an eight-season career, Christopher was a .260 hitter with 29 home runs and\n173 RBI in 638 games, including one five-hit game and eight four-hit games.\nSince retiring, his consuming passion has been his art. He devotes himself to\ndrawing (in a Pre-Columbian style), from which he gains patience and\nconcentration.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Joe_Christopher","recorded":1375076666,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joe_Christopher&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Christopher&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/Frederiksted,_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Fielding_percentage","/wiki/Putout","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/1959_in_baseball","/wiki/1961_in_baseball","/wiki/New_York_Mets","/wiki/1962_in_baseball","/wiki/1965_in_baseball","/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox","/wiki/1966_in_baseball","/wiki/1960_World_Series","/wiki/Frederiksted,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/1959_in_baseball","/wiki/1966_in_baseball","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/New_York_Mets","/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox","/wiki/Bob_Skinner","/wiki/Left_fielder","/wiki/Bill_Virdon","/wiki/Center_fielder","/wiki/Roberto_Clemente","/wiki/Right_fielder","/wiki/Harvey_Haddix","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Harvey_Haddix#Near_perfect_game","/wiki/1960_World_Series","/wiki/Pinch-runner","/wiki/1961_MLB_Expansion_Draft","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Games_played","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Jim_Maloney","/wiki/Shea_Stadium","/wiki/Single_(baseball)","/wiki/Shutout","/wiki/Earl_Wilson_(pitcher)","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Julio_Navarro","/wiki/Dominican_Republic","/wiki/Mexico","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","/wiki/Drawing","/wiki/Pre-Columbian","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Christopher&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_players_from_Virgin_Islands_in_Major_League_Baseball","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Christopher&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/chrisjo01.shtml","http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1002213","http://www.thebaseballcube.com/profile.asp?P=joe-christopher","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=c/chrisjo01","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/C/Christopher_Joe.stm","http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Joe_Christopher","http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pchrij101.htm","http://www.readingphillies.com/alumni_pheatures.htm","http://members.aol.com/vibaseball/christopher.html","/wiki/Template:1960_Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/Template_talk:1960_Pittsburgh_Pirates","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1960_Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates","/wiki/1960_World_Series","/wiki/Bob_Oldis","/wiki/Bob_Skinner","/wiki/Hal_Smith_(infielder)","/wiki/Smoky_Burgess","/wiki/Dick_Stuart","/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski","/wiki/Ducky_Schofield","/wiki/Don_Hoak","/wiki/Rocky_Nelson","/wiki/Gene_Baker","/wiki/Bill_Virdon","/wiki/Bob_Friend","/wiki/Gino_Cimoli","/wiki/Roberto_Clemente","/wiki/Joe_Gibbon","/wiki/Dick_Groat","/wiki/Roy_Face","/wiki/Clem_Labine","/wiki/Wilmer_Mizell","/wiki/Harvey_Haddix","/wiki/Vern_Law","/wiki/Fred_Green_(baseball)","/wiki/George_Witt","/wiki/Tom_Cheney_(baseball)","/wiki/Danny_Murtaugh","/wiki/Bill_Burwell","/wiki/Mickey_Vernon","/wiki/Sam_Narron_(catcher)","/wiki/Frank_Oceak","/wiki/Lenny_Levy","/wiki/Virgil_Trucks","/wiki/1960_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Frederiksted,_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Christopher&oldid=554996026","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1935_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:United_States_Virgin_Islands_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_outfielders","/wiki/Category:Pittsburgh_Pirates_players","/wiki/Category:New_York_Mets_players","/wiki/Category:Boston_Red_Sox_players","/wiki/Category:Syracuse_Chiefs_players","/wiki/Category:Richmond_Braves_players","/wiki/Category:African-American_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_players_from_the_United_States_Virgin_Islands","/wiki/Category:People_from_Saint_Croix,_U.S._Virgin_Islands","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joe+Christopher&type=sig
