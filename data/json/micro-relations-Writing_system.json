These characters, often including letters and numbers, are usually\nrecorded onto a durable medium such as paper or electronic storage/display,\nalthough non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing in sand or\nskywriting.\n\nThe general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories\nsuch as alphabets, syllabaries, or logographies. Any particular system can have\nattributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a\nstandard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) of consonants and\nvowels that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter\npair/groups) represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken\nlanguage. A syllabary typically correlates a symbol to a syllable (which can be\na pairing or group of phonemes, and are considered the building blocks of\nwords). In a logography, each character represents a word, morpheme or semantic\nunit (which themselves can be pairings or groups of syllables). Other\ncategories include abjads (which is an alphabet where vowels are not indicated\nat all) and abugidas, also called alphasyllabaries (where vowels are shown by\ndiacritics or other modification of consonants). A system's category can often\nbe determined just by identifying the number of symbols used within the system.\nAlphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language,\nwhereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100, and logographies can have several\nhundreds of symbols.\n\nMost systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that\ngroups of them can be coded into larger clusters like words or acronyms\n(generally lexemes), giving rise to many more possibilities (permutations) in\nmeanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the\nconcatenation (a \"stringing together\") of these smaller groupings (sometimes\nreferred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full\nexpression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished by the reader\npurely in the mind as an internal process, or expressed verbally (typically,\n'reading aloud'). Historically, writing systems have developed after a spoken\nlanguage has been established, although the individual symbols used (typically\nan ideogram) may have preceded the spoken word. A special set of symbols known\nas punctuation is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing\nsystems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's\nmeaning that are communicated verbally by cues in timing, tone, accent,\ninflection or intonation.\n\nA writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded\nmessages that follows the spoken version's rules like its grammar and syntax so\nthat the reader will have the meaning of the intended message accurately\npreserved. Writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, which used\npictograms, ideograms and other mnemonic symbols. Proto-writing lacked the\nability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention\nof writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the Bronze Age in the\nlate Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BCE, enabled the accurate durable\nrecording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of\nerror to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, it provided a reliable\nform of long distance communication. And with the advent of publishing, it\nprovided the medium for an early form of mass communication. Secure written\ncommunications were also made more reliable with the invention of encryption.\n","linknr":1235,"url":"Writing_system","recorded":1362897697,"links":114,"instances":["information_theory","printing","linguistics","script","linguistic","linguistics","linguistics","letter","communication","communication","semiotics","game","computing","linguistics","alphabet","letter","phonetics","process","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/idsl/dozenten/primus/publikationen/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf","http://www.ijpam.eu/contents/2010-61-3/9/9.pdf"],"categories":["Writing","Writing
