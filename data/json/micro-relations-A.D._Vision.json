Vision' (commonly referred to as 'ADV') was an American international\nmultimedia entertainment company headquartered in Houston, Texas, prior to its\ncollapse and distress sale to four other Houston-based companies in 2009. The\ncompany was active in home video production and distribution, broadcast\ntelevision, theatrical film distribution, merchandising, original productions,\nmagazine and comic book publishing. It was the largest anime distributor in\nNorth America and the United Kingdom before its demise.\n\nIt was founded in 1992 by John Ledford and Matt Greenfield. Since then, the\ncompany had grown immensely in size and diversified with several subsidiary\ncompanies, handling an array of properties and original content. Perhaps their\nmost popular property was Gainax's post-apocalyptic anime series [[Neon Genesis\nEvangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]], originally\nreleased by ADV in the U.S. in 1997 and re-released several times since. The\ncompany maintained offices in North America, Europe and Asia. It served the\nUnited States, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. On September 1, 2009, ADV announced it was selling\noff its assets, including intellectual properties, to several companies.\n","linknr":511,"url":"A.D._Vision","recorded":1362891145,"links":38,"instances":["filmmaking","video_format","filmmaking"],"pdf":["http://www.dentsu.com/news/2007/pdf/2007064-0921.pdf","http://www.dentsu.com/news/2007/pdf/2007064-0921.pdf"],"categories":["Defunct media companies of the United States","Anime companies","Companies based in Houston, Texas","Companies established in 1992","Companies disestablished in 2009","Dubbing (filmmaking)","Entertainment companies of the United States","Video production companies","A.D.
