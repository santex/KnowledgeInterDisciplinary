Each set of contacts can be in one of two states: either \"closed\"\nmeaning the contacts are touching and electricity can flow between them, or\n\"open\", meaning the contacts are separated and the switch is nonconducting. The\nmechanism actuating the transition between these two states (open or closed) can\nbe either a \"toggle\" (flip switch for continuous \"on\" or \"off\") or \"momentary\"\n(push-for \"on\" or push-for \"off\") type.\n\nA switch may be directly manipulated by a human as a control signal to a system,\nsuch as a computer keyboard button, or to control power flow in a circuit, such\nas a light switch. Automatically operated switches can be used to control the\nmotions of machines, for example, to indicate that a garage door has reached its\nfull open position or that a machine tool is in a position to accept another\nworkpiece. Switches may be operated by process variables such as pressure,\ntemperature, flow, current, voltage, and force, acting as sensors in a process\nand used to automatically control a system. For example, a thermostat is a temperature-\noperated switch used to control a heating process. A switch that is operated by\nanother electrical circuit is called a relay. Large switches may be remotely\noperated by a motor drive mechanism. Some switches are used to isolate electric\npower from a system, providing a visible point of isolation that can be\npadlocked if necessary to prevent accidental operation of a machine during\nmaintenance, or to prevent electric shock.\n\nAn ideal switch would have no voltage drop when closed, and would have no limits\non voltage or current rating. It would have zero rise time and fall time during\nstate changes, and would change state without \"bouncing\" between on and off\npositions.\n\nPractical switches fall short of this ideal; they have resistance, limits on the\ncurrent and voltage they can handle, finite switching time, etc. The ideal\nswitch is often used in circuit analysis as it greatly simplifies the system of\nequations to be solved, however this can lead to a less accurate solution.\nTheoretical treatment of the effects of non-ideal properties is required in the\ndesign of large networks of switches, as for example used in telephone\nexchanges.\n","title":"switch","headings":["Contacts","Actuator","Special types","Light switches","Electronic switches","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Relay","2: Reed_switch","2: Electric_current","2: Light_switch","2: Electric_arc","2: Electromagnetic_interference","2: Inductance","2: Switchgear","2: Limit_switch","2: Multiway_switching","2: Touch_switch","1: DIP&nbsp;switch","1: Electrical_engineering","1: Electrical_component","1: Electrical_circuit","1: Electromechanical","1: Electrical_contacts","1: Sensor","1: Thermostat","1: Rise_time","1: Fall_time","1: Metal","1: Electric_circuit","1: Corrosion","1: Electrical_insulation","1: Oxide","1: Electrical_conductivity","1: Wear#Abrasive_wear","1: Strength_of_materials","1: Toxicity","1: Electroplating","1: Noble_metals","1: Design","1: Electrical_conductor","1: Plastic","1: Wetting_current","1: Dynamic_braking","1: Herley_Industries","1: Electronics","1: Mains","1: Electrician","1: British_English","1: American_English","1: Elektronika_BK","1: Analogue_electronics","1: Logic_circuit","1: Mercury-wetted_relay","1: Low-pass_filter","1: Ionize","1: Gas_plasma","1: Contact_protection#Contact_wear","1: Arc_suppression","1: Breakdown_voltage","1: Convection","1: Mineral_oil","1: Sulfur_hexafluoride#Dielectric_medium","1: Laser_pointer","1: Flashlight","1: Electric_motor","1: Snubber","1: Resistor","1: Capacitor","1: Incandescent_light_bulb","1: Inrush_current","1: Oxidation","1: Humidity","1: Control_engineering","1: Contact_pressure","1: Push-button","1: Electromagnet","1: Refrigerator","1: Radio_control","1: Electrical_switch","1: Lever","1: Electrical_contact","1: Mains_electricity","1: Minicomputer","1: Float_switch","1: Key_switch","1: Microswitch","1: Sail_switch","1: Pressure_switch","1: Glass","1: Liquid_metal","1: Copper","1: Steel","1: Brass","1: Electric_guitar","1: Wireless_light_switch","1: Vandal_resistant_switch","1: Silicon-controlled_rectifier","1: Triac","1: Analogue_switch","1: Transmission_gate","1: Switching_voltage_regulator","1: Metonymy","1: Strowger_switch","1: Crossbar_switch","1: Digital_logic","1: Active_device","1: Transistor","1: Logic_gate","1: Logic_level","1: Digital_signal","1: Network_switch","1: Computer_network","1: Telecommunications_network","1: Circuit_switched","1: Public_switched_telephone_network","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Centrifugal_switch","1: Dead_man's_switch","1: Fireman's_switch","1: Hall-effect_switch","1: Inertial_switch","1: Isolator_switch","1: Kill_switch","1: Latching_switch","1: Load_control_switch","1: Membrane_switch","1: Piezo_switch","1: Pull_switch","1: Push_switch","1: RF_Switch_Matrix","1: Sense_switch","1: Slotted_optical_switch","1: Stepping_switch","1: Switch_access","1: Switchboard","1: Thermal_switch","1: Time_switch","1: Transfer_switch"]}
