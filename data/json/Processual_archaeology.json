{"cursor":"15652","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Processual archaeology' (formerly the 'New Archaeology') is a form of\narchaeological theory that had its genesis in 1958 with Willey and Phillips'\nwork Method and Theory in American Archeology, in which the pair stated that\n\"American archaeology is anthropology or it is nothing\" (Willey and Phillips,\n1958:2), a rephrasing of Frederic William Maitland's comment that \"[m]y own\nbelief is that by and by, anthropology will have the choice between being\nhistory and being nothing.\" This idea implied that the goals of\narchaeology were, in fact, the goals of anthropology, which were to answer\nquestions about humans and human society. This was a critique of the former\nperiod in archaeology, the Culture-Historical phase in which archaeologists\nthought that any information which artifacts contained about past people and\npast ways of life was lost once the items became included in the archaeological\nrecord. All they felt could be done was to catalogue, describe, and create\ntimelines based on the artifacts. Trigger, 1989:148\n\nProponents of this new phase in archaeology claimed that with the rigorous use\nof the scientific method it was possible to get past the limits of the\narchaeological record and learn something about how the people who used the\nartifacts lived. Colin Renfrew, a proponent of the new processual archaeology,\nobserved in 1987 that it focuses attention on \"the underlying historical\nprocesses which are at the root of change\". Archaeology, he noted \"has learnt to\nspeak with greater authority and accuracy about the ecology of past societies,\ntheir technology, their economic basis and their social organization. Now it is\nbeginning to interest itself in the ideology of early communities: their\nreligions, the way they expressed rank, status and group identity.\" Colin\nRenfrew, Archaeology and Language: the puzzle of Indo-European origins 1987:6,\nand \"6.
