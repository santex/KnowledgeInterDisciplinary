{"cursor":"11267","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'head-related transfer function' (HRTF) is a response that characterizes how\nan ear receives a sound from a point in space; a pair of HRTFs for two ears can\nbe used to synthesize a binaural sound that seems to come from a particular\npoint in space. It is a transfer function, describing how a sound from a\nspecific point will arrive at the ear (generally at the outer end of the\nauditory canal). Some consumer home entertainment products designed to reproduce\nsurround sound from stereo (two-speaker) headphones use HRTFs. Some forms of HRTF-\nprocessing have also been included in computer software to simulate surround\nsound playback from loudspeakers.\n\nHumans have just two ears, but can locate sounds in three dimensions â in range\n(distance), in direction above and below, in front and to the rear, as well as\nto either side. This is possible because the brain, inner ear and the external\nears (pinna) work together to make inferences about location. This ability to\nlocalize sound sources may have developed in humans as an evolutionary\nnecessity, since the eyes can only see a fraction of the world around a viewer,\nand vision is hampered in darkness, while the ability to localize a sound source\nworks in all directions, to varying accuracy, {{cite book\n | title = Perimetry of the localization of sound author = Daniel Starch\n | publisher = State University of Iowa year = 1908 page = 35 ff url =\n | http://books.google.com/books?id=ClRVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA35\n }} regardless of the surrounding light.\n\nHumans estimate the location of a source by taking cues derived from one ear\n(monaural cues), and by comparing cues received at both ears (difference cues or\nbinaural cues). Among the difference cues are time differences of arrival and\nintensity differences. The monaural cues come from the interaction between the\nsound source and the human anatomy, in which the original source sound is\nmodified before it enters the ear canal for processing by the auditory system.\nThese modifications encode the source location, and may be captured via an\nimpulse response which relates the source location and the ear location. This\nimpulse response is termed the head-related impulse response (HRIR). Convolution\nof an arbitrary source sound with the HRIR converts the sound to that which\nwould have been heard by the listener if it had been played at the source\nlocation, with the listener's ear at the receiver location. HRIRs have been used\nto produce virtual surround sound. Begault, D.R. (1994) 3D sound for virtual\nreality and multimedia. AP Professional. So, R.H.Y., Leung, N.M.,\nBraasch, J. and Leung, K.L.(2006) A low cost, Non-individualized surround sound\nsystem based upon head-related transfer functions. An Ergonomics study and\nprototype development. Applied Ergonomics, 37, pp.695-707.\n\nThe HRTF is the Fourier transform of HRIR. The HRTF is also sometimes known as\nthe anatomical transfer function (ATF).\n\nHRTFs for left and right ear (expressed above as HRIRs) describe the filtering\nof a sound source (x(t)) before it is perceived at the left and right ears as\nx L(t) and x R(t), respectively.\n\nThe HRTF can also be described as the modifications to a sound from a direction\nin free air to the sound as it arrives at the eardrum. These modifications\ninclude the shape of the listener's outer ear, the shape of the listener's head\nand body, the acoustical characteristics of the space in which the sound is\nplayed, and so on. All these characteristics will influence how (or whether) a\nlistener can accurately tell what direction a sound is coming from.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Anatomical_transfer_function","recorded":1374520606,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Anatomical_transfer_function&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Lead_section","/wiki/Ear","/wiki/Sound_localization","/wiki/Transfer_function","/wiki/Auditory_canal","/wiki/Ear","/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Impulse_response","/wiki/Convolution","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Fourier_transform","/wiki/Sound","/wiki/Eardrum","#How_HRTF_works","#Technical_derivation","#Recording_technology","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Human_head","/wiki/Diffraction","/wiki/Reflection_(physics)","/wiki/Human_head","/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)","/wiki/Torso","/wiki/Transduction_(physiology)","/wiki/Auditory_system","/wiki/Sound_localization","/wiki/Elevation","/wiki/Vertical_sound_localization","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Transfer_function","/wiki/Eardrum","/wiki/Ear","/wiki/Time-invariant_system","/wiki/Fourier_transform","/wiki/Frequency","/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system","/wiki/Far_field","/wiki/Anechoic_chamber","/wiki/Reverberation","/wiki/Interpolation","/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio","/wiki/Frequency_domain","/wiki/Sine","/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence","/wiki/Vertical_sound_localization#The_Cone_of_Confusion","/wiki/Sound_localization#ITD_and_ILD","/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/A3D","/wiki/Environmental_audio_extensions","/wiki/OpenAL","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/A3D","/wiki/Binaural_recording","/wiki/Dummy_head_recording","/wiki/Environmental_audio_extensions","/wiki/OpenAL","/wiki/Sound_Retrieval_System","/wiki/Sound_localization","/wiki/Soundbar","/wiki/Sensaura","/wiki/Transfer_function","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Daniel_Starch","http://books.google.com/books?id=ClRVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA35","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/~johnvo/papers/nn98.pdf","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F1633","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10196533","#cite_ref-6","/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&action=edit&section=6","http://interface.idav.ucdavis.edu/sound/tutorial/","http://interface.cipic.ucdavis.edu/sound/hrtf.html","http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/index.html","http://www.ind.rwth-aachen.de/air/","http://www.audiogroup.web.fh-koeln.de","http://sound.media.mit.edu/resources/KEMAR.html","http://www.kfs.oeaw.ac.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=608:ari-hrtf-database&catid=158:resources-items&Itemid=606&lang=en","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Head-related_transfer_function&oldid=558022138","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Acoustics","/wiki/Category:Electrical_circuits","/wiki/Category:Signal_processing","/wiki/Category:Control_theory","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_context_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_Wikipedia_articles_needing_context","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_introduction_cleanup_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2008","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Head-related+transfer+function&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Head-related+transfer+function","/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function","/wiki/Talk:Head-r
