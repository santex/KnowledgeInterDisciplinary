{"cursor":"18781","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n drainage basin, Romania. ]] A 'drainage basin' is an extent or an area of land\n where surface water from rain and melting snow or ice converges to a single\n point, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another waterbody,\n such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean.\n\nOther terms that are used to describe a drainage basin are 'catchment',\n'catchment area', 'catchment basin', 'drainage area', 'river basin' and\n'water basin'. In North America, the term 'watershed' is commonly\nused to mean a drainage basin (though in other English-speaking countries, it\nis used only in its original sense, to mean a drainage divide {{cite web\n|author= |year= |url=http://www.watershed.org/?q=node/187 |title=Recommended\nWatershed Terminology |publisher=watershed.org |accessdate=2011-08-26 }}\n). Drainage basins drain into other drainage basins in a hierarchical\npattern, with smaller 'sub-drainage basins' combining into larger drainage\nbasins. {{cite web |author= |year=\n|url=http://www.wr.udel.edu/cb/whatwhycare.html |title=What is a watershed\nand why should I care? |publisher=university of delaware |accessdate=2008-02-\n11 }}\n\nIn closed drainage basins the water converges to a single point inside the\nbasin, known as a sink, which may be a permanent lake, dry lake, or a point\nwhere surface water is lost underground. The drainage\nbasin includes both the streams and rivers that convey the water as well as the\nland surfaces from which water drains into those channels, and is separated from\nadjacent basins by a drainage divide. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html\n|title=drainage basin |publisher=www.uwsp.edu |accessdate=2008-02-21 |last=\n|first= }} \n\nThe drainage basin acts as a funnel by collecting all the water within the area\ncovered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each drainage basin\nis separated topographically from adjacent basins by a geographical barrier such\nas a ridge, hill or mountain.\n\nDrainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units, which are\ndrainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage\nsystem. Hydrologic units are designed to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or\nsinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all\nhydrologic units are drainage basins.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency launched the website Watershed\nCentral for the US public to exchange information and locate resources needed to\nrestore local drainage basins in that country.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Drainage_basin","recorded":1362371962,"links":77,"instances":["canada","ecology","geomorphology","meteorology","oceanography","geography"],"pdf":["http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf","http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf"],"categories":["Drainage
