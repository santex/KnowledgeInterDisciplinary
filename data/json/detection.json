The term is still in use today to describe a\ncomponent that extracts a particular signal from all of the electromagnetic\nwaves present. Detection is usually based on the frequency of the carrier wave,\nas in the familiar frequencies of radio broadcasting, but it may also involve\nfiltering a faint signal from noise, as in radio astronomy, or reconstructing a\nhidden signal, as in steganography.\n\nIn optoelectronics, \"detection\" means converting a received optical input to a\nelectrical output. For example, the light signal received through an optical\nfiber is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a photodiode.\n\nIn steganography, attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier\nmaterial is referred to as steganalysis. Steganalysis has an interesting\ndifference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only\ndetermine the probability that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to\nthe detection of signals which are simply encrypted, as the ciphertext can often\nbe identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded.\n\nIn the military, detection refers to the special discipline of reconnaissance\nwith the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance.\n\nFinally, the art of detection, also known as following clues, is the work of a\ndetective[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://ca.geocities.com/t369%40r-\nogers.com/index.html&date=2009-10-25+03:06:49 ] in attempting to reconstruct a\nsequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.\n","title":"detection","headings":["See also"]},"micro-relation":["2: Steganography","1: Radio","1: Morse_code","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Frequency","1: Carrier_wave","1: Radio_broadcasting","1: Noise","1: Radio_astronomy","1: Optoelectronics","1: Optical_fiber","1: Photodiode","1: Steganalysis","1: Probability","1: Encryption","1: Ciphertext","1: Military","1: Reconnaissance","1: Art_of_detection","1: Detective","1: Signal_detection_theory"]}
