{"cursor":"4073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Model Parliament' is the term, attributed to Frederic William Maitland,\nused for the 1295 Parliament of England of King Edward I.\n\nThis assembly included members of the clergy and the aristocracy, as well as\nrepresentatives from the various counties and boroughs. Each county returned two\nknights, two burgesses were elected from each borough, and each city provided\ntwo citizens. This composition became the model for later parliaments, hence the\nname. Powicke, Maurice, Medieval England: 1066-1485, pp. 96-97\n(London: Oxford University Press paperback edition 1969).\n\nA similar scheme had been used in summoning De Montfort's Parliament in 1265.\nThat Parliament, however, had been called by Simon de Montfort in the midst of\nthe Second Barons' War against Henry III of England; that the same scheme should\nbe adopted by a king (Henry's son and heir, who had quelled Montfort's uprising)\nwas remarkable.\n\nEdward I summoned the parliament on 13 November 1295. In calling the parliament,\nEdward proclaimed in his writ of summons, \"what touches all, should be approved\nof all, and it is also clear that common dangers should be met by measures\nagreed upon in common.\" \"Edward I,\" EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (1911). At\nthe time, Parliament's legislative authority was limited and its primary role\nwas to levy taxes. Edward's paramount goal in summoning the parliament was to\nraise funds for his wars, specifically planned campaigns against the French and\nthe Scots for the upcoming year, and countering an insurgency in Wales. This\n\"sound finance\" by taxation was a goal of summoning the parliament, but it was\ntied into \"counsel\" to the king and \"the element of service\" for feudalism.\n\nHowever, the resulting parliament became a model for a new function as well, the\naddressing of grievances with the king. \"The elected members were far more\nanxious to establish the second function: to discuss grievances. A kind of quid\npro quo was looked for: money for the Scottish campaign of 1296 would be\nforthcoming if certain grievances were addressed. This consciousness was\ngrowing, even if all was still in an embryonic state.\" Michael L. Nash,\n\"Crown, Woolsack and Mace: the model Parliament of 1295.\" Contemporary Review,\nNovember 1995. The concept of \"Parliament\" was, in fact, such that the\ndivision into House of Commons and House of Lords had not yet taken place; the\nModel Parliament was unicameral, summoning 49 lords to sit with 292\nrepresentatives of the Commons. Nash mentions these figures in discussing\nseparate houses, but the Parliament website\n[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g03.pdf] indicates that the Commons\ndid not deliberate apart until 1341. This article accepts the Parliament's\nversion.\n\nThe Model Parliament created a precedent, whereby each \"successor of a baron\"\n(which includes Lords spirirtual) who received a writ to the parliament of 1295\n\"had a legal right to receive a writ.\" However, that strictly\nhereditary right was not recognized formally until 1387.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Model_Parliament","recorded":1375081206,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Model_parliament","/wiki/Frederic_William_Maitland","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Historic_counties_of_England","/wiki/Borough","/wiki/Knights_of_the_Shire","/wiki/Burgess_(title)","#cite_note-Powicke-1","/wiki/De_Montfort%27s_Parliament","/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester","/wiki/Second_Barons%27_War","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","#cite_note-2","/wiki/France","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Feudalism","#cite_note-Powicke-1","/wiki/Quid_pro_quo","#cite_note-3","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Unicameralism","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Precedent","#cite_note-Powicke-1","#cite_note-Powicke-1","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Provisions_of_Oxford","/wiki/Provisions_of_Westminster","/wiki/List_of_Parliaments_of_England","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Powicke_1-0","#cite_ref-Powicke_1-1","#cite_ref-Powicke_1-2","#cite_ref-Powicke_1-3","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/g03.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit&section=3","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf","http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_n1558_v267/ai_18038959","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&oldid=565379408","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1295_in_England","/wiki/Category:1295_establishments_in_England","/wiki/Category:13th-century_English_parliaments","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_December_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Model+Parliament&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Model+Parliament","/wiki/Model_Parliament","/wiki/Talk:Model_Parliament","#","/wiki/Model_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Model_Parliament","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Model_Parliament","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&oldid=565379408","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1026910","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Model_Parliament&id=565379408","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Model+Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Model+Parliament&oldid=565379408&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Model_Parliament&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlamento_modelo","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlement_mod%C3%A8le","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A8%A1%E8%8C%83%E8%AE%AE%E4%BC%9A_(%E8%8B%B1%E5%9B%BD%E5%8E%86%E5%8F%B2)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1026910#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Parliament","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediaw
