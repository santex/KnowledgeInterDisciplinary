{"cursor":"5798","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Overdrafting' is the process of extracting groundwater beyond the safe yield or\nequilibrium yield of the aquifer.\n\nSince every groundwater basin recharges at a different rate depending upon\nprecipitation, vegetative cover and soil conservation practises, the quantity of\ngroundwater that can be safely pumped varies greatly among regions of the world\nand even within provinces. Some aquifers require a very long time to recharge\nand thus the process of overdrafting can have consequences of effectively drying\nup certain sub-surface water supplies.\n\n\nAquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a\ncontributing factor to sea-level rise.\n\nGroundwater extractions are a popular means of supplying water to communities\nand agricultural producers. Since water is a necessity to survival for all\nliving things, communities and agricultural producers are using various ways to\nmeet their water demands and groundwater extractions are one way this is being\naccomplished. Proper conservation of water needs to be used to keep the balance\nof water supply and demand in equilibrium. The only economical way to extract\nground water is by drilling water wells. Currently there are approximately\n128,000 registered water wells in the state of Texas. A registered well is one\nthat is monitored and follows certain restrictions enforced by the water\ndistrict. However, there have been approximately 1,000,000 water wells drilled\nover the past 100 years (par. 2). If this rate continues in the future, the\ndemand will be greater than the supply and the water tables and aquifers will\nbecome lower or even depleted. There are seven major aquifers and sixteen minor\naquifers in the state of Texas. These aquifers are located under 75% of the\nstate (par. 1). Many natural springs and creeks have lost their water source\nbecause groundwater extractions have reduced the amount of underground water\nsupply. If these extractions had not occurred, many springs and creeks would be\nflowing today. As the water table drops it becomes more expensive. You must\ndrill deeper to reach the amount of water required to suit your needs. When the\ncost of drilling is by the foot, a couple of feet can add up fast and become\nexpensive. The pump also has to push the water to ground level. For every gallon\nof water in the pipe, there is over 8 pounds of pressure placed on the pump.\nThis means that the pump in the well will need to be able to produce extra\nhorsepower, which will result in a larger pump (par. 5). Therefore, extracting\nthe water from the aquifer will require additional electricity. Each mounted\nsystem is made with many different thing put into it, as in, automatic controls,\nbackwashing features, switches, gauges and sample ports, and also functioning\npackaged units. Instructions are always provided on a control panel to\ncritically measure operating numerical factors forming one of a set that defines\na system or sets the conditions of its operation. Prior to the design or\ninstillation of a ground water extraction and treatment system it is required to\ndetermine the necessary actions to follow. Whether it is clean up or containment\nis the remedial action is determined at the beginning of this process. If clean-\nup is chosen the objectives are determined. If containment is chosen the ground\nwater extraction is used to establish a hydraulic barrier to prevent continued\nmigration or containment plumes.\n\nWorks Citied Groundwater Extraction and Treament.
