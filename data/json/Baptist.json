{"cursor":"47821","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Baptists' are Christians who comprise a group of denominations and churches\nthat subscribe to a doctrine that baptism should be performed only for\nprofessing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and\nthat it must be done by immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other\ntenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through\nfaith alone, scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy\nof the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors\nand deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches,\nthough some Baptists disavow this identity. Buescher,\nJohn. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/22329 Baptist\nOrigins].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Retrieved 23\nSeptember 2011.\n\nDiverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today differ widely\nfrom one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward\nother Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian\ndiscipleship.\n\nHistorians trace the earliest church labeled \"Baptist\" back to 1609 in\nAmsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of\ninfants and instituted baptism only of believing adults.\nBaptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered\nChrist's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists\nbelieved that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, Roger Williams established\nthe first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th\ncentury, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England\nand the South. \"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52364/Baptist\nBaptist].\" 2010. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. The Second Great\nAwakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as\ndid the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of\nslavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings. Baptist missionaries\nhave spread their church to every continent.\n\nThe Baptist World Alliance reports more than 41 million members in more\nthan 150,000 congregations. In 2002, there were over 100 million\nBaptists and Baptistic group members worldwide and over 33 million in North\nAmerica. The largest Baptist association is the\nSouthern Baptist Convention, with the membership of associated churches totaling\nmore than 16 million.\n","linknr":1203,"url":"Baptist","recorded":1362669235,"links":98,"instances":["christianity","christian","clergyman","baptist_minister","theologian","baptist_minister"],"pdf":["http://www.dbts.edu/pdf/macp/2007/Priest,%20Are%20Baptists%20Protestants.pdf","http://www.dbts.edu/pdf/macp/2007/Priest,%20Are%20Baptists%20Protestants.pdf","http://www.trinitybaptistreformed.org/files/Download/Bible%20Translations%20+.pdf","http://www.trinitybaptistreformed.org/files/Download/Bible%20Translations%20+.pdf","http://www.baptistdistinctives.org/crises.pdf","http://www.baptistdistinctives.org/crises.pdf"],"categories":["Baptist","Protestantism","Christian
