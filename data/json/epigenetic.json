      "text" : "\nIn biology, and specifically genetics, 'epigenetics' is the study of changes in\ngene expression or cellular phenotype, caused by mechanisms other than changes\nin the underlying DNA sequence&nbsp;– hence the name epi- (Greek: επί- over,\nabove, outer) -[[genetics]], some of which have been argued to be\nheritable.<ref></ref>\n\nIt refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not\ninvolve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are\nDNA methylation and histone modification, both of which serve to regulate gene\nexpression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Gene expression can be\ncontrolled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to silencer\nregions of the DNA. These changes may remain through cell divisions for the\nremainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations.\nHowever, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;<ref\nname=\"pmid17522671\"></ref> instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's\ngenes to behave (or \"express themselves\") differently.<ref></ref> There are\nobjections to the use of the term epigenetic to describe chemical modification\nof histone, since it remains unclear whether or not histone modifications are\nheritable.<ref name=\"nature2008\"></ref>\n\nOne example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology is the process of\ncellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the\nvarious pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully\ndifferentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote\n– changes into the many cell types including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium,\nendothelium of blood vessels, etc. as it continues to divide. It does so by\nactivating some genes while inhibiting others.<ref name=\"pmid17522676\"></ref>\n\nIn 2011, it was demonstrated that the methylation of mRNA has a critical role in\nhuman energy homeostasis. The obesity associated FTO gene is shown to be able to\ndemethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA. This opened the related field of RNA\nepigenetics.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n",
