The mile of 5,280 feet is sometimes called the\nstatute mile or land mile to distinguish it from the [[nautical mile]] (about\n6,076 feet, or 1,852 metres).<ref>[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language]], 4th ed., s.v. mile 1.</ref> There have also been many\nhistorical miles and similar units in other systems that may be translated into\nEnglish as miles; they have varied in length from 1 to 15 kilometres.\n\nThe exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking\ncountries until the international yard and pound agreement in 1959 established\nthe yard as exactly 0.9144 metres, giving a mile of exactly 1,609.344 metres.\nThe United States adopted this international mile for most purposes, but\nretained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the U.S. survey\nmile. In the United States, statute mile formally refers to the survey mile,\nabout 3.219&nbsp;mm (⅛&nbsp;inch) longer than the international mile (the\ninternational mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the U.S. survey mile).\n\nUse of the mile as an official unit of measurement is now largely confined to\nthe United\nKingdom,<ref>[http://www.dft.gov.uk/trafficsignsimages/imagelist.php?CATID=6\nSpeed limit signs] (UK) Department for Transport.
