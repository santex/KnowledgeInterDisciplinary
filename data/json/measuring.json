They enable comparisons to be done between different measurements\nand reduce confusion. Even in cases of clear qualitative similarity or\ndifference, increased precision through quantitative measurement is often\npreferred in order to aid in replication. For example, different colours may be\noperationalized based either on wavelengths of light or (qualitative) terms such\nas \"green\" and \"blue\" which are often interpreted differently by different\npeople.
