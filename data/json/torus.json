'tori') is a surface of revolution\n generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis\n coplanar with the circle. If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle,\n the surface has a ring shape and is called a 'ring torus' or simply torus if\n the ring shape is implicit.\n\nWhen the axis is tangent to the circle, the resulting surface is called a 'horn\ntorus'; when the axis is a chord of the circle, it is called a 'spindle torus'.\nA degenerate case is when the axis is a diameter of the circle, which simply\ngenerates a 2-sphere. The ring torus bounds a solid known as a 'toroid'. The\nadjective 'toroidal' can be applied to tori, toroids or, more generally, any\nring shape as in toroidal inductors and transformers. Real-world examples of\n(approximately) toroidal objects include doughnuts, vadais, inner tubes, bagels,\nmany lifebuoys, O-rings and vortex rings.\n\nIn topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of two\ncircles: S<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;×&nbsp;S<sup>1</sup>, and the latter is taken to be\nthe definition in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring\ntorus is one way to embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but\nanother way to do this is the Cartesian product of the embedding of\nS<sup>1</sup> in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford\ntorus, surface in 4-space.\n\nThe word torus comes from the Latin word meaning cushion.<ref></ref>\n","title":"torus","headings":["Geometry","Topology","Two-sheeted cover","''n''-dimensional torus","Flat torus","''n''-fold torus","Toroidal polyhedra","Automorphisms","Coloring a torus","Cutting a torus","See also","References","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Sphere","3: Circle","3: Clifford_torus","3: Surface","3: Fundamental_group","2: Doughnut","2: Topology","2: Product_topology","2: 3-sphere","2: Stereographic_projection","2: Quotient_space","2: Cartesian_plane","2: Homology_group","2: Abelian_group","2: Compact_space","2: Maximal_torus","2: MÃ¶bius_strip","2: Double_torus","2: Triple_torus","1: Geometry","1: Surface_of_revolution","1: Coplanar","1: Toroidal_inductors_and_transformers","1: Inner_tube","1: Bagels","1: Lifebuoy","1: O-ring","1: Vortex_ring","1: Homeomorphism","1: Euclidean_space","1: Four-dimensional_space","1: Latin","1: Cushion","1: Parametric_equation","1: Aspect_ratio","1: Implicit_function","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Coordinate_axis","1: Quartic_equation","1: Diffeomorphism","1: Cartesian_product","1: Surface_area","1: Volume","1: Pappus's_centroid_theorem","1: Spherical_coordinate_system","1: Magnetic_confinement_fusion","1: Complex_coordinate_space","1: Square_root_of_2","1: Foliation","1: Fiber_bundle","1: Hopf_bundle","1: Relative_topology","1: Real_coordinate_space","1: Homeomorphic","1: Unit_square","1: Fundamental_polygon","1: Direct_product_of_groups","1: Isomorphic","1: Hurewicz_theorem","1: Ramification_point","1: Conformal_structure","1: Weierstrass_point","1: Cross-ratio","1: Group_action","1: Hypercube","1: Manifold","1: Lie_group","1: Unit_circle","1: Complex_number","1: Compact_Lie_group","1: Subgroup","1: Automorphism","1: Invertible_matrix","1: Integral_matrices","1: Free_abelian_group","1: Binomial_coefficient","1: Euler_characteristic","1: Cohomology_ring","1: Exterior_algebra","1: Configuration_space","1: Orbifold","1: Symmetric_group","1: Equilateral_triangle","1: Triangular_prism","1: Orbifold#Music_theory","1: American_Mathematical_Society","1: Riemannian_manifold","1: Gaussian_curvature","1: Diffeomorphic","1: Isometry","1: Fractal","1: Surface_normals","1: Connected_sum","1: Orientability","1: Classification_theorem","1: Connected_space","1: Projective_plane","1: Real_numbers","1: Toroidal_polyhedra","1: Polyhedron_formula","1: Homeomorphism_group","1: Geometric_topology","1: Mapping_class_group","1: Eilenbergâ€“MacLane_space","1: N-connected","1: Short_exact_sequence","1: Semidirect_product","1: Four_color_theorem","1: Standard_torus","1: Algebraic_torus","1: Bagel","1: Complex_torus","1: Dupin_cyclide","1: Elliptic_curve","1: Irrational_cable_on_a_torus","1: Joint_European_Torus","1: Loewner's_torus_inequality","1: Period_lattice","1: Spiric_section","1: Toric_lens","1: Toric_section","1: Toric_variety","1: Toroidal_and_poloidal","1: Torus_knot","1: Umbilic_torus","1: Villarceau_circles","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
