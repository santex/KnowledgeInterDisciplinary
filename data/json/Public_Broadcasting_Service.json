Its\nheadquarters is in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nPBS is the most prominent provider of television programs to U.S. public\ntelevision stations, distributing series such as [[Sesame Street]], [[PBS\nNewsHour]], [[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]], and [[Frontline (U.S. TV\nseries)|Frontline]]. Since the mid-2000s, Roper polls commissioned by PBS have\nconsistently placed the service as America's most-trusted national\ninstitution. However, PBS is not responsible for all programming\ncarried on public TV stations; in fact, stations usually receive a large portion\nof their content (including most pledge drive specials) from third-party\nsources, such as American Public Television, NETA, WTTW National Productions and\nindependent producers. This distinction is a frequent source of viewer\nconfusion.\n\nPBS also has a subsidiary called National Datacast (NDI), which offers\ndatacasting services via member stations. This helps PBS and its member stations\nearn extra revenue.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Public_Broadcasting_Service","recorded":1375087123,"links":[],"instances":["tv_network","tv_series","tv","tv_show","sportscaster","tv_series","tv_series","tv_series","american_football","1989","broadcasting"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Commercial-free
