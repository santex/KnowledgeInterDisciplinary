{"cursor":"9653","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Fetal hemoglobin', or 'foetal haemoglobin', (also 'hemoglobin F' or 'HbF' or\n'Î±2Î³2') is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven\nmonths of development in the uterus and in the newborn until roughly 6 months\nold. Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin in that\nit is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the\ndeveloping fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.\n\nIn newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult hemoglobin\nby approximately 6 months postnatally. In adults, fetal hemoglobin production\ncan be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of\ndiseases such as sickle-cell disease.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Fetal_hemoglobin","recorded":1362508462,"links":22,"instances":["human","biochemistry","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hemoglobins"],"headings":["Overview","Distribution","Structure and genetics","Clinical significance","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Hemoglobin_F.png/250px-Hemoglobin_F.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/HbA_vs_HbF_saturation_curve.png/300px-HbA_vs_HbF_saturation_curve.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Sicklecells.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["p50","biochemistry"],["chromosome_11","human"],["chromosome_16","human"]],"members":["chromosome_16","p50","chromosome_11"],"related":["Oxygen","Transport_protein","Fetus","Uterus","Hemoglobin","Bloodstream","Sickle-cell_disease","Umbilical_vein","Placenta","Uterus","P50_(biochemistry)","Partial_pressure","MmHg","2,3-bisphosphoglycerate","Red_blood_cell","Embryonic_hemoglobin","Hemoglobin_A","Hereditary_persistence_of_fetal_hemoglobin","Hemoglobin_A","Hemoglobin_A2","Tetrameric_protein","Protein_subunit","Heme","Prosthetic_group","Chromosome_11_(human)","Gene","Glycine","Alanine","Chromosome_16_(human)","Sickle-cell_disease","Hemoglobin_S","Red_blood_cell","Sickle","Blood_vessel","Hydroxyurea","Erythropoietin","F-cell"]}
