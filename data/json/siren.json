Roman poets placed them on some\nsmall islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions,\nthe literal geography of the \"flowery\" island of Anthemoessa, or\nAnthemusa,<ref>\"We must steer clear of the Sirens, their enchanting song, their\nmeadow starred with flowers\" is Robert Fagles' rendering of Odyssey\n12.158–9.</ref> is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands\nknown as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.<ref>Strabo i. 22; Eustathius\nof Thessalonica's Homeric commentaries §1709; Servius I.e.</ref> All such\nlocations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.\n\nWhen the Sirens were given a name of their own they were considered the\ndaughters of the river god Achelous, fathered upon Terpsichore, Melpomene,\nSterope, or Chthon (the Earth; in Euripides' [[Helen (play)|Helen]] 167, Helen\nin her anguish calls upon \"Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth\"). Although\nthey lured mariners, for the Greeks the Sirens in their \"meadow starred with\nflowers\" were not sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to\nthe sea, as daughters of Phorcys.<ref>Virgil. V. 846; Ovid XIV, 88.</ref> Sirens\nare found in many Greek stories, particularly in Homer's [[Odyssey]].\n\nTheir number is variously reported as between two and five. In the [[Odyssey]],\nHomer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens\nas two.<ref>Odyssey 12.52</ref> Later writers mention both their names and\nnumber: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia\n(Tzetzes, ad Lycophron 7l2) or Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia (Eustathius,\nloc. cit.; Strabo v. §246, 252; Servius' commentary on Virgil's Georgics iv.\n562); Eustathius (Commentaries §1709) states that they were two, Aglaopheme and\nThelxiepeia. Their individual names are variously rendered in the later sources\nas Thelxiepeia/Thelxiope/Thelxinoe, Molpe, Himerope,\nAglaophonos/Aglaope/Aglaopheme, Pisinoe/Peisinoë/Peisithoe, Parthenope, Ligeia,\nLeucosia, Raidne, and Teles.<ref>Linda Phyllis Austern, Inna Naroditskaya, [htt-\np://books.google.de/books?id=5IBSGG9YegwC&pg=PT27&dq=three+sirens+mythology&hl=-\nen&sa=X&ei=I2X-\nToWyJ_DN4QSlkNGNCA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=three%20sirens%20mythology&f=false\nMusic of the Sirens], Indiana University Press, 2006, p.18</ref><ref>William\nHansen, William F.
