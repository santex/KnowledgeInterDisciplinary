It is publicly traded on the Australian\nSecurities Exchange. In 2012, it has approximately 3,600 employees and\nreported an after-tax profit of $90.7 million (pre-significant items). The\ncompany has a diversified shareholding with predominantly Australian fund\nmanagers and retail owners.\n\nFounded in Sydney in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining company, the company\nfirst began refining imported raw sugar, expanding into the Melbourne market in\nthe 1870s. Over the next two decades, mills were established in Queensland and\nFiji, which began to process domestically-grown sugar. In 1923, the Queensland\nstate government signed an agreement with CSR to refine all of that state's\nsugar production, a monopoly that was to continue until 1989. Mills outside\nQueensland were sold in the 1970s. About 80% of production is exported.\n\nUntil 2010, the refined sugar products for the retail market were produced in a\njoint venture with Mackay Sugar Co-Operative (75% controlled by CSR), who\noperate refineries in Mackay (Queensland), and Melbourne. The CSR brand is used\non most of the retail sugar products produced. The production makes up around\n60% of the sugar on the Australian domestic market, and 80% of that in New\nZealand. Using the molasses by-product from the sugar mills, the company also\ndistills ethanol for use in fuel ethanol manufacture, and varying grades of\ndomestic industrial ethanols for food production and other chemical processes.\n\nThe company began to diversify into building products as early as 1942, with the\nconstruction of a plaster mill in Sydney, and in 1947 the company began\nmanufacturing plasterboard there, bringing the product to the Australian market.\nIt acquired Bradford Insulation in 1959, which produced heat insulation\nmaterials for buildings, and currently has a substantial share of the insulation\nmarket in Australia. It has established insulation businesses in China, Thailand\nand Malaysia, originally in joint ventures with local partners, but now wholly\nowned. The company also produces fibre cement sheeting, aerated concrete\nproducts, bricks, and systems to support plasterboard construction through\nRondo, a joint venture with Boral. It spun off its interests in heavy building\nproducts, then producing more than half the group's profits, to a separate\nlisted company, Rinker Group, in 2003. In 2007, CSR acquired the Australasian\nglass businesses of Pilkington and the Melbourne based glass processing company\nDMS Glass, subsequently renaming both as Viridian.\n\nThe company's interest in aluminium is through an approximate 25% stake in the\nTomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle, New South Wales.\n\nThe current managing director is Rob Sindel, a CSR employee since 2009, and the\nchairman of the board of directors is Jeremy Sutcliffe, the former managing\ndirector of Sims Metal. The group's corporate headquarters is in North Ryde\n[Triniti 3 Building], a suburb of Sydney.\n\nIn December 2010, CSR sold its sugar and ethanol business, Sucrogen, to the\nSingaporean company
