They are most commonly associated with rock\nmusic groups.\n\nSuch passes are usually a laminated paper worn on a lanyard, or on chain link or\nkey chain holder at the belt, or a simpler \"stick-on\" applied to one's clothing.\nPlastic or paper wristbands may also be used. However, some elaborately designed\nbackstage passes have been used by Bill Graham Productions/Winterland, Beaver\nProductions and many other regional and local promoters. To deter\ncounterfeiting, passes often include holograms or color-shifting properties.\n\nSome venues (including the House of Blues venues and Irving Plaza in New York)\nrequire their own passes to be worn, even by laminate holders for the tour.\nLarge music festivals, such as Ozzfest and the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival\nalso usually issue their own passes.\n\nBackstage passes sometimes become memorabilia sold to die-hard fans, especially\nwhen the pass is signed by a performer.\n\nIn media, the term \"Backstage Pass\" may be used to signify the presence of\nexpanded coverage of certain musical groups.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Backstage_pass","recorded":1362670124,"links":14,"instances":["promoter","admission"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ephemera","Business documents"],"headings":["Types of passes","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Warpedtourpass.jpg/203px-Warpedtourpass.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bill_graham","promoter"],["ticket","admission"]],"members":["bill_graham","ticket"],"related":["Rock_music","Bill_Graham_(promoter)","House_of_Blues","Ozzfest","Bonnaroo_Music_and_Arts_Festival","Memorabilia","Groupies","Ticket_(admission)"]}
