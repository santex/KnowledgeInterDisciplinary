Latexes may be natural or\nsynthetic.\n\nLatex as found in nature is a milky fluid found in 10% of all flowering plants\n(angiosperms). Agrawal AA, Konno K. (2009). Latex: A Model\nfor Understanding Mechanisms, Ecology, and Evolution of Plant Defense Against\nHerbivory. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 40:311â31.  It is a complex\nemulsion consisting of proteins, alkaloids, starches, sugars, oils, tannins,\nresins, and gums that coagulates on exposure to air. It is usually exuded after\ntissue injury. In most plants, latex is white, but some have yellow, orange, or\nscarlet latex. Since the 17th century, latex has been used as a term for the\nfluid substance in plants. Mahlberg PG. (1993). Laticifers: an historical\nperspective. Bot. Rev. 59:1â23.  It serves mainly as defense against\nherbivorous insects.\n\nLatex is not to be confused with plant sap; it is a separate substance,\nseparately produced, and with separate functions.\n\nIt can also be made synthetically by polymerizing a monomer such as styrene that\nhas been emulsified with surfactants.\n\nThe word is also used to refer to natural latex rubber; particularly for non-\nvulcanized rubber. Such is the case in products like latex gloves, latex condoms\nand latex clothing. Many people are allergic to rubber latex.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Latex","recorded":1362481438,"links":43,"instances":["botany","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Materials","Sculpture materials","Rubber"],"headings":["Biology","Productive species","Defense function","Synthetic latices","Uses of latex","Latex clothing","Allergic reactions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Latex-production.jpg/220px-Latex-production.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Latex_being_collected_from_a_tapped_rubber_tree.jpg/220px-Latex_being_collected_from_a_tapped_rubber_tree.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Slaapbol_R0017601.JPG/220px-Slaapbol_R0017601.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cortex","botany"]],"members":["cortex","cell"],"related":["Rubber","Emulsion","Polymer","Angiosperms","Protein","Alkaloid","Starch","Sugar","Vegetable_oil","Tannin","Resin","Natural_gum","Antipredator_adaptation","Herbivorous","Insect","Sap","Chemical_synthesis","Polymerization","Monomer","Styrene","Emulsion","Surfactant","Rubber","Vulcanization","Glove","Condom","Latex_clothing","Latex_allergy","Cell_(biology)","Laticifer","Laticiferous","Meristem","Plant_stem","Root","Cell_wall","Papaveraceae","Rubber","Hevea_brasiliensis","Euphorbiaceae","Moraceae","Asteraceae","Parthenium_argentatum","Parthenium_argentatum","Heliantheae","Cichorieae","Clade","Asclepias","Euphorbiaceae","Euphorbiaceae","Embryo","Leaf","Fruit","Cortex_(botany)","Cannabaceae","Families","Dicotyledonous","Monocotyledonous","Conifer","Pteridophyte","Lactarius","Convergent_evolution","Asclepias_humistrata","Milkweed","Monarch_butterfly","Cryptostegia_grandiflora","Styrene-butadiene","Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene","Acrylic_polymer","Polyvinyl_acetate","Rubber","Mattresses","Gloves","Swim_cap","Condom","Catheters","Balloon","Balatá","Gutta_percha","Chicle","Dyera_costulata","Chewing_gum","Opium_poppy","Opium","Opiate","Alkaloid","Coating","Glue","Immunoassays","Scratchcards","Clothing","Latex_allergy","Latex_glove","Anaphylactic_shock","Guayule","Hypoallergenic","Hevea","Antibody_generator","Vytex_Natural_Rubber_Latex","Spina_bifida","Plant_sap","Rubber"]}
