{"cursor":"1517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'tract' (Latin: 'tractus') is part of the proper of the liturgical\ncelebration of the Eucharist for many Christian denominations, which is used\ninstead of the Alleluia during Lenten or pre-Lenten seasons, in a Requiem Mass,\nand on a few other penitential occasions, when the joyousness of an Alleluia is\ndeemed inappropriate. Tracts are not, however, necessarily sorrowful.\n\nThe name apparently derives from either the drawn-out style of singing or the\ncontinuous structure without a refrain. There is evidence, however, that the\nearliest performances were sung responsorially, and it is probable that these\nwere dropped at an early age.\n\nIn their final form, tracts are a series of psalm verses; rarely a complete\npsalm, but all of the verses from the same psalm. They are restricted to only\ntwo modes, the second and the eighth. The melodies follow centonization patterns\nmore strongly than anywhere else in the repertoire; a typical tract is almost\nexclusively a succession of such formulas. The cadences are nearly always\nelaborate melismas. Tracts with multiple verses are some of the longest chants\nin the Liber Usualis.\n","linknr":482,"url":"Tract_(liturgy)","recorded":1362689262,"links":24,"instances":["music","liturgy","language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structure of the Mass"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Gregorian_chant.gif/150px-Gregorian_chant.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/046CupolaSPietro.jpg/25px-046CupolaSPietro.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Lutherrose.svg/25px-Lutherrose.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["latin","language"],["proper","liturgy"],["cadence","music"]],"members":["cadence","proper","latin"],"related":["Latin_(language)","Proper_(liturgy)","Liturgy","Eucharist","Christian_denominations","Alleluia","Lent","Septuagesima","Requiem","Refrain","Psalm","Musical_mode","Centonization","Cadence_(music)","Melisma","Liber_Usualis"]}
