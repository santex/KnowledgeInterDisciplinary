{"cursor":"37906","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nn students taking an exam in order to apply for the Don Bosco Technical School\nof Sihanoukville in 2008.]]\n\n students in a computer fundamentals class taking a computer-based test]]\n\nA 'test' or 'examination' is an assessment intended to measure a test-taker's\nknowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other\ntopics (e.g., beliefs). A test may be administered orally, on paper, on a\ncomputer, or in a confined area that requires a test taker to physically perform\na set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. For example, in a\nclosed book test, a test taker is often required to rely upon memory to respond\nto specific items whereas in an open book test, a test taker may use one or more\nsupplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding to an\nitem. A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an\ninformal test would be a reading test administered by a parent to a child. An\nexample of a formal test would be a final examination administered by a teacher\nin a classroom or an I.Q. test administered by a psychologist in a clinic.\nFormal testing often results in a grade or a test score. Thissen, D., &\nWainer, H. (2001). Test Scoring. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Page 1, sentence 1.\nA test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or\noccasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical\nanalysis of a large number of participants.\n\nA standardized test is any test that is administered and scored in a consistent\nmanner to ensure legal defensibility. North Central Regional Educational\nLaboratory, [http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/students/earlycld/ea5lk3.htm\nNCREL.org] Standardized tests are often used in education, professional\ncertification, psychology (e.g., MMPI), the military, and many other fields.\n\nA non-standardized test is usually flexible in scope and format, variable in\ndifficulty and significance. Since these tests are usually developed by\nindividual instructors, the format and difficulty of these tests may not be\nwidely adopted or used by other instructors or institutions. A non-standardized\ntest may be used to determine the proficiency level of students, to motivate\nstudents to study, and to provide feedback to students. In some instances, a\nteacher may develop non-standardized tests that resemble standardized tests in\nscope, format, and difficulty for the purpose of preparing their students for an\nupcoming standardized test. Finally, the frequency and\nsetting by which a non-standardized tests are administered are highly variable\nand are usually constrained by the duration of the class period. A class\ninstructor may for example, administer a test on a weekly basis or just twice a\nsemester. Depending on the policy of the instructor or institution, the duration\nof each test itself may last for only five minutes to an entire class period.\n\nIn contrasts to non-standardized tests, standardized tests are widely used,\nfixed in terms of scope, difficulty and format, and are usually significant in\nconsequences. Standardized tests are usually held on fixed dates as determined\nby the test developer, educational institution, or governing body, which may or\nmay not be administered by the instructor, held within the classroom, or\nconstrained by the classroom period. Although there is little variability\nbetween different copies of the same type of standardized test (e.g., SAT or\nGRE), there is variability between different types of standardized tests.\n\nAny test with important consequences for the individual test taker is referred\nto as a high-stakes test.\n\nA test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a\ngoverning body, or a test provider. In some instances, the developer of the test\nmay not be directly responsible for its administration. For example, Educational\nTesting Service (ETS), a nonprofit educational testing and assessment\norganization, develops standardized tests such as the SAT but may not directly\nbe involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests. As with the\ndevelopment and administration of educational tests, the format and level of\ndifficulty of the tests themselves are highly variable and there is no general\nconsensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. Often, the\nformat and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy\nof the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational\ninstitution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies. In general,\ntests developed and administered by individual instructors are non-standardized\nwhereas tests developed by testing organizations are standardized.\n","linknr":495,"url":"examine","recorded":1362673394,"links":53,"instances":["education","education","exercise","mathematics","disambiguation","uk","exercise","assessment","test"],"pdf":["http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf","http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/GCSE_Guide.pdf","http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/files/GCSE_Guide.pdf","http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/documents/nbme_iwgindex.pdf","http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/documents/nbme_iwgindex.pdf","http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P6100.12%20W%20CH%201.pdf","http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/MCO%20P6100.12%20W%20CH%201.pdf","https://www.pharmacy.purdue.edu/~mcmp304/HowToStudyForQuizzesAndExams.pdf","https://www.pharmacy.purdue.edu/~mcmp304/HowToStudyForQuizzesAndExams.pdf","http://torinmonahan.com/papers/testing.pdf","http://www.dianeravitch.com/uses_and_misuses.pdf"],"categories":["School
