The interior of the Earth, similar to the\nother terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The mantle is a\nhighly viscous layer between the crust and the outer core. Earth's mantle is a\nrocky shell about\nthick [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=mantle Mantle:\nSchlumberger Oilfield Glossary] that constitutes about 84% of Earth's\nvolume. It is predominantly solid and encloses the iron-\nrich hot core, which occupies about 15% of Earth's volume. {{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/interior/ |title=The\ninterior of the earth |last=Robertson |first=Eugene |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-01-\n06 |publisher=USGS }}\n[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=core Core:\nSchlumberger Oilfield Glossary] Past episodes of melting and volcanism at\nthe shallower levels of the mantle have produced a thin crust of crystallized\nmelt products near the surface, upon which we live. {{cite\nweb |url=http://www.moorlandschool.co.uk/earth/earths_structure.htm |title=The\nstructure of the Earth |year=2005 |publisher=Moorland School |accessdate=2007-12-\n26 }}  Information about structure and composition of the mantle either\nresult from geophysical investigation or from direct geoscientific analyses on\nEarth mantle derived xenoliths.\n\nTwo main zones are distinguished in the upper mantle: the inner asthenosphere\ncomposed of plastic flowing rock about 200 km\nthick, [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=asthenosphere\nAsthenosphere: Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary ]. and the lowermost part of\nthe lithosphere composed of rigid rock about 50 to 120 km\nthick.
