{"cursor":"9986","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"One of the most important properties of a lipid bilayer is the relative mobility\n(fluidity) of the individual lipid molecules and how this mobility changes with\ntemperature. This response is known as the phase behavior of the bilayer.\nBroadly, at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or\na solid phase. The solid phase is commonly referred to as a âgelâ phase. All\nlipids have a characteristic temperature at which they undergo a transition\n(melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are\nconstrained to the two dimensional plane of the membrane, but in liquid phase\nbilayers the molecules diffuse freely within this plane. Thus, in a liquid\nbilayer a given lipid will rapidly exchange locations with its neighbor millions\nof times a second and will, through the process of a random walk, migrate over\nlong distances. H.
