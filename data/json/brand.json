The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)\nendorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-\nproject/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project].</ref>\nInitially, [[Livestock branding|Branding]] was adopted to differentiate one\nperson's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the\nanimal's skin with a hot iron stamp, and was subsequently used in business,\nmarketing and advertising. A modern example of a brand is Coca Cola which\nbelongs to the Coca-Cola Company.\n\nA brand is often the most valuable asset of a corporation. Brand owners manage\ntheir brands carefully to create shareholder value, and brand valuation is an\nimportant management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand, and\nallows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio\nof brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear\non a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces\nmarketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and\nmanaging for value.\n\nThe word \"brand\" is often used as a metonym, referring to the company that is\nstrongly identified with a brand.\n\n or are often used to denote a brand of motor vehicle, which may be\n distinguished from a car model. A concept brand is a brand that is\n associated with an abstract concept, like breast cancer awareness or\n environmentalism, rather than a specific product, service, or business. A\n commodity brand is a brand associated with a commodity. Got milk? is an\n example of a commodity brand.\n",
