Assembly of the human genome is one of the greatest achievements of\n bioinformatics.]]\n\n\nIn biology, 'bioinformatics' is an interdisciplinary field that develops and\nimproves upon methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing\nbiological data. A major activity in bioinformatics is to develop software tools\nto generate useful biological knowledge.\n\nBioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In\nexperimental molecular biology, bioinformatics techniques such as image and\nsignal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw\ndata. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and\nannotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the textual\nmining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene\nontologies to organize and query biological data. It plays a role in the\nanalysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid\nin the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the\nunderstanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more\nintegrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and\nnetworks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology,\nit aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, and protein structures as\nwell as molecular interactions.\n\nBioinformatics uses many areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering\nto process biological data. Complex machines are used to read in biological data\nat a much faster rate than before. Databases and information systems are used to\nstore and organize biological data. Analyzing biological data may involve\nalgorithms in artificial intelligence, soft computing, data mining, image\nprocessing, and simulation. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical\nfoundations such as discrete mathematics, control theory, system theory,\ninformation theory, and statistics. Commonly used software tools and\ntechnologies in the field include Java, C#, XML, Perl, C, C++, Python, R, SQL,\nCUDA, MATLAB, and spreadsheet applications.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>\n","title":"bioinformatics","headings":["Introduction","Major research areas","Software and tools","Conferences","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Human_genome","3: DNA","2: Genomics","2: Computer_science","2: Algorithm","2: Data_mining","2: Statistics","2: Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff","2: Computational_biology","2: Gene","2: Cluster_analysis","2: Sequence_alignment","2: Gene_finding","2: Gene_expression","2: Species","2: The_Institute_for_Genomic_Research","2: Noise","2: Bi-CoPaM","2: Metabolic_network","2: X-ray_crystallography","2: List_of_open-source_bioinformatics_software","2: Taverna_workbench","2: Bioinformatics_workflow_management_systems","1: Biology","1: Genetics","1: Mutation","1: Mathematics","1: Engineering","1: Database","1: Information_systems","1: Artificial_intelligence","1: Soft_computing","1: Image_processing","1: Simulation","1: Discrete_mathematics","1: Control_theory","1: System_theory","1: Information_theory","1: XML","1: Perl","1: C++","1: SQL","1: CUDA","1: MATLAB","1: Spreadsheet","1: Paulien_Hogeweg","1: Biophysics","1: Biochemistry","1: Abiogenesis","1: Elvin_A._Kabat","1: David_Lipman","1: National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","1: Nucleotide_sequences","1: Amino_acid_sequence","1: Protein_domain","1: Protein_structure","1: Pattern_recognition","1: Machine_learning","1: Biological_Data_Visualization","1: Genome_assembly","1: Drug_design","1: Drug_discovery","1: Protein_structural_alignment","1: Protein_structure_prediction","1: Protein–protein_interactions","1: Genome-wide_association_studies","1: Evolution","1: Structural_bioinformatics","1: Phi_X_174","1: Sequencing","1: DNA_sequence","1: Polypeptides","1: Proteins","1: Molecular_systematics","1: Phylogenetic_tree","1: Computer_program","1: BLAST","1: Nucleotides","1: Shotgun_sequencing","1: Junk_DNA","1: Proteome","1: Genome_project#Genome_annotation","1: Owen_White","1: Evolutionary_biology","1: Genomes","1: Gene_duplication","1: Horizontal_gene_transfer","1: Speciation","1: Evolutionary_tree","1: Genetic_algorithm","1: Computational_linguistics","1: Messenger_RNA","1: DNA_microarray","1: Expressed_sequence_tag","1: Serial_analysis_of_gene_expression","1: Massively_parallel_signature_sequencing","1: RNA-Seq","1: Epithelial","1: Hormone","1: Protein","1: Sequence_motif","1: Microarray","1: Cell_cycle","1: Regulatory_elements","1: K-means_clustering","1: Self-organizing_map","1: Hierarchical_clustering","1: Consensus_clustering","1: Protein_microarray","1: Mass_spectrometry","1: Point_mutation","1: Cancer","1: Germline","1: Oligonucleotide","1: Comparative_genomic_hybridization","1: Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","1: Terabyte","1: Hidden_Markov_model","1: Copy_number_variation","1: Lesion","1: Genes","1: Endosymbiosis","1: Heuristics","1: Approximation_algorithms","1: Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","1: Bayesian_analysis","1: Biological_network","1: Interactome","1: Computer_simulation","1: Enzyme","1: Metabolism","1: Signal_transduction","1: Gene_regulatory_network","1: Artificial_life","1: Biomedical_imagery","1: Accuracy","1: Diagnostics","1: High-content_screening","1: Bioimage_informatics","1: Morphometrics","1: Gene_mapping","1: Sulston_score","1: Amino_acid","1: Primary_structure","1: Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","1: Mad_Cow_Disease","1: Prion","1: Leghemoglobin","1: Structural_motif","1: Structural_domain","1: Protein–protein_interaction_prediction","1: Protein_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","1: Protein–protein_interaction","1: Protein–protein_docking","1: Software","1: List_of_bioinformatics_companies","1: Free_and_open-source_software","1: Open_code","1: Bioconductor","1: BioPerl","1: Biopython","1: BioJava","1: BioRuby","1: Bioclipse","1: EMBOSS","1: UGENE","1: Open_Bioinformatics_Foundation","1: SOAP","1: REST","1: European_Bioinformatics_Institute","1: Sequence_alignment_software","1: Multiple_sequence_alignment","1: Bioinformatics#Sequence_analysis","1: Service-orientation","1: Workflow_management_system","1: Provenance","1: Kepler_scientific_workflow_system","1: Problem_solving","1: Computer_programming","1: Homework","1: University_of_California_at_San_Diego","1: Saint_Petersburg_Academic_University","1: Russian_Academy_of_Sciences","1: Rosalind_Franklin","1: Raymond_Gosling","1: James_D._Watson","1: Francis_Crick","1: Intelligent_Systems_for_Molecular_Biology","1: European_Conference_on_Computational_Biology","1: Computational_genomics","1: Health_informatics","1: Computational_biomodeling","1: Functional_genomics","1: Phylogenetics","1: Bioinformatics_companies","1: International_Society_for_Computational_Biology","1: List_of_scientific_journals_in_bioinformatics","1: Jumping_library","1: Bernd_Sturmfels"]}
