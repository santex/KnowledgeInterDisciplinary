Keratin is the key structural material making up the outer\nlayer of human skin. It is also the key structural component of hair and nails.\nKeratin monomers assemble into bundles to form intermediate filaments, which are\ntough and insoluble and form strong unmineralized tissues found in reptiles,\nbirds, amphibians, and mammals. The only other biological matter known to\napproximate the toughness of keratinized tissue is\nchitin.\n","linknr":946,"url":"Keratin","recorded":1362371348,"links":63,"instances":["anatomy","spider","biology","biology","biology","zoology","biology","skin","chemistry","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/Design%2Band%2Bmechanical%2Bproperties%2BofVincent.pdf","http://biomimetic.pbworks.com/f/Design%2Band%2Bmechanical%2Bproperties%2BofVincent.pdf","http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/126/1263373670.pdf","http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/126/1263373670.pdf","http://biochem118.stanford.edu/Papers/Protein%20Papers/Voet%26Voet%20chapter6.pdf","http://biochem118.stanford.edu/Papers/Protein%20Papers/Voet%26Voet%20chapter6.pdf"],"categories":["Keratins","Cytoskeleton","Skin anatomy"],"headings":["Etymology","Molecular biology and biochemistry","Structural details","Silk","Clinical significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/KeratinF9.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Male_impala_profile.jpg/220px-Male_impala_profile.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Keratin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nail","anatomy"],["mineralization","biology"],["horn","anatomy"],["nail","anatomy"],["scale","zoology"],["cell","biology"],["epidermis","skin"],["homology","biology"],["dissociation","chemistry"],["annealing","biology"],["spinneret","spider"]],"members":["nail","spinneret","mineralization","homology","annealing","scale","cell","epidermis","dissociation","horn"],"related":["Fibrous_protein","Skin","Hair","Nail_(anatomy)","Monomer","Intermediate_filament","Mineralization_(biology)","Reptile","Bird","Amphibian","Mammal","Biology","Toughness","Chitin","Greek_language","Proto-Indo-European","Impala","Keratinocyte","Cornified","Hair","Wool","Horn_(anatomy)","Nail_(anatomy)","Claw","Hoof","Scale_(zoology)","Reptiles","Animal_shell","Testudines","Tortoise","Turtle","Terrapin","Feather","Beak","Birds","Beta_sheet","Baleen","Whale","Thyreophora","Dinosaur","Cytokeratins","Intermediate_filaments","Intermediate_filaments","Lamins","Nylon","Peptide","Amino_acid","Alpha_helix","Beta_sheet","Globular_protein","Enzymes","Transglutaminase","Cellular_differentiation","Cornification","Protein","Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Organelle","Metabolism","Apoptosis","Dermis","Cytoskeleton","Desmosomes","Hemidesmosomes","Cell_(biology)","Epidermis_(skin)","Skin","Collagen","Elastin","Callus","Integumentary_system","Sebaceous_glands","Moult","Protein","Phylogenetics","Homology_(biology)","Chemical_compound","Molecule","Evolution","Gene","Superhelix","Monomer","Triple_helix","Collagen","Cartilage","Bone","Elastin","Fibroin","Chemical_reaction","Chemical_specificity","Sulfur","Cysteine","Disulfide_bond","Cross-link","Vulcanization","Rubber","Soluble","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Redox","Fingernail","Alpha_helix","Hydrogen_bond","Cytokeratin","Intermediate_filament","Annealing_(biology)","Keratin_1","Keratin_2","Keratin_9","Keratin_10","Stratum_corneum","Keratinocyte","Keratin_3","Keratin_12","Cornea","Keratin_4","Keratin_13","Stratified_epithelium","Keratin_5","Keratin_14","Keratin_15","Stratified_epithelium","Keratin_6","Keratin_16","Keratin_17","Squamous_epithelium","Keratin_7","Keratin_19","Keratin_8","Keratin_18","Keratin_20","KRT23","KRT24","KRT25","KRT26","KRT27","KRT28","KRT31","KRT32","KRT33A","KRT33B","KRT34","KRT35","KRT36","KRT37","KRT38","KRT39","KRT40","KRT71","KRT72","KRT73","KRT74","KRT75","KRT76","KRT77","KRT78","KRT79","KRT8","KRT80","KRT81","KRT82","KRT83","KRT84","KRT85","KRT86","Silk","Fibroins","Insect","Spider","Pupa","Spider_web","Spinneret_(spider)","Gland","Extrusion","Biology","Commerce","Crystal","Amorphous","Random_coil","Chemical_synthesis","Polymer","Nylon","Hornet","Silkworm_cocoons","Adhesive","Infection","Fungus","Athlete's_foot","Ringworm","Dermatophytes","Epidermolysis_bullosa_simplex","Ichthyosis_bullosa_of_Siemens","Epidermolytic_hyperkeratosis","Steatocystoma_multiplex","Keratosis_pharyngis","Large_cell_lung_carcinoma_with_rhabdoid_phenotype","Anaplastic","Carcinoma","Thymoma","Sarcoma","Trophoblastic_neoplasm","Hepatocellular_carcinoma","Cholangiocarcinoma","Colorectal_carcinoma","List_of_keratins_expressed_in_the_human_integumentary_system","List_of_cutaneous_conditions_caused_by_mutations_in_keratins"]}
