By his restatement of Sadi Carnot's principle known\nas the Carnot cycle, he put the theory of heat on a truer and sounder basis. His\nmost important paper, On the mechanical theory of heat, published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the second law of\nthermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he\nintroduced virial theorem which applied to heat.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Rudolf_Clausius","recorded":1362480437,"links":60,"instances":["crater","school"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1822 births","1888 deaths","People from Koszalin","ETH Zurich faculty","Thermodynamicists","German military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War","German physicists","People from the Province of Pomerania","Recipients of the Iron Cross","Recipients of the Copley Medal","Humboldt University of Berlin alumni","University of Bonn faculty","University of Würzburg faculty","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Theoretical physicists"],"headings":["Life","Work","Tributes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Clausius.jpg/220px-Clausius.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Rudolf_Clausius_signature.svg/128px-Rudolf_Clausius_signature.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["province_of_pomerania","1815–1945"],["province_of_pomerania","1815–1945"],["gymnasium","school"],["clausius","crater"]],"members":["clausius","gymnasium","province_of_pomerania"],"related":["Koszalin","Koszalin","Province_of_Pomerania_(1815–1945)","Prussia","Bonn","Germany","Physics","Thermodynamics","Entropy","Germany","Physicist","Mathematician","Thermodynamics","Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot","Carnot_cycle","Theory_of_heat","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Thermodynamic_entropy","Virial_theorem","Heat","Koszalin","Koszalin","Province_of_Pomerania_(1815–1945)","Prussia","Gymnasium_(school)","Stettin","Szczecin","University_of_Berlin","Heinrich_Gustav_Magnus","Dirichlet","Jakob_Steiner","Leopold_von_Ranke","University_of_Halle","ETH_Zürich","Zürich","University_of_Würzburg","University_of_Bonn","Franco-Prussian_War","Iron_Cross","Bonn","Lord_Rayleigh","Nicolas_Léonard_Sadi_Carnot","Conservation_of_energy","Laws_of_thermodynamics","Third_law_of_thermodynamics","Walther_Nernst","Kinetic_theory","August_Krönig","Mean_free_path","Bibliothèque_nationale_de_France","Clausius–Clapeyron_relation","Thermodynamics","Phase_transition","Solid","Liquid","Émile_Clapeyron","Entropy","Calorie","Degree_Celsius","Joule","Kelvin","Energy","Universe","Entropy","Institution_of_Engineers_and_Shipbuilders_in_Scotland","Royal_Society_of_London","Copley_Medal","Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","Huygens","Poncelet_Prize","Würzburg","Clausius_(crater)","Moon","Hans_Peter_Jørgen_Julius_Thomsen","Thermochemistry","MacTutor_archive"]}
