Under pressure from Anglo-American colonial settlement,\nafter 1763 and the French defeat in the Seven Years War, they began to move west\ninto Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, then under Spanish rule, where they were\nresettled by the early nineteenth century. Some of the Coushatta and closely\nallied Alabama were removed west to Oklahoma in the 1830s under Indian Removal,\ntogether with other Muscogee peoples.\n\nToday there are three federally recognized tribal governments and centers of\npopulation: the largest is the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana on of reservation\nland in Allen Parish. This is just north of the town of Elton, Louisiana. The\nnew Leatherwood Museum in Oakdale, the largest community in Allen Parish,\nfeatures an exhibit on the Coushatta.\n\nOther federally recognized Coushatta tribes are the 'Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of\nTexas', with a reservation near Livingston, Texas; and the '[[Alabama-Quassarte\nTribal Town]]' in Wetumka, Oklahoma.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Koasati","recorded":1362480912,"links":19,"instances":["creek","people","people"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Muskogean tribes","Native American tribes in Alabama","Native American tribes in Louisiana","Native American tribes in Texas","Native American tribes in Oklahoma","Federally recognized tribes in the United States","Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands"],"headings":["History","20th century to present","Film","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Bandera_Coushatta_Tribe.png/275px-Bandera_Coushatta_Tribe.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alabama","people"],["creek","people"],["georgia","u.s._state"],["muscogee","creek"],["muscogee","creek"],["alabama","people"]],"members":["muscogee","georgia","alabama","creek"],"related":["Alabama-Quassarte_Tribal_Town","United_States","Louisiana","Texas","Oklahoma","Christianity","English_language","Koasati_language","Alabama_(people)","Creek_(people)","Muskogean_languages","Muskogean","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","United_States","Louisiana","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Alabama","Seven_Years_War","Mississippi","Texas","Alabama","Oklahoma","Indian_Removal","Muscogee_(Creek)","Coushatta_Tribe_of_Louisiana","Allen_Parish,_Louisiana","Elton,_Louisiana","Oakdale,_Louisiana","Livingston,_Texas","Wetumka,_Oklahoma","Maize","Hernando_de_Soto","Spanish_Florida","Tennessee_River_Valley","List_of_sites_and_peoples_visited_by_the_Hernando_de_Soto_Expedition","Hernando_de_Soto","Alabama","Marion_County,_Tennessee","American_Revolution","Tennessee_River","Muscogee_(Creek)","Alabama_(people)","Creek_Confederacy","Long_King","Colita","Polk_County,_Texas","Livingston,_Texas","Koasati_language","Muskogean_languages","Crawfish","Jack_Abramoff","Jack_Abramoff_Indian_lobbying_scandal","United_States_District_Court_for_the_Western_District_of_Louisiana","F._A._Little,_Jr.","Alexandria,_Louisiana","Wetumka,_Oklahoma","Oklahoma_Indian_Welfare_Act","Muscogee_Creek_Nation","Livingston,_Texas"]}
