The reason is given in [[Powell v. Texas]], 392 U.S.\n514, 533 (1968):\n:...criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed some\n:act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in preventing.\nThe burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove each \"element of the offense\"\nin order for a defendant to be found guilty. The Model Penal Code รยง1.13(9)\noffers the following definition of the phrase \"elements of an offense\":\n:(i) such conduct or (ii) such attendant circumstances or (iii) such a result of\n:    conduct as\n::(a) is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition\n::    of the offense; or\n::(b) establishes the required kind of culpability; or\n::(c) negatives an excuse or justification for such conduct; or\n::(d) negatives a defense under the statute of limitations; or\n::(e) establishes jurisdiction or venue;\n","linknr":185,"url":"Attendant_circumstance","recorded":1362574283,"links":13,"instances":["criminal","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Criminal law","Legal terms"],"headings":["Discussion","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["guilt","law"],["conspiracy","criminal"]],"members":["conspiracy","guilt"],"related":["Law","Fact","Criminal_law","United_States","Actus_reus","Mens_rea","Legal_burden_of_proof","Prosecution","Defendant","Guilt_(law)","Model_Penal_Code","Chief_Justice_Rehnquist","Overt_act","Conspiracy_(criminal)","Excuse","Police","Punishment","Statute_of_limitation","Criminal_jurisdiction","Sixth_Amendment_to_the_U.S._Constitution","Federal_Rules_of_Criminal_Procedure","Extenuating_circumstances"]}
