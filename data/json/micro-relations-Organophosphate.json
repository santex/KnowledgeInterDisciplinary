{"cursor":"27331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'organophosphate' (sometimes abbreviated 'OP') is the general name for esters\nof phosphoric acid. Phosphates are probably the most pervasive organophosphorus\ncompounds. Many of the most important biochemicals are organophosphates,\nincluding DNA and RNA as well as many cofactors that are essential for life.\nOrganophosphates are the basis of many insecticides, herbicides, and nerve\ngases. The EPA lists organophosphates as very highly acutely toxic to bees,\nwildlife, and humans. Recent studies suggest a possible link to\nadverse effects in the neurobehavioral development of fetuses and children, even\nat very low levels of exposure. Organophosphates are widely used as solvents,\nplasticizers, and EP additives.\n\nOrganophosphates are widely employed both in natural and synthetic applications\nbecause of the ease with which organic groups can be linked together. Being a\ntriprotic acid, phosphoric acid can form triesters whereas carboxylic acids only\nform monoesters. Esterification entails the attachment of organic groups to\nphosphorus through oxygen linkers. The precursors to such esters are alcohols.\nEncompassing many thousands of natural and synthetic compounds, alcohols are\ndiverse and widespread. :OP(OH) 3 + ROH â OP(OH) 2(OR) +\nH 2O :OP(OH) 2(OR) + R'OH â OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + H 2O\n:OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + R\"OH â OP(OR)(OR')(OR\") + H 2O The phosphate esters\nbearing OH groups are acidic and partially deprotonated in aqueous solution. For\nexample, DNA and RNA are polymers of the type [PO 2(OR)(OR') -\n] n. Polyphosphates also form esters; an important example of an\nester of a polyphosphate is ATP, which is the monoester of triphosphoric acid\n(H 5P 3O 10 ).\n\nAlcohols can be detached from phosphate esters by hydrolysis, which is the\nreverse of the above reactions. For this reason, phosphate esters are common\ncarriers of organic groups in biosynthesis.\n","linknr":1059,"url":"Organophosphate","recorded":1362509988,"links":39,"instances":["chemical","biochemistry","biology","nerve_agent"],"pdf":["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/peds.2009-3058v1.pdf","http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/peds.2009-3058v1.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/espp/litstatus/effects/redleg-frog/2010/phosmet/assessment.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/espp/litstatus/effects/redleg-frog/2010/phosmet/assessment.pdf","http://www.iom-world.org/pubs/IOM_TM9902c.pdf","http://www.iom-world.org/pubs/IOM_TM9902b.pdf","http://www.iom-world.org/pubs/IOM_TM9902a.pdf"],"categories":["Organophosphates|"],"headings":["Organophosphate pesticides","Organophosphates as nerve agents","Organophosphate poisoning","Health effects","Proposals to ban and restrictions of use","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Phosphate_formula.svg/220px-Phosphate_formula.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/FcPthiocyanate2.jpg/220px-FcPthiocyanate2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["cell","biology"],["oxon","chemical"]],"members":["oxon","cofactor","cell","vx"],"related":["Ester","Phosphoric_acid","Organophosphorus_compound","DNA","RNA","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Insecticide","Herbicide","Nerve_gas","Solvent","Plasticizer","EP_additives","Ester","Carboxylic_acid","Alcohol","Acid","Deprotonation","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hydrolysis","Biosynthesis","Insecticides","Cholinesterase_enzyme","Carbamates","Sarin","Phosphorous_acid","Phosphinic_acid","VX_(nerve_agent)","Parathion","Malathion","Mediterranean_fruit_fly","West_Nile_Virus","Organochloride","DDT","Aldrin","Dieldrin","Parathion","Malathion","Methyl_parathion","Chlorpyrifos","Diazinon","Dichlorvos","Phosmet","Fenitrothion","Tetrachlorvinphos","Azamethiphos","Azinphos_methyl","Jean_Louis_Lassaigne","Philippe_de_Clermont","Cholinergic","Gerhard_Schrader","IG_Farben","Sarin","Tabun","Soman","Cholinergic","Diisopropylfluorophosphate","VX_(nerve_agent)","Parathion","Malathion","Organochlorine","DDT","Dieldrin","Heptachlor","Oxygen","Leaving_group","Halide","Sarin","VX_(nerve_agent)","Tetraethyl_pyrophosphate","Enzyme_inhibitor","Acetylcholinesterase","Mammals","Metabolism","Lipophilic","Oxidize","Thiocyanate","Aryl","Alkyl","Cyanamide","Nerve","Insects","Cell_(biology)","Acetylcholine","Neurotoxic","Toxicity","Oxon_(chemical)","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Carcinogen","Chlorpyrifos","ADHD","Alzheimer's_disease","ADHD","Organic_food","Pesticide_Action_Network","World_Health_Organization","Dichlorvos","Organophosphate_poisoning","Activity_based_protein_profiling","Mark_Purdey","Pesticide_toxicity_to_bees","Toxic_Oil_Syndrome","Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine","Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine","Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine"]}
