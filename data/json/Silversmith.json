{"cursor":"7938","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" goblet presented the Tsar of Russia by John III Sobieski King of Poland, 17th\n century, over 1m height.]] A 'silversmith' is a craftsman who makes objects\n from silver or gold. The terms 'silversmith' and 'goldsmith' are not exactly\n synonyms as the techniques, training, history, and guilds are or were largely\n the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects\n created. However most goldsmiths have always also worked in silver although the\n reverse may not be the case.\n\nSilversmithing is the art of turning silver and gold sheetmetal into hollowware\n(dishes, bowls, porringers, cups, vases, ewers, urns, etc.), flatware\n(silverware), and other articles of household silver, church plate or sculpture.\nIt may also include the making of jewellery.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Silversmith","recorded":1362480242,"links":26,"instances":["designer","metal","household","vessel","fuel","metallurgy","tool"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arts occupations","Silversmithing","Silversmiths|","Metalworking occupations"],"headings":["History","Tools, materials and techniques","Related and overlapping trades","Canadian observations","Notable silversmiths","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Kremlin_Armoury_1.JPG/170px-Kremlin_Armoury_1.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/T%26T_Hand-hammered_dish.jpg/220px-T%26T_Hand-hammered_dish.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Silver_band.png/170px-Silver_band.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/J_S_Copley_-_Paul_Revere.jpg/220px-J_S_Copley_-_Paul_Revere.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bowl","vessel"],["silver","household"],["file","tool"],["pickling","metal"],["annealing","metallurgy"],["coke","fuel"],["robert_welch","designer"]],"members":["robert_welch","pickling","silver","bowl","coke","annealing","file"],"related":["Goblet","Russia","John_III_Sobieski","Poland","Master_craftsman","Silver","Gold","Goldsmith","Synonyms","Guild","Sheetmetal","Hollowware","Dish","Bowl_(vessel)","Porringer","Drinkware","Vase","Ewer","Urn","Cutlery","Silver_(household)","Jewellery","Apprentice","Saw","Snips","File_(tool)","Hammer","Anvil","Swage_block","Riveting","Solder","Flux","Borax","Boric_acid","Torch","Blow-pipe","Pickling_(metal)","Firescale","Buffing_wheel","Polishing","Chasing","Repousse","Engraving","Annealing_(metallurgy)","Casting","Solder","Rivet","Charcoal","Coke_(fuel)","Forges","Blow-pipe","Laser_beam_welding","Copper","Brass","Jeweler","Precious_metal","Chain","Gemstone","Iron","Armor","Movie","Blacksmith","Jocelyn_Burton","Kurt_Aepli","Garrard_&_Co","Georg_Jensen","Benvenuto_Cellini","Georges_Cuyvers","Paul_Revere","Robert_Welch_(designer)","Jean-Valentin_Morel","Thomas_Germain","Fran√ßois-Thomas_Germain","Atsidi_Sani","Victoria_and_Albert_Museum"]}
