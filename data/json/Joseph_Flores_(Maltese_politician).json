{"cursor":"3406","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Joseph Flores' (1907â1974) was a judge and politician from Malta.\n\nFlores was born in 1907 in the Maltese town of Hamrun, close to the capital\nValletta. Following school he enrolled at the University of Malta (the main\nuniversity on the island) and began a course in the study of law. He used this\nto develop his career in the legal field, finally being appointed as a judge.\n\nFlores was drawn to the political sphere, but an attempt to gain election during\nthe 1932 Maltese national elections ended in failure. However, there was more\nsuccess during the 1950s when he was elected for three successive terms, serving\nas a member of the Malta Labour Party in the period before independence from\nGreat Britain. This was a period of turmoil for the Maltese left - a split\nbetween the MLP and the Maltese Workers Party led to the latter forming a\ncoalition with the Nationalists. From 1949 until 1955, Flores served as Deputy\nLeader of the MLP in the Assembly. It was not until 1955 that the MLP finally\nformed the government under the leadership of Dom Mintoff. This legislature came\nto be dominated by the issue of integration with the United Kingdom. ]] Such was\nFlores' position within the dominant Labour grouping that he was appointed the\nSpeaker of the Maltese Legislative Assembly that same year. He was later\nappointed Judge and thus he resigned as a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nFlores was also influential in introducing the policy of criminal probation in\nMalta. In 1955, he adopted some of the proposals that had been developed by Sir\nAlexander Paterson, HM Commissioner of Prisons for England and Malta. Paterson\nhad suggested using the social system already in place - in Malta's case the use\nof the police force and priesthood. M. Montebello, 'The Impact of\nRadicalisation on community punishments in Malta, 2007' from http://users.onvol-\n.net/98560/site/news/AGIS%20hate%202%20Research%20Study.doc\n\nShortly before his retirement he took up a further post as vice-president of the\nMaltese constitutional court.\n\nFlores was gay and it has been suggested that Flores had a relationship with the\nMaltese editor Herbert Ganado and served as his best man. Chetcuti describes\nhow, \"On the eve of the wedding, Flores dressed up as a woman, and on another\noccasion, Flores and others put on a drag show sending up Queen\nVictoria.\" Joseph Chetcuti in \"Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History, Ed\nAldrich and Wotherspoon, London, 2000 Queer Mediterranean Memories,\nJoseph Carmel Chetcuti, Australia, 2010\n\nAfter he retired he taught law again at the university in Malta. He died in\n1974.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","recorded":1375077000,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Hamrun","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/University_of_Malta","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Malta_Labour_Party","/wiki/Great_Britain","/w/index.php?title=Maltese_Workers_Party&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dom_Mintoff","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:Malta_Valletta_BW_2011-10-07_10-41-05.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Malta_Valletta_BW_2011-10-07_10-41-05.JPG/180px-Malta_Valletta_BW_2011-10-07_10-41-05.JPG","/wiki/File:Malta_Valletta_BW_2011-10-07_10-41-05.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Probation","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Herbert_Ganado","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Malta-related_topics","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://users.onvol.net/98560/site/news/AGIS%20hate%202%20Research%20Study.doc","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Malta.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Malta.svg/30px-Flag_of_Malta.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Malta-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Malta-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Malta-politician-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&oldid=557075126","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Speakers_of_the_House_of_Representatives_of_Malta","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_University_of_Malta","/wiki/Category:1907_births","/wiki/Category:LGBT_people_from_Malta","/wiki/Category:1974_deaths","/wiki/Category:Maltese_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:European_politician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_November_2009","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joseph+Flores+%28Maltese+politician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joseph+Flores+%28Maltese+politician%29","/wiki/Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","/wiki/Talk:Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","#","/wiki/Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&oldid=557075126","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Flores_(Maltese_politician)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wik
