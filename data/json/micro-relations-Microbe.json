{"cursor":"48372","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'' Bacteria magnified 10,000 times.]]\n\nA 'microorganism' (from the , mikrÃ³s, \"small\" and , organismÃ³s, \"organism\") or\n'microbe' is a microscopic organism, which may be a single cell or multicellular organism. The study of microorganisms is\ncalled microbiology, a subject that began with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's discovery\nof microorganisms in 1675, using a microscope of his own design.\n\nMicroorganisms are very diverse; they include all of the prokaryotes, namely the\nbacteria and archaea; and various forms of eukaryote, comprising the protozoa,\nfungi, algae, microscopic plants (green algae), and animals such as rotifers and\nplanarians. Some microbiologists also classify viruses as microorganisms, but\nothers consider these as nonliving. {{Cite\njournal |author=LWOFF A |title=The concept of virus |journal=J. Gen.

Microorganisms are critical to nutrient recycling in ecosystems\nas they act as decomposers. As some microorganisms can fix nitrogen, they are a\nvital part of the nitrogen cycle, and recent studies indicate that airborne\nmicrobes may play a role in precipitation and weather.\n\nMicrobes are also exploited by people in biotechnology, both in traditional food\nand beverage preparation, and in modern technologies based on genetic\nengineering. However there are many pathogenic microbes which are harmful and\ncan even cause death in plants and\nanimals.
