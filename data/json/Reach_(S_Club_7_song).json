The lyrics were probably\n inspired by a Shirley Bassey double A-side of \"Reach For The Stars\" and \"Climb\n Every Mountain\" although the song itself sounds nothing like either of those\n two. The song debut at its number 2 peak on the UK charts, with first week\n sales of almost 124,000 (more than the first week sales of their two previous\n singles). It spent 3 weeks at its peak, unable to dislodge Sonique's \"It Feels\n So Good\" from number one. It is one of the group's most popular songs. Reach\n was the theme tune to the second series of the group's CBBC series, [[L.A. 7]].\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Reach_(S_Club_7_song)","recorded":1363582956,"links":[],"instances":["musician","s_club_juniors_song","s_club_7_album","s_club_7_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["S Club songs","2000 singles","Songs written by Cathy Dennis"],"headings":["Song information and music video","Formats and track listings","Alternative versions","Charts","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["7","s_club_7_album"],["natural","s_club_7_song"],["sonique","musician"],["7","s_club_7_album"],["one_step_closer","s_club_juniors_song"]],"members":["sonique","one_step_closer","7","natural"],"related":["S_Club","7_(S_Club_7_album)","United_Kingdom","CD_single","Compact_Cassette","London","England","Pop_music","Polydor_Records","Cathy_Dennis","Two_in_a_Million/You're_My_Number_One","Natural_(S_Club_7_song)","S_Club_7","Cathy_Dennis","Republica","Sonique_(musician)","It_Feels_So_Good","CBBC","Boyfriends_&_Birthdays","7_(S_Club_7_album)","Almighty_Records","S_Club_7","S_Club_Juniors","One_Step_Closer_(S_Club_Juniors_song)","ARIA_Charts","German_Singles_Chart","Irish_Singles_Chart","Recording_Industry_Association_of_New_Zealand","Swedish_Singles_Chart","Swiss_Music_Charts","UK_Singles_Chart","UK_Singles_Chart"]}
