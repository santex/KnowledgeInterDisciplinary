{"cursor":"15890","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'intein' is a segment of a protein that is able to excise itself and rejoin\nthe remaining portions (the 'exteins') with a peptide bond in a process termed\nprotein splicing. Inteins have also been called \"protein introns\".\n\nIntein-mediated protein splicing occurs after the intein-containing mRNA has\nbeen translated into a protein. This precursor protein contains three segments\nâ€” an 'N-extein' followed by the intein followed by a 'C-extein'. After\nsplicing has taken place, the resulting protein contains the N-extein linked to\nthe C-extein; this splicing product is also termed an extein.\n","linknr":240,"url":"Inteins","recorded":1362670209,"links":20,"instances":["molecular_biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Molecular genetics","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["History","Mechanism","Inteins in biotechnology","Intein naming conventions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Intein_mech.png/280px-Intein_mech.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["homology","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"]],"members":["directionality","homology","translation"],"related":["Protein","Peptide_bond","Protein_splicing","Intron","Protein_splicing","MRNA","Translation_(biology)","Vacuole","ATPase","Homology_(biology)","Ion_transporter","Three-domain_system","Virus","Endonuclease","Gene","Parasite","Richard_Dawkins","Allele","Hedgehog_protein","Native_chemical_ligation","Serine","Threonine","Cysteine","Nucleophile","Peptide_bond","Ester","Thioester","Transesterification","N-terminus","Asparagine","Amide","Imide","Amine","Ligated","Biotechnology","Amino_acid","Peptide_synthesis","Protein_NMR","Enzyme_inhibitor","Drug_development","Allotopic_expression","Hydrophobe","Mitochondria","Gene_therapy","Wild-type","Binomial_nomenclature","Organism","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Homing_endonuclease","Allele","Homologous_chromosome","Cyanobacteria","DnaE","DNA_polymerase_III_holoenzyme","Gene_product","Intragenomic_conflict","Intron","Protein_splicing","RNA_splicing"]}
