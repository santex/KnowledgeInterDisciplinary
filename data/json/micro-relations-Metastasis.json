The plural is metastases.\n\nCancer occurs after a single cell in a tissue is progressively genetically\ndamaged to produce a cancer stem cell possessing a malignant phenotype. These\ncancer stem cells are able to undergo uncontrolled abnormal mitosis, which\nserves to increase the total number of cancer cells at that location. When the\narea of cancer cells at the originating site becomes clinically detectable, it\nis called a primary tumor. Some cancer cells also acquire the ability to\npenetrate and infiltrate surrounding normal tissues in the local area, forming a\nnew tumor. The newly formed \"daughter\" tumor in the adjacent site within the\ntissue is called a local metastasis.\n\nSome cancer cells acquire the ability to penetrate the walls of lymphatic and/or\nblood vessels, after which they are able to circulate through the bloodstream\n(circulating tumor cells) to other sites and tissues in the body. This process\nis known (respectively) as lymphatic or hematogeneous spread.\n\nAfter the tumor cells come to rest at another site, they re-penetrate the vessel\nor walls and continue to multiply, eventually forming another clinically\ndetectable tumor. This new tumor is known as a metastatic (or secondary) tumor.\nMetastasis is one of three hallmarks of malignancy (contrast benign tumors). {{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Vinay |last2=Abbas |first2=Abul\nK |last3=Fausto |first3=Nelson |last4=Robbins |first4=Stanley L |last5=Cotran\n|first5=Ramzi S |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease\n|edition=7th |year=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7216-0187-\n8 }}  Most neoplasms can metastasize, although in varying degrees (e.g.,\nbasal cell carcinoma rarely metastasize).\n\nWhen tumor cells metastasize, the new tumor is called a secondary or metastatic\ntumor, and its cells are similar to those in the original tumor. This means, for\nexample, that, if breast cancer metastasizes to the lungs, the secondary tumor\nis made up of abnormal breast cells, not of abnormal lung cells. The tumor in\nthe lung is then called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.\n","linknr":581,"url":"Metastasis","recorded":1362543410,"links":67,"instances":["medical","biology","anatomy","pathologist","language"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n5/pdf/nrg2101.pdf","http://www.biosignaling.com/content/pdf/1478-811x-8-23.pdf"],"categories":["Oncology"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Management","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Secondary_tumor_deposits_in_the_liver_from_a_primary_cancer_of_the_pancreas.jpg/230px-Secondary_tumor_deposits_in_the_liver_from_a_primary_cancer_of_the_pancreas.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Symptoms_of_cancer_metastasis.png/220px-Symptoms_of_cancer_metastasis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Metastasis_sites_for_common_cancers.svg/240px-Metastasis_sites_for_common_cancers.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Lymph_node_with_metastatic_melanoma.jpg/220px-Lymph_node_with_metastatic_melanoma.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Bone_metastasis.jpg/75px-Bone_metastasis.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Lymph_node_with_papillary_thyroid_carcinoma.jpg/120px-Lymph_node_with_papillary_thyroid_carcinoma.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/MultipleLiverMets2008.jpg/120px-MultipleLiverMets2008.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/LungMets2008.jpg/120px-LungMets2008.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Adenocarcinoma_liver_metastasis.jpg/62px-Adenocarcinoma_liver_metastasis.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["greek","language"],["tissue","biology"],["vertigo","medical"],["james_ewing","pathologist"]],"members":["vertigo","tissue","organ","james_ewing","greek"],"related":["Liver","Pancreatic_cancer","Cancer","Organ_(anatomy)","Cancer","Tumor_cell","Infection","Greek_(language)","Cancer","Tissue_(biology)","Stem_cell","Malignant","Phenotype","Mitosis","Cancer_cell","Primary_tumor","Lymphatic_vessel","Blood_vessel","Bloodstream","Circulating_tumor_cell","Cancer","Benign_tumor","Neoplasia","Basal_cell_carcinoma","Breast_cancer","Symptoms_of_metastasis","Lungs","Liver","Brain","Bone","Lymph_nodes","Lymphadenopathy","Cough","Hemoptysis","Dyspnea","Hepatomegaly","Liver","Nausea","Jaundice","Fracture","Neurology","Vertigo_(medical)","Pain","Lymph_nodes","Lysis","Lung","Liver","Brain","Bone","Protein","Extracellular_matrix","Chemokines","Transforming_growth_factor_beta","Metastasis_suppressor","Motility","Amoeboid_movement","Angiogenesis","Angiogenesis_inhibitor","Endothelial_progenitor_cell","ID1","Peritoneal_cavity","Pleural_cavity","Ovarian_cancer","Mesothelioma","Lung_cancer","Pleural","Pleural_effusion","Carcinoma","Sarcoma","Lymph_node","Lymph_node","Prognosis","Stephen_Paget","Prostate_cancer","Colon_cancer","Stomach_cancer","Ovary","Krukenberg_tumor","Ion","Melanoma","Neural","Melanocyte","Cell_line","Embryo","James_Ewing_(pathologist)","Oncology_unit","Cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin","Unknown_primary_tumors","Lung_cancer","Bladder_cancer","Immunohistochemistry","Melanoma","Autopsy","Lung_cancer","Breast_cancer","Melanoma","Colon_cancer","Renal_cell_carcinoma","Prostate_cancer","Pancreatic_cancer","Cervical_cancer","Breast_cancer","Immunohistochemistry","Fluorescent_in_situ_hybridization","Biopsy","Somatic","Adenocarcinomas","SNRPF","HNRPAB","DHPS","Securin","Actin","Myosin","MHC_class_II","Adenocarcinoma","Breast_cancer","Medulloblastoma","Prostate_cancer","Humerus","Cancer","Micrograph","Papillary_thyroid_carcinoma","Lymph_node","H&E_stain","Ct_scan","Ct_scan","Liver","Biopsy","Adenocarcinoma","H&E_stain","Leukemia","Radiosurgery","Chemotherapy","Radiation_therapy","Biological_therapy","Hormone_therapy","Surgery","Cancer","Testicular_cancer","Thyroid_cancer","Disseminated_disease","Brown–Séquard_syndrome","Brain_metastasis","National_Cancer_Institute","Children's_Hospital_Boston"]}
