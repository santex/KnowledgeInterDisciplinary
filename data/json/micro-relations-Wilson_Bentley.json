Probably the absolutely first photographer of snowflakes was Dr.\nJohann Heinrich FlÃ¶gel (1834-1918) from Ahrensburg, Germany in 1879: http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/artikeldetail/article/111/wem-\ngehoert-die-erste-foto-flocke.html He perfected a process of catching\nflakes on black velvet in such a way that their images could be captured before\nthey either melted or sublimated.\n\nKenneth G. Libbrecht notes that the techniques used by Bentley to photograph\nsnowflakes are essentially the same as used today, and that whilst the quality\nof his photographs reflect the technical limitations of the equipment of the era\n\"he did it so well that hardly anybody bothered to photograph snowflakes for\nalmost 100 years\". \"Historic Bentley snowflake photos for sale in US\", BBC\nNews, 22 January 2010\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8473771.stm] The broadest\ncollection of Bentley's photographs is held by the Jericho Historical Society in\nhis home town, Jericho, Vermont.\n\nBentley donated his collection of original glass-plate photomicrographs of snow\ncrystals to the Buffalo Museum of Science. A portion of this collection has been\ndigitized and organized into a digital library.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Wilson_Bentley","recorded":1362892185,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry","book"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1865 births","1931 deaths","People from Jericho, Vermont","American photographers","American meteorologists","Nature photographers","Pioneers of photography","Infectious disease deaths in Vermont","Deaths from pneumonia"],"headings":["Biography","Popular culture","See also","References","Bibliography","Other reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Wilson_Alwyn_Bentley_snima_emulzi_ze_sklenene_desky.jpg/220px-Wilson_Alwyn_Bentley_snima_emulzi_ze_sklenene_desky.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg/220px-SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Wilson_A._Bentley_snowflake%2C_1890.jpg/220px-Wilson_A._Bentley_snowflake%2C_1890.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["jericho","town,_vermont"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["snowflake_bentley","book"],["jericho","town,_vermont"],["jericho","town,_vermont"]],"members":["sublimation","jericho","snowflake_bentley"],"related":["Jericho_(town),_Vermont","Vermont","Photography","Snowflake","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Kenneth_G._Libbrecht","Jericho_Historical_Society","Buffalo_Museum_of_Science","Snow","Crystal","Microscope","Bellows_camera","Chalkboard","Microscope_slide","Subzero","Ephemeral","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Karl_Blossfeldt","Harvard_Mineralogical_Museum","Micrograph","George_Henry_Perkins","University_of_Vermont","1931_in_science","William_Jackson_Humphreys","U.S._Weather_Bureau","Monograph","Illustration","Cloud","Fog","Raindrop","Physicist","Pneumonia","Johnson_State_College","Tilly_and_the_Wall","Indie_pop","Caldecott_Medal","Snowflake_Bentley_(book)","Snow_Cake","Alan_Rickman","Sigourney_Weaver","Carrie-Anne_Moss","Ukichiro_Nakaya","Mary_Azarian","Mary_Azarian","Caldecott_Medal","Photographer","Snow","Jericho_(town),_Vermont","Vermont","United_States","Jericho_(town),_Vermont","Vermont","United_States"]}
