{"cursor":"5103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]]\n\nA 'mobile device' (also known as a 'handheld device', 'handheld computer' or\nsimply 'handheld') is a small, hand-held computing device, typically having a\ndisplay screen with touch input and/or a miniature keyboard and weighing less\nthan . Apple, HTC, LG, Research in Motion (RIM) and Motorola are just a few\nexamples of the many manufacturers that produce these types of devices.\n\nA handheld computing device has an operating system (OS), and can run various\ntypes of application software, known as apps. Most hand held devices can also be\nequipped with WI-FI, Bluetooth and GPS capabilities that can allow connections\nto the Internet and other Bluetooth capable devices such as an automobile or a\nmicrophone headset. A camera or media player feature for video or music files\ncan also be typically found on these devices along with a stable battery power\nsource such as a lithium battery.\n\nEarly pocket sized ones were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise\nsimilar tablet computers. As in a personal digital assistant (PDA), the input\nand output are often combined into a touch-screen interface.\n\nSmartphones and PDAs are popular amongst those who wish to use some of the\npowers of a conventional computer in environments where carrying one would not\nbe practical. Enterprise digital assistants can further extend the available\nfunctionality for the business user by offering integrated data capture devices\nlike barcode, RFID and smart card readers.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Mobile_device","recorded":1362688923,"links":36,"instances":["computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Personal digital assistants","Mobile computers","Information appliances"],"headings":["Types","Uses","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III_Pebble_Blue_WikiWikipedia.png/170px-Samsung_Galaxy_S_III_Pebble_Blue_WikiWikipedia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interface","computer_science"]],"members":["interface"],"related":["Computing_device","Touchscreen","Application_software","Mobile_app","Tablet_computer","Personal_digital_assistant","Interface_(computer_science)","Smartphone","Enterprise_digital_assistant","Barcode","RFID","Smart_card","Mobile_computing","Mobile_collaboration","Mobile_internet_device","Mobile_Web","Smartphone","Tablet_computer","Personal_digital_assistant","Enterprise_digital_assistant","Calculator","Handheld_game_console","Portable_media_player","Digital_still_camera","Digital_video_camera","Camcorder","Mobile_phone","Smartphone","Feature_phone","Pager","Personal_navigation_device","Tablet_computer","Rugged_computer","Field_Service_Management","Digitizing","Invoice","Mobile_asset_management","Barcode_scanner","Mobile_collaboration","Teleconferencing","Smartphone","PDA","Ultra-Mobile_PC","Tablet_computer","Laptop","Internet_television","Television_receiver","Converged_device","List_of_emerging_technologies","Mobile_collaboration","HTML5_in_mobile_devices","Portable_communications_device","Mobile_computing","Near_field_communication"]}
