It is stimulated by decreased O 2 in circulation, which\nis detected by the kidneys, which then secrete the hormone erythropoietin. Sherwood, L, Klansman, H, Yancey, P: Animal\nPhysiology, Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning, 2005. This hormone stimulates\nproliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors, which activates\nincreased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues, ultimately producing red\nblood cells. In postnatal birds and mammals\n(including humans), this usually occurs within the red bone marrow. In the early fetus, erythropoiesis takes place in\nthe mesodermal cells of the yolk sac. By the third or fourth month,\nerythropoiesis moves to the spleen and liver.\nAfter seven months, erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow. Increased level of\nphysical activity can cause an increase in erythropoiesis. {{Cite book\n  | last1 = Le | first1 = Tao first2 = Vikas | last2 = Bhushan first3 = Neil |\n  | last3 = Vasan title = location = USA publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies,\n  | Inc. year= 2010 pages = 124 isbn = 978-0-07-163340-6 }}\n However, in humans with certain diseases and in some animals,\nerythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow, within the spleen or liver.\nThis is termed [[Haematopoiesis#Extramedullary|extramedullary erythropoiesis]].\n\nThe bone marrow of essentially all the bones produces RBCs until a person is\naround five years old. The tibia and femur cease to be important sites of\nhematopoiesis by about age 25; the vertebrae, sternum, pelvis and ribs, and\ncranial bones continue to produce red blood cells throughout life.\n","linknr":276,"url":"Erythropoiesis","recorded":1362568516,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hematopoiesis"],"headings":["Erythrocyte differentiation","Characteristics seen in erythrocytes during erythropoiesis","Regulation of erythropoiesis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Illu_blood_cell_lineage.jpg/400px-Illu_blood_cell_lineage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["The_McGraw-Hill_Companies,_Inc.","Red_blood_cell","Kidney","Erythropoietin","Hemopoietic","Red_blood_cells","Postnatal","Bird","Mammal","Humans","Red_bone_marrow","Fetus","Yolk_sac","The_McGraw-Hill_Companies,_Inc.","Humans","Diseases","Animals","Bone_marrow","Spleen","Liver","Bone_marrow","Bone","Red_blood_cell","Years","Tibia","Femur","Hematopoiesis","Vertebra","Human_sternum","Pelvis","Rib","Cranial_bones","Bone_marrow","Hemocytoblast","Stem_cell","Common_myeloid_progenitor","Unipotent_stem_cell","Pronormoblast","Basophilic_normoblast","Orthochromatic_normoblast","Reticulocyte","Wright's_stain","Cell_nucleus","Femtolitre","Vitamin_B12","Folic_acid","Reticulocytopenia","RNA","DNA","Erythropoietin","Thrombosis","Stroke","Hepcidin","Macrophages","Hemoglobin","Anemia","Haemoglobin","Polycythemia"]}
