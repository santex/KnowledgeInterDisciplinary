For a jump with counterclockwise\nrotation, this is the right back outside edge. It is named from its similarity\nto the loop compulsory figure. The invention is widely credited to Werner\nRittberger, and the jump is also known as the \"Rittberger\" in Europe. However,\nevidence exists that it may have been first done as early as the\n1880s.
