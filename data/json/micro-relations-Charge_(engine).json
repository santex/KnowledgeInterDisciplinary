{"cursor":"50147","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" exhaust.]] engine partly opened and colored to show components.]] The 'internal\n combustion engine' is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel (normally a\n fossil fuel) occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber that\n is an integral part of the working fluid flow circuit. In an internal\n combustion engine (ICE) the expansion of the high-temperature and high-pressure\n gases produced by combustion apply direct force to some component of the\n engine. The force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle.\n This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy\n into useful mechanical energy. The first commercially successful internal\n combustion engine was created by Ãtienne Lenoir.\n\nThe term [[wiktionary:internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine]]\nusually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the\nmore familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants,\nsuch as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second\nclass of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines,\njet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion\nengines on the same principle as previously described.\n\nThe ICE is quite different from external combustion engines, such as steam or\nStirling engines, in which the energy is delivered to a working fluid not\nconsisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by combustion products. Working\nfluids can be air, hot water, pressurized water or even liquid sodium, heated in\nsome kind of boiler. ICEs are usually powered by energy-dense fuels such as\ngasoline or diesel, liquids derived from fossil fuels. While there are many\nstationary applications, most ICEs are used in mobile applications and are the\ndominant power supply for cars, aircraft, and boats.\n","linknr":872,"url":"Charge_(engine)","recorded":1362560117,"links":98,"instances":["physics","engine","united_states","engine_mechanics","engine","auto","automotive","engine","unit","engine","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.ansys.com/assets/testimonials/siemens.pdf","http://www.ansys.com/assets/testimonials/siemens.pdf","https://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf","https://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf","http://www.oxford.gov.uk/Direct/2_Item%205.6.pdf","http://www.oxford.gov.uk/Direct/2_Item%205.6.pdf"],"categories":["Internal
