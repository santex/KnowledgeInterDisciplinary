{"cursor":"51156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Population genetics' is the study of allele frequency distribution and change\nunder the influence of the four main evolutionary processes: natural selection,\ngenetic drift, mutation and gene flow. It also takes into account the factors of\nrecombination, population subdivision and population structure. It attempts to\nexplain such phenomena as adaptation and speciation.\n\nPopulation genetics was a vital ingredient in the emergence of the modern\nevolutionary synthesis. Its primary founders were Sewall Wright, J. B. S.\nHaldane and R. A. Fisher, who also laid the foundations for the related\ndiscipline of quantitative genetics.\n\nTraditionally a highly mathematical discipline, modern population genetics\nencompasses theoretical, lab and field work.\n","linknr":1169,"url":"Population_Genetics","recorded":1362374208,"links":61,"instances":["biology","population_genetics","biology","statistics","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","engineering","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.esp.org/books/sturt/history/contents/sturt-history-ch-17.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","Population
