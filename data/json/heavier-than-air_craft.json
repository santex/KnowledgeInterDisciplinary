      "text" : "\n\n\n, the world's largest passenger airliner]]\n\nAn 'aircraft' is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air,\nor, in general, the atmosphere of a planet.<!--English word \"aircraft\" is\nsingular and plural with no \"s\". See also the link to Wiktionary below.--> It\ncounters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the\ndynamic lift of an airfoil,<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft\ndictionary.com definition of aircraft]</ref> or in a few cases the downward\nthrust from jet engines.\n\nThe human activity that surrounds aircraft is called [[aviation]]. Crewed\naircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be\nremotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may\nbe classified by different criteria, such as lift type, propulsion, usage\nand others.\n",
