Since 1987, it was added to\nthe arsenal of the Soviet Army and the KGB.\n\nIts effective range is approximately 300 m, as it uses heavy subsonic 9x39mm SP-\n6 (high performance armor piercing) ammunition, as well as the SP-5 ball round\nused by the VSS Vintorez. It can also use the same 10 or 20-round magazines as\nthe VSS. Controls are similar to all AK-type rifles with charging handle on the\nright side, tangent rear sight, magazine release button behind magazine well and\nsafety lever above the trigger guard. The fire selector is however located\nwithin the trigger guard, behind the trigger. The \"Val\" has two modes of fire,\nsingle shot and automatic fire at a cyclic rate of 900 RPM. According to its\nusers, the \"Val\" is reliable, accurate and well liked.\n\nIt has an AK-type side mount for various optical sights, including the 4x PSO-1\nscope and night sights calibrated for use with the 9x39mm round. The standard\nopen sights are graduated up to 400 m in 25 m increments.\n\nThe \"Val\" has a 70% piece commonality with its sister-gun, the VSS Vintorez.\nDifferences are furniture made of high impact polymer and a skeletonized steel\nstock which folds to the left for storage and transportation (gun can operate\nwith stock folded).\n","linknr":142,"url":"AS_Val","recorded":1362685505,"links":31,"instances":["russia","russia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Silenced firearms","Assault rifles","Weapons of Russia"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Val2.jpg/300px-Val2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_Soviet_Union.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/SIG220-Morges.jpg/35px-SIG220-Morges.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mvd","russia"],["fsb","russia"]],"members":["fsb","mvd"],"related":["Assault_rifle","First_Chechen_War","Second_Chechen_War","2008_South_Ossetia_war","TsNIITochMash","Tula_Arms_Plant","VSS_rifle","SR-3_Vikhr","9x39mm","Gas-operated_reloading","Rotating_bolt","Russian_Language","Assault_rifle","Suppressor","TsNIITochMash","Spetsnaz","MVD_(Russia)","FSB_(Russia)","Russian_Ground_Forces","9x39mm","VSS_Vintorez","PSO-1","List_of_Russian_Weaponry","List_of_equipment_of_the_Russian_Ground_Forces"]}
