{"cursor":"14939","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Agreement' or 'concord' happens when a word changes form depending on the other\nwords to which it relates.\n\nFor example, one does not say I is in English, because I and is disagree in\nperson. The word is is said not to agree with the word I. This is why the\ngrammatical form is I am, even though the verb still has the same function and\nbasic meaning.\n\nThe agreement based on overt grammatical numbers as above is 'formal agreement',\nin contrast to notional agreement that does so based on\nmeaning. For instance, the phrase The United States is\nconsidered singular, alltough the phrase is in fact plural.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Agreement_(linguistics)","recorded":1362891407,"links":33,"instances":["grammar","linguistics","french","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntactic relationships"],"headings":["Causes","Examples","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["liaison","french"],["predicate","grammar"],["copula","linguistics"],["redundancy","linguistics"]],"members":["predicate","redundancy","liaison","copula"],"related":["Grammatical_person","Grammatical_number","Synesis","The_United_States","Plural","Grammatical_categories","Grammatical_person","Grammatical_number","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_case","Japanese_language","Malay_language","English_language","French_language","Greek_language","Latin_language","Swahili_language","Indicative","Affix","Sibilant","Defective_verb","Modal_verb","Early_Modern_English","Subjunctive_mood","Auxiliary_verb","Romance_languages","Null-subject_language","Liaison_(French)","Participle","Verb_argument","Predicate_(grammar)","Copula_(linguistics)","Slavic_languages","Bulgarian_language","Macedonian_language","Animacy","Serbian_language","Swahili_language","Bantu_languages","Noun_class","Case_government","Declension","Inflection","Redundancy_(linguistics)","Sequence_of_tenses","Synthetic_language"]}
