There are two types of reruns&mdash;those that occur during a hiatus,\nand those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the\ncase with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (e.g.\nin the afternoon).\n\nIn the UK, the word \"repeat\" refers only to a single episode; \"rerun\" or\n\"rerunning\" is the preferred term for an entire series/season. \"Repeat\" is also\nused to refer to programs shown less than a week after the original broadcast,\nbefore the next episode of the series.\n\nThe term \"rerun\" can also be used in some respects as a synonym for [[reprint]],\nthe equivalent term for print items; this is especially true for print items\nthat are part of ongoing series (such as comic strips; [[Peanuts]], for\ninstance, has been in reruns since the retirement and death of creator Charles\nM. Schulz).\n","title":"rerun","headings":["Reruns in the United States","Repeats in the United Kingdom","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: United_Kingdom","2: Broadcast_syndication","2: Videotape","2: Sweeps","2: Situation_comedy","2: Reality_television","1: Radio","1: Television","1: Broadcasting","1: Dayparting","1: Comic_strip","1: Charles_M._Schulz","1: United_States","1: Kinescope","1: East_Coast_of_the_United_States","1: West_Coast_of_the_United_States","1: Television_special","1: VCR","1: List_of_Peanuts_media","1: Holiday_season","1: Money","1: Cable_television","1: 100_episodes","1: List_of_TV_series_with_episodes_in_the_public_domain","1: Wiping","1: Copyright_Act_of_1976","1: Satellite_television","1: Digital_subchannel","1: SyndEx","1: Monochrome","1: Radio_format","1: Oldies","1: Classic_rock","1: Classic_hits","1: Adult_standards","1: Public_domain","1: Nick_at_Nite","1: TV_Land","1: USA_Network","1: WGN_America","1: TVGN","1: Hub_Network","1: Game_Show_Network","1: Nicktoons_Network","1: The_Inspiration_Network","1: RFD-TV","1: Hallmark_Channel","1: Digital_television","1: Retro_Television_Network","1: Antenna_TV","1: Me-TV","1: This_TV","1: Bounce_TV","1: Equity_Media_Holdings#Retro_Television_Network_Stations","1: Low-power_broadcasting","1: Daystar_Television_Network","1: Game_show","1: Variety_show","1: Saturday_morning_cartoon","1: Newsmagazine","1: Late-night_talk_show","1: Niche_market","1: MSG_Network","1: ESPN_Classic","1: NFL_Network","1: DVD","1: Box_set","1: Television_series","1: Soap_opera","1: BBC","1: ITV","1: Channel_4","1: Sky_Television_plc","1: Atlantic_Ocean","1: British_Actors'_Equity_Association","1: Terrestrial_television"]}
