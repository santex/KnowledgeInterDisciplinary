in the East Midlands of England, and the county town of\nLeicestershire. The city lies on the River Soar and at the edge of the National\nForest. In the 2011 census, the population of the Leicester unitary authority\nwas 330,000, the highest in the region, whilst 480,000 people lived in the wider\nLeicester Urban Area in 2011, making Leicester the tenth largest city in the\nUnited Kingdom and the UK's fourteenth largest urban area. It is the largest\ncity in the East Midlands with a population of 330,000 and second largest in the\nMidlands behind its much larger neighbour Birmingham. It has the second largest\nurban area in the East Midlands region. Eurostat's Larger Urban Zone listed the\npopulation of Leicester LUZ at 806,100 people as of 2009. According to the 2011\ncensus Leicester had the largest proportion of people aged 19-and-under in the\nEast Midlands with 27 per cent.\n\nLeicestershire is a major commercial and manufacturing centre. Its economy is\nthe largest in the East Midlands, accounting for almost a quarter of the\nregion's GDP (£11billion) and providing jobs for 437,000 people.\n\n\"Unlike almost every other city in the UK, Leicester has retained a remarkable\nrecord of its past in buildings that still stand today\".<ref></ref> Ancient\nRoman pavements and baths remain in Leicester from its early settlement as Ratae\nCorieltauvorum, a Roman military outpost in a region inhabited by the Celtic\nCorieltauvi tribe. Following the demise of Roman society the early medieval\nRatae Corieltauvorum is shrouded in obscurity, but when the settlement was\ncaptured by the Danes it became one of five fortified towns important to the\nDanelaw. The name \"Leicester\" is thought to derive from the words castra of the\n\"Ligore\", meaning camp of the dwellers on the (river) Legro.<ref>Leicester is on\nthe River Soar and Legro or Leire could have been the name of the tributary at\nLeire. \"Legorensis civitas\" (803) and \"Ligera ceaster\" (917) are the earliest\nforms; William of Malmesbury says Leicester is named \"a Legra fluvio\" (from the\nriver Legra). Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-\nnames; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 280</ref> Leicester appears in the\n[[Domesday Book]] as \"Ledecestre\". Leicester continued to grow throughout the\nEarly Modern period as a market town, although it was the Industrial Revolution\nthat facilitated a process of rapid unplanned urbanisation in the area.\n\nA newly constructed rail and canal network routed through the area stimulated\nindustrial growth in the 19th century, and Leicester became a major economic\ncentre with a variety of manufacturers engaged in engineering, shoemaking and\nhosiery production. The economic success of these industries, and businesses\nancillary to them, resulted in significant urban expansion into the surrounding\ncountryside. Leicester is one of the oldest cities in England, it was the centre\nof the bishopric from around 670, endowing it with city status. However, it lost\ncity status in the 11th century during a time of struggle between the church and\nthe aristocracy. The boundaries of Leicester were extended several times in the\n19th and 20th centuries; it became a county borough in 1889, and was re-granted\ncity status in 1919.\n\nToday, Leicester is located on the Midland Main Line and close to the M1\nmotorway. The city has the highest ethnic minority population in the United\nKingdom in terms of its size, particularly of South Asian origin, a product of\nimmigration to the United Kingdom since the Second World War. To cater for the\nSouth Asian community, there are many Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and other places of\nworship and the Melton Road district serves as a focus, containing a large\nnumber of Asian restaurants and other small businesses. Leicester is a centre\nfor higher education, with both the University of Leicester and De Montfort\nUniversity being based in the city.\n","title":"leicester","headings":["History","Geography","Government","Demography","Economy","Landmarks","Transport","Education","Culture","In popular culture","Sport","Public services","Notable
