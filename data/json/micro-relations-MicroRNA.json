'miRNA') is a small non-coding RNA molecule (ca. 22\nnucleotides) found in plants and animals, which functions in transcriptional and\npost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression . Encoded by\neukaryotic nuclear DNA, miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary\nsequences within mRNA molecules, usually resulting in gene silencing via\ntranslational repression or target degradation. The human genome may\nencode over 1000 miRNAs, [http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-\nbin/mirna_summary.pl?org=hsa Homo sapiens miRNAs in the miRBase] at Manchester\nUniversity which may target about 60% of\nmammalian genes and are abundant in many human cell types.\n\nmiRNAs are well conserved in eukaryotic organisms and are thought to be a vital\nand evolutionarily ancient component of genetic regulation. While core components\nof the microRNA pathway are conserved between plants and animals, miRNA\nrepertoires in the two kingdoms appear to have evolved independently with\ndifferent modes of function. Plant miRNAs usually\nhave perfect or near-perfect pairing with their messenger RNA targets and induce\ngene repression through degradation of their target transcripts. Plant miRNAs may bind\ntheir targets in both coding regions and untranslated regions. In contrast, animal miRNAs typically exhibit only partial\ncomplementarity to their mRNA targets. A 'seed region' of about 6-8 nucleotides\nin length at the 5' end of an animal miRNA is thought to be an important\ndeterminant of target specificity. Combinatorial regulation is a feature of miRNA regulation. A\ngiven miRNA may have multiple different mRNA targets, and a given target might\nsimilarly be targeted by multiple miRNAs.\n\nThe first miRNAs were characterized in the early 1990s. However, miRNAs were not recognized as a distinct\nclass of biological regulators with conserved functions until the early 2000s.\nSince then, miRNA research has revealed multiple roles in negative regulation\n(transcript degradation and sequestering, translational suppression) and\npossible involvement in positive regulation (transcriptional and translational\nactivation). By affecting gene regulation, miRNAs are likely to be involved in\nmost biological processes. Different sets of\nexpressed miRNAs are found in different cell types and tissues.\n\nAberrant expression of miRNAs has been implicated in numerous disease states,\nand miRNA-based therapies are under investigation.\n","linknr":1683,"url":"MicroRNA","recorded":1362374426,"links":46,"instances":["molecular_biology","biology","biology","protein","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.laboratoriosilesia.com/upfiles/sibi/d_014_micrornas.pdf","http://www.laboratoriosilesia.com/upfiles/sibi/d_014_micrornas.pdf"],"categories":["Articles with inconsistent citation formats","RNA","MicroRNA|"],"headings":["History","Nomenclature","Biogenesis","The RNA-induced silencing complex","miRNA turnover","Cellular functions","Evolution","Experimental detection and manipulation of miRNA","miRNA and disease","miRNA and non-coding RNAs","miRNA and viruses","See also","References","Further reading","External links","({{NoMoreLinks}})",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/MiRNA.svg/400px-MiRNA.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Microrna_secondary_structure.png/220px-Microrna_secondary_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/MiRNA-biogenesis.jpg/400px-MiRNA-biogenesis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/MiRNA_mechanisms.jpg/320px-MiRNA_mechanisms.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Role_of_miRNA_in_a_cancer_cell.svg/220px-Role_of_miRNA_in_a_cancer_cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["pasha","protein"],["ran","biology"],["complementarity","molecular_biology"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["complementarity","promoter","ran","pasha","tissue","translation"],"related":["Secondary_structure","Non-coding_RNA","Nucleotide","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Eukaryote","Cell_nucleus","Base-pair","MRNA","Gene_silencing","Translation_(biology)","Human_genome","Manchester_University","Conserved_sequence","Plant","Animal","Tissue_(biology)","Victor_Ambros","Antisense","Intron","Exon","Isomir","RNA_polymerase_II","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","Adenosine_monophosphate","RNA_splicing","Stem-loop","RNA_polymerase_III","Alu_sequence","Transfer_RNA","Pasha_(protein)","DiGeorge_Syndrome","Drosha","RNA_splicing","Intron","Mirtrons","RNA_editing","Adenosine","Inosine","XPO5","Guanosine_triphosphate","Ran_(biology)","Cytoplasm","Dicer-like1","Methyltransferase","Hua-Enhancer1","Argonaute","TARBP2","MOV10","TNRC6B","XRN2","MiR-122","Complementarity_(molecular_biology)","Messenger_RNA","3'_UTR","Deadenylation","MiR-430","DNA_methylation","Promoter_(biology)","Gene_expression","RNAa","SaRNA","Pseudogene","Sequence_homology","CeRNA","Genome","Messenger_RNA","Ribonuclease","Ribonuclease","PCR","RT-PCR","QPCR","Microarray","MicroRNA_Sequencing","Locked_nucleic_acid","Morpholino","Antagomir","Messenger_rna","Messenger_rna","Messenger_rna","Messenger_rna","Cancer","Oncomir","MIRN21","Myc","Lymphoma","Cell_growth","Gene","Chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia","Cancer_stem_cells","Colorectal_cancer","Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma","Metastasis","Colorectal_cancer","Cardiomyopathy","Leptin","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma","Ccaat-enhancer-binding_proteins","Cardiovascular_risk","Nervous_system","Mir-132_microRNA","Mir-124_microRNA_precursor_family","Synapse","Schizophrenia","Stem_cell","Adipocyte","Ectopic_expression","PPARÎ³","CEBPA","Insulin_resistance","Obesity","Diabetes","Let-7_microRNA_precursor","Aging","Antagomir","Obesity","Diabetes","Antagomir","SnoRNA","Gene_expression","RNAi","SiRNA","Small_nucleolar_RNA_derived_microRNA"]}
