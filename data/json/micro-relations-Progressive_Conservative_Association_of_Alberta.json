The party has\nformed the provincial government, without interruption, since 1971 under\npremiers Peter Lougheed (1971â1985), Don Getty (1985â1992), Ralph Klein\n(1992â2006), Ed Stelmach (2006â2011) and Alison Redford (2011âpresent). As of\n2012, this is the third-longest unbroken run in government at the provincial\nlevel in Canadian history, behind their Ontario counterparts' 42-year run from\n1943 to 1985, and the Nova Scotia Liberals' 43 years from 1882 to 1925.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta","recorded":1362540425,"links":27,"instances":["alberta_politician","politician","alberta","alberta_politician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conservative parties in Canada","Organizations based in Calgary","Organizations based in Edmonton","Political parties established in 1905","Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|","Provincial political parties in Alberta|Progressive Conservative"],"headings":["History","Party leaders","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/PC_Alberta_Logo_new.svg/180px-PC_Alberta_Logo_new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_Logo.svg/220px-Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_Logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flag_of_Alberta.svg/22px-Flag_of_Alberta.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Flag_of_Alberta.svg/92px-Flag_of_Alberta.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg/16px-DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["leader_of_the_opposition","alberta"],["george_hoadley","alberta_politician"],["james_ramsey","politician"],["alexander_mcgillivray","alberta_politician"]],"members":["george_hoadley","james_ramsey","leader_of_the_opposition","alexander_mcgillivray"],"related":["Alison_Redford","Edmonton","Alberta","Calgary","Alberta","Conservatism_in_Canada","Fiscal_Conservatism","Progressivism_","Progressive_conservatism","Red_Tory_","Economic_liberalism","Centrism","Centre-right","Colloquialism","Centre-right","Canada","Alberta","Peter_Lougheed","Don_Getty","Ralph_Klein","Ed_Stelmach","Alison_Redford","Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario","Nova_Scotia_Liberal_Party","Northwest_Territories_Liberal-Conservative_Party","Alberta_general_election,_1905","Prime_Minister_of_Canada","Richard_B._Bennett,_1st_Viscount_Bennett","Alberta_Liberal_Party","Alberta_general_election,_1913","Alberta_general_election,_1917","Alberta_general_election,_1921","Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","Legislative_Assembly_of_Alberta","United_Farmers_of_Alberta","Social_Credit_Party_of_Alberta","Social_credit","Alberta_general_election,_1940","Alberta_general_election,_1944","Alberta_general_election,_1948","Alberta_general_election,_1952","Cam_Kirby","Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada","Peter_Lougheed","Parochialism","Agrarianism","Calgary","Edmonton","Alberta_general_election,_1967","Legislative_Assembly_of_Alberta","Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Alberta)","Premier_of_Alberta","Ernest_Manning","Harry_Strom","By-election","Crossing_the_floor","Alberta_general_election,_1971","First_past_the_post","Sales_tax","Don_Getty","Ralph_Klein","Red_Tory","Reform_Party_of_Canada","Canadian_Alliance","Conservative_Party_of_Canada","Stockwell_Day","Alberta_general_election,_1993","Alberta_general_election,_1997","Alberta_general_election,_2001","Alberta_Liberal_Party","Alberta_New_Democrats","Alberta_general_election,_2004","Alberta_Alliance","Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_leadership_election,_2006","Jim_Dinning","Ted_Morton","Ed_Stelmach","Alberta_general_election,_2008","Cardston-Taber-Warner","Wildrose_Alliance","Alberta_general_election,_2012","Ted_Morton","Alison_Redford","Nova_Scotia_Liberal_Party","Frederick_W._A._G._Haultain","Richard_B._Bennett,_1st_Viscount_Bennett","Alberta_general_election,_1905","Albert_Robertson","Richard_B._Bennett,_1st_Viscount_Bennett","Edward_Michener","George_Hoadley_(Alberta_politician)","James_Ramsey_(politician)","Alexander_McGillivray_(Alberta_politician)","David_Milwyn_Duggan","John_Percy_Page","Alberta_general_election,_1952","Alberta_general_election,_1955","Cam_Kirby","Alberta_general_election,_1959","Ernest_Watkins","Milt_Harradence","Peter_Lougheed","Donald_Getty","Ralph_Klein","Ed_Stelmach","Alison_Redford","List_of_Alberta_general_elections","List_of_political_parties_in_Canada","Northwest_Territories_Liberal-Conservative_Party","Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_leadership_elections","Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_candidates,_2012_Alberta_provincial_election","Government_of_Alberta","Social_Credit_Party_of_Alberta"]}
