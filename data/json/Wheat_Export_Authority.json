{"cursor":"3304","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Wheat Export Authority' ('WEA') was established 1 July 1999 as part of\nrestructuring the former government-owned Australian Wheat Board in preparation\nfor its sale as AWB Limited. It was felt that a number of the tasks carried out\nby the previous Australian Wheat Board would not be appropriate for a privately\nowned body; thus, the WEA was established. The WEA's role was determined by the\nWheat Marketing Act 1989 and its operations were funded by a charge on\nAustralian wheat exports.\n\nThe WEA was controlled by a five-member board of directors, appointed for a\nperiod of up to three years by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and\nForestry. They were supported by an 16-person Canberra-based Secretariat, headed\nby a Chief Executive Officer. The WEA was an agency under the Commonwealth\nAuthorities and Corporations Act 1997.\n\nThe WEA had two major functions, including monitoring and reporting to the\ngovernment and growers on AWB(I)'s performance in managing the National [wheat]\nPool. This was done through a commercial-in-confidence report to the Minister\nand a public report, known as the Growers Report.\n\nThrough its second function, the WEA also considered export applications from\nparties other than AWB(I) [known as non-AWB(I) exporters] to export wheat from\nAustralia, usually in bags and containers. Since 17 August 2007, the export of\nwheat in bags and containers has been deregulated. Non-AWB(I) exports, are\npermitted in limited volumes to protect the integrity of the National Pool and\nmake up about 4% of total exports.\n\nIn December 2006 the Government amended the Act transferring the power of veto\nover bulk exports from AWB(I) to the Minister, on a temporary basis until 30\nJune 2007. This has since been extended to the end of June 2008. The Government\nthen established a Wheat Export Marketing Consultation Committee which consulted\nwith wheat growers across Australia and presented its finding to the government\non 29 March 2007. The government is using this report as the basis for its\nconsideration of new wheat export marketing arrangements.\n\nThe WEA was succeeded by the Export Wheat Commission in 2007.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Wheat_Export_Authority","recorded":1375058826,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=edit","/wiki/Australian_Wheat_Board","/wiki/AWB_Limited","/w/index.php?title=AWB(I)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Export_Wheat_Commission","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Cole_inquiry","/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Program","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&oldid=548635060","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_government_entities_of_Australia","/wiki/Category:Grain_industry_of_Australia","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_April_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_April_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_April_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wheat+Export+Authority&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wheat+Export+Authority","/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority","/wiki/Talk:Wheat_Export_Authority","#","/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wheat_Export_Authority","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Wheat_Export_Authority","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&oldid=548635060","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7991816","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Wheat_Export_Authority&id=548635060","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Wheat+Export+Authority","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Wheat+Export+Authority&oldid=548635060&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Wheat_Export_Authority&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7991816#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct
