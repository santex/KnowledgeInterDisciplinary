{"cursor":"3656","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'keynote' in literature, music, or public speaking is a talk that establishes\nthe main underlying theme. In corporate or commercial settings, greater\nimportance is attached to the delivery of a keynote speech or keynote address.\nThe keynote lays the framework for the following programme of events or\nconvention agenda; frequently the role of keynote speaker will include the role\nof convention moderator. It will also flag up a larger idea â€” a literary\nstory, an individual musical piece or event.\n\nAt political or industrial conventions and expositions and at academic\nconferences, the 'keynote address' or 'keynote speech' is delivered to set the\nunderlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of\nthe event. Some of the more famous keynote speeches in the United States are\nthose made at the party conventions during Democratic and Republican\npresidential campaigns. Keynote speakers at these events have often gained\nnationwide fame (or notoriety); for example, Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic\nNational Convention, and have occasionally influenced the course of the\nelection. In the commercial arena, Steve Jobs delivered some of the most\ninfluential keynote speeches at Apple product, system and service launches.\n\nKeynote speeches are also given at the graduation and commencement ceremonies of\ncolleges, universities, and major high schools, usually by accomplished\nacademics or celebrities invited by the student body.\n\nKeynote speakers are often selected to raise interest in a particular event,\nsuch as a conference or large meeting sponsored by a corporation or association,\nand draw attendees to attend that program. Selecting a keynote speaker who is\nwell known for his or her expertise in a particular field, or who has wide name\nrecognition due to other accomplishments, will probably raise enthusiasm among\nprospective attendees for a meeting or conference. Increasingly the word keynote\nis being used as a synonym for \"invited talk,\" with some conferences having an\nopening keynote, a closing keynote, and many other keynotes. This usage is\nincorrect; there is literally only one keynote.\n\nTypically a keynote presenter speaks for anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes. A\nkeynote speaker may work independently, be represented by a speakers bureau, or\nby a new crowdsourced model such as the speakerwiki website. In the event that a\nspeaker is represented by a traditional speakers bureau, a commission, typically\n25%-30%, is due; however, this is traditionally and ethically absorbed by the\nspeaker rather than the client so that the fee remains flat and transparently\npriced to the client.\n\nThe term key note comes from the practice of a cappella, often barbershop\nsingers, playing a note before singing. The note played determines the key in\nwhich the song will be performed.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Keynote","recorded":1374766833,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Keynote_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Literature","/wiki/Music","/wiki/Public_speaking","/wiki/Academic_conference","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/U.S._presidential_nominating_convention","/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party","/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/2004_Democratic_National_Convention_keynote_address","/wiki/Steve_Jobs","/wiki/Apple_Inc.","/wiki/Graduation","/wiki/Colleges","/wiki/University","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Speakers_bureau","/wiki/Speakers_bureau","#cite_note-1","/wiki/A_cappella","/wiki/Barbershop_singers","/wiki/Key_(music)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-07-069615-2","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit&section=2","http://speakerwiki.org","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keynote&oldid=543501532","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Literary_motifs","/wiki/Category:Speeches","/wiki/Category:Musical_keys","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Keynote&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Keynote","/wiki/Keynote","/wiki/Talk:Keynote","#","/wiki/Keynote","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Keynote","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Keynote","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&oldid=543501532","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q960189","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Keynote&id=543501532","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Keynote","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Keynote&oldid=543501532&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Keynote&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q960189#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&
