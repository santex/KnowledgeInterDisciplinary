{"cursor":"26252","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'stallion' is a male horse that has not been gelded (castrated). Stallions\nwill follow the conformation and phenotype of their breed, but within that\nstandard, the presence of hormones such as testosterone may give stallions a\nthicker, \"cresty\" neck, as well as a somewhat more muscular physique as compared\nto female horses, known as mares, and castrated males, called geldings.\n\nTemperament varies widely based on genetics, and training, but because of their\ninstincts as herd animals, they may be prone to aggressive behavior,\nparticularly toward other stallions, and thus require careful management by\nknowledgeable handlers. However, with proper training and management, stallions\nare effective equine athletes at the highest levels of many disciplines,\nincluding horse racing, horse shows, and international Olympic competition.\n\nThe term \"stallion\" dates from the era of Henry VII, who passed a number of laws\nrelating to the breeding and export of horses in an attempt to improve the\nBritish stock, under which it was forbidden to allow uncastrated male horses to\nbe turned out in fields or on the commons; they had to be \"kept within bounds\nand tied in stalls.\" (The term \"stallion\" for an uncastrated male horse dates\nfrom this time; stallion = stalled one.) {{citation\n| last = Wortley Axe\n|first=J\n| title = The Horse - Its Treatment In Health And Disease publisher = Hewlett\n| Press location = year = 2008 pages = 541â542 isbn = 1-4437-7540-1\n}} \"Stallion\" is also used to refer to males of other equids, including\nzebras and donkeys.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Stallion","recorded":1362665009,"links":42,"instances":["livestock","enclosure","horse","horse","horse_show","enclosure","horse"],"pdf":["http://www.verderers.org.uk/oct05mins.pdf","http://www.verderers.org.uk/oct05mins.pdf","http://www.verderers.org.uk/apr09mins.pdf","http://www.verderers.org.uk/apr09mins.pdf"],"categories":["Types of horse","Horse breeding and studs","Male horses"],"headings":["Herd behavior","Reproductive anatomy","Management and handling of domesticated stallions","Cultural views of stallions","Geldings","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Puerto_rican-Paso-Fino-Horse-chestnut.jpg/250px-Puerto_rican-Paso-Fino-Horse-chestnut.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Horsescd1l-095.jpg/220px-Horsescd1l-095.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/RCMP_Farm_Hannoverian2.jpg/220px-RCMP_Farm_Hannoverian2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Arabe.jpg/220px-Arabe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Hengstauftrieb_Rauris_6.jpg/220px-Hengstauftrieb_Rauris_6.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Finnhorse_stallions_lunch_time.jpg/220px-Finnhorse_stallions_lunch_time.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Maestoso_Basowizza_%26_Oberbereiter_Hausberger.jpg/220px-Maestoso_Basowizza_%26_Oberbereiter_Hausberger.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stall","enclosure"],["mare","horse"],["yearling","horse"],["colt","horse"],["mare","horse"],["muster","livestock"],["pen","enclosure"],["colt","horse"],["halter","horse_show"]],"members":["muster","stall","colt","mare","halter","pen","yearling"],"related":["Male","Horse","Gelding","Castrated","Horse_conformation","Phenotype","List_of_horse_breeds","Hormone","Testosterone","Mare","Gelding","Genetics","Horse_training","Instincts","Horse_racing","Horse_show","Equestrian_at_the_Summer_Olympics","Henry_VII_of_England","Commons","Stall_(enclosure)","Zebras","Donkeys","Predator","Mare_(horse)","Yearling_(horse)","Colt_(horse)","Filly","Instinct","Inbreeding","Bachelor_herd","Feral","Domestication_of_the_horse","Animal_sexual_behavior","Secondary_sex_characteristics","Testes","Scrotum","Foreskin","Penile_sheath","Retractor_penis_muscle","Erection","Glans_penis","Urethra","Glans_penis","Accessory_sex_glands","Vesicular_glands","Prostate_gland","Bulbourethral_glands","Semen","Ejaculation","Domestication","Mare_(horse)","Estrus","Instinct","Feral_horse","Semi-feral","Stable_vices","Estrus","Pregnant","New_Forest","Muster_(livestock)","Pen_(enclosure)","Stable","Pasture","Agricultural_fencing","Equine_nutrition","Stable_vices","Barn","Gelding","Goat","Donkey","Cat","Lipizzan","Spanish_Riding_School","Vienna","Austria","Colt_(horse)","Thoroughbred","Racetrack","Horse_show","Halter_(horse_show)","Horse_conformation","Western_pleasure","English_pleasure","Horse_breeding","Equestrianism","Fertility","Breed_registry","Artificial_insemination","Gelding","Horse_breeding","Purebred","List_of_horse_breeds","Asia","Middle_East","Horsemeat","Europe","Australia","Americas","Castration","Boarding_stable","Equestrianism","Trail_riding","Neutering","Dog","Cat","Animal_rights","Ridgling","Cryptorchidism","Infertility","Horse_breeding","Horse_behavior"]}
