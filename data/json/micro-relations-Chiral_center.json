Solomons & Fryhle. (2004). Organic Chemistry, 8th ed.\n\nA stereocenter consisting of an atom holding a set of ligands (atoms or groups\nof atoms) in a spatial arrangement which is not superposable on its mirror\nimage. A chiral center is a generalized extension of an asymmetric carbon atom,\nwhich is a carbon atom bonded to four different entities, such that an\ninterchanging of any two groups gives rise to an enantiomer.\n[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01060.html IUPAC-definition of chirality\ncenter] In organic chemistry a chirality center usually refers to a\ncarbon, phosphorus, or sulfur atom, though it is also possible for other atoms\nto be chirality centers in organic and inorganic chemistry.\n\nThe term stereocenter was introduced in 1984 by Mislow and\nSiegel.
