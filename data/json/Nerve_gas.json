{"cursor":"30109","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n:The neural-network-like computing method is called [[neural gas]].\n\n\n'Nerve agents' are a class of phosphorus-containing organic chemicals\n(organophosphates) that disrupt the mechanism by which nerves transfer messages\nto organs. The disruption is caused by blocking acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme\nthat normally relaxes the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.\n\nAs chemical weapons, they are classified as weapons of mass destruction by the\nUnited Nations according to UN Resolution 687 (passed in April 1991) and their\nproduction and stockpiling was outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of\n1993; the Chemical Weapons Convention officially took effect on April 29, 1997.\nThe use of dangerous gases in warfare was forbidden by treaty already in the\nGeneva Protocol of 1925.\n\nPoisoning by a nerve agent leads to contraction of pupils, profuse salivation,\nconvulsions, involuntary urination and defecation, and eventual death by\nasphyxiation as control is lost over respiratory muscles. Some nerve agents are\nreadily vaporized or aerosolized and the primary portal of entry into the body\nis the respiratory system. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin,\nrequiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit\nin addition to a respirator.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Nerve_gas","recorded":1362507257,"links":42,"instances":["nerve_agent","nerve_agent","information_gathering","nerve_agent","medical","nerve_agent","nerve_agent","nerve_agent"],"pdf":["http://ocw.core.org.cn/CORE/medicine/veterinary-pharmacology/lecture_notes_files/notes_17.Chapter_Fifteen__Detoxicants.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33432.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33432.pdf","http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/Army_Chemical_Review/pdfs/Jan-June%202006/Kirby-Nerve%20Gas.pdf","http://www.cbiac.apgea.army.mil/products/newsletter_pdfs/vol5_num1.pdf"],"categories":["Anticholinesterases","Nerve
