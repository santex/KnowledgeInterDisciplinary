{"cursor":"2397","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In linear algebra, a 'defective matrix' is a square matrix that does not have\na complete basis of eigenvectors, and is therefore not diagonalizable. In\nparticular, an n Ã n matrix is defective if and only if it does not\nhave n linearly independent eigenvectors. A complete basis is formed by\naugmenting the eigenvectors with generalized eigenvectors, which are\nnecessary for solving defective systems of ordinary differential equations\nand other problems.\n\nA defective matrix always has fewer than n distinct eigenvalues, since distinct\neigenvalues always have linearly independent eigenvectors. In particular, a\ndefective matrix has one or more eigenvalues Î» with algebraic multiplicity\nm > 1 (that is, they are multiple roots of the characteristic\npolynomial), but fewer than m linearly independent eigenvectors associated with\nÎ». However, every eigenvalue with multiplicity m always has m linearly\nindependent generalized eigenvectors.\n\nA Hermitian matrix (or the special case of a real symmetric matrix) or a unitary\nmatrix is never defective; more generally, a normal matrix (which includes\nHermitian and unitary as special cases) is never defective.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Defective_matrix","recorded":1362673868,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linear algebra"],"headings":["Jordan block","Example","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/c/f/9cf6dacb4ffa5908ac1862fc296cb176.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/a/6cacaf75b2b999a201c9becd611c4dff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/2/df2380e3366775e8182523b6037d82ff.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/f/b/5fb0f53a45831e361d39eb6726de3559.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/0/480d7a09bd266050d9deb97b094aab48.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Linear_algebra","Square_matrix","Basis_function","Eigenvector","Diagonalizable_matrix","Linearly_independent","Generalized_eigenvector","Ordinary_differential_equation","Eigenvalue","Algebraic_multiplicity","Characteristic_polynomial","Hermitian_matrix","Symmetric_matrix","Unitary_matrix","Normal_matrix","Jordan_normal_form","Eigenvalue","Eigenvalue","Jordan_normal_form"]}
