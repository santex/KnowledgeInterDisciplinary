{"cursor":"2673","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'cleave' in an optical fiber is a deliberate, controlled break, intended to\ncreate a perfectly flat endface, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the\nfiber. Since there are no crystalline planes in glass, this process is not\ncleavage in the crystallographic sense of the word, although the techniques used\nand the finished result are quite similar.\n\nA cleave is made by first introducing a microscopic fracture (\"nick\") into the\nfiber with a special tool, called a 'cleaving tool', which has a sharp blade of\nsome hard material, such as diamond, sapphire, or tungsten carbide. If proper\ntension is applied to the fiber as the nick is made, or immediately afterward\n(this may be done by the cleaving tool in some designs, or manually in other\ndesigns), the fracture will propagate in a controlled fashion, creating the\ndesired endface.\n\nA good cleave is required for a successful splice of an optical fiber, whether\nby fusion or mechanical means. Also, some types of fiber-optic connectors do not\nemploy abrasives and polishers. Instead, they use some type of cleaving\ntechnique to trim the fiber to its proper length, and produce a smooth, flat\nperpendicular endface.\n\nHigh-precision optical fiber cleavers are commercially available through a small\nnumber of specialized manufacturers, such as Nyfors Teknologi AB, which usually\nalso supplies other fusion splicing accessories such as fiber optic recoaters\nand stripping and preparation equipment.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Cleavage_(fiber)","recorded":1362540631,"links":15,"instances":["mechanics","fiber","crystal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fiber optics"],"headings":["Tools","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lens_triplet.svg/36px-Lens_triplet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cleavage","crystal"],["tension","mechanics"],["stripping","fiber"],["stripping","fiber"]],"members":["tension","stripping","cleavage"],"related":["Optical_fiber","Glass","Cleavage_(crystal)","Crystallography","Hardness","Diamond","Sapphire","Tungsten_carbide","Tension_(mechanics)","Fusion_splicing","Mechanical_splice","Fiber-optic_connector","Optical_fiber","Nyfors","Fusion_splicing","Recoating","Stripping_(fiber)","Federal_Standard_1037C","Fusion_splicing","Stripping_(fiber)","Recoating","Optical_communication","Optical_fiber","Fiber_optic_communications"]}
