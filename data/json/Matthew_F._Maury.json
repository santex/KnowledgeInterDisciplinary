Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and\nocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea.\n\nIn 1825 at age 19, Maury joined the United States Navy as a midshipman on board\nthe frigate . Almost immediately he began to study the seas and record methods\nof navigation. When a leg injury left him unfit for sea duty, Maury devoted his\ntime to the study of navigation, meteorology, winds, and currents. He became\nSuperintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory and head of the Depot of Charts and\nInstruments. Here, Maury studied thousands of ships' logs and charts. He\npublished the Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic, which showed sailors\nhow to use the ocean's currents and winds to their advantage and drastically\nreduced the length of ocean voyages. Maury's uniform system of recording\noceanographic data was adopted by navies and merchant marines around the world\nand was used to develop charts for all the major trade routes.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Maury, a Virginian, resigned his commission\nas a U.S. Navy commander and joined the Confederacy. He spent the war in the\nSouth, as well as abroad in Great Britain, Ireland, and France. He helped\nacquire a ship, , for the Confederacy while also advocating stopping the war in\nAmerica among several European Nations. Following the war, Maury accepted a\nteaching position at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. He\ndied at his V.M.I. home in Lexington in 1873 after completing an exhausting state-to-\nstate lecture tour on national and international weather forecasting on land. He\nhad also completed his book on his Geological Survey of Virginia and a new\nseries of geography for young people.\n","linknr":405,"url":"Matthew_F._Maury","recorded":1362505505,"links":40,"instances":["1836","united_states","rank","crater"],"pdf":["http://www4.uwm.edu/libraries/AGSL/maury.pdf"],"categories":["1806
