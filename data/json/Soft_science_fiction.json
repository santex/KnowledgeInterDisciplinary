{"cursor":"3223","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Soft science fiction', or 'soft SF' is science fiction that is based on the\n\"soft\" sciences, and especially the social sciences (anthropology, sociology,\npsychology, political science, and so on), rather than engineering or the \"hard\"\nsciences (for example, physics, astronomy, or\nchemistry). [http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1843] Science Fiction\nCitations: Soft Science Fiction Soft science fiction is often more\nconcerned with character, and speculative societies rather than scientific or\nengineering speculations. [http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1843] Science\nFiction Citations: Soft Science Fiction; [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/528857/science-fiction/235713/The-\nevolution-of-science-fiction] It is the of hard science fiction. The term\nfirst appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nIn [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]], Peter Nicholls writes that \"soft SF\"\nis a \"not very precise item of SF terminology\" and that the contrast between\nhard and soft is \"sometimes illogical.\" \"Soft SF,\" Encyclopedia of Science\nFiction, ed. John Clute and Peter Nicholls, 1995, ISBN 0-312-13486-X. In\nfact, the boundaries between \"hard\" and \"soft\" are neither definite nor\nuniversally agreed-upon, so there is no single standard of scientific \"hardness\"\nor \"softness.\" Some readers might consider any deviation from the possible or\nprobable (for example, including faster-than-light travel or paranormal powers)\nto be a mark of \"softness.\" Others might see an emphasis on character or the\nsocial implications of technological change (however possible or probable) as a\ndeparture from the science-engineering-technology issues that in their view\nought to be the focus of hard SF. Given this lack of objective and well-defined\nstandards, \"soft science fiction\" does not indicate a genre or subgenre of SF\nbut a tendency or qualityâone pole of an axis that has \"hard science fiction\" at\nthe other pole.\n\nFor example, a book like George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four might be described\nas soft science fiction, since it is concerned primarily with how society and\ninterpersonal relationships are altered by a political force which uses\ntechnology mercilessly; even though it is the source of many ideas and tropes\ncommonly explored in subsequent science fiction, (even in hard science fiction),\nsuch as mind control and surveillance. And yet, its style is uncompromisingly\nrealistic, and despite its then-future setting, very much more like a spy novel\nor political thriller in terms of its themes and treatment.\n\nBy contrast, Karel Äapek's R.U.R., though the original source for the robot\nfound with near-ubiquity in much subsequent Science Fiction, is un-scientific\nin its style and approach. Äapek's robots are manufactured like gingerbread\nmen, implying that for all his concerns with free will and ideas of personal\nliberty, his play is essentially a kind of Soft Science Fiction, or even a\nliterary fantasy.\n","linknr":222,"url":"Soft_science_fiction","recorded":1375088692,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Soft_science_fiction&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Soft_science_fiction&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soft_science_fiction&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Science_fiction","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complementary","/wiki/Hard_science_fiction","/wiki/The_Encyclopedia_of_Science_Fiction","/wiki/Peter_Nicholls_(writer)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four","/wiki/Tropes","/wiki/Hard_science_fiction","/wiki/Mind_control","/wiki/Surveillance","/wiki/Spy_fiction","/wiki/Political_thriller","/wiki/R.U.R.","/wiki/Robot","/wiki/Free_will","/wiki/Fantasy","/w/index.php?title=Soft_science_fiction&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1843","#cite_ref-2","http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1843","http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/528857/science-fiction/235713/The-evolution-of-science-fiction","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Special:BookSources/031213486X","/wiki/Template:Science_fiction","/wiki/Template_talk:Science_fiction","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Science_fiction&action=edit","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Outline_of_science_fiction","/wiki/Definitions_of_science_fiction","/wiki/Future_history","/wiki/History_of_science_fiction","/wiki/Scientific_romance","/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction","/wiki/New_Wave_science_fiction","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_genres","/wiki/Adventure_science_fiction","/wiki/Alternate_history","/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction","/wiki/Comic_science_fiction","/wiki/Cyberpunk","/wiki/Dying_Earth_(subgenre)","/wiki/Hard_science_fiction","/wiki/Military_science_fiction","/wiki/Science-fiction_opera","/wiki/Planetary_romance","/wiki/Science_fantasy","/wiki/Scientific_romance","/wiki/Social_science_fiction","/wiki/Space_opera","/wiki/Space_Western","/wiki/Steampunk","/wiki/Sword_and_planet","/wiki/Science_fiction_convention","/wiki/EMP_Museum","/wiki/Science_fiction_fandom","/wiki/Science_fiction_fanzine","/wiki/Hugo_Award","/wiki/Internet_Speculative_Fiction_Database","/wiki/Nebula_Award","/wiki/Science_fiction_studies","/wiki/Women_in_speculative_fiction","/wiki/Worldcon","/wiki/Australian_science_fiction","/wiki/Bengali_science_fiction","/wiki/Canadian_science_fiction","/wiki/Chinese_science_fiction","/wiki/Croatian_science_fiction","/wiki/Czech_science_fiction_and_fantasy","/wiki/French_science_fiction","/wiki/Japanese_science_fiction","/wiki/Norwegian_science_fiction","/wiki/Science_fiction_and_fantasy_in_Poland","/wiki/Romanian_science_fiction","/wiki/Russian_science_fiction_and_fantasy","/wiki/Serbian_science_fiction","/wiki/Spanish_science_fiction","/wiki/Science_fiction_comics","/wiki/Science_fiction_magazine","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_novels","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_publishers","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_short_stories","/wiki/Science_fiction_film","/wiki/History_of_science_fiction_films","/wiki/List_of_science-fiction_films","/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_television_programs","/wiki/British_television_science_fiction","/wiki/U.S._television_science_fiction","/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes","/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction","/wiki/Black_science_fiction","/wiki/Extraterrestrials_in_fiction","/wiki/List_of_fictional_extraterrestrials","/wiki/Feminist_science_fiction","/wiki/First_contact_(science_fiction)","/wiki/Gender_in_speculative_fiction","/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)","/wiki/LGBT_themes_in_speculative_fiction","/wiki/Libertarian_science_fiction","/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)","/wiki/Planets_in_science_fiction","/wiki/Terraforming_in_popular_culture","/wiki/Political_ideas_in_science_fiction","/wiki/List_of_religious_ideas_in_science_fiction","/wiki/Sex_and_sexuality_in_speculative_fiction","/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction","/wiki/Fantasy","/wiki/Fictional_technology","/wiki/Future","/wiki/Gothic_fiction","/wiki/Horror_fiction","/wiki/Magic_realism
