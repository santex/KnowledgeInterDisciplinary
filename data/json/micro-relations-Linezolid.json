US Patent 6362334 It is used for the\ntreatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are\nresistant to several other antibiotics.\n\nA member of the oxazolidinone class of drugs, linezolid is active against most\nGram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-\nresistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''\n(MRSA). The main indications of linezolid are infections of\nthe skin and soft tissues and pneumonia (particularly hospital-acquired\npneumonia), although off-label use for a variety of other infections is becoming\npopular. Linezolid is marketed by Pfizer under the trade names 'Zyvox' (in the\nUnited States, United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries),\n'Zyvoxid' (in Europe), and 'Zyvoxam' (in Canada and Mexico). Generics are also\navailable, such as 'Linospan' (in India, by Cipla) and 'Arlin' (in Bangladesh,\nby Beximco).\n\nDiscovered in the 1990s and first approved for use in 2000, linezolid was the\nfirst commercially available 1,3-oxazolidinone antibiotic. , it is the only\nmarketed oxazolidinone, although others are in development. As a protein\nsynthesis inhibitor, it stops the growth of bacteria by disrupting their\nproduction of proteins. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact\nmechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the\ninitiation of protein production, and not one of the later steps. Bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained very low since it\nwas first detected in 1999, although it may be increasing.\n\nWhen administered for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug; it can\nbe used in patients of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney\nfunction. Common adverse effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea,\nand nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with serious adverse\neffects; linezolid can cause bone marrow suppression and low platelet counts,\nparticularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods\nstill, it may cause peripheral neuropathy (which can be irreversible), optic\nnerve damage, and lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body), all\nmost likely due to mitochondrial toxicity.\n\nIn the United States, linezolid costs approximately 115 U.S. dollars per pill,\ncompared to generic vancomycin which can cost fifteen dollars per day of\ntreatment. Nonetheless, it appears to be more cost-effective than comparable\nantibiotics, mostly because of the possibility of switching\nfrom intravenous to oral administration as soon as patients are stable enough,\nwithout the need for dose adjustments. Additionally, many Canadian and\ninternational pharmacies sell linezolid online for less than $10/pill.\n","linknr":1831,"url":"Linezolid","recorded":1362500980,"links":123,"instances":["microbiology","pharmacology","united_states","medicine","medicine","pharmacokinetics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021130s022lbl.pdf","http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021130s022lbl.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/42/12/3251.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/42/12/3251.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/470.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/470.full.pdf","http://www.elsevier.es/sites/default/files/elsevier/pdf/28/28v27n04a13136682pdf001.pdf","http://www.elsevier.es/sites/default/files/elsevier/pdf/28/28v27n04a13136682pdf001.pdf","http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Clinical%20Information/Pneumonia/Guidelines/MACAPrevisedApr04.pdf","http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/Portals/0/Clinical%20Information/Pneumonia/Guidelines/MACAPrevisedApr04.pdf","http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/reprint/171/4/388.pdf","http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/reprint/171/4/388.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2369-5-18.pdf","http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2369-5-18.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/273.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/273.full.pdf","http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/45/2/631.pdf","http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/45/2/631.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/3/387.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/3/387.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/3/701.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/3/701.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/1/180.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/1/180.full.pdf","http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/138/2/135.pdf","http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/138/2/135.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/981.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/6/981.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_2/ii45.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_2/ii45.full.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/5/1617.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/5/1617.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/4/832.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/4/832.full.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/50/6/2042.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/50/6/2042.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/50/4/1599.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/50/4/1599.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/10/3550.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/10/3550.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/278/24/21972.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/278/24/21972.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/105/36/13339.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/105/36/13339.full.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Assessment_Report_-_Variation/human/000944/WC500120736.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Assessment_Report_-_Variation/human/000944/WC500120736.pdf","http://www.imm.ac.cn/journal/ccl/1703/170306-302-b050449-p3.pdf","http://www.imm.ac.cn/journal/ccl/1703/170306-302-b050449-p3.pdf","http://www.rbfarma.org.br/images/edicoes-em-pdf/2007/RBF_V88_N2_2007/PAG83a88_OXAZOLIDINONAS.pdf","http://www.rbfarma.org.br/images/edicoes-em-pdf/2007/RBF_V88_N2_2007/PAG83a88_OXAZOLIDINONAS.pdf","http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/29/8/1136.full.pdf","http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/29/8/1136.full.pdf","http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/alive/pediatrics/PharmNews/200306.pdf","http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/alive/pediatrics/PharmNews/200306.pdf","http://www.nature.com/bmt/journal/v28/n12/pdf/1703288a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/bmt/journal/v28/n12/pdf/1703288a.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/3/347.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/3/347.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/suppl_2/ii65.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/suppl_2/ii65.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/5/743.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/5/743.full.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/6/2256.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/6/2256.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/6/1261.full.pdf","http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/6/1261.full.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/4/1570.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/4/1570.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/31/11/1791.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/31/11/1791.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/6/1989.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/46/6/1989.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/11/3651.pdf","http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/11/3651.pdf"],"categories":["2000
