The term weight\nand mass are often confused with each other in everyday discourse but they are\ndistinct quantities.<ref name=\"Canada\">The National Standard of Canada, CAN/CSA-Z234.1-\n89 Canadian Metric Practice Guide, January 1989: *'5.7.3' Considerable confusion\nexists in the use of the term \"weight.\" In commercial and everyday use, the term\n\"weight\" nearly always means mass. In science and technology \"weight\" has\nprimarily meant a force due to gravity. In scientific and technical work, the\nterm \"weight\" should be replaced by the term \"mass\" or \"force,\" depending on the\napplication. *'5.7.4' The use of the verb \"to weigh\" meaning \"to determine the\nmass of,\" e.g., \"I weighed this object and determined its mass to be 5&nbsp;kg,\"\nis correct.</ref> The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in\nthe International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object\nwith a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of\nthe Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a\nbody can be weightless only if it is far away from any gravitating mass. There\nis also a rival tradition within Newtonian physics and engineering which sees\nweight as that which is measured when one uses scales. There the weight is a\nmeasure of the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body. Typically, in\nmeasuring someone's weight, the person is placed on scales at rest with respect\nto the earth but the definition can be extended to other states of motion. Thus\nin a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. In this second sense of\nweight, terrestrial objects can be weightless. Ignoring air resistance, an apple\non its way to meet Newton's head is weightless.\n\nFurther complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do\nwith the theory of relativity according to which gravity becomes reduced to a\nspace-time curvature. In the teaching community, a considerable debate has\nexisted for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. The\ncurrent situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in\ntheir various contexts. <ref name=\"Galili\"/>\n",
