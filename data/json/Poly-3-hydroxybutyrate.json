Frieder W. Lichtenthaler \"Carbohydrates as Organic\nRaw Materials\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2010, Wiley-\nVCH, Weinheim.  The poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) form of PHB is probably\nthe most common type of polyhydroxyalkanoate, but other polymers of this class\nare produced by a variety of organisms: these include poly-4-hydroxybutyrate\n(P4HB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV), polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH),\npolyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) and their copolymers.\n\nFermentation can also be used to produce the alcohol needed to produce plastic,\nalthough this renewable source of energy is expensive and is not used\ncommercially.
