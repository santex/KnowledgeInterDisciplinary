It is today\nmainly used in the kitchen as a general cooking ingredient, but historically, as\nthe most easily available mild acid, it had a great variety of industrial,\nmedical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as a general household cleanser)\nare still promoted today. Commercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow\nfermentation processes. In general, slow methods are used with traditional\nvinegars, and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of weeks or months.\nThe longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime\ncomposed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add mother of vinegar (i.e.,\nbacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air using a venturi pump\nsystem or a turbine to promote oxygenation to obtain the fastest fermentation.\nIn fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in a period ranging from\n20 hours to three days.\n","linknr":790,"url":"Vinegar","recorded":1362505736,"links":97,"instances":["wine","drug","condiment","folk_magic"],"pdf":["http://www.apctt.org/publication/pdf/tm_dec_biotechnz.pdf","http://www.apctt.org/publication/pdf/tm_dec_biotechnz.pdf","http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/legislation/e_d-text-2.pdf","http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/legislation/e_d-text-2.pdf"],"categories":["Vinegar|","Condiments","Traditional
