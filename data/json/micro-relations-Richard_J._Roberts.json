He was awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology or Medicine with Phillip Allen Sharp for the discovery of introns in\neukaryotic DNA and the mechanism of gene-splicing.\n\nWhen he was 4, his family moved to Bath. In Bath, he attended City of Bath Boys'\nSchool. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1993/roberts-\nautobio.html Nobel Prize website] As a child he at first wanted to be a\ndetective and then, when given a chemistry set, a chemist. He failed his Physics\nA-level exam on his first attempt.\n\nAfter becoming a Nobel Laureate in 1993 he was awarded an Honorary Degree\n(Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath in 1994. \n\nIn 2005, a multi-million pound expansion to the chemistry department at the\nUniversity of Sheffield, where he had been a student, was named after him. A\nrefurbished science department at Beechen Cliff School (previously City of Bath\nBoys' School) was also named after Roberts, who had donated a substantial sum of\nhis Nobel prize winnings to the\nschool.
