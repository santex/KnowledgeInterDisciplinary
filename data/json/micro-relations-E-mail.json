Modern email operates across\nthe Internet or other computer networks. Some early email systems required that\nthe author and the recipient both be online at the same time, in common with\ninstant messaging. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model.\nEmail servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages. Neither the users nor\ntheir computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only\nbriefly, typically to an email server, for as long as it takes to send or\nreceive messages.\n\nHistorically, the term electronic mail was used generically for any electronic\ndocument transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used\nthe term to describe fax document transmission. Ron Brown, Fax invades the\nmail market, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New\nScientist], Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218-\n221. Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets\nstarted, [http://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&pg=PA85 Popular\nScience], Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85 As a result, it is\ndifficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more\nspecific meaning it has today.\n\nAn Internet email message Unless explicitly qualified, any\ntechnical descriptions in this article will refer to current Internet e-mail\nrather than to earlier email systems. consists of three components, the\nmessage envelope, the message header, and the message body. The message header\ncontains control information, including, minimally, an originator's email\naddress and one or more recipient addresses. Usually descriptive information\nis also added, such as a subject header field and a message submission\ndate/time stamp.\n\nOriginally a text-only (7-bit ASCII and others) communications medium, email was\nextended to carry multi-media content attachments, a process standardized in RFC\n2045 through 2049. Collectively, these RFCs have come to be called Multipurpose\nInternet Mail Extensions (MIME).\n\nElectronic mail predates the inception of the Internet and was in fact a crucial\ntool in creating it, See for early history of email, from origins through\n1991. but the history of modern, global Internet email services reaches\nback to the early ARPANET. Standards for encoding email messages were proposed\nas early as 1973 (RFC 561). Conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early\n1980s produced the core of the current services. An email sent in the early\n1970s looks quite similar to a basic text message sent on the Internet today.\n\nNetwork-based email was initially exchanged on the ARPANET in extensions to the\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP), but is now carried by the Simple Mail Transfer\nProtocol (SMTP), first published as Internet standard 10 (RFC 821) in 1982. In\nthe process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates\ndelivery parameters using a message envelope separate from the message (header\nand body) itself.\n","linknr":1298,"url":"E-mail","recorded":1362683903,"links":155,"instances":["computer_system","telecommunications","internet","email","computing","computing","application","computing","computer_science","anonymity_network","scientist","computing","mail","email_client","computing","computer_worm"],"pdf":["http://www.baudot.net/docs/kimberlin--telex-twx-history.pdf","http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/H20-0129-1_1440_admTermSys.pdf","http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/H20-0129-1_1440_admTermSys.pdf","http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf","http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-et-al-2003.pdf","http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2010-2014-Executive-Summary2.pdf","http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2010-2014-Executive-Summary2.pdf","http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00188.pdf","http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf","http://www.ir.bbn.com/~craig/email.pdf","http://rafaeli.net/KalmanRafaeliChronemics2011.pdf"],"categories":["Email","Internet
