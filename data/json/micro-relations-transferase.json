{"cursor":"2205","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In biochemistry, a 'transferase' is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a\nfunctional group (e.g., a methyl or phosphate group) from one molecule (called\nthe donor) to another (called the acceptor). For example, an enzyme that\ncatalyzed this reaction would be a transferase:\n\n:A–X + B → A + B–X\n\nIn this example, A would be the donor, and B would be the acceptor. The donor is\noften a coenzyme.\n","linknr":1014,"url":"transferase","recorded":1362560036,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transferases|"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Classification","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biochemistry","Enzyme","Functional_group","Methyl","Phosphate","Molecule","Coenzyme","DNA_methyltransferase","Methyl","DNA","Enzyme_Commission_number","Methyltransferase","Aldehyde","Ketone","Acyltransferase","Glycosyltransferase","Alkyl","Aryl","Nitrogenous","Transaminase","Phosphorus","Phosphotransferase","Polymerase","Kinase","Sulfur","Sulfurtransferase","Sulfotransferase","Selenium","Queen_Mary,_University_of_London"]}
