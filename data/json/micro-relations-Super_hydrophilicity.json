This effect, called 'superhydrophilicity', was\ndiscovered in 1995 by the Research Institute of Toto Ltd. for titanium dioxide\nirradiated by sunlight.

For example, it can defog\nglass, and it can also enable oil spots to be swept away easily with water. Such\nmaterials are already commercialized as door mirrors for cars, coatings for\nbuildings, self-cleaning glass, etc.\n\nSeveral mechanisms of this superhydrophilicity have been proposed by\nresearchers. One is the change of the surface structure to a metastable\nstructure, and another is cleaning the surface by the photodecomposition of dirt\nsuch as organic compounds adsorbed on the surface, after either of which water\nmolecules can adsorb to the surface. The mechanism is still controversial, and\nit is too soon to decide which suggestion is correct. To decide, atomic scale\nmeasurements and other studies will be necessary.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Super_hydrophilicity","recorded":1362486481,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Titanium_dioxide","Contact_angle","Toto_Ltd.","Sunlight","Self-cleaning_glass","Metastability","Photodecomposition","Organic_compound","Adsorption","Superhydrophobicity"]}
