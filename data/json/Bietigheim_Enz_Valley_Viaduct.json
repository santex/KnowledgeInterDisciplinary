It\nwas built in 1851-1853 under the direction of Karl Etzel as part of the Western\nRailway between Bietigheim and Bruchsal. The Bietigheim Enz Valley Bridge is a\nbricked stone construction with two rows of arches. The viaduct is approximately\n287 metres long, approximately 33 metres high and has 21 arches, which extend\nover the Enz valley. Six arches were destroyed at the end of the Second World\nWar; after that an auxiliary bridge, which was opened on 1 August 1945 was\nerected beside it, some foundations of which are still visible. The damaged\ncolumns were later restored, although one of the arches had to be completely\nfilled with concrete. Directly beside the Bietigheim Enz Valley Bridge is the\nfestival area of Bietigheim Bissingens, on which the Bietigheim Horse Market, a\nbeer festival, takes place annually at the beginning of September.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Bietigheim_Enz_Valley_Viaduct","recorded":1362579331,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Railway bridges in Germany","Bridges completed in 1853"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Enzviadukt.jpg/220px-Enzviadukt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Eisenbahnviadukt_Bietigheim_1855.jpg/220px-Eisenbahnviadukt_Bietigheim_1855.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/30px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/AB-Br%C3%BCcke.svg/25px-AB-Br%C3%BCcke.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Enz","Bietigheim-Bissingen","Karl_Etzel","WÃ¼rttemberg_Western_Railway","Bruchsal","World_War_II","Bietigheim_Horse_Market"]}
