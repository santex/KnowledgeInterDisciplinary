Machines are usually powered by mechanical, chemical,\nthermal, or electrical means, and are frequently motorized. Historically, a\npowered tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine; however, the\nadvent of electronics technology has led to the development of powered tools\nwithout moving parts that are considered machines.<ref name=AHD/>\n\nA simple machine is a device that simply transforms the direction or magnitude\nof a force, but a large number of more complex machines exist.
