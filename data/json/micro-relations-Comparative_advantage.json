{"cursor":"17770","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn economics, the law of 'comparative advantage' refers to the ability of a\nparty to produce a particular good or service at a lower marginal and\nopportunity cost over another. Even if one country is more efficient in the\nproduction of all goods (absolute advantage in all goods) than the other, both\ncountries will still gain by trading with each other, as long as they have\ndifferent relative efficiencies. 'Baumol, William J. and Alan S. Binder,\n'Economics: Principles and Policy'', [p. 50 http://books.google.com/books?id=6K-\nedl8ZTTe0C&lpg=PA49&dq=%22law%20of%20comparative%20advantage%22&pg=PA50#v=onepa-\nge&q=%22law%20of%20comparative%20advantage%22&f=false]. 2009.\n\nFor example, if, using machinery, a worker in one country can produce both shoes\nand shirts at 6 per hour, and a worker in a country with less machinery can\nproduce either 2 shoes or 4 shirts in an hour, each country can gain from trade\nbecause their internal trade-offs between shoes and shirts are different. The\nless-efficient country has a comparative advantage in shirts, so it finds it\nmore efficient to produce shirts and trade them to the more-efficient country\nfor shoes. Without trade, its opportunity cost per shoe was 2 shirts; by\ntrading, its cost per shoe can reduce to as low as 1 shirt depending on how much\ntrade occurs (since the more-efficient country has a 1:1 trade-off). The more-\nefficient country has a comparative advantage in shoes, so it can gain in\nefficiency by moving some workers from shirt-production to shoe-production and\ntrading some shoes for shirts. Without trade, its cost to make a shirt was 1\nshoe; by trading, its cost per shirt can go as low as 1/2 shoe depending on how\nmuch trade occurs.\n\nThe net benefits to each country are called the gains from trade.\n","linknr":356,"url":"Comparative_advantage","recorded":1362574646,"links":50,"instances":["conference"],"pdf":[],"categories":["International economics","International trade","Economic theories","Economics terminology"],"headings":["Origins of the theory","Modern Theories","Effect of trade costs","Effects on the economy","Considerations","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/20px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/SingaporePort1.JPG/150px-SingaporePort1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ted","conference"]],"members":["ted"],"related":["Economics","Marginal_cost","Opportunity_cost","Absolute_advantage","Opportunity_cost","Gains_from_trade","Adam_Smith","David_Ricardo","Wine","Cloth","Heckscher–Ohlin_model","Paul_Krugman","Paul_Krugman","Import_substitution_industrialization","Development_economics","Singer–Prebisch_thesis","Infant_industry","Keynesian_economics","Mercantilism","Economic_nationalism","Competitive_advantage","Reagan_administration","Project_Socrates","Herman_Daly","Absolute_advantage","Adam_Smith","Absolute_advantage","Paul_Craig_Roberts","David_Ricardo","Opportunity_cost","Currency_peg","Ha-Joon_Chang","United_Kingdom","South_Korea","Japan","China","Competitive_advantage","Revealed_comparative_advantage","Heckscher-Ohlin_model","Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics","Resource_curse","U.S._Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics_Division_of_Information_Services","Paul_Krugman","Matt_Ridley","TED_(conference)"]}
