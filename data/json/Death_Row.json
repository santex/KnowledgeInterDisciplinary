{"cursor":"25098","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Death row', in English-speaking countries that have capital punishment, is the\nplace, often a section of a prison, that houses prisoners awaiting execution.\nThe term is also used figuratively to describe the state of awaiting execution\n(\"being on death row\"), even in places where no special facility or separate\nunit for condemned inmates exists. After persons are found guilty of an offense\nand sentenced to death, they remain on death row during appeal and habeas corpus\nprocedures, and if those are unsuccessful, until execution.\n\nOpponents of capital punishment claim that a prisoner's isolation and\nuncertainty over his or her fate constitute a form of mental cruelty and that\nespecially long-time death row inmates are liable to become mentally ill, if\nthey are not already. This is referred to as the death row phenomenon. In\nextreme cases some inmates may attempt suicide.\n\nIn the United States, prisoners may wait years before execution can be carried\nout due to the complex, expensive, and time-consuming appeals procedures\nmandated in the jurisdiction. The time between sentencing and execution has\nincreased relatively steadily between 1977 and 2010, including a 22% jump\nbetween 1989 and 1990 and a similar jump between 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a death\nrow inmate waited an average of 178 months (or close to 15 years) between\nsentencing and execution. Nearly a quarter of deaths on death row in\nthe U.S. are due to natural\ncauses. [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cp05.htm United States\nDepartment of Justice]\n\nWhen the United Kingdom had capital punishment, the convicted were given one\nappeal of their sentence. If that appeal was found to involve an important point\nof law it was taken up to the House of Lords, and if the appeal was successful,\nat that point the sentence was changed to life in prison. http://www.stephen-\nstratford.co.uk/capital_hist.htm The Home Secretary in the United Kingdom\nhad the power to exercise the Sovereign's royal prerogative of mercy to grant a\nreprieve on execution and change the sentence to life imprisonment. In some\nCaribbean countries which still authorize execution, the Judicial Committee of\nthe Privy Council is the ultimate court of appeals. It has upheld appeals by\nprisoners who have spent several years under sentence of death, stating that it\ndoes not desire to see the death row phenomenon emerge in countries under its\njurisdiction.\n\nHaiti continued the conventional 'reprieved if not executed within 90 days'\nprocess adopted by Britain before its abolition (Haiti later abolished the death\npenalty in 1987).\n\n houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by the U.S. federal government]]\n houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by the U.S. state of California]]\n houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by the U.S. state of Texas]] ,\n which houses the male death row prisoners sentenced by the State of Louisiana]]\n , which houses male death row prisoners sentenced by the State of Mississippi]]\n , which houses male death row prisoners sentenced by the state of Oklahoma]]\n\nThere were 3,125 people on death row in the United States on January 1,\n2013. http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf Since\n1977, the states of Texas (464), Virginia (108) and Oklahoma (94) have executed\nthe most death row inmates. As of 2010, California (683), Florida\n(390), Texas (330) and Pennsylvania (218) housed more than half of all inmates\npending on death row. As of 2008, the longest-serving prisoner on death row in\nthe U.S.A. who has been executed was Jack Alderman who served over 33 years. He\nwas executed in Georgia in\n2008. [http://www.reprieve.org.uk/Press_Jack_Alderman_Executed.htm Jack\nAlderman Executed] However, Alderman only holds the distinction of being\nthe longest-serving executed inmate so far. A Florida inmate, Gary Alvord,\narrived on Florida's death row before Alderman arrived on Georgia's death row\nand, on 9 April 2009, Alvord had been on death row for exactly 39 years, [h-\nttp://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/list.asp?DataAction=GetInmate&DCNumber=0-\n41482] longer than any other United States death row inmate. The oldest\nprisoner on death row in the United States was Leroy Nash, age 94, in Arizona.\nHe died of natural causes on February 12, 2010.\n","linknr":920,"url":"Death_Row","recorded":1375083193,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Death_row&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Death_row&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Death_row","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Death_Row&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Death_row_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Death_row&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Death_row","/wiki/Capital_punishment","/wiki/Capital_punishment_debate","/wiki/Religion_and_capital_punishment","/wiki/Use_of_capital_punishment_by_country","/wiki/Wrongful_execution","/wiki/Capital_punishment_for_drug_trafficking","/wiki/Use_of_capital_punishment_by_country","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Afghanistan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Bahamas","/w/index.php?title=Capital_punishment_in_Barbados&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Belarus","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Botswana","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_China","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Cuba","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Egypt","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Guatemala","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_India","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Indonesia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Iran","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Iraq","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Japan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_North_Korea","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_South_Korea","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Lebanon","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Malaysia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Pakistan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Saudi_Arabia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Somalia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Suriname","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Syria","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Taiwan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Tajikistan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Tonga","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Vietnam","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Yemen","/wiki/Use_of_capital_punishment_by_country","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Australia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Austria","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Belgium","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Bhutan","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Brazil","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Bulgaria","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Canada","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Cyprus","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Denmark","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Ecuador","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_France","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Germany","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Gibraltar","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Hong_Kong","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Hungary","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Ireland","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Israel","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Italy","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Liechtenstein","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Macau","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Mexico","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Mongolia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Netherlands","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_New_Zealand","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Norway","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Philippines","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Poland","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Portugal","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Romania","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Russia","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_San_Marino","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_South_Africa","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Spain","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Sweden","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Switzerland","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Turkey","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Venezuela","/wiki/List_of_methods_of_capital_punishment","/wiki/Decapitation","/wiki/Electric_chair","/wiki/Gas_chamber","/wiki/Hanging","/wiki/Lethal_injection","/wiki/Execution_by_shooting","/wiki/Execution_by_firing_squad","/wiki/Stoning","/wiki/Nitrogen_asphyxiation","/wiki/List_of_methods_of_capital_punishment","/wiki/Blowing_from_a_gun","/wiki/Death_by_boiling","/wiki/Breaking_wheel","/wiki/Death_by_burning","/wiki/Crucifixion","/wiki/Crushing_(execution)","/wiki/Disembowelment","/wiki/Dismemberment","/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered","/wiki/Execution_by_elephant","/wiki/Flaying","/wiki/Immurement","/wiki/Impalement","/wiki/Buried_alive#As
