Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis\nof a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma,\nanemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the\nblood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much\ninformation can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by\nphlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells\nin the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role\nof bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\n","linknr":208,"url":"Bone_marrow_examination","recorded":1362510764,"links":25,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical tests","Hematology"],"headings":["Components of the procedure","Site of procedure","How the test is performed","After the procedure","Contraindications","Complications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Acute_leukemia-ALL.jpg/220px-Acute_leukemia-ALL.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Bone_marrow_core_biopsy_microscopy_%28trephine%29_H%26E_panorama_by_gabriel_caponetti.jpg/220px-Bone_marrow_core_biopsy_microscopy_%28trephine%29_H%26E_panorama_by_gabriel_caponetti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Bone_marrow_biopsy.jpg/220px-Bone_marrow_biopsy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Bone_marrow_aspiration.jpg/220px-Bone_marrow_aspiration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Bone_marrow_biopsy_needle.jpg/170px-Bone_marrow_biopsy_needle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/OnControl_Driver_and_Aspiration_Needle_2010.jpg/170px-OnControl_Driver_and_Aspiration_Needle_2010.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complication","medicine"]],"members":["complication"],"related":["Wright's_stain","Cytopathology","Leukemia","Pathology","Bone_marrow","Trephine","Leukemia","Multiple_myeloma","Lymphoma","Anemia","Pancytopenia","Blood","Platelet","Red_blood_cell","White_blood_cell","Phlebotomy","Hematopoiesis","Pathologist","Light_microscope","Flow_cytometry","Cytogenetics","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Immunohistochemistry","Molecular_genetics","Flow_cytometry","Bone_marrow_stroma","Lymphoma","Cancellous_bone","Iliac_crest","Human_sternum","Blood_vessel","Lung","Heart","Informed_consent","Prone","Decubitus","Local_anesthetic","Lidocaine","Procaine","Analgesic","Anxiolytic","Bone","Cortical_bone","Trephine","Power_drill","Paracetamol","Contraindications","Thrombocytopenia","Platelet","Complication_(medicine)","Serious_adverse_event","United_Kingdom","Adverse_event"]}
