According to Orwell, the book reflects events\nleading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalin era in\nthe Soviet Union. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-\nhistorical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html BBC Learning Zone, Animal Farm]\nOrwell, a democratic socialist, \"Why I Write\" (1936) (The Collected Essays,\nJournalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 â An Age Like This 1945â1950 p.\n23 (Penguin)) was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed\nStalinism, especially after his experiences with the NKVD and the Spanish Civil\nWar. Orwell, writing in his review of Franz Borkenau's The Spanish Cockpit\nin [[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]], 31 July 1937, and \"Spilling the\nSpanish Beans\", New English Weekly, 29 July 1937 The Soviet Union, he\nbelieved, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and\nenforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described\nAnimal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin \"une conte satirique contre\nStalin\", and in his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), he wrote that Animal Farm was\nthe first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was\ndoing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".\n\nThe original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, though the subtitle was\ndropped by U.S. publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but\none of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted it. Other variations\nin the title include: A Satire and A Contemporary Satire. Orwell suggested the\ntitle Union des rÃ©publiques socialistes animales for the French translation,\nwhich recalled the French name of the Soviet Union, Union des rÃ©publiques\nsocialistes soviÃ©tiques, and which abbreviates to URSA, the Latin for \"bear\", a\nsymbol of Russia.\n\nOrwell wrote the book from November 1943âFebruary 1944, when the wartime\nalliance with the Soviet Union was at its height and Stalin was held in high\nesteem in Britain among the people and intelligentsia, a fact that Orwell\nhated. Malcolm Bradbury, Introduction, p. vi, Animal Farm, Penguin edition,\n1989 It was initially rejected by a number of British and American\npublishers, including one of Orwell's own, Victor Gollancz. Its publication was\nthus delayed, though it became a great commercial success when it did finally\nappear partly because the Cold War so quickly followed World War II. Morris\nDickstein, Cambridge Companion to Orwell, p. 134\n\nTime magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels\n(1923 to 2005); it also featured at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best\n20th-Century Novels. It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996, and is also\nincluded in the Great Books of the Western World selection.\n\nThe novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders,\nbut also the ways wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed, and myopia corrupt\nthe revolution. It portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution, rather\nthan the act of revolution itself. It also shows how potential ignorance and\nindifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if a\nsmooth transition to a people's government is not achieved.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Animal_Farm","recorded":1372154446,"links":[],"instances":["director","animal_farm","animal_farm","cartoonist","animal_farm","literary_agent","bolsheviks","animal_farm","orwell","animal_farm","united_kingdom","1922","animal_farm","pig","animal_farm","title","animal_farm","professor","1999_film"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1945
