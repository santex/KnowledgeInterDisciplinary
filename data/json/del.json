When applied to a function defined on a one-\ndimensional domain, it denotes its standard derivative as defined in calculus.\nWhen applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain),\ndel may denote the gradient (locally steepest slope) of a scalar field (or\nsometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier–Stokes equations), the\ndivergence of a vector field, or the curl (rotation) of a vector field,\ndepending on the way it is applied.\n\nStrictly speaking, del is not a specific operator, but rather a convenient\nmathematical notation for those three operators, that makes many equations\neasier to write and remember. The del symbol can be interpreted as a vector of\npartial derivative operators, and its three possible meanings—gradient,\ndivergence, and curl—can be formally viewed as the product of scalars, dot\nproduct, and cross product, respectively, of the del \"operator\" with the\nfield. These formal products do not necessarily commute with other operators\nor products.\n","title":"del","headings":["Definition","Notational uses","Product rules","Second derivatives","Precautions","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Gradient","3: Scalar_field","3: Vector_field","3: Divergence","2: Partial_derivative","2: Dot_product","2: Cartesian_coordinate_system","2: Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates","2: Directional_derivative","2: Laplacian","2: Vector_Laplacian","1: Vector_calculus","1: Differential_operator","1: Nabla_symbol","1: Derivative","1: Calculus","1: Mathematical_notation","1: Equations","1: Cross_product","1: Commutative_operation","1: Unit_vectors","1: Euclidean_space","1: Standard_basis","1: Einstein_summation_notation","1: Vector_product","1: Fluid_dynamics","1: Convective_derivative","1: Laplace_operator","1: Mathematical_physics","1: Laplace's_equation","1: Poisson's_equation","1: Heat_equation","1: Wave_equation","1: SchrÃ¶dinger_equation","1: Tensor","1: Tensor_derivative","1: Dyadic_product","1: Jacobian_matrix","1: Well-behaved","1: Vector_operator","1: Maxwell's_equations","1: NavierâStokes_equations","1: Table_of_mathematical_symbols","1: Vector_calculus_identities"]}
