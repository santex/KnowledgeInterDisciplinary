Letters containing anthrax spores were\nmailed to several news media offices and two Democratic U.S. Senators, killing\nfive people and infecting 17 others. According to the FBI, the ensuing\ninvestigation became \"one of the largest and most complex in the history of law\nenforcement\". [http://www.fbi.gov/anthrax/amerithraxlinks.htm Amerithrax or\nAnthrax Investigation], U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nA major focus in the early years of the investigation was a bio-weapons expert\nnamed Steven Hatfill, who was eventually exonerated. Another suspect, Bruce\nEdwards Ivins, became a focus of investigation around April 4, 2005. Ivins was a\nscientist who worked at the government's biodefense labs at Fort Detrick in\nFrederick, Maryland. On April 11, 2007, Ivins was put under periodic\nsurveillance and an FBI document stated that \"Bruce Edwards Ivins is an\nextremely sensitive suspect in the 2001 anthrax\nattacks.\" [http://foia2.fbi.gov/amerithrax/847444.PDF FBI .pdf file #847444\npp. 67] On July 27, 2008, Ivins took an intentional overdose of\nacetaminophen and died two days later in a hospital.\n\nOn August 6, 2008, despite having no direct evidence of his involvement, Greenwald, Glenn (February 16, 2011)\n[http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/02/16/ivans/index.html\nSerious doubt cast on FBI's anthrax case against Bruce Ivans],\n[[Salon.com]] federal prosecutors declared Ivins to be the sole culprit of\nthe crime. Two days later, Senator Charles Grassley and Rep. Rush\nHolt called for hearings into the DOJ and FBI's handling of the\ninvestigation. On February 19, 2010, the FBI formally\nclosed its investigation. {{cite news\n|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/us/20anthrax.html |title=F.B.I., Laying\nOut Evidence, Closes Anthrax Letters Case |work= The New York Times\n|author=Scott Shane |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2010|\narchiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100225020445/http://www.nytimes.com/20-\n10/02/20/us/20anthrax.html| archivedate= 25 February 2010 |\ndeadurl= no}}\n\nA review of the scientific methods used in the investigation at the National\nAcademy of Sciences, published in February\n2011, cast doubt on the U.S. government's conclusion that Ivins was the\nperpetrator. The review report said that, although the type of anthrax used in\nthe letters was correctly identified as the Ames strain of the bacterium, there\nwas insufficient scientific evidence for the FBI's assertion that it originated\nfrom Ivins' laboratory. The FBI responded by pointing out that the review panel\nasserted that it would not be possible to reach a definite conclusion based on\nscience alone, and said that a combination of factors led the FBI to conclude\nthat Ivins had been the perpetrator. Some information about the case\nrelated to Ivins' mental problems is still \"under seal\".
