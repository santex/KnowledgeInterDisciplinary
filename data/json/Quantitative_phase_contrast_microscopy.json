This makes translucent objects difficult to observe in ordinary light\nmicroscopes. Such objects do, however, induce a phase shift that can be observed\nusing either a Zernike or a Nomarski phase contrast microscope. Unfortunately,\nboth microscopy methods visualize phase shifts by transforming phase shift\ngradients into intensity variations. These intensity variations are mixed with\nother intensity variations, making it difficult to extract quantitative\ninformation from conventional phase contrast microscopy images. {{cite journal\n| author=Etienne Cuche coauthor=FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bevilacqua and Christian Depeursinge\n| title=Digital holography for quantitative phase-contrast imaging\n| journal=Optics Letters volume=24 issue=5 pages=291â293 year=1999\n| doi=10.1364/OL.24.000291}} {{cite journal\n| author=Pierre Marquet coauthor=Benjamin Rappaz, Pierre J.

Common to these methods is that an interference pattern\n(hologram) is recoded by a digital image sensor. From the recorded interference\npattern, a so called phase shift image or phase image is numerically created by\na computer algorithm. {{cite journal\n| author=Myung K.
