Two of the Associate\nJusticeships were abolished, leaving the nine-seat Court of today.\n\nThe Associate Justiceships are numbered in order of their creation. If seats\nwere established simultaneously, they are numbered in the order in which they\nwere filled. The dates given below for the filling of a seat are the dates the\njustices were sworn (not when they were confirmed by the Senate or\ncommissioned).\n\nThe Judicial Circuits Act of July 23, 1866 [14 Stat. 209] provided that each\nAssociate Justiceship would be abolished as it became vacant until only six\nAssociate Justiceships would remain. Since there were nine Associate\nJusticeships when the Act was passed, three were to be abolished:\n\n* Seat 7 was vacant when the Judicial Circuits Act passed, and hence was\n  abolished on July 23, 1866. John Catron was both the first and last occupant\n  of this seat.\n* Seat 5 was abolished upon the death of James Moore Wayne on July 5, 1867.\n* The Circuit Judges Act of 1869 [see 16 Stat. 44] superseded the Judicial\n  Circuits Act before a third seat could be abolished.\n\n\n\n\n{{U.S. judge succession note\n| text = The seat of Chief Justice was established by the Constitution and\n| organized on September 24, 1789 by the Judiciary Act of 1789 [see 1 Stat. 73].\n}} {{U.S. judge succession row\n| name = Jay term = October 19, 1789 – June 29, 1795\n}} {{U.S. judge succession row\n| name = J.
