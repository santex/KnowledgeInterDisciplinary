Different applications use\ndifferent parts of the X-ray spectrum.]]\n\n'X-radiation' (composed of 'X-rays') is a form of electromagnetic radiation. X-\nrays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to\nfrequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3Ã10 16 Hz to\n3Ã10 19 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. The\nwavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and longer than of gamma rays. In\nmany languages, X-radiation is called 'RÃ¶ntgen radiation', after Wilhelm\nRÃ¶ntgen, who is usually credited as its discoverer, and who had named\nit X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation. Novelline, Robert. Squire's Fundamentals of Radiology. Harvard\nUniversity Press. 5th edition. 1997. ISBN 0-674-83339-2. Correct spelling\nof X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s) and X\nray(s).\n\nX-rays with photon energies above 5-10 keV (below 0.2-0.1 nm wavelength)\nare called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy are called soft X-\nrays. {{cite book\n  | author = David Attwood title = Soft X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press year = 1999 isbn = 978-0-521-65214-8\n  | url = http://ast.coe.berkeley.edu/sxreuv/ page = 2}} Due to their\n  | penetrating ability hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of\n  | objects, e.g. in medical radiography and airport security. As a result, the\n  | term X-ray is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced\n  | using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths\n  | of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for\n  | determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft\n  | X-rays are easily absorbed in air and the attenuation length of 600 eV\n  | (~2 nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.\n\nThe distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is not universal. One often sees\nthe two types of radiation separated by their origin: X-rays are emitted by\nelectrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus. {{cite book |last = Denny |first = P.
