An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an\neconomic context, where scalability of a company implies that the underlying\nbusiness model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.\n\nScalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to\ndefine<ref>See for instance, and </ref> and in any particular case it is\nnecessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those\ndimensions that are deemed important. It is a highly significant issue in\nelectronics systems, databases, routers, and networking. A system whose\nperformance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity\nadded, is said to be a 'scalable system'.\n\nAn algorithm, design, networking protocol, program, or other system is said to\n'scale' if it is suitably efficient and practical when applied to large\nsituations (e.g. a large input data set, a large number of outputs or users, or\na large number of participating nodes in the case of a distributed system). If\nthe design or system fails when a quantity increases, it 'does not scale'. In\npractice, if there are a large number of things n that affect scaling, then n\nmust grow less than n<sup>2</sup>. An example is a search engine, that must\nscale not only for the number of users, but for the number of objects it\nindexes. Scalability refers to the ability of a site to increase in size as\ndemand warrants.<ref>{{Cite\nbook|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/E_commerce.html?id=n4bUGAAACAAJ|\ntitle=E-commerce: Business, Technology, Society |first1=Kenneth Craig|last1=\nLaudon|first2=Carol Guercio |last2=Traver |publisher=Pearson Prentice\nHall/Pearson Education|year=2008|isbn=9780136006459 }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of scalability is desirable in technology as well as business\nsettings. The base concept is consistent – the ability for a business or\ntechnology to accept increased volume without impacting the contribution margin\n(= revenue &minus; variable costs). For example, a given piece of equipment may\nhave capacity from 1–1000 users, and beyond 1000 users, additional equipment is\nneeded or performance will decline (variable costs will increase and reduce\ncontribution margin).\n","title":"scalability","headings":["Measures","Examples","Horizontal and vertical scaling","Database scalability","Design for scalability","Weak versus strong scaling","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Database_management_system","2: NoSQL","1: Electronics","1: Semiconductor_manufacturing","1: Telecommunications","1: Software_engineering","1: Economics","1: Business_model","1: Economic_growth","1: Algorithm","1: Computer_program","1: Algorithmic_efficiency","1: Business","1: Contribution_margin","1: Revenue","1: Variable_costs","1: Distributed_system","1: Routing_protocol","1: Routing_table","1: Big_O_notation","1: Online_transaction_processing","1: Peer-to-peer","1: Gnutella","1: Query_flooding","1: Domain_Name_System","1: Internet","1: Commodity_server","1: Supercomputer","1: Computer_cluster","1: Reduced_instruction_set_computing","1: Myrinet","1: InfiniBand","1: Seismic_analysis","1: Object_storage_device","1: Shared_nothing_architecture","1: Google","1: Platform_virtualization","1: Operating_system","1: Application_software","1: Apache_HTTP_Server","1: Hypervisor","1: Database","1: Transactions_Per_Second","1: Mass_storage","1: Database_server","1: Microprocessor","1: Symmetric_multiprocessing","1: Transaction_processing","1: Network-attached_storage","1: Storage_area_network","1: Fibre_Channel","1: X/Open_XA","1: Distributed_transaction","1: Oracle_RAC","1: Relational_database_management_system","1: GigaSpaces","1: Space_based_architecture","1: Base_One","1: BigTable","1: Database_transaction","1: SQL","1: Relational_model","1: Performance_tuning","1: Performance_engineering","1: Speedup","1: Amdahl's_Law","1: High_performance_computing","1: Asymptotic_complexity","1: Computational_complexity_theory","1: Gustafson's_law","1: List_of_system_quality_attributes","1: Parallel_computing","1: Scalable_Video_Coding","1: Memcached"]}
