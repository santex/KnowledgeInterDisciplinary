He sometimes\nwrote under the pen name 'Ian Don'.\n\nBorn in Warwickshire, the son of Donald Marter and his wife Helen Donaldson,\nafter graduating from Oxford University in 1969, Marter initially worked at the\nBristol Old Vic theatre, where he was a stage manager as well as acting in\nvarious minor roles. To support his low actor's wages, he also worked for a time\nas a milkman and a schoolteacher.\n\nIn 1971 he auditioned for the regular role of Captain Mike Yates in the eighth\nseason of Doctor Who and was offered the part, but was unable to accept due to a\nprior commitment. The production team were sufficiently impressed that they kept\nhim in mind and cast him in a supporting role in the 1973 story [[Carnival of\nMonsters]], broadcast as part of the tenth season of the programme.\n\nThe following year, he was cast in the role of Harry Sullivan, a character\ndeveloped by the production team when they planned that the incoming Fourth\nDoctor would be portrayed by an older actor, and thus would not be able to\nhandle the more physical action scenes (This was similar to the original TARDIS\ncrew when the Ian Chesterton character was written to handle the more physical\nscenes over William Hartnell). However, after forty year-old Tom Baker was cast,\nthis was no longer an issue and Harry was written out after only one season.\n\nMarter remained involved with Doctor Who after his departure from the cast. He\nco-wrote the script for a potential feature film version, provisionally titled\nDoctor Who Meets Scratchman, also known as Doctor Who and the Big Game, in\ncollaboration with Baker and film director James Hill, although this never came\nto fruition. The intention was to have Baker's Doctor come face to face with\nScratchman (an ancient term for the devil). The finale of the film was to have\ntaken place on a giant pinball table, the holes in the table being portals to\nother dimensions. The project fizzled out due to lack of funding.\n\nHe later became involved with the writing of novelisations of Doctor Who\ntelevision stories for Target Books, penning nine adaptations in the late 1970s\nand early 1980s. Marter's novelisations were somewhat controversial, most\nnotably for his use of the word 'bastard' in his novelization of the 1967 story\n[[The Enemy of the World]].\n\nThe last of Marter's Doctor Who novelisations was [[The Rescue (Doctor Who)|The\nRescue]], which had to be completed by range editor Nigel Robinson due to\nMarter's unexpected death. Marter was one of a small group of Doctor Who actors\nto write licensed fiction based upon the series.\n\nHe also wrote an original spin-off novel for Target,\n[[The_Companions_of_Doctor_Who#Harry_Sullivan.27s_War|Harry Sullivan's War]],\nstarring the character he had played on screen, which was published in\n1986 and was one of the earliest original Doctor Who-related novels\never published. Marter was planning both a sequel to this and an adaptation of\nthe unused Doctor Who Meets Scratchman script at the time of his death. In\naddition to his Doctor Who novelizations, he wrote adaptations of several 1980s\nAmerican films such as [[Splash (film)|Splash]] and [[Down and Out in Beverly\nHills]] for Target and their Star Books imprint. Some of these books were\npublished under the pen name 'Ian Don'.\n\nMarter's acting career outside of Doctor Who consisted mainly of guest roles in\nepisodes of series such as the BBC's [[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]] (in 1981)\nand Granada Television's [[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|The\nReturn of Sherlock Holmes]] (in 1986). He also had minor roles in several films,\nsuch as [[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]] (1971) and [[The Medusa Touch (film)|The\nMedusa Touch]] (1978). He lived and worked in New Zealand in the early 1980s,\nappearing in the New Zealand soap opera [[Close to Home (1975 TV series)|Close\nto Home]] from 1982.\n\nMarter married Rosemary Heyland in 1968, and had two sons, Rupert and Toby. He\ndied suddenly at his home in London on his forty-second birthday in 1986, after\nsuffering a heart attack brought on by complications of diabetes.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Ian_Marter","recorded":1375068987,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Layout","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit","/wiki/File:Ian_Marter.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Ian_Marter.jpg/220px-Ian_Marter.jpg","/wiki/Coventry","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/UK","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","/wiki/Myocardial_infarction","/wiki/England","/wiki/Actor","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Harry_Sullivan","/wiki/BBC","/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television","/wiki/Doctor_Who","/wiki/Pen_name","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Bristol_Old_Vic","/wiki/Stage_manager","/wiki/Milkman","/wiki/Mike_Yates","/wiki/Carnival_of_Monsters","/wiki/Fourth_Doctor","/wiki/Ian_Chesterton","/wiki/William_Hartnell","/wiki/Tom_Baker","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Film","/wiki/James_Hill_(British_director)","/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/Devil","/wiki/Novelisation","/wiki/Target_Books","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/The_Enemy_of_the_World","/wiki/The_Rescue_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/Nigel_Robinson","/wiki/The_Companions_of_Doctor_Who#Harry_Sullivan.27s_War","#cite_note-1","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Splash_(film)","/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_Beverly_Hills","/w/index.php?title=Star_Books&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bergerac_(TV_series)","/wiki/Granada_Television","/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes_(TV_series)","/wiki/The_Abominable_Dr._Phibes","/wiki/The_Medusa_Touch_(film)","/wiki/Close_to_Home_(1975_TV_series)","/wiki/London","/wiki/Myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus","/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Carnival_of_Monsters","/wiki/Robot_(Doctor_Who)","/wiki/The_Ark_in_Space","/wiki/The_Sontaran_Experiment","/wiki/Genesis_of_the_Daleks","/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Cybermen","/wiki/Terror_of_the_Zygons","/wiki/The_Android_Invasion","/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.timelash.com/tardis/display.asp?963","/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&action=edit&section=3","http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecl6nb/OnTarget/authors/mart/marter.htm","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0551722/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/14366627","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Pen_name","/wiki/Coventry","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/England","/wiki/UK","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Marter&oldid=543464633","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_myocardial_infarction","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_diabetes","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Bristol_Old_Vic_Theatre_School","/wiki/Category:English_film_actors","/wiki/Category:English_television_actors","/wiki/Category:English_writers","/wiki/Category:1944_births","/wiki/Category:1986_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_reorganization_from_September_2011","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_August_2010","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2007","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ian+Marter&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ian+Marter","/wiki/Ian_
