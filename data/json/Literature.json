The word\nliterature literally means \"things made from letters\" and the [[pars pro toto]]\nterm '\"letters\"' is sometimes used to signify \"literature,\" as in the figures of\nspeech \"arts and letters\" and \"man of letters.\" Literature is commonly\nclassified as having two major formsâfiction and non-fictionâand two major\ntechniquesâpoetry and prose.\n\nLiterature may consist of texts based on factual information (journalistic or\nnon-fiction), as well as on original imagination, such as polemical works as\nwell as autobiography, and reflective essays as well as belles-lettres.\nLiterature can be classified according to historical periods, genres, and\npolitical influences. The concept of genre, which earlier was limited, has\nbroadened over the centuries. A genre consists of artistic works which fall\nwithin a certain central theme, and examples of genre include romance, mystery,\ncrime, fantasy, erotica, and adventure, among others. Important historical\nperiods in English literature include Old English, Middle English, the\nRenaissance, the 17th Century Shakespearean and Elizabethan times, the 18th\nCentury Restoration, 19th Century Victorian, and 20th Century Modernism.\nImportant intellectual movements that have influenced the study of literature\ninclude feminism, post-colonialism, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, post-\nmodernism, romanticism, and Marxism.\n","recorded":1362124385,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"811","instances":["literature","poetry","narrative","poetry","literature","arts","literature","arts","literature","arts","narrative","message","fiction","literature","genre","genre","sociology","narrative_mode","genre","poetry","language","narrative","writer","composition","literature","fiction","literary","theatre","heroic_literature","chinese_philosophy","literary_technique","sociolinguistics","radio","narrative","poetry","chinese","narrative"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fiction","Humanities","Literature|"],"headings":["History","Poetry","Essays","Other
