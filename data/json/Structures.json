{"cursor":"6854","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Structure' is a fundamental, tangible or intangible notion referring to the\nrecognition, observation, nature, and permanence of patterns and s of entities.\nThis notion may itself be an object, such as a built structure, or an attribute,\nsuch as the structure of society. From a child's verbal description of a\nsnowflake, to the detailed scientific analysis of the properties of magnetic\nfields, the concept of structure is now often an essential foundation of nearly\nevery mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art. In early 20th-century and earlier thought, often plays a\nrole comparable to that of structure in contemporary thought. The neo-Kantianism\nof Ernst Cassirer (cf. his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, completed in 1929 and\npublished in English translation in the 1950s) is sometimes regarded as a\nprecursor of the later shift to structuralism and poststructuralism. John\nCarlos Rowe, \"Structure,\" in Critical Terms for Literary Study, 2nd ed., ed.\nFrank Lentricchia and Thomas McLaughlin, (Chicago and London: University of\nChicago Press, 1995), 25.\n\nThe description of structure implicitly offers an account of what a system is\nmade of: a configuration of items, a collection of inter-related components or\nservices. A structure may be a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many\nrelationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring\nconnections between components that are neighbors in space.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Structures","recorded":1372152275,"links":[],"instances":["geometry","anatomy","biology","philosophy","computer_science","order","structure","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structure|","Systems"],"headings":["Types of structure","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["nature","philosophy"],["link","geometry"],["lattice","order"],["beam","structure"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["reference","computer_science"]],"members":["link","organ","tissue","nature","reference","lattice","beam","cell"],"related":["Pattern_recognition","Observation","Nature_(philosophy)","Object_permanence","Pattern","Entities","Snow","Scientific_analysis","Magnetic_field","Science","Philosophy","Art","Neo-Kantianism","Ernst_Cassirer","Structuralism","Poststructuralism","Frank_Lentricchia","Thomas_McLaughlin","System","Hierarchy","Complex_network","Link_(geometry)","Lattice_(order)","Engineering","Architecture","Physical_body","Structural_load","Structural_analysis","Structural_engineering","Construction","Building","Nonbuilding_structure","Infrastructure","Column","Beam_(structure)","Truss","Architectural_structure","Biology","Atom","Molecular","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Organ_(anatomy)","Organism","Population","Ecosystem","Chemical_structure","Structural_formula","Protein_structure","Musical_form","Organization","Structure_and_agency","Computer_science","Data","Algorithmic_efficiency","Algorithm","Abstract_data_type","Data_type","Memory_space","Programming_language","Data_type","Reference_(computer_science)","Data_structure","Crystal_structure","Data_structure","Mathematical_structure","Building","Nonbuilding_structure","Structural_analysis","Structural_engineering","Structural_geology","Protein_structure","Biomolecular_structure","Primary_structure","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Quaternary_structure"]}
