{"cursor":"17153","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Humorism', or 'humoralism', is a now discredited (but historically important)\ntheory of the makeup and workings of the human body, adopted by Greek and Roman\nphysicians and philosophers, positing that an excess or deficiency of any of\nfour distinct bodily fluids in a person directly influences their temperament\nand health. From Hippocrates onward, the humoral theory was adopted by Greek,\nRoman and Islamic physicians, and became the most commonly held view of the\nhuman body among European physicians until the advent of modern medical research\nin the nineteenth century.\n\nThe four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Gk. melan chole), yellow\nbile (Gk. chole), phlegm (Gk. phlegma), and blood (Gk. haima), and each\ncorresponds to one of the traditional '[[four temperaments]]'. A humor is also\nreferred to as a cambium (pl. cambia or cambiums).
