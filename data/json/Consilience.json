That is,\nwhen multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very\nstrong even when none of the individual sources of evidence are very strong on\ntheir own. Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence\nof evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not\nlikely be a strong scientific consensus.\n\nThe principle is based on the unity of knowledge; measuring the same result by\nseveral different methods should lead to the same answer. For example, it should\nnot matter whether one measures the distance between the Great Pyramids of Giza\nby laser rangefinding, by satellite imaging, or with a meter stick - in all\nthree cases, the answer should be approximately the same. For the same reason,\ndifferent dating methods in geochronology should concur, a result in chemistry\nshould not contradict a result in geology, etc.\n\nThe word consilience was originally coined as the phrase \"consilience of\ninductions\" by William Whewell (\"consilience\" refers to a \"jumping together\"\nof knowledge).
