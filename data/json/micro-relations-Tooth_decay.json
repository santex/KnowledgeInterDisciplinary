If demineralization exceeds saliva and other\nremineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes, these\nhard tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries (cavities, holes\nin the teeth). The bacteria most responsible for dental cavities are the mutans\nstreptococci, most prominently [[Streptococcus mutans]] and [[Streptococcus\nsobrinus]], and lactobacilli. If left untreated, the disease can lead to pain,\ntooth loss and\ninfection. [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cavities/DS00896/DSECTION=7\nCavities/tooth decay], hosted on the Mayo Clinic website. Page accessed May 25,\n2008. Today, caries remain one of the most common diseases throughout the\nworld. Cariology is the study of dental caries.\n\nThe presentation of caries is highly variable. However the risk factors and\nstages of development are similar. Initially it may appear as a small chalky\narea (smooth surface caries), which may eventually develop into a large\ncavitation. Sometimes caries may be directly visible. However other methods of\ndetection such as X-rays are used for less visible areas of teeth and to judge\nthe extent of destruction. Lasers for detecting caries allow detection without\nradiation and are now used for detection of interproximal decay (between the\nteeth). Disclosing solutions are also used during tooth restoration to minimize\nthe chance of recurrence.\n\nTooth decay disease is caused by specific types of bacteria that produce acid in\nthe presence of fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and\nglucose.   \n   The mineral content of\nteeth is sensitive to increases in acidity from the production of lactic acid.\nTo be specific, a tooth (which is primarily mineral in content) is in a constant\nstate of back-and-forth demineralization and remineralization between the tooth\nand surrounding saliva. For people with little saliva, especially due to\nradiation therapies that may destroy the salivary glands, there also exists\nremineralization gel. These patients are particularly susceptible to dental\ncaries. When the pH at the surface of the tooth drops below 5.5,\ndemineralization proceeds faster than remineralization (meaning that there is a\nnet loss of mineral structure on the tooth's surface). Most foods are in this\nacidic range and without remineralization, this results in the ensuing decay.\nDepending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to\nrestore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known\nmethod to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health\norganizations advocate preventive and prophylactic measures, such as regular\noral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.
