{"cursor":"4969","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'' of November 10, 1919, reported on Einstein's confirmed prediction of\ngravitation on space, called the gravitational lens effect.]]\n\nThe 'predictive power' of a scientific theory refers to its ability to generate\ntestable predictions. Theories with strong predictive power are highly valued,\nbecause the predictions can often encourage the falsification of the theory. The\nconcept of predictive power differs from explanatory and descriptive power\n(where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained by a given\ntheory) in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding.\n\nScientific ideas that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best\n\"conjectures\", or at worst \"pseudoscience\". Because they cannot be tested or\nfalsified in any way, there is no way to determine whether they are true or\nfalse, and so they do not gain the status of \"scientific theory\".\n\nTheories whose \"predictive power\" presupposes technologies that are not\ncurrently possible constitute something of a grey area. For example, certain\naspects of string theory have been labeled as predictive, but only through the\nuse of machines that have not yet been built and in some cases may never be\npossible. Whether or not this sort of theory can or should be considered truly\npredictive is a matter of scientific and philosophical debate.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Predictive_power","recorded":1362484638,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy of science","Epistemology"],"headings":["Examples","Applications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Einstein_theory_triumphs.png/150px-Einstein_theory_triumphs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Gravitation","Gravitational_lens","Scientific_theory","Testability","Falsifiability","Explanatory_power","Descriptive_power","Conjecture","Pseudoscience","String_theory","Discovery_of_Neptune","John_Couch_Adams","Urbain_Le_Verrier","Dmitri_Mendeleev","Periodic_table","Chemical_element","Tellurium","Iodine","Charles_Darwin","Evolution","Natural_selection","Proboscis","Xanthopan_morgani","Hawk_moth","Albert_Einstein","General_Theory_of_Relativity","Sobral","Brazil","Atlantic_Ocean","Pr√≠ncipe","Arthur_Eddington","Harry_Collins","Trevor_Pinch","Radio_astronomy","Interferometry","Proper_time","Satellite","GPS"]}
