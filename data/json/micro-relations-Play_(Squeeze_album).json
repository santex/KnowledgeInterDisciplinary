It is the band's\nninth album, and their only released by Reprise Records. It is the first LP in\nthe Squeeze discography to feature only four official members instead of five\n(Steve Nieve took on many of the keyboard duties that would have gone to Jools\nHolland in the past). Tony Berg produced the album. In the liner notes to the\n1996 Squeeze compilation [[Excess Moderation]], Glenn Tilbrook stated that he\nconsiders Play the beginning of Squeeze's \"renaissance period.\"\n\nThe liner notes to the album are, appropriately, in the form of a play that\nincorporates the lyrics of the songs in a script that also references the plays\n[[Our Town]] by Thornton Wilder and [[Waiting for Godot]] by Samuel Beckett.\n","linknr":248,"url":"Play_(Squeeze_album)","recorded":1362482925,"links":24,"instances":["band","musician","squeeze_song","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Squeeze (band) albums","1991 albums","Albums produced by Tony Berg"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/SqueezePlay.jpg/220px-SqueezePlay.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg/32px-Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["squeeze","band"],["squeeze","band"],["satisfied","squeeze_song"],["sunday_street","song"],["keith_wilkinson","musician"]],"members":["squeeze","keith_wilkinson","satisfied","sunday_street"],"related":["Album","Squeeze_(band)","Rock_and_roll","Reprise_Records","Tony_Berg","Allmusic","New_Wave_music","Squeeze_(band)","Reprise_Records","Steve_Nieve","Jools_Holland","Tony_Berg","Glenn_Tilbrook","Thornton_Wilder","Samuel_Beckett","Chris_Difford","Glenn_Tilbrook","Satisfied_(Squeeze_song)","Crying_In_My_Sleep","Sunday_Street_(song)","Chris_Difford","Gilson_Lavis","Glenn_Tilbrook","Keith_Wilkinson_(musician)","Tony_Berg","Bruce_Hornsby","Matt_Irving","Steve_Nieve","Jerry_Hey","Claudia_Fontaine","Christopher_Guest","Michael_McKean","Michael_Penn"]}
