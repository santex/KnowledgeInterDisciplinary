In many countries, use of agrichemicals is highly regulated.\nGovernment-issued permits for purchase and use of approved agrichemicals may be\nrequired. Significant penalties can result from misuse, including improper\nstorage resulting in spillage. On farms, proper storage facilities and labeling,\nemergency clean-up equipment and procedures, and safety equipment and procedures\nfor handling, application and disposal are often subject to mandatory standards\nand regulations. Usually, the regulations are carried out through the\nregistration process.\n\nAccording to Agrow, Bayer CropScience led the agrichemical industry in sales in\n2007.
