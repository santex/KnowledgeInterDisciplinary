The obligation arises from the\ndivorce law or family law of each country. Traditionally, alimony was paid by a\nhusband to his former wife, but since the 1970s there have been moves in many\nWestern countries to gender equality with a corresponding recognition that a\nformer husband may also be entitled to alimony from his former wife.\n","linknr":615,"url":"Alimony","recorded":1362667645,"links":69,"instances":["law"],"pdf":["http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/332/mccoy.pdf","http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/332/mccoy.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/family/familylaw/flqwinter09_alimony.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/family/familylaw/flqwinter09_alimony.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/alimony-servitude-peonage.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/alimony-servitude-peonage.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/alimony-servitude-peonage.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/alimony-servitude-peonage.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/books/family/chapter_10.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/books/family/chapter_10.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/Should_Permanent_Alimony_Be_Eliminated.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/Should_Permanent_Alimony_Be_Eliminated.pdf","http://www.burlingtoncountydivorce.com/CM/Custom/Article%20on%20Alimony%20for%20NJ.pdf","http://www.burlingtoncountydivorce.com/CM/Custom/Article%20on%20Alimony%20for%20NJ.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/Should_Permanent_Alimony_Be_Eliminated.pdf","http://www.massalimonyreform.org/PDFs/Should_Permanent_Alimony_Be_Eliminated.pdf","http://www.womensbar.org/images/amicus_piercevpierce.pdf","http://www.womensbar.org/images/amicus_piercevpierce.pdf","http://www.massbar.org/media/153691/yearinreview.pdf","http://www.massbar.org/media/153691/yearinreview.pdf","http://www.highroadsolution.com/file_uploader/images/NJFamilyLawyerV33N1June2012.pdf","http://www.highroadsolution.com/file_uploader/images/FamilyLawyerV33N2Oct2012.pdf","http://www.mcle.org/includes/pdf/2000278B00_S.pdf","http://www.mcle.org/includes/pdf/2000278B00_S.pdf","http://www.flsenate.gov/data/Publications/2005/Senate/reports/interim_reports/pdf/2005-146ju.pdf","http://www.flsenate.gov/data/Publications/2005/Senate/reports/interim_reports/pdf/2005-146ju.pdf","http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/fcy-fea/spo-epo/g-ld/spag/pdf/SSAG_eng.pdf","http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/fcy-fea/spo-epo/g-ld/spag/pdf/SSAG_eng.pdf"],"categories":["Marriage","Divorce","Family law","Law of obligations","Child support","Childhood","Parenting"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Reckoning","Child support","Factors affecting alimony","Alimony Reform in the United States","Spousal Support (Alimony) in Canada","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg/28px-Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissolution","law"]],"members":["dissolution"],"related":["Divorce","Law","Family_law","Gender_equality","Alimentary","Scots_law","Aliment","Babylonian","Code_of_Hammurabi","Code_of_Justinian","Ecclesiastical_courts","American_Bar_Association","United_States_Supreme_Court","Britney_Spears","Victoria_Principal","Jessica_Simpson","Dissolution_(law)","Pendente_lite","Litigation","Divorce","Dissolution_of_marriage","Civil_union","Legal_instrument","Testimony","Collection_agency","Contempt_of_court","Bankruptcy","Contempt_of_court","Bankruptcy","Child_support","Child_support","Income","Legal_separation","No_fault_divorce","Stay-at-home_dad","Family_law","English_Common_Law","Coverture","Married_Women's_Property_Act_1870","Married_Women's_Property_Act_1882","Sustenance","Cohabitation","Divorce_Agreement","Child_support","Coverture","Divorce","Men's_rights","Palimony","Lee_Marvin","Prenuptial_agreement","Shah_Bano_case","Suffrage","Women's_rights"]}
