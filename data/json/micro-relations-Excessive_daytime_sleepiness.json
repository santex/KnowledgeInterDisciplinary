EDS is a symptom of sleep disorder [[hypersomnia]], another\nsymptom being prolonged nighttime sleep.\n\nSome persons with EDS, including those with narcolepsy, are compelled to nap\nrepeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep\nduring inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal,\nor in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to\ncomplete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of\nintoxication.\n","linknr":294,"url":"Excessive_daytime_sleepiness","recorded":1362535217,"links":15,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sleep disorders"],"headings":["Diagnosis","Causes","Coping","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chronic","medical"]],"members":["chronic"],"related":["Hypersomnia","Sleep_disorder","Narcolepsy","Chronic_(medical)","Epworth_Sleepiness_Scale","Sleep_medicine","Multiple_Sleep_Latency_Test","Sleep_latency","Jet_lag","Shift_work","Circadian_rhythm_sleep_disorder","Narcolepsy","Sleep_apnea","Hypersomnia","Restless_legs_syndrome","Clinical_depression","Atypical_depression","Hypothyroidism","Self_control","Modafinil","Xyrem","Sodium_oxybate","Methylphenidate","Dextroamphetamine","Amphetamine","Lisdexamfetamine","Methamphetamine","Pemoline","Psychostimulant"]}
