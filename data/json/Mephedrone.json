Slang names include 'drone' and  'MCAT'. It is reportedly manufactured in China and is chemically similar\nto the cathinone compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa. It comes\nin the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort or inject,\nproducing similar effects to MDMA, amphetamines, and cocaine.\n\nAs well as producing stimulant effects, negative side effects occur when\nmephedrone is used, with teeth grinding the most common. The metabolism of\nmephedrone has been studied in rats and humans, and the metabolites can be\ndetected in urine after usage. Nothing is known about its potential\nneurotoxicity, but scientists have suggested possible dangers associated with\nits use based on its similarity to other drugs. Several people have died after\nconsuming mephedrone, but some deaths the media attributed to the drug were\nlater determined to have been caused by other factors.\n\nMephedrone was first synthesised in 1929, but did not become widely known until\nit was rediscovered in 2003. By 2007, mephedrone was reported to be available\nfor sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of\nthe compound, and by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming\nparticularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal\nin Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made\nillegal in many European countries and in December 2010, the EU ruled it\nillegal. In Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, it is considered an analog of\nother illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the Federal Analog\nAct. In September 2011, the USA temporarily classified mephedrone as illegal, in\neffect from October 2011.\n","linknr":4619,"url":"Mephedrone","recorded":1362480542,"links":88,"instances":["medicine","drugs","drug","mood","drug","australia","website","drug","satirist","newspaper_format","psychology","uk","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_132203_EN_2010_Mephedrone_Joint%20report.pdf","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_132203_EN_2010_Mephedrone_Joint%20report.pdf","http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/ndarcweb.nsf/resources/BulletinsEDRS2010/$file/EDRS+December+2010.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%20Practice/DruglinkJanFeb10.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%20Practice/DruglinkJanFeb10.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%20Practice/Druglink_March_09_mephedrone.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Good%20Practice/Druglink_March_09_mephedrone.pdf","http://www.ltg.uk.net/admin/files/Methcathinones.pdf","http://www.ltg.uk.net/admin/files/Methcathinones.pdf","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_77265_EN_Annex%202_New%20psychoactive%20substances%20reported%202008.pdf","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_77265_EN_Annex%202_New%20psychoactive%20substances%20reported%202008.pdf","http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0709/mg0709.pdf","http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0709/mg0709.pdf","http://www.incb.org/pdf/annual-report/2010/en/AR_2010_English.pdf","http://www.incb.org/pdf/annual-report/2010/en/AR_2010_English.pdf","http://www.ofdt.fr/BDD/publications/docs/rarOEDTmephAnn1.pdf","http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/nta_annualreport_0910.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Publications/DruglinkSept-Oct2010.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Publications/DruglinkSept-Oct2010.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Publications/DruglinkSept-Oct2010.pdf","http://www.drugscope.org.uk/Resources/Drugscope/Documents/PDF/Publications/DruglinkSept-Oct2010.pdf","http://www.biomedicalpublications.com/mephedrone.pdf","http://www.sgul.ac.uk/about-st-georges/divisions/faculty-of-medicine-and-biomedical-sciences/mental-health/icdp/website-pdfs/np-SAD%2011th%20annual%20report%20Final.pdf","http://194.83.136.209/documents/reports/Mephedrone.pdf","http://addictionireland.com/_fileupload/publications/Legal_Highs_Poster.pdf","http://addictionireland.com/_fileupload/publications/Legal_Highs_Poster.pdf","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_112008_EN_NR_2009_DK.pdf","http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_112008_EN_NR_2009_DK.pdf","http://www.kozlonyok.hu/nkonline/MKPDF/hiteles/MK10190.pdf","http://www.kozlonyok.hu/nkonline/MKPDF/hiteles/MK10190.pdf","http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/rapidpdf/cmaj.109-3245v1.pdf","http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/rapidpdf/cmaj.109-3245v1.pdf","http://www.lifeline.org.uk/docs/Meph%20faq.pdf"],"categories":["Dopamine
