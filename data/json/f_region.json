      "text" : "The 'F region' of the ionosphere is home to the F layer of ionization, also\ncalled the 'Appleton layer', after the English physicist Edward Appleton. As\nwith other ionospheric sectors, 'layer' implies a concentration of plasma,\nwhile 'region' is the area that contains the said layer. The F region contains\nionized gases at a height of around 150–800&nbsp;km above sea level, placing it\nin the Earth’s thermosphere, a hot region in the upper atmosphere, and also in\nthe heterosphere, where chemical composition varies with height. Generally\nspeaking, the F region has the highest concentration of free electrons and ions\nanywhere in the atmosphere. It may be thought of as comprising two layers, the\nF1-and F2-layers.\n\nThe F-region is located directly above the E region (formerly the Kennelly-\nHeaviside layer) and below the protonosphere. It acts as a dependable reflector\nof radio signals as it is not affected by atmospheric conditions, although its\nionic composition varies with the sunspot cycle. It reflects normal-incident\nfrequencies at or below the critical frequency (approximately 10&nbsp;MHz) and\npartially absorbs waves of higher frequency.\n\nThe F region is the region of the ionosphere which is very important for HF\nradio wave propagation. This F region is very anomalous in nature.\n",
