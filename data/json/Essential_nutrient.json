{"cursor":"7428","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'essential nutrient' is a nutrient required for normal body functioning that\neither cannot be synthesized by the body at all, or cannot be synthesized in\namounts adequate for good health (e.g. niacin, choline), and thus must be\nobtained from a dietary source. Essential nutrients are also defined by the\ncollective physiological evidence for their importance in the diet, as\nrepresented in e.g. US government approved tables for Dietary Reference\nIntake.\n\nSome categories of essential nutrients include vitamins, dietary minerals,\nessential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. Different species have very\ndifferent essential nutrients. For example, most mammals synthesize their own\nascorbic acid, and it is therefore not considered an essential nutrient for such\nspecies. It is, however, an essential nutrient for human beings, who require\nexternal sources of ascorbic acid (known as Vitamin C in the context of\nnutrition).\n\nMany essential nutrients are toxic in large doses (see hypervitaminosis or the\nnutrient pages themselves below). Some can be taken in amounts larger than\nrequired in a typical diet, with no apparent ill effects. Linus Pauling said of\nvitamin B 3, (either niacin or niacinamide), \"What astonished me was\nthe very low toxicity of a substance that has such very great physiological\npower. A little pinch, 5Â mg, every day, is enough to keep a person from\ndying of pellagra, but it is so lacking in toxicity that ten thousand times as\nmuch can [sometimes] be taken without harm.\" Page 24.\n","linknr":221,"url":"Essential_nutrient","recorded":1362569042,"links":25,"instances":["nutrition"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Essential nutrients|*","Nutrition"],"headings":["Fatty acids","Amino acids","Vitamins","Dietary minerals","Elements with speculated role in human health","References","Further reading","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Foods.jpg/19px-Foods.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["diet"],"related":["Nutrient","Niacin","Choline","Diet_(nutrition)","Dietary_Reference_Intake","Vitamin","Dietary_minerals","Essential_fatty_acid","Essential_amino_acid","Ascorbic_acid","Hypervitaminosis","Linus_Pauling","Niacin","Pellagra","Desaturase","Alpha-linolenic_acid","Omega-3_fatty_acid","Linoleic_acid","Omega-6_fatty_acid","Eicosapentaenoic_acid","Docosahexaenoic_acid","Gamma-linolenic_acid","Dihomo-gamma-linolenic_acid","Arachidonic_acid","Omega-9_fatty_acid","Isoleucine","Lysine","Leucine","Methionine","Phenylalanine","Threonine","Tryptophan","Valine","Histidine","Arginine","Vitamin_A","Choline","Choline","Vitamin_B1","Vitamin_B2","Vitamin_B3","Vitamin_B5","Vitamin_B6","Pyridoxine","Pyridoxamine","Pyridoxal","Vitamin_B7","Vitamin_B9","Vitamin_B12","Vitamin_C","Ascorbic_acid","Vitamin_D","Ergocalciferol","Cholecalciferol","Vitamin_E","Vitamin_K","Calcium","Chloride","Chromium","Cobalt","Vitamin_B12","Copper","Iodine","Iron","Magnesium","Manganese","Molybdenum","Phosphorus","Potassium","Selenium","Sodium","Zinc","Dietary_reference_intake","Ultratrace_element","Avitaminosis","Dietary_Reference_Intake","Dietary_supplement","Food_composition","Illnesses_related_to_poor_nutrition","Malnutrition","Orthomolecular_medicine","Vitamin_poisoning","Health_freedom_movement","Malabsorption"]}
