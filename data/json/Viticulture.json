{"cursor":"19363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Viticulture' (from the Latin word for [[vine]]) is the science, production and\nstudy of grapes which deals with the series of events that occur in the\nvineyard. When the grapes are used for winemaking, it is also known as\n'viniculture'. It is a branch of the science of horticulture.\n\nWhile the native territory of [[Vitis vinifera]], the common grape vine, is a\nband of area from Western Europe to the Persian shores of the Caspian Sea, the\nvine has demonstrated high levels of adaptability and will sometimes mutate to\naccommodate a new environment after its introduction. Because of this,\nviticulture can be found on every continent except Antarctica. H. Johnson \"Vintage: The Story of Wine\" pg 17-19 Simon and Schuster\n1989 ISBN 0-671-68702-6 \n\nDuties of the viticulturist include: monitoring and controlling pests and\ndiseases, fertilizing, irrigation, canopy management, monitoring fruit\ndevelopment and characteristics, deciding when to harvest and vine pruning\nduring the winter months. Viticulturists are often intimately involved with\nwinemakers, because vineyard management and the resulting grape characteristics\nprovide the basis from which winemaking can begin.\n","linknr":788,"url":"Viticulture","recorded":1362510305,"links":56,"instances":["chemistry","grape","plant","agriculture","organism","wine","country","spain","region","wine","agricultural_writer","wine_region"],"pdf":["http://www.grovesnurseries.co.uk/Uploads/Downloads/23/DownloadFile_FILE/Groves_Guide_to_Grape_Vines_Dormant.pdf"],"categories":["Viticulture|","Wine terms"],"headings":["History","Growing vines","Green harvest","Field blend","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Wine_grapes03.jpg/220px-Wine_grapes03.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Downy_and_Powdery_mildew_on_grape_leaf.JPG/200px-Downy_and_Powdery_mildew_on_grape_leaf.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Grape_gathering.jpg/200px-Grape_gathering.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Harvesting_the_Grapes_in_Duras.jpg/220px-Harvesting_the_Grapes_in_Duras.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c0/Red_Wine_Glass.jpg/15px-Red_Wine_Glass.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/RegaderaMetalica.jpg/100px-RegaderaMetalica.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Corn_01.JPG/16px-Corn_01.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Leaf_1_web.jpg/16px-Leaf_1_web.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pest","organism"],["irrigation","wine"],["canopy","grape"],["harvest","wine"],["georgia","country"],["mago","agricultural_writer"],["trellis","agriculture"],["la_rioja","spain"],["mosel","wine_region"],["burgundy","region"],["homogeneous","chemistry"],["la_rioja","spain"],["cutting","plant"]],"members":["homogeneous","canopy","cutting","trellis","pest","harvest","georgia","la_rioja","burgundy","irrigation","mago","mosel"],"related":["Latin","Science","Plant_cultivation","Grape","Vineyard","Winemaking","Horticulture","Western_Europe","Iran","Caspian_Sea","Adaptability","Mutate","Antarctica","Pest_(organism)","Plant_pathology","Fertilizer","Irrigation_(wine)","Canopy_(grape)","Fruit","Typicity","Harvest_(wine)","Pruning","History_of_wine","Neolithic","Domestication","Georgia_(country)","Near_East","Bronze_Age","Pollinate","Offspring","Greeks","Thucydides","Asia_Minor","Ancient_Greece","Cyclades","Aegean_Sea","Staple_food","Economies","Trade","Phoenicia","Carthage","Mago_(agricultural_writer)","Ancient_Rome","Third_Punic_War","Cato_the_Elder","Columella","Trellis_(agriculture)","Training_the_vines","Tree","Foliage","Roman_expansion","Wine-growing_regions","La_Rioja_(Spain)","Mosel_(wine_region)","Bordeaux","Burgundy_(region)","Rhône_wine","Photosynthesis","Frost","Middle_Ages","Monk","Cistercians","Varietal","Peasant","Homogeneous_(chemistry)","Vintage","Côte-d'Or","Montrachet","La_Romanée","Wine_producing_regions","Temperate","Latitude","Earth","Mean","Body_of_water","Mountain_range","Lake","River","Growing_season","Rain","Harvest","Fungus","Weather","Acid","Sugar","Topography","Slopes","Perpendicular","Climes","Powdery_mildew","Flower","Wind","Hail","Seed","Coulure","Downy_mildew","Powdery_mildew","Frost","Uncinula_necator","Phylloxera","Plant_virus","Grape","French_language","La_Rioja_(Spain)","Fruit_set","Appellation","Côtes_de_Duras","Varietal","Clonal_selection","Cutting_(plant)","Zinfandel","Carignan","Ridge_Vineyards","Petite_Sirah","Grenache","German_language","Vienna","Ampelography","Annual_growth_cycle_of_grapevines","Diurnal_temperature_variation","Global_warming_and_wine","List_of_vineyard_soil_types","Oenology","Precision_viticulture","Vine_training_systems","Winemaking","Subsoiling","John_Phin"]}
