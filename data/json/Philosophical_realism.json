{"cursor":"8960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nContemporary 'philosophical realism' is the belief that our reality, or some\naspect of it, is ontologically independent of our conceptual schemes, linguistic\npractices, beliefs, etc. Realism may be spoken of with respect to other minds,\nthe past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural\nnumbers), moral categories, the material world, and thought. Realism can also be\npromoted in an unqualified sense, in which case it asserts the mind-independent\nexistence of a visible world, as opposed to idealism, skepticism, and solipsism.\nPhilosophers who profess realism state that truth consists in the mind's\ncorrespondence to reality. The statement veritas est adaequatio rei et\nintellectus (\"truth is the equation of thought and thing\") was ascribed by\nThomas Aquinas to a 10th-century Jewish philosopher, Isaac IsraÃ«li.\n([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/index.html Summa],\n[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1.htm I],\n[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Q.16],\n[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article2 A.2])\n\nRealists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation\nof reality and that every new observation brings us closer to understanding\nreality. Blackburn p. 188 In its Kantian sense, realism is contrasted\nwith [[idealism]]. In a contemporary sense, realism is contrasted with [[anti-\nrealism]], primarily in the philosophy of science.\n","linknr":794,"url":"Philosophical_realism","recorded":1362580585,"links":44,"instances":["metaphysics","philosophy","metaphysics","journal","ayn_rand"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Realism|*Philosophical","Metaphysical theories"],"headings":["History","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Plato-raphael.jpg/100px-Plato-raphael.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["universal","metaphysics"],["universal","metaphysics"],["universals","metaphysics"],["object","philosophy"],["objectivism","ayn_rand"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["universal","object","universals","nature","objectivism"],"related":["Reality","Ontology","Conceptual_scheme","Language","Belief","The_problem_of_other_minds","Past","Future","Universal_(metaphysics)","Mathematics","Natural_numbers","Morality","Material_world","Thought","Idealism","Skepticism","Solipsism","Truth","Correspondence_theory_of_truth","Philosophy_of_science","Medieval_philosophy","Scholasticism","Greek_philosophy","Platonic_realism","Problem_of_universals","Universal_(metaphysics)","Conceptualism","Nominalism","Flatus_voci","Platonic_realism","Philosophy","Universals_(metaphysics)","Abstract_object","Greek_philosophy","Philosopher","Plato","Socrates","Theory_of_Forms","Platonic_idealism","Philosophical_idealism","George_Berkeley","Abstraction","Mathematical_realism","Form_of_the_Good","Ethical_realism","Scottish_Common_Sense_Realism","Philosophy","Scepticism","Common_sense","Thomas_Reid","Adam_Ferguson","Dugald_Stewart","Scottish_Enlightenment","John_Locke","George_Berkeley","David_Hume","Empirical_evidence","Naïve_realism","Philosophy_of_mind","Common_sense","Theory","Perception","Senses","Awareness","Idealism","Skepticism","Object_(philosophy)","Matter","Space","Perception","Physics","Scientific_realism","Philosophy_of_science","Unobservables","Theory","Ontology","Analytical_philosopher","Instrumentalism","Analytic_philosophy","Critical_realism","Epistemological_realism","Legal_realism","Moderate_realism","Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)","Philosophy_of_social_science","Principle_of_bivalence","Problem_of_future_contingents","Truth-value_link_realism","Speculative_realism","Nature_(journal)"]}
