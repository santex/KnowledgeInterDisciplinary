It has been perpetrated mainly\nfor the purposes of sexual slavery or forced labor; other purposes include\nextraction of organs or tissues and even surrogacy and ova\nremoval\n\nThe Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially\nWomen and Children (also referred to as the Trafficking Protocol) was adopted by\nthe United Nations in Palermo in 2000, and is an international legal agreement\nattached to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC). This\nprotocol is one of three adopted to supplement the CTOC. The\nTrafficking Protocol is the first global, legally binding instrument on\ntrafficking in over half a century, and the only one with an agreed-upon\ndefinition of trafficking in persons. One of its purposes is to facilitate\ninternational cooperation in investigating and prosecuting such trafficking.\nAnother is to protect and assist human trafficking's victims with full respect\nfor their rights as established in the UDHR. The Trafficking Protocol defines\nhuman trafficking as\n\n{{quote|(a) [...] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or\nreceipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of\ncoercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a\nposition of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits\nto achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the\npurpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the\nexploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual\nexploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to\nslavery, servitude or the removal of organs;\n(b) The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended\n    exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be\n    irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been\n    used;\n(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child\n    for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered âtrafficking in personsâ\n    even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a)\n    of this article;\n(d) âChildâ shall mean any person under eighteen years of age. }}\n\nThe Trafficking Protocol entered into force on 25 December 2003. As of June 2010\nit has been ratified by 117 countries and 137 parties.\n","linknr":1347,"url":"Human_trafficking","recorded":1362890582,"links":92,"instances":["country","country"],"pdf":["http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf","http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf","http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/transcrime/gfi_transnational_crime_web.pdf","http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/transcrime/gfi_transnational_crime_web.pdf","http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/fact_labor.pdf","http://content.news14.com/human_trafficking.pdf","http://content.news14.com/human_trafficking.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090326135123/http://law.shu.edu/journals/lawreview/library/vol_35/35-2/Smolin.pdf","http://law.shu.edu/journals/lawreview/library/vol_35/35-2/Smolin.pdf","http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf","http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080626234542/http://www.prostitutie.nl/studie/documenten/mensenhandel/researchcasestraffick.pdf","http://www.prostitutie.nl/studie/documenten/mensenhandel/researchcasestraffick.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080626234542/http://www.prostitutie.nl/studie/documenten/mensenhandel/researchcasestraffick.pdf","http://www.solidaritycenter.org/files/IndoTraffickingFactSheetCauses.pdf","http://www.solidaritycenter.org/files/IndoTraffickingFactSheetCauses.pdf","http://ungift.org/docs/ungift/pdf/about/UNGIFT_progress_report09.pdf","http://ungift.org/docs/ungift/pdf/about/UNGIFT_progress_report09.pdf","http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/77423e5166dffaed5d33b58c35d504b5.pdf/119_Cho.pdf","http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/77423e5166dffaed5d33b58c35d504b5.pdf/119_Cho.pdf","http://polis.osce.org/library/f/3655/2833/UN-USA-RPT-3655-EN-Text%20of%20the%20Convention.pdf","http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf","http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06825.pdf","http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/HT-globalpatterns-en.pdf","http://polis.osce.org/library/f/3655/2833/UN-USA-RPT-3655-EN-Text%20of%20the%20Convention.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
