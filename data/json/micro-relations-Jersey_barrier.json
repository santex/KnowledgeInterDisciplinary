It is designed to minimize vehicle damage in cases of\nincidental contact while still preventing the crossover case of a head-on\ncollision. Jersey barriers are also used to reroute traffic and protect\npedestrians during highway construction, as well as temporary and semi-permanent\nprotections against landborne attack such as suicide vehicle bombs. A Jersey\nbarrier is also known in the western United States as 'K-rail', a term borrowed\nfrom the California Department of Transportation specification for temporary\nconcrete traffic barriers, or colloquially as a 'Jersey bump'.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Jersey_barrier","recorded":1362890097,"links":19,"instances":["equipment"],"pdf":["http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/ctrmeasures/concrete_barriers/concrt_barriers.pdf"],"categories":["American inventions","Road safety","Anti-tank obstacles","Fortification (architectural elements)"],"headings":["Development and use","Plastic Jersey barriers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Jersey_barrier_2.png/220px-Jersey_barrier_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Road_block.jpg/250px-Road_block.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Dora_Baghdad_soldiers.jpg/250px-Dora_Baghdad_soldiers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["loader","equipment"]],"members":["loader"],"related":["Semi-trailer_truck","Concrete","Traffic","Highway","California_Department_of_Transportation","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","New_Jersey","United_States","New_Jersey_Department_of_Transportation","Reinforced_concrete","Collision","Sheet_metal","Tire","Constant_slope_barrier","F-shape_barrier","Concrete_step_barrier","Ontario,_Canada","400-series_highways","New_Jersey_Turnpike_Authority","Semi-trailer_truck","New_York_State_Department_of_Transportation","Massachusetts_Department_of_Transportation","New_Jersey_Department_of_Transportation","Federal_Highway_Administration","Loader_(equipment)","Rebar","Lifting_hook","2010_G-20_Toronto_summit","Metro_Toronto_Convention_Centre","Polyethylene","Constant_slope_barrier","F-shape_barrier","Barrier_transfer_machine","Cable_barrier","Central_reservation","Traffic_barrier","Bremer_wall"]}
