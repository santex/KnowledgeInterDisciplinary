      "text" : "\n\n, Bertalda, Assailed by Spirits, c.1830]]\n\nThe English word 'spirit' (from Latin spiritus \"breath\") has many differing\nmeanings and connotations, most of them relating to a non-corporeal substance\ncontrasted with the material body. The word spirit is often used metaphysically\nto refer to the consciousness or personality. The notions of a person's spirit\nand soul often also overlap, as both contrast with body and both are understood\nas surviving the bodily death in religion and occultism,<ref>OED \"spirit 2.a.:\nThe soul of a person, as commended to God, or passing out of the body, in the\nmoment of death.\"</ref> and \"spirit\" can also have the sense of \"ghost\", i.e. a\nmanifestation of the spirit of a deceased person.\n\nThe term may also refer to any incorporeal or immaterial being, such as demons\nor deities, in Christianity specifically the Holy Spirit (though with a capital\n\"S\") experienced by the disciples at Pentecost.\n",
