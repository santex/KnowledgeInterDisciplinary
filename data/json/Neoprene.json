Here the soft thin rubber-like seal material at neck and wrists is made from\n  non-foam neoprene for elasticity; the blue area is a thin blue knit fabric\n  laminated onto spongy foamed neoprene for insulation.]]\n\n\n'Neoprene' or 'polychloroprene' is a family of synthetic rubbers that are\nproduced by polymerization of chloroprene.

Emulsion Rubbers\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial\nChemistry, 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  Neoprene exhibits good chemical\nstability, and maintains flexibility over a wide temperature range. It is used\nin a wide variety of applications, such as laptop sleeves, orthopedic braces\n(wrist, knee, etc.), electrical insulation, liquid and sheet applied elastomeric\nmembranes or flashings, and automotive fan belts.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Neoprene","recorded":1372154930,"links":[],"instances":["tubing","clothing","tack","catholic_church","mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elastomers","Dielectrics","DuPont","Brand name materials","DuPont products"],"headings":["Production","History","Applications","Precautions","References","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["belt","mechanical"],["priesthood","catholic_church"],["hose","tubing"],["girth","tack"],["lanvin","clothing"]],"members":["hose","lanvin","girth","priesthood","belt"],"related":["Synthetic_rubber","Chloroprene","Laptop","Orthopedic","Electricity","Electrical_insulation","Motor_vehicle","Belt_(mechanical)","2-chlorobutadiene","Potassium_persulfate","Thiourea","Elmer_Keiser_Bolton","DuPont","Priesthood_(Catholic_Church)","Julius_Arthur_Nieuwland","Chemistry","University_of_Notre_Dame","Acetylene","Sulfur_dichloride","Patent","Wallace_Carothers","Arnold_Collins","Hydrogen_chloride","Chloroprene","Synthetic_rubber","Gasket","Hose_(tubing)","Corrosion","Coating","Adhesive","Transformer","Hydrocarbon","Fire_door","Fly_fishing","Nylon","Wetsuit","Nitrogen","Spandex","Laptop","Tablet_computer","Remote_control","LRPu","Girth_(tack)","Airsoft","Yamaha","Hydroponics","Halloween","CPU_socket","Spandex","Wheelchair","Latex","Gareth_Pugh","Balenciaga","Lanvin_(clothing)","Vera_Wang","Thiourea","Vulcanizing_accelerators","Vulcanization","Ethylene_thiourea","Hydrochloric_acid","Acetone","Xylene","Acetic_acid","Aqua_regia","Boric_acid","Butane","Hydrogen_peroxide","Iodine","Kerosine","Lacquer","Lard","Motor_oil","Nitric_acid","Palm_oil","Tallow","Turpentine","Urine","Clorine","Bleach","Isoprene"]}
