The taxon was first\nestablished by Banks in 1968 as the subdivision 'Zosterophyllophytina'; they\nhave since also been treated as the division 'Zosterophyllophyta' and the class\n'Zosterophyllopsida'. They were among the first vascular plants in the fossil\nrecord, and had a world-wide distribution. They were probably stem-group\nlycophytes, forming a sister group to the ancestors of the living\nlycophytes. By the late Silurian (late Ludlovian,\nabout ) a diverse assemblage of species existed, examples of which have been\nfound fossilised in what is now Bathurst Island in Arctic Canada.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Zosterophyllophyta","recorded":1362477094,"links":25,"instances":["canada","biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Silurian life","Devonian life"],"headings":["Morphology","Taxonomy and classification","Phylogeny and genera","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Zosterophyllum.JPG/220px-Zosterophyllum.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/97/Sawdonia_ornata.gif/220px-Sawdonia_ornata.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Cooksonia.png/60px-Cooksonia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","biology"],["bathurst_island","canada"],["stele","biology"],["class","biology"],["order","biology"],["family","biology"]],"members":["bathurst_island","order","stele","class","family"],"related":["Taxon","Phylum","Phylum","Class_(biology)","Vascular_plant","Stem-group","Lycophyte","Silurian","Bathurst_Island_(Canada)","Arctic","Canada","Enation","Vernation","Stele_(biology)","Xylem","Xylem_development","Sporangium","Flowering_plant","David_P._Penhallow","Bryophyte","Class_(biology)","Taxonomic_rank","Xylem_development","Xylem","Order_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Cladogram","Polysporangiophyte","Sporangium","Paraphyletic","Lycophyte","Drepanophycales"]}
