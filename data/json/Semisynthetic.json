{"cursor":"1877","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\"'Semisynthesis'\" or 'partial chemical synthesis' is a type of chemical\nsynthesis that uses compounds isolated from natural sources (e.g. plant material\nor bacterial or cell cultures) as starting materials. These natural biomolecules\nare usually large and complex molecules. This is opposed to a total synthesis\nwhere large molecules are synthesized from a stepwise combination of small and\ncheap (usually petrochemical) building blocks.\n\nSemisynthesis is usually used when the precursor molecule is too structurally\ncomplex, too costly or too inefficient to be produced by total synthesis.\n\nDrugs derived from natural sources are usually produced by harvesting the\nnatural source or through semisynthetic methods: one example is the\nsemisynthesis of LSD from ergotamine, which is isolated from ergot fungus\ncultures. The commercial production of paclitaxel is also based on semisynthesis\n(see: paclitaxel total synthesis).\n\nThe antimalarial drug artemether (a component of Coartem) is a semisynthetic\nderived from naturally occurring artemisinin. The latter is unstable due to the\npresence of a lactone group and therefore this group is replaced by an acetal\nthrough organic reduction with potassium borohydride and methoxylation An\nImproved Manufacturing Process for the Antimalaria Drug Coartem.
