They are among the most diverse groups of animals on the planet,\nincluding more than a million described species and representing more than half\nof all known living organisms. The number\nof extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, In:  and potentially\nrepresent over 90% of the differing metazoan life forms on Earth.\nInsects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of\nspecies reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group,\ncrustaceans.\n\nThe life cycles of insects vary (from one day to a few years), but most insects\nhatch from eggs. Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and\ndevelopment involves a series of molts. The immature stages can differ from the\nadults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in\nthose groups that undergo complete metamorphosis. Insects that undergo\nincomplete metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series\nof nymphal stages. \"insect physiology\" McGraw-Hill\nEncyclopedia of Science and Technology, Ch. 9, p 233, 2007 The higher\nlevel relationship of the hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous\nsize have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with\nwingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22â28 in). The most diverse insect groups\nappear to have coevolved with flowering plants.\n\nAdult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming.\nAs it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait\nin which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating\ntriangles. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many\ninsects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations\nthat include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for\nswimming. Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the\nsurface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees,\nants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some\ninsects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young.\nInsects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can\nsense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species\ncommunicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to\nattract a mate and repel other males. Lampyridae in the beetle order Coleoptera\ncommunicate with light.\n\nHumans regard certain insects as pests, and attempt to control them using\ninsecticides and a host of other techniques. Some insects damage crops by\nfeeding on sap, leaves or fruits. A few parasitic species are capable of\ntransmitting diseases to humans, pets and livestock. Some insects perform\ncomplex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion and dead\nor diseased tissue but also spread diseases. lnsect pollinators are essential to\nthe life-cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms,\nincluding humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial\nportion of the biosphere (including humans) would be devastated. Many\nother insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few\nprovide direct economic benefit. Silkworms and bees have been used extensively\nby humans for the production of silk and honey, respectively. In some cultures,\nthe larvae or adults of certain insects are a food-source for humans.\n","linknr":1949,"url":"Insect","recorded":1362509373,"links":208,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","insect_mouthpart","animal","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","anatomy","butterfly","anatomy","insect","genetics","science","biology","biophysical","physiology","biology","anthropology","insect_anatomy","skin","biology","biology","insect_anatomy","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.vkm.no/dav/413af9502e.pdf","http://www.vkm.no/dav/413af9502e.pdf","http://docserver.esa.catchword.org/deliver/cw/pdf/esa/freepdfs/0046225x/v34n4s26.pdf","http://www.units.muohio.edu/cryolab/publications/documents/Lee89_BioSci.pdf","http://www.units.muohio.edu/cryolab/publications/documents/Lee89_BioSci.pdf","http://crazydaz.com/insects.pdf","http://crazydaz.com/insects.pdf","http://www.ti.uni-bielefeld.de/downloads/publications/habil.pdf","http://www.ti.uni-bielefeld.de/downloads/publications/habil.pdf","http://www.ento.org.nz/nzentomologist/free_issues/NZEnto07_4_1983/Volume%207-4-419-424.pdf","http://www.ento.org.nz/nzentomologist/free_issues/NZEnto07_4_1983/Volume%207-4-419-424.pdf","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ne/v33n2/a01v33n2.pdf","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ne/v33n2/a01v33n2.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/8/1043.full.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/8/1043.full.pdf","http://www-das.uwyo.edu/wcr/projects/ihop02/coldfront_preprint.pdf","http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~dhu/Pubweb/Bush_Hu_06.pdf","http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~dhu/Pubweb/Bush_Hu_06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080410135644/http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/documents/factsheet_pollinator.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080410135644/http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/documents/factsheet_pollinator.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20091122074740/http://www.spc.int/PPS/SAFRINET/inse-scr.pdf"],"categories":["Insects|","Arthropods","Entomology"],"headings":["Etymology","Phylogeny
