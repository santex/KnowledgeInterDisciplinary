Modern approaches are extending these observations beyond making\nmovies of cell structure. Increasingly, time-lapse imaging is being integrated\nwith specialized techniques for monitoring, measuring, and perturbing dynamic\nactivities of cells and subcellular structures. {{cite journal\n| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7310/full/4661137a.html\n| author=M.
