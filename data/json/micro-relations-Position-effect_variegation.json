{"cursor":"3221","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Position-effect variegation' is a variegation caused by the inactivation of a\ngene in some cells through its abnormal juxtaposition with heterochromatin.\n\nThe classical example is the [[Drosophila]] w[m4](speak white-mottled-4)\ntranslocation. In this mutation, an inversion on the X chromosome places the\nwhite gene next to pericentric heterochromatin. Normally, the white gene is\nexpressed in every cell of the adult Drosophila eye resulting in a red eye\nphenotype. In the w[m4] mutant the eye color is variegated (red-white mosaic\ncolored) where the white gene is expressed in some cells in the eyes and not in\nothers. The mutation was described first by Hermann Muller in 1938.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Position-effect_variegation","recorded":1363137186,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics"],"headings":["See also","Selected References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Variegation","Gene","Heterochromatin","Chromosomal_translocation","Mutation","Chromosomal_inversion","X_chromosome","Phenotype","Hermann_Joseph_Muller","Friedreich's_ataxia","Position_effect"]}
