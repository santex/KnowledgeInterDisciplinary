{"cursor":"2737","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'trap primer' (or 'trap seal primer') is a plumbing device or valve that adds\nwater to traps. The water seals in traps are needed to prevent sewer gases from\nentering buildings, but because this water is exposed to the air, it is subject\nto evaporation over time in infrequently used floor drains, leading to the\nrelease of sewer gas into the environment. The trap primer mitigates this\nproblem by injecting water, either directly or indirectly, into the trap to\nmaintain the water seal indefinitely.\n\nBuilding codes may require trap primers for some traps, especially for where\nexperience has shown that there are isolated and/or infrequently used drains\nsuch as basement floor drains (which are only used when the basement is\nflooded). Where explosion hazards are high, specifying trap primers, whether\nrequired or not by code, is wise. Trap primers do require maintenance and\nreplacement, so they should be installed in accessible locations.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Trap_primer","recorded":1362544539,"links":12,"instances":["plumbing","company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plumbing","Valves"],"headings":["Types","Other solutions","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trap","plumbing"],["moen","company"]],"members":["trap","moen"],"related":["Plumbing","Valve","Trap_(plumbing)","Water_seal","Sewer_gas","Evaporation","Building_code","Sink","Potable_water","Water_closet","Moen_(company)","Rancidification","Piping_and_plumbing_fittings","Plumbing_drainage_venting"]}
