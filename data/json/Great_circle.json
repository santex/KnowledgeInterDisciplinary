(A small circle is the\nintersection of the sphere and a plane which does not pass through the center.)\nAny diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and\ntherefore all great circles have the same circumference as each other, and have\nthe same center as the sphere. A great circle is the largest circle that can be\ndrawn on any given sphere. Every circle in Euclidean space is a great circle of\nexactly one sphere.\n\nFor any two points on the surface of a sphere there is a great circle through\nthe two points. The minor arc of a great circle between two points is the\nshortest surface-path between them. In this sense the minor arc is analogous\nto âstraight linesâ in spherical geometry. The length of the minor arc of a\ngreat circle is taken as the distance between two points on a surface of a\nsphere, namely the great-circle distance. The great circles are the geodesics\nof the sphere.\n\nIn higher dimensions, the great circles on the ''n''-sphere are the intersection\nof the n-sphere with two-planes that pass through the origin in the Euclidean\nspace 'R' n+1 .\n","linknr":206,"url":"Great_circle","recorded":1362672667,"links":59,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","geography","web_browser"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary geometry","Spherical trigonometry"],"headings":["Earth geodesics","Derivation of shortest paths","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Great_circle_hemispheres.png/220px-Great_circle_hemispheres.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/OblateSpheroid.PNG/220px-OblateSpheroid.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Greatcircle_Jetstream_routes.svg/220px-Greatcircle_Jetstream_routes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/5/195e08817e8a21cdb4023ded96abe1f4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/f/03fe329767af429479bc023b7605a6ab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/3/f035947a24cbeb316aed5a7976272b7f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/8/52804f46b652a46ada0e0bc1e3c8ac6b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/6/1a6fbc649bf9931fbda4210347b75f28.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plane","geometry"],["meridian","geography"],["functional","mathematics"],["safari","web_browser"],["safari","web_browser"]],"members":["plane","functional","meridian","safari"],"related":["Riemannian_circle","Sphere","Plane_(geometry)","Circle_of_a_sphere","Diameter","Circumference","Circle","Euclidean_space","Spherical_geometry","Great-circle_distance","Geodesic","N-sphere","Reference_ellipsoid","Mercator_projection","Gnomonic_projection","Meridian_(geography)","Equator","Latitude","Small_circle","Root_mean_square","Celestial_sphere","Celestial_horizon","Celestial_equator","Ecliptic","Flight_length","Great-circle_distance","Arctic","Jet_stream","Rhumb_line","Waypoint","Tokyo","Calculus_of_variations","Spherical_coordinates","Functional_(mathematics)","Great-circle_distance","Geodesic","Rhumb_line","Circle_of_a_sphere","Qibla","Wolfram_Demonstrations_Project","Google_Chrome","Firefox","Safari_(web_browser)","Google_Chrome","Firefox","Safari_(web_browser)"]}
