{"cursor":"4715","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Physical information security' Is concerned with physically protecting data and\nmeans to access that data (apart from protecting it electronically). Many\nindividuals and companies place importance in protecting their information from\na software and/or network perspective, but fewer devote resources to protecting\ndata physically. However, physical attacks to acquire sensitive information do\nfrequently occur. Sometimes these attacks are considered a type of social\nengineering.\n\n' Background' Many individuals and companies consider it important to protect\ntheir information for a variety of reasons, including financial, competitive,\nand privacy-related purposes. People who wish to obtain this information may be\ncomputer crackers, corporate spies, or other malicious individuals. This\ninformation may be directly beneficial to them, such as industrial secrets or\ncredit card numbers. It may also be indirectly beneficial to them. For example,\ncomputer passwords do not have inherent value. However, they provide computer\nsystem access that may be used to get other information or to disable a\nperson/company electronically. Sometimes these malicious individuals use\nelectronic means or social engineering to gain information. However, sometimes\nthey use direct physical attacks.\n\n' Examples of physical attacks to obtain information' There are several ways to\nobtain information through physical attacks or exploitations. A few examples are\ndescribed below.\n\n' Dumpster diving' Dumpster diving is the practice of searching through the\ntrash of an individual or business in attempt to obtain something useful. In the\nrealm of information security, this frequently means looking for documents\ncontaining sensitive information. However, as more and more information is being\nstored electronically, it is becoming increasingly useful to those seeking\ninformation through this means to search for computer disks or other computer\nhardware which may contain data. Sometimes this data can be restored to provide\na wealth of information.\n\n' Overt document stealing' Sometimes attackers will simply go into a building\nand take the information they need. Frequently when using this strategy, an\nattacker will masquerade as someone who belongs in the situation. The thief may\npose as a copy room employee, remove a document from someone's desk, copy the\ndocument, replace the original, and leave with the copied document.\nAlternatively, the individual may pose as a janitor, systematically collecting\ninformation and \"throwing it away.\" The individual may then be able to walk\nright out of the building with a trash bag containing documents that were left\nout in the open or a sticky note which had been left in a partially open desk\ndrawer on which a user had written his/her passwords.\n\n' Common Physical Information Security Practices'There are many practices\ncommonly used to decrease the possibility of success for these kind of attacks.\nDocument shredding has become common, and the practice is still growing. Also\nelectronic storage media are often prepared for disposal by purging, which\nerases files which may have been \"deleted\" by an operating system but never\noverwritten with other data.\n\nMany choose to restrict access to areas where information is kept to those\npossessing a proper identification badge and/or other form of authorization.\nThis attempts both to decrease the ease with which someone could access\ndocuments and to decrease the possibility of someone physically tampering with\ncomputer equipment. Along the same lines, many companies train their employees\nto physically protect documents and other sources of sensitive information on an\nindividual level by locking the information in a file cabinet or by some other\nmeans. Also, companies request that employees memorize their passwords rather\nthan writing them down as the paper with the password could be seen or stolen.
