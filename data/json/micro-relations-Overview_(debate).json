An overview may be\n\"global\" if presented at the beginning of a speech or \"local\" if presented at\nthe beginning of a position.\n\nOverviews typically list the order a debater's speech will be given in. For\ninstance, On-Case, Co-op Disadvantage, Spending Disadvantage, Weapon\nDisadvantage would be an expected overview.\n\nDebaters will usually inform the judge where they will be giving an overview\nbefore they start a speech because it can make it harder to flow the speech. A\nsmall minority of judges dislike this practice and will start speech time when a\ndebater starts giving this order.\n\nMany judges dislike overviews because, since many are scripted before the round\nbegins, they tend to be non-responsive or repetitive and are often long.\nHowever, most judges and coaches support the practice for arguments which cannot\nbe placed anywhere on the line-by-line or that need to be flagged for their\nimportance.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Overview_(debate)","recorded":1362665573,"links":14,"instances":["policy_debate","policy_debate"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Policy debate","Rhetoric"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["flow","policy_debate"],["judge","policy_debate"]],"members":["judge","flow"],"related":["Policy_debate","Structure_of_policy_debate","Flow_(policy_debate)","Judge_(policy_debate)"]}
