The derivation of a theorem is often interpreted as a proof of the\n truth of the resulting expression, but different deductive systems can yield\n other interpretations, depending on the meanings of the derivation rules. The\n proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument demonstrating that the\n conclusions are a necessary consequence of the hypotheses, in the sense that if\n the hypotheses are true then the conclusions must also be true, without any\n further assumptions. The concept of a theorem is therefore fundamentally\n [[deductive]], in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory, which is\n [[empirical]]. However, both theorems and theories are investigations. See\n Introduction, The terminology of Archimedes, p. clxxxii:\"theorem (Î¸Îµá½¼ÏÎ½Î¼Î±) from\n Î¸ÎµÏÏÎµá¼³Î½ to investigate\"\n\nAlthough they can be written in a completely symbolic form using, for example,\npropositional calculus, theorems are often expressed in a natural language such\nas English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically\norganized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of\nthe truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which\narguments a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such\narguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic onesâindeed, many\nmathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates\nthe validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why it is obviously\ntrue. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem.\nBecause theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its\naesthetics. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or\n\"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from\nperson to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or\nbetter understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the\nother hand, a deep theorem may be simply stated, but its proof may involve\nsurprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics.\nFermat's Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.\n","recorded":1362123875,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"579","instances":["symbol","polynomial","matematik","symbol","computer_science","logician","logic","mathematical_logic","logic","typography","film","symbol","logic","logic","formal","mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematical_logic","logic","dynamical_systems","set_theory","computer_science","wiskunde","symbol","polynomial","mathematics","mathematics","linguistics","mathematical_logic","mathematical_logic","logic","matematiikka","mathematics","symbol","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","logic","logic","mathematics","mathematical_logic","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED037335.pdf","http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED037335.pdf"],"categories":["Theorems|","Mathematical
