The flight is under contract to\nNASA as Cygnus' demonstration mission in the Commercial Orbital Transportation\nServices (COTS) program. The mission is scheduled to launch in April 2013. When berthed, it will become the 5th unmanned vehicle type\nto deliver supplies to the station. The other vehicles are the Progress, ATV,\nHTV and the Dragon. The Cygnus is expected to deliver of cargo to ISS and\ndispose of about through destructive reentry.\n","linknr":320,"url":"Cygnus_1","recorded":1362267910,"links":18,"instances":["rocket","iss_module","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2013 in spaceflight","Unmanned resupply spacecraft","Supply vehicles for the International Space Station","Future spaceflights"],"headings":["Gallery","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Cygnus_PCM_Arrival_at_NASA%27s_Wallops_Flight_Facility_02.jpg/120px-Cygnus_PCM_Arrival_at_NASA%27s_Wallops_Flight_Facility_02.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/Progress-HTV-Dragon-ATV_Collage.jpg/110px-Progress-HTV-Dragon-ATV_Collage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Gas_giants_in_the_solar_system.jpg/30px-Gas_giants_in_the_solar_system.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cygnus","spacecraft"],["antares","rocket"],["harmony","iss_module"],["cygnus","spacecraft"],["antares","rocket"],["progress","spacecraft"],["dragon","spacecraft"]],"members":["antares","harmony","progress","dragon","cygnus"],"related":["Cygnus_(spacecraft)","NASA","International_Space_Station","Expedition_34","Orbital_Sciences_Corporation","Antares_(rocket)","Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport","Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport_Launch_Pad_0","Harmony_(ISS_module)","Nadir","CRS_Orb-1","Orbital_Sciences_Corporation","Unmanned_resupply_spacecraft","Cygnus_(spacecraft)","International_Space_Station","Antares_(rocket)","NASA","Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services","Progress_(spacecraft)","Automated_Transfer_Vehicle","H-II_Transfer_Vehicle","Dragon_(spacecraft)","Atmospheric_entry"]}
