It is implemented as a troff preprocessor.\n\nrefer was written by Mike E. Lesk at Bell Laboratories Michael Lesk. Some\napplications of inverted indexes on the Unix system. In UNIX Programmer's\nmanual: Supplementary Documents, volume 2. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, seventh\nedition, 1982. Also available online [http://plan9.bell-\nlabs.com/7thEdMan/] in or before 1978, and is now available as part of\nmost Unix-like operating systems. A free reimplementation exists as part of the\ngroff package.\n\nrefer works with a reference file, a text file where the author lists works to\nwhich she might want to refer. One such reference (to an article in a journal in\nthis case) might look like:\n\n %A Brian W. Kernighan %A Lorinda L. Cherry %T A System for Typesetting\n Mathematics %J J. Comm. ACM %V 18 %N 3 %D March 1978 %P 151-157 %K eqn\n\nThe author then can refer to it in her troff document by listing keywords which\nuniquely match this reference:\n\n .[ kernighan cherry eqn .]\n\nrefer sees little use today, primarily because troff itself is not used much for\nlonger technical writing that might need software support for reference and\ncitation management.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Refer_(software)","recorded":1362892404,"links":13,"instances":["software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Troff|Refer","Reference management software|Refer","Bibliography file formats"],"headings":["Citations","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/HelloWorld.svg/50px-HelloWorld.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["groff","software"]],"members":["groff"],"related":["Troff","Preprocessor","Mike_Lesk","Bell_Laboratories","Unix-like","Groff_(software)","Comparison_of_reference_management_software","PostScript"]}
