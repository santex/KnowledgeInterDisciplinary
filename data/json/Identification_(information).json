The known quantity is called the identifier (or Id) and\nthe unknown entity is what needs identification. A basic requirement for\nidentification is that the Id be unique. Ids may be scoped, that is, they are\nunique only within a particular scope. Ids may also be built out of a collection\nof quantities such that they are unique on the collective.\n\nFor data storage, 'identification' is the capability to find, retrieve, report,\nchange, or delete specific data without ambiguity. This applies especially to\ninformation stored in databases. In database normalisation, it is the central,\ndefining function to the discipline.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Identification_(information)","recorded":1362572479,"links":20,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Identification","Data modeling"],"headings":["Relational database example","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Crystal_Clear_action_run.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_action_run.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["identification","disambiguation"]],"members":["identification"],"related":["Data_storage_device","Data","Ambiguity","Information","Database","Database_normalization","Internal_Revenue_Service","United_States","Social_Security_number","Authentication","Identification_(disambiguation)","Forensic_profiling","Profiling_practices","Unique_identifier"]}
