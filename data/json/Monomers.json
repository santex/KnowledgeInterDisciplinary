The term \"monomeric protein\" may also be used to describe one of the\nproteins making up a multiprotein complex. The most common natural monomer is\nglucose, which is linked by glycosidic bonds into polymers such as cellulose and\nstarch, and is over 77% of the mass of all plant matter. Cellulose.

Most often the term monomer refers to the organic\nmolecules which form synthetic polymers, such as, for example, vinyl chloride,\nwhich is used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n","linknr":186,"url":"Monomers","recorded":1362512485,"links":53,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monomers|"],"headings":["Natural monomers","Molecular weight","Industrial use","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dimer","chemistry"],["trimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","trimer"],"related":["Greek_language","Molecule","Chemical_bonding","Polymer","Multiprotein_complex","Glucose","Glycosidic_bonds","Cellulose","Starch","Synthetic_polymers","Vinyl_chloride","Polyvinyl_chloride","Amino_acid","Polymerization","Ribosome","Protein","Nucleotides","Nucleic_acids","DNA","RNA","Glucose","Starch","Glycogen","Cellulose","Xylose","Xylan","Hydrogen","Hydroxyl","Oxygen","Water","Isoprene","Natural_rubber","Dimer_(chemistry)","Trimer_(chemistry)","Tetramer","Oligomer","Propylene","Polyolefin","Prepolymer"]}
