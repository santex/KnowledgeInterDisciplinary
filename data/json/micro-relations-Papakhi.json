{"cursor":"3300","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Papakhi' ( ; ; ; ; ), also known as Astrakhan hat in English, is a male wool\nhat worn throughout the Caucasus.\n\nFor example, Georgian papakhi are made of wool and have a circular shape.\n\nThe two Russian Papakhis, one called a Papaha, is a high fur hat, usually made\nof karakul sheep skin. The hat has the general appearance of a cylinder with one\nopen side, and is set upon the head in such a way as to have the brim touch the\ntemples, some of them comes with ear flaps which can fold up when not using them\nand unfold them down when using. The other called a Kubanka, which is the same\nas the papaha, except shorter, and with no ear flaps.\n\nPapakhi are mostly worn in mountainous Georgia: the regions of Pshavi, Khevi,\nMtiuleti and Tusheti. Papakhi are also donned by the Chechens and other\nCaucasian tribes and were introduced to the Russian army following the campaigns\nin the Caucasus mountains, becoming an official part of the uniform in 1855 for\nthe Cossacks, and, later, for the rest of the cavalry.\n\nShortly after the Russian revolution of 1917, papakhi were removed from the new\nRed Army uniform because of their association with the old Tsarist regime and\nthe fact that many Cossack regiments of the Tsarist army fought against the\nBolsheviks. During the Russian Civil War, many Bolshevik cavalrymen and officers\n(like Vasily Chapayev) wore papahas or kubankas because many of them were\ncossacks and the hat had become a customary part of a cavalryman's costume.\n\nPapakhi became part of the uniform again in 1935, but in 1941, were reserved\nexclusively for full colonels, generals and marshals, thus becoming a symbol of\nstatus and high rank. In 1994, they were once again removed from military use,\nallegedly upon the request of the wearers, who found the hat inefficient since\nthe Papakhi is a relatively short hat that does not protect the ears well - this\nmight have been acceptable in the mild climate of the Caucasus, but not in lower\ntemperatures - and is not very wind-proof.\n\nThe act of removing the papakhi was seen in some quarters as an attempt of the\nBoris Yeltsin regime to abandon earlier Soviet traditions and symbolically\ndemonstrate the country's commitment to a new political course. In 2005, papakhi\nwere reinstalled.\n\n File:Brooklyn Museum - Two Persian Peasants and Two Persian Officers\nGambling One of 274 Vintage Photographs.jpg|Two Persian peasants with papkhi and\ntwo Persian officers gambling, between 1876 and 1933, Brooklyn Museum Image:Vaja-\npapakhi.jpg|The famous Georgian poet Vazha-Pshavela wearing a Georgian Papakhi\nFile:Ford - Brezhnev 1974.jpg|Leonid Brezhnev (right) wearing a papakh and\nGerald Ford wearing an ushanka, 1974 in Vladivostok \n","linknr":266,"url":"Papakhi","recorded":1362566578,"links":36,"instances":["sheep"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Uniforms","Hats","Clothing of Georgia (country)","Azerbaijani clothing","Russian clothing","Military organization of Cossacks"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Repin_Cossacks.jpg/180px-Repin_Cossacks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Two_Persian_Peasants_and_Two_Persian_Officers_Gambling_One_of_274_Vintage_Photographs.jpg/91px-Brooklyn_Museum_-_Two_Persian_Peasants_and_Two_Persian_Officers_Gambling_One_of_274_Vintage_Photographs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f5/Vaja-papakhi.jpg/92px-Vaja-papakhi.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Ford_-_Brezhnev_1974.jpg/120px-Ford_-_Brezhnev_1974.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Russian-Matroshka_no_bg.jpg/100px-Russian-Matroshka_no_bg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Samovar.silver.jpg/80px-Samovar.silver.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Grayushanka.jpg/80px-Grayushanka.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/TenorBalalaika1.jpg/100px-TenorBalalaika1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["karakul","sheep"]],"members":["karakul"],"related":["Wool","Karakul_(sheep)","Pshavi","Khevi","Mtiuleti","Tusheti","Chechens","Caucasus","Imperial_Russian_Army","Caucasus_mountains","Cossack","Russian_revolution_of_1917","Red_Army","Tsarist_regime","Bolsheviks","Russian_Civil_War","Vasily_Chapayev","Boris_Yeltsin","Brooklyn_Museum","Georgian_people","Vazha-Pshavela","Leonid_Brezhnev","Gerald_Ford","Ushanka","Vladivostok"]}
