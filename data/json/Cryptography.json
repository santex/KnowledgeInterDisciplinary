{"cursor":"62495","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n Lorenz cipher machine, used in World War II to encrypt very-high-level\n general staff messages]]\n\n'Cryptography' (or cryptology; from Greek , \"hidden, secret\"; and , graphein,\n\"writing\", or , [[-logy|-logia]], \"study\", respectively) Liddell and Scott's\nGreek-English Lexicon. Oxford University Press. (1984) is the practice and\nstudy of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties\n(called adversaries). More generally, it is about\nconstructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of\nadversaries and which are related to various\naspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity,\nauthentication, and non-repudiation. Modern cryptography\nintersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical\nengineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords,\nand electronic commerce.\n\nCryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with\n[[encryption]], the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent\nnonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique\nneeded to recover the original information only with intended recipients,\nthereby precluding unwanted persons to do the same. Since World War I and\nthe advent of the computer, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become\nincreasingly complex and its application more widespread.\n\nModern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science\npractice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness\nassumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary.\nIt is theoretically possible to break such a system but it is infeasible to do\nso by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed\ncomputationally secure; theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in integer\nfactorization algorithms) and faster computing technology require these\nsolutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically\nsecure schemes that cannot be broken even with unlimited computing powerâan\nexample is the one-time padâbut these schemes are more difficult to implement\nthan the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.\n\nCryptology-related technology has raised a number of legal issues. In the United\nKingdom, additions to the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 require a\nsuspected criminal to hand over their encryption key if asked by law\nenforcement. Otherwise the user will face a criminal charge. The\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is involved in a case in the Supreme Court\nof the United States, which may determine whether requiring suspected criminals\nto provide their encryption keys to law enforcement is unconstitutional. The EFF\nis arguing that this is a violation of the right of not being forced to\nincriminate oneself, as given in the fifth amendment.\n","linknr":1001,"url":"Cryptography","recorded":1362671686,"links":115,"instances":["cryptography","algebra","cryptography","writer","cryptography","algorithm","cryptanalysis","cipher","cryptography","cryptography","security"],"pdf":["http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rd/86197922%2C340126%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/16749/http:zSzzSzwww.cs.rutgers.eduzSz%7EtdnguyenzSzclasseszSzcs671zSzpresentationszSzArvind-NEWDIRS.pdf/diffie76new.pdf","http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf","http://www.ncua.gov/letters/2004/04-CU-09.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf","http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/rsapaper.pdf","http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/lecture/paper2.pdf","http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf","http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/K54H077NP8714058.pdf","http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf","http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf","https://www.cryptool.org/download/CrypToolScript-en.pdf","http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/227/spring05/book/main.pdf","http://www.cryptool.org/images/ct1/presentations/CrypToolPresentation-en.pdf","http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4830/2010fa/lecnotes.pdf"],"categories":["Cryptography|","Banking
