Along with the ajrak, the Sindhi cap is\n regarded as an essential part of Sindhi culture and a symbol of Sindhi\n nationalism.\n\nThe hat is circular/cylindrical except for a portion cut out in the front to\nexpose the forehead. Intricate geometrical designs are embroidered on the hat,\nand very often small pieces of mirror are sewed into it also.\n\nIn Sindhi culture, the Sindhi cap is often given as a gift or as a sign of\nrespect, along with the ajrak.\n\nIn December 2009, \"Sindhi Cap Day\" was celebrated in Pakistan's Sindh province\nto celebrate the Sindhi cap, and Sindhi culture in general. In 2010, the day was\nrenamed to Sindhi Cultural Day.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Sindhi_cap","recorded":1362566585,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pakistani headgear","Sindhi culture","Caps"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Young_Pashtun_boy.JPEG/270px-Young_Pashtun_boy.JPEG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Flag_of_Sindhudesh.svg/22px-Flag_of_Sindhudesh.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pakistan","Afghanistan","Hat","Sindhi_people","Sindh","Baloch_people","Saraiki_people","Ajrak","Culture_of_Sindh","Sindhi_nationalism","Ajrak","Pakistan","Sindh","Sindhi_culture"]}
