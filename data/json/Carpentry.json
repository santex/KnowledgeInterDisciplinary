{"cursor":"14987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, June 1942]]\n\n, Cervo, Italy]]\n\n\n'Carpentry' is a skilled trade in which the primary work performed is the use of\nwood to construct items as large as buildings and as small as desk drawers.\nCarpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured\nduring the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses. While\nthe primary material used is wood, the construction of walls with metal studs,\nand concrete formwork with reusable metal forms, is a carpentry skill.\n\nProfessional status as a journeyman carpenter in the United States may be\nobtained in a number of ways. The most formal training is acquired in a four\nyear apprenticeship program administered by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters\nand Joiners of America, in which journeyman status is obtained after successful\ncompletion of a 12 weeks of pre-appenticeship training, followed by 4 years of\non-the-job field training working alongside journeyman carpenters.\n\nThere are two main divisions of training: Construction Carpentry and\nCabinetmaking. During pre-apprenticeship trainees in each major division spend\n30 hours a week for 12 weeks in classrooms and indoor workshops, learning\nmathematics, trade terminology, and skill with hand and power tools.\nConstruction carpentry trainees also have a daily calisthentics period to\nprepare for the physical aspect of the work.\n\nUpon completion of pre-apprenticship, trainess who successfully pass the graded\ncurriculum (taught by highly experienced journeyman carpenters) are assigned to\na local union, and to union carpentry crews at work on construction sites or in\ncabinet shops as First Year Apprentices. Over the next four years as they\nprogress in status to 2nd Year, 3rd year, and 4th Year Apprentice, they\nperiodically return to the training facility for one week every three months for\nmore detailed training in specific aspects of the trade.\n\nLess formal methods of obtaining Union Journeyman status exist, such as working\nalongside carpenters for years as a laborer, and learning skills by observation\nand peripheral assistance. While such an individual may obtain journeyman status\nby paying the union entry fee and obtaining a journeyman's card (which provides\nthe right to work on a union carpentry crew) the carpenter foreman will by\nnecessity dismiss any worker who presents the card but not demonstrate the\nexpected work skill.\n\nCarpentry skill of a varying degree may gained through non-union vocational\nprograms, such as high school shop classes.\n\nThe word \"carpenter\" is the English rendering of the Old French word carpentier\n(become charpentier) which is derived from the Latin carpentrius [artifex],\n\"(maker) of a carriage.

The American Heritage Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language: Fourth Edition. 2000. In British slang, a carpenter is\nsometimes referred to as a \"chippy\".\n\nCarpentry in the United States is almost always done by men. With 98.5% of\ncarpenters being male, it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the\ncountry in 1999.\n","linknr":441,"url":"Carpentry","recorded":1362563056,"links":74,"instances":["furniture","theatre","carpenter"],"pdf":["http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf","http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf","http://www.energystar.gov/ia/new_homes/Green_Begins_with_ENERGYSTAR_Blue.pdf","http://www.energystar.gov/ia/new_homes/Green_Begins_with_ENERGYSTAR_Blue.pdf","http://www.uwex.edu/CES/cced/communities/documents/GreenCollar.pdf","http://www.uwex.edu/CES/cced/communities/documents/GreenCollar.pdf"],"categories":["Crafts","Occupations","Woodworking","Carpentry|"],"headings":["Types and occupations","Training","Notable carpenters","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PalmercarpenterA.jpg/220px-PalmercarpenterA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Fotothek_df_n-10_0000828.jpg/220px-Fotothek_df_n-10_0000828.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Cervo100.jpg/220px-Cervo100.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Indiacarpenter.jpg/220px-Indiacarpenter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Centre_Pompidou-Metz_chantier.JPG/220px-Centre_Pompidou-Metz_chantier.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chest","furniture"],["william_hurley","carpenter"],["carpenter","theatre"]],"members":["chest","carpenter","william_hurley"],"related":["Cervo,_Liguria","Italy","Building_construction","English_language","French_language","Latin","Carriage","Middle_English_language","Scots_language","Old_English_language","British_English","Slang","Cabinetry","Tool","Parquetry","Woodworking_joints","Door","Window","Neck_molding","Fireplace_mantel","Wardrobe","Chest_of_drawers","Chest_(furniture)","Shipbuilding","Shipbuilding","Ship","Barrel","Theatrical_scenery","Set_construction","Platform_framing","Balloon_framing","Timber_framing","Mortise_and_tenon","Pole_building_framing","Falsework","Concrete","Japanese_carpentry","Building_restoration","Architectural_conservation","Historic_Preservation","Metz","France","Kim_Bá»“ng_woodworking_village","Apprenticeship","Journeyman","United_Brotherhood_of_Carpenters_and_Joiners_of_America","Master_craftsman","Japan","Interprovincial_Standards","Construction","GCSE","Mathematics","Technology","Joiner","Shop_fitting","Scaffolding","Joiner","Maintenance,_repair_and_operations","Jesus","Laborer","Saint_Joseph","Mayasura","Noah","Viswakarma","Lu_Ban","Matthew_Banckes","Hugh_Herland","William_Hurley_(carpenter)","Sympson_the_Joiner","Robert_Lyminge","Harry_McNish","Perumthachan","Norm_Abram","Jeremy_Broun","Theo_Wade_Brown","Adam_Carolla","Harrison_Ford","Brian_Haw","Christopher_Fulke_Greville","Mike_Holmes","Andy_Kane","Thomas_J._MacDonald","Nick_Offerman","Alan_Peters","Roy_Underhill","Paulinho_da_Viola","Atlanta_Community_ToolBank","Building_construction","Carpenter_(theatre)","Guild","Woodworking","Timber_framing"]}
