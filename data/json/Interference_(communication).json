The term typically\nrefers to the addition of unwanted signals to a useful signal. Common\nexamples are:\n\n* Electromagnetic interference (EMI)\n* Co-channel interference (CCI), also known as crosstalk\n* Adjacent-channel interference (ACI)\n* Intersymbol interference (ISI)\n* Inter-carrier interference (ICI), caused by doppler shift in OFDM modulation\n  (multitone modulation).\n* Common-mode interference (CMI)\n* Conducted interference\n\nInterference is typically but not always distinguished from noise, for example\nwhite thermal noise.\n\nRadio resource management aims at reducing and controlling the co-channel and\nadjacent-channel interference.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Interference_(communication)","recorded":1362567186,"links":23,"instances":["electrical_engineering","communications","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Noise","Interference","electronics","telecommunications"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg/25px-Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/28px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/28px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electrical_engineering"],["channel","communications"],["crosstalk","electronics"]],"members":["signal","channel","crosstalk"],"related":["Communication","Electronics","Telecommunications","Signal_(electrical_engineering)","Channel_(communications)","Communication_source","Electromagnetic_interference","Co-channel_interference","Crosstalk_(electronics)","Adjacent-channel_interference","Intersymbol_interference","Inter-carrier_interference","OFDM","Common-mode_interference","Conducted_interference","Electronic_noise","White_noise","Thermal_noise","Radio_resource_management","Distortion","Signal-to-Interference_Ratio","Signal_to_noise_plus_interference","Inter-flow_interference","Intra-flow_interference"]}
