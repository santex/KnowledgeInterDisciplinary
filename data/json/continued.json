It was\nreleased on Monument Records and contained the single Roosevelt and Ira Lee It\nwas recorded at Monument Studios, Nashville and Lyn-Lou Studios, Memphis in\n1969. It was produced by Billy Swan and engineered by Tommy Strong and Mort\nThomasson.\n\nThe album was re-released on by Movieplay/Intermusic from Portugal in 1993 with\na different cover and another title (Roosevelt And Ira Lee). In 1997 it was\nrereleased by Warner Brothers containing two additional songs - \"Watching The\nTrains Go By\" (by Dewey Oldham and Wallace Pennington) and \"Old Man Willis\" (by\nTony Joe White himself) was the second single. \"Old Man Willis\" was later re-\nrecorded for the album.\n\nThe album contained the track \"Rainy Night In Georgia\" popularized by R&B\nvocalist Brook Benton in 1970. It reached #4 on the Pop Singles and #2 on the\nAdult Contemporary charts, respectively. The RIAA certified the single gold for\nsales of one million copies. In 2004, it was ranked #498 on the List of Rolling\nStone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe song has been covered by a number of musicians, including Ray Charles, Otis\nRush, Randy Crawford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Amos Garrett, Hank Williams, Jr.,\nShelby Lynne, John Holt, by the duet of Conway Twitty and Sam Moore, Aaron\nNeville, and reggae band The Gladiators. Most recently indie folk-rock band Hem\nreleased a cover on [[No Word from Tom]] (2006). Australian band Ross Hanniford\nTrio recorded a cover of the song on their 1994 album. Interestingly, David\nRuffin recorded a cover version of the song the same year as Benton, however,\nMotown for unknown reasons did not release the album. A dance version was\nrecorded by Boozoo Bajou in 2006.\n","title":"continued","headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Notes and references"]},"micro-relation":["4: Tony_Joe_White","2: Monument_Records","2: Billy_Swan","2: Rainy_Night_In_Georgia","1: Country_music","1: Pop_music","1: Blue-eyed_soul","1: Swamp_rock","1: Allmusic","1: Roosevelt_and_Ira_Lee","1: Nashville","1: Memphis,_Tennessee","1: Warner_Brothers","1: R&B","1: Brook_Benton","1: 1970_in_music","1: Billboard_Hot_100","1: RIAA","1: List_of_Rolling_Stone's_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time","1: Cover_version","1: Ray_Charles","1: Otis_Rush","1: Randy_Crawford","1: Tennessee_Ernie_Ford","1: Amos_Garrett","1: Hank_Williams,_Jr.","1: Shelby_Lynne","1: Conway_Twitty","1: Sam_Moore","1: Aaron_Neville","1: Folk-rock","1: David_Ruffin","1: Motown","1: Boozoo_Bajou","1: Tommy_McClure","1: Sammy_Creason","1: James_Milhart","1: Michael_Utley"]}
