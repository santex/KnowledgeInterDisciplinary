{"cursor":"66355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In broadcasting and radio communications, a 'call sign' (also known as a 'call\nname' or 'call letters'âand historically as a 'call signal'âor abbreviated as a\n'call') is a unique designation for a transmitting station. In North\nAmerica they are used as names for broadcasting stations. A call sign\ncan be formally assigned by a government agency, informally adopted by\nindividuals or organizations, or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a\nstation's identity.\n\nThe use of call signs as unique identifiers dates to the landline railroad\ntelegraph system. Because there was only one telegraph line linking all railroad\nstations, there needed to be a way to address each one when sending a telegram.\nIn order to save time, two letter identifiers were adopted for this purpose.\nThis pattern continued in radiotelegraph operation; radio companies initially\nassigned two-letter identifiers to coastal stations and stations aboard ships at\nsea. These were not globally unique, so a one-letter company identifier (for\ninstance, 'M' and two letters as a Marconi Station) was later added. By 1912,\nthe need to quickly identify stations operated by multiple companies in multiple\nnations required an international standard; an ITU prefix would be used to\nidentify a country, and the rest of the call sign an individual station in that\ncountry. {{cite web |url=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1913call.htm\n|title=Radio Call Letters |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerece, Bureau

spacecraft.\n","linknr":1181,"url":"Call_sign","recorded":1362891080,"links":66,"instances":["am","broadcaster","radio_station","broadcaster","new_zealand","am","am","province","catalonia","radio_navigation","navigation_system","military_unit","tv_station","am","australian_tv_station","tv_station","tv_station","am","australia","am","province","province","radio","radio_station","tv_station","tv_station","sailplane"],"pdf":["http://www.icao.int/icao/en/ro/apac/2007/FIT_SEA5/ip05.pdf","http://www.icao.int/icao/en/ro/apac/2007/FIT_SEA5/ip05.pdf","http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib100052/lic027_current_tcbls.pdf","http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib100052/lic027_current_tcbls.pdf","http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/radio/rsls/RSL_notes.pdf"],"categories":["Amateur
