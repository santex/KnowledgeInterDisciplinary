It may occur through the process of photosynthesis,\nusing light as a source of energy, or chemosynthesis, using the oxidation or\nreduction of chemical compounds as a source of energy. Almost all life on earth\nis directly or indirectly reliant on primary production. The organisms\nresponsible for primary production are known as primary producers or autotrophs,\nand form the base of the food chain. In terrestrial ecoregions, these are mainly\nplants, while in aquatic ecoregions algae are primarily responsible. Primary\nproduction is distinguished as either net or gross, the former accounting for\nlosses to processes such as cellular respiration, the latter not.\n","linknr":481,"url":"Primary_production","recorded":1362372551,"links":39,"instances":["biochemistry","mathematics","ecology","plug","optics","temperature_coefficient","thermodynamics","ecology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.biology.duke.edu/wilson/EcoSysServices/papers/VitousekEtal1986.pdf","http://www.biology.duke.edu/wilson/EcoSysServices/papers/VitousekEtal1986.pdf"],"categories":["Plants","Ecology"],"headings":["Overview","GPP
