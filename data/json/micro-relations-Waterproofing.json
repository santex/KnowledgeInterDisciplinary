Such items\nmay be used in wet environments or under water to specified depths.\n'Waterproofing' describes making an object waterproof or water-resistant (such\nas a camera or watch).\n\n\"Water resistant\" and \"waterproof\" often refer to penetration of liquid water.\nPermeation of water vapor is reported as a water vapor transmission rate. Also,\nwater from condensation is usually separate from \"water resistant\".\n\nThe hulls of boats and ships were once waterproofed by applying tar or pitch.\nModern items may be waterproofed by applying water-repellent coatings or by\nsealing seams with gaskets or O-rings.\n\nIn construction, a building or structure is waterproofed with the use of\nmembranes and coatings to protect contents underneath or within as well as\nprotecting structural integrity. The waterproofing of the building envelope in\nconstruction specifications is listed under '07 - Thermal and Moisture\nProtection' within MasterFormat 2004, by the Construction Specifications\nInstitute, and includes roofing material as well as waterproofing materials.\n\nWaterproofing is used in reference to building structures (basements, decks, wet\nareas, etc.), watercraft, canvas, clothing (raincoat, waders) and paper (e.g.,\nmilk and juice cartons).\n\nWaterproofing should not be confused with roofing, as roofing cannot necessarily\nwithstand hydrostatic head, and waterproofing can.\n\nThe standards for waterproofing bathrooms in domestic construction have improved\nover the years, due in large part to the general tightening of building codes.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Waterproofing","recorded":1362675739,"links":21,"instances":["resin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Water","Construction","Gardening aids","Physical quantities"],"headings":["Construction waterproofing","Oil based Waterproofing","Standards","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pitch","resin"]],"members":["pitch"],"related":["Under_water","Camera","Watch","Permeation","Water_vapor","Water_vapor_transmission_rate","Condensation","Tar","Pitch_(resin)","Gaskets","O-ring","Building_envelope","MasterFormat","Construction_Specifications_Institute","Raincoat","Waders","Milk_and_juice_carton","Roofing","Roofing","Hydrostatic_head","Construction","Concrete","Artificial_membrane","Bitumen","Silicate","PVC","EPDM","ASTM","IEC_60529","Bituminous_waterproofing","Durable_water_repellent","Building_insulation","IP_Code","Sika_AG","Soundproofing","Water_Resistant_mark","Water_vapor_transmission_rate","Waterproof_fabric","Waterproof_paper"]}
