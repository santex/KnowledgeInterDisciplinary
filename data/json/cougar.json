'catamount', is a large cat of the family Felidae native to the\nAmericas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South\nAmerica, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western\nHemisphere.<ref name=\"diet\"/> An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is\nfound in most American habitat types. It is the second heaviest cat in the\nWestern Hemisphere, after the jaguar. Solitary by nature and nocturnal,<ref nam-\ne=\"cougar\">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070224075326/http://www.nps.gov/ccso/c-\nougar.htm Cougars]. US National Park Service.</ref> the cougar is most closely\nrelated to smaller felines and is nearer genetically to the domestic cat than\ntrue lions.\n\nAn excellent stalk-and-ambush predator, the cougar pursues a wide variety of\nprey. Primary food sources include ungulates such as deer, elk, moose, and\nbighorn sheep, as well as domestic cattle, horses and sheep, particularly in the\nnorthern part of its range. It will also hunt species as small as insects and\nrodents. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for\nstalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is territorial and\nsurvives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on\nterrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the\napex predator in its range, yielding to the jaguar, grey wolf, American black\nbear, and grizzly bear. It is reclusive and usually avoids people. Fatal attacks\non humans are rare, but have been trending upward in recent years as more people\nenter their territory.<ref name=\"Med\"/>\n\nExcessive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and the\nongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in\nmost parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was extirpated in\neastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for an\nisolated subpopulation in Florida. However, in recent decades, breeding\npopulations have moved east into the far western parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska,\nand Oklahoma.
