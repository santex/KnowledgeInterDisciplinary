The party supported states' rights and\nincreased Southern cultural and regionalist activism.\n\nThe Party was formed by the League of the South in 1999 and experienced moderate\nsuccess following the framing of the Asheville Declaration, which was touted by\nthe Party as a second Declaration of Independence. Despite its initial success,\nthe Southern Party was disbanded in 2003 following internal factionalism; all\nthat exists of the Southern Party today are the remnants of its state chapters\nin Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Mississippi.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Southern_Party","recorded":1362582783,"links":23,"instances":["united_states","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["United States regional and state political parties","Regionalist parties","History of the Southern United States","Political parties established in 1999","Political parties disestablished in 2003","1999 establishments in the United States","2003 disestablishments in the United States"],"headings":["History","Today","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Southern_Party_%28logo%29.jpg/250px-Southern_Party_%28logo%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["georgia","u.s._state"],["libertarian_party","united_states"],["constitution_party","united_states"]],"members":["constitution_party","georgia","libertarian_party"],"related":["Houston","Texas","States'_Rights","Political_party_in_the_United_States","Southern_United_States","States'_rights","League_of_the_South","Asheville_Declaration","Declaration_of_Independence","Florida","Georgia_(U.S._state)","North_Carolina","Mississippi","Monroe,_Louisiana","Tuscaloosa,_Alabama","Nonpartisan","West_Point,_Alabama","ABC_News","NPR","Voice_of_America","BBC","Paleoconservative","Secession","Flat_Rock,_Henderson_County,_North_Carolina","Paleoconservative","United_States_Republican_Party","Georgia_state_flag","Gene_Champman","Libertarian_Party_(United_States)","Constitution_Party_(United_States)"]}
