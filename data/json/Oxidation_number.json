In older literature the term is referred to\nas Stock number, however the use of this term is no longer recommended.\nOxidation number represents the degree of oxidation of an element in a\nsubstance. This degree of oxidation (often termed the elements oxidation state)\nis with the exception of coordination compounds where a different definition\napplies, the imaginary charge on the atom if the substance were broken down into\nions. The oxidation number in compound naming is placed either as a right\nsuperscript to the element symbol in chemical formulae, for example\nFe III , or in parentheses after the name of the element, iron(III) in\nchemical names. For example Fe 2(SO 4) 3 would be\nnamed iron(III) sulfate and its formula could be shown as\nFe III 2(SO 4) 3. Note that fractional\noxidation numbers should not be used in naming.
