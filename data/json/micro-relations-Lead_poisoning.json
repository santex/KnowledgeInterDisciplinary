Lead\ninterferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and\ntissues including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and\nnervous systems. It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is\ntherefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning\nand behavior disorders. Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headache,\nanemia, irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.\n\n Routes of exposure to lead\ninclude contaminated air, water, soil, food, and consumer products.\nOccupational exposure is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults. According\nto estimates made by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health\n(NIOSH), more than 3 million workers in the United States are potentially\nexposed to lead in the workplace. One of the largest threats to\nchildren is lead paint that exists in many homes, especially older ones; thus\nchildren in older housing with chipping paint or lead dust from moveable window\nframes with lead paint are at greater risk. Prevention of lead exposure can\nrange from individual efforts (e.g. removing lead-containing items such as\npiping or blinds from the home) to nationwide policies (e.g. laws that ban lead\nin products, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, or provide for cleanup\nand mitigation of contaminated soil, etc.).\n\n Elevated lead in the body can be detected by the\npresence of changes in blood cells visible with a microscope and dense lines in\nthe bones of children seen on X-ray. However, the main tool for diagnosis is\nmeasurement of the blood lead level or a urine test. When blood lead levels are\nrecorded, the results indicate how much lead is circulating within the blood\nstream, not the amount being stored in the body. [htt-\np://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/demodebris/pages2/lbloodtest.html Blood Lead\nLevel Testing], Department of Ecology State of Washington. 2011 There are\ntwo units for reporting blood lead level, either micrograms per deciliter\n(Âµg/dl), or micrograms per 100 grams (Âµg/100 g) of whole blood, which are\nboth numerically equivalent. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the\nstandard elevated blood lead level for adults to be 25 (Âµg/dl) of the whole\nblood. For children however, the number is set much lower at 5 (Âµg/dl) of blood\nas of 2012 down from a previous 10 (Âµg/dl). Children are especially prone to the health effects of\nlead and as a result, blood lead levels must be set lower and closely monitored\nif contamination is possible. The major treatments\nare removal of the source of lead and chelation therapy (administration of\nagents that bind lead so it can be excreted).\n\n Humans have been mining and using this heavy metal for\nthousands of years, poisoning themselves in the process. Although lead poisoning\nis one of the oldest known work and environmental hazards, the modern understanding of the small amount of lead\nnecessary to cause harm did not come about until the latter half of the\n20th century. No safe threshold for lead exposure has been discoveredâthat\nis, there is no known amount of lead that is too small to cause the body harm.\n","linknr":2397,"url":"Lead_poisoning","recorded":1362482379,"links":70,"instances":["medicine","biochemistry","law","medical","genetics","biology","cosmetics","medicine","element","chemistry","disorder","watercourse"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/Final_Document_010412.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/Final_Document_010412.pdf","http://www.rmef.org/NR/rdonlyres/F07627AA-4D94-4CBC-B8FD-4F4F18401303/0/ND_report.pdf","http://www.rmef.org/NR/rdonlyres/F07627AA-4D94-4CBC-B8FD-4F4F18401303/0/ND_report.pdf","http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/hunt/documents/pbbirds.pdf","http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/hunt/documents/pbbirds.pdf","http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/3/430.pdf","http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/3/430.pdf","http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/56/10/1165.pdf","http://jdr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/56/10/1165.pdf","http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/113/4/S1/1120.pdf","http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/113/4/S1/1120.pdf","http://www.icfi.com/Markets/Community_Development/doc_files/LeadExposureStudy.pdf","http://www.icfi.com/Markets/Community_Development/doc_files/LeadExposureStudy.pdf","http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf"],"categories":["Lead
