With almost a thousand very highly cited publications, he is\none of the most influential social scientists of the 20th century.\n\nSimon was among the founding fathers of several of today's important scientific\ndomains, including artificial intelligence, information processing, decision-\nmaking, problem-solving, attention economics, organization theory, complex\nsystems, and computer simulation of scientific discovery. He coined the terms\n[[bounded rationality]] and [[satisficing]], and was the first to analyze the\narchitecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to\nexplain power law distributions. Simon, H. A., 1955, Biometrika\n42, 425.\n\nHe also received many top-level honors later in life. These include: becoming a\nfellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in\n1959; http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf\nelection to the National Academy of Sciences in\n1967; http://nas.nasonline.org/site/Dir/1715450020?pg=rslts the ACM's\nTuring Award for making \"basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the\npsychology of human cognition, and list processing\" (1975); the Nobel Memorial\nPrize in Economics \"for his pioneering research into the decision-making process\nwithin economic organizations\" (1978); the National Medal of Science (1986); and\nthe APA's Award for Outstanding Lifetime Contributions to Psychology (1993).\n\nAs a testament to his interdisciplinary approach, Simon was affiliated with such\nvaried Carnegie Mellon departments as the School of Computer Science, Tepper\nSchool of Business, Departments of Philosophy, Social and Decision Sciences, and\nPsychology.\n\nSimon received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from Harvard\nUniversity in 1990.\n","linknr":1104,"url":"Herbert_A._Simon","recorded":1362579856,"links":81,"instances":["psychology","psychologist"],"pdf":["http://memory.psy.cmu.edu/publications/Applic.MisApp.pdf","http://octopus.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/simon/box00064/fld04878/bdl0001/doc0001/simon.pdf","http://memory.psy.cmu.edu/publications/98_jra_lmr_has.pdf","http://memory.psy.cmu.edu/publications/Applic.MisApp.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf","http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Robert_Lepper_Artist_Teacher.pdf","http://www.ecoplexity.org/files/uploads/Simon.pdf","http://www.ecoplexity.org/files/uploads/Simon.pdf"],"categories":["1916
