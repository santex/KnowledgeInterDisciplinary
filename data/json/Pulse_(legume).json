Pulses are used for food for humans and other animals.\nIncluded in the pulses are: dry beans like pinto beans, kidney beans and navy\nbeans; dry peas; lentils; and others.\n\nPulses are important food crops due to their high protein and essential amino\nacid content. Like many leguminous crops, pulses play a key role in crop\nrotation due to their ability to fix nitrogen.\n\nJust like words such as \"bean\" and \"lentil\", the word \"pulse\" may refer to just\nthe seed, or the entire plant.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Pulse_(legume)","recorded":1362902750,"links":20,"instances":["nutrition","bean"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vegetables","Lists of foods","Granular materials","Staple foods","Vegan cuisine","Vegetarian cuisine"],"headings":["Varying Interpretations","History","World economy","Classification","Nutrient-rich pulses","Health","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Phaseolus_vulgaris_seed.jpg/240px-Phaseolus_vulgaris_seed.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["urad","bean"],["prebiotic","nutrition"]],"members":["prebiotic","urad"],"related":["Latin","Ancient_Greek","Legume","Crop","Protein","Essential_amino_acid","Crop_rotation","Nitrogen_fixation","Food_and_Agricultural_Organization","Oilseeds","Soybeans","Peanut","India","Pakistan","Canada","Burma","Australia","United_States","FAO","Kidney_bean","Haricot_bean","Pinto_bean","Navy_bean","Lima_bean","Azuki_bean","Mung_bean","Urad_(bean)","Scarlet_runner_bean","Ricebean","Moth_bean","Tepary_bean","Vicia_faba","Vicia_faba","Vicia_faba","Vicia_faba","Pea","Chickpea","Cowpea","Black-eyed_pea","Pigeon_pea","Lentil","Bambara_groundnut","Vetch","Lupin","Jack_bean","Sword_bean","Winged_bean","Velvet_bean","Yam_bean","Wheat","Rice","Essential_amino_acid","Methionine","Cereal","Lysine","Methionine","Coronary_heart_disease","Amylose","Prebiotic_(nutrition)","Resistant_starch","Bean","Common_bean","Dal","Legume","Fabaceae"]}
