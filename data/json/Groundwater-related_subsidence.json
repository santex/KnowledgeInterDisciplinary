{"cursor":"4042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Groundwater-related subsidence' is the subsidence (or the sinking) of land\nresulting from groundwater extraction, and a major problem in the developing\nworld as major metropolises swell without adequate regulation and enforcement,\nas well as a being a common problem in the developed world. One estimate has 80%\nof serious land subsidence problems associated with the excessive extraction of\ngroundwater [http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/pubs/fs00165/], making it a growing\nproblem throughout the world.\n\nGroundwater is considered to be one of the last 'free' resources, as anyone who\ncan afford to drill, can draw up merely according to their ability to pump.\nHowever, as seen in the figure, the act of pumping draws down the free surface\nof the groundwater table, and can affect a large region. Thus, the extraction of\ngroundwater becomes a Tragedy of the commons, with high economic externalities.\n\n\n\nThe desert areas of the world are requiring more and more water for growing\npopulations, and agriculture. In the San Joaquin Valley of the United States,\ngroundwater pumping for crops has gone on for generations. This has resulted in\nthe entire valley sinking an extraordinary amount, as shown in the figure. It\nhas been argued that there is little consequence to subsidence in a wide, flat,\nagricultural basin, since the settlement is uniform. However, no large-scale\nchange due to subsidence of the magnitude seen in the San Joaquin Valley is\nlikely to be without some negative impact, since the hydrology of the area is\nnow greatly changed. Other regions of the world, such as New Orleans, Louisiana,\nin the United States and Bangkok in Thailand are now subject to severe flooding\ndue to subsidence associated with groundwater removal.

Environment and Urbanization April 1989 vol. 1\nno. 1 31-39 Total settlement, and therefore the potential impacts of the\nsettlement, can only be determined by surveys and GPS measurements.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, not all groundwater-related subsidence is benign. In Mexico City\nthe buildings interact with the settlement, and cause cracking, tilting, and\nother major damage [http://www.geotimes.org/july01/sinking_titanic_city.html].\nIn many places, large sinkholes open up, as well as surface cavities. Damage\nfrom Hurricane Katrina was exacerbated due to coastal sinking, associated with\ngroundwater withdrawal.\n\nThe cause of the long-term surface changes associated with this phenomenon, are\nfairly well known.\n[http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/changes/anthropogenic/subside/]. As shown in\nthe USGS figure, aquifers are frequently associated with compressible layers of\nsilt or clay.\n\n\n\nAs the groundwater is pumped out, the effective stress changes, precipitating\nconsolidation, which is non-reversible. Thus, the total volume of the silts and\nclays is reduced, resulting in the lowering of the surface. The damage at the\nsurface is much greater if there is differential settlement, or large-scale\nfeatures, such as sinkholes.\n\nThe only known method to prevent this condition is by pumping less groundwater,\nwhich is extremely difficult to enforce when many people own water wells.\nAttempts are being made to directly recharge aquifers but this still a\npreliminary effort.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Groundwater-related_subsidence","recorded":1374784759,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Gwsurface.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/Gwsurface.jpg/200px-Gwsurface.jpg","/wiki/File:Gwsurface.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Subsidence","/wiki/Groundwater","http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/pubs/fs00165/","/wiki/Drawdown_(hydrology)","/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons","/wiki/Externalities","/wiki/File:Gwsanjoaquin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Gwsanjoaquin.jpg/100px-Gwsanjoaquin.jpg","/wiki/File:Gwsanjoaquin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Desert","/wiki/Agriculture","/wiki/San_Joaquin_Valley","/wiki/United_States","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Surveying","/wiki/GPS","/wiki/File:Gwcitysubsidence.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/Gwcitysubsidence.jpg/200px-Gwcitysubsidence.jpg","/wiki/File:Gwcitysubsidence.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://www.geotimes.org/july01/sinking_titanic_city.html","/wiki/Sinkholes","/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina","http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/changes/anthropogenic/subside/","/wiki/USGS","/wiki/Aquifers","/wiki/Silt","/wiki/Clay","/wiki/File:Gwcause.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Gwcause.jpg/100px-Gwcause.jpg","/wiki/File:Gwcause.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Effective_stress","/wiki/Consolidation_(soil)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&oldid=539591407","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Soil_mechanics","/wiki/Category:Aquifers","/wiki/Category:Environmental_issues_with_water","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Groundwater-related+subsidence&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Groundwater-related+subsidence","/wiki/Groundwater-related_subsidence","/wiki/Talk:Groundwater-related_subsidence","#","/wiki/Groundwater-related_subsidence","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Groundwater-related_subsidence","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Groundwater-related_subsidence","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&oldid=539591407","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Groundwater-related_subsidence&id=539591407","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Groundwater-related+subsidence","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Groundwater-related+subsidence&oldid=539591407&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Groundwater-related_subsidence&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundwasserabsenkung#Folgen_der_Grundwasserabsenkung","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/
