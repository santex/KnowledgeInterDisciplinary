A colleague is an associate in a\nprofession or in a civil or ecclesiastical office.\n\nThus, the word collegiality can connote respect for another's commitment to\nthe common purpose and ability to work toward it. In a narrower sense, members\nof the faculty of a university or college are each other's colleagues; very\noften the word is taken to mean that. Sometimes colleague is taken to mean a\nfellow member of the same profession. The word [[college]] is sometimes used\nin a broad sense to mean a group of colleagues united in a common purpose, and\nused in proper names, such as Electoral College, College of Cardinals, College\nof Pontiffs.\n\nSociologists of organizations use the word collegiality in a technical sense, to\ncreate a contrast with the concept of bureaucracy. Classical authors such as Max\nWeber consider collegiality as an organizational device used by autocrats to\nprevent experts and professionals from challenging monocratic and sometimes\narbitrary powers. More recently, authors such as Eliot Freidson (USA), Malcolm\nWaters (Australia) and Emmanuel Lazega (France) have shown that collegiality can\nnow be understood as a full fledged organizational form. This is especially\nuseful to account for coordination in knowledge intensive organizations in which\ninterdependent members jointly perform non routine tasks â€“ an increasingly\nfrequent form of coordination in knowledge economies. A specific social\ndiscipline comes attached to this organizational form, a discipline described in\nterms of niche seeking, status competition, lateral control, and power among\npeers in corporate law partnerships, in dioceses, in scientific laboratories,\netc. This view of collegiality is obviously very different from the ideology of\ncollegiality stressing mainly trust and sharing in the collegium.\n","title":"Collegiality","headings":["Collegiality in the Roman Republic","Collegiality in the Catholic Church","Collegiality in Academia","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Electoral_college","1: College_of_Cardinals","1: College_of_Pontiffs","1: Sociologist","1: Organization","1: Bureaucracy","1: Max_Weber","1: Expert","1: Professional","1: Roman_Republic","1: Roman_Senate","1: Consuls","1: Praetors","1: Quaestor","1: Aedile","1: Tribunes","1: Decemviri","1: Pontifex_maximus","1: Princeps_senatus","1: Extraordinary_magistrates","1: Roman_dictator","1: Magister_Equitum","1: Triumviri","1: Roman_Catholic_Church","1: College_of_Bishops","1: Pope","1: Second_Vatican_Council","1: Episcopal_conference","1: Collegiate_church","1: Cathedral_chapter","1: Traditionalist_Catholic","1: Managerialism"]}
