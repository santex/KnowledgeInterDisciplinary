In dry air at , the speed of sound\nis . This is , or about one kilometer in three seconds or approximately one mile\nin five seconds.\n\nIn fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used\nas a relative measure of speed itself. The speed of an object divided by the\nspeed of sound in the fluid is called the Mach number. Objects moving at speeds\ngreater than {{gaps|Mach|1}} are traveling at supersonic speeds.\n\nThe speed of sound in an ideal gas is independent of frequency, but does vary\nslightly with frequency in a real gas. It is proportional to the square root of\nthe absolute temperature, but is independent of pressure or density for a given\nideal gas. Sound speed in air varies slightly with pressure only because air is\nnot quite an ideal gas. In addition, for different gases, the speed of sound is\ninversely proportional to the mean molecular weight of the gas, and is affected\nto a lesser extent by the number of ways in which the molecules of the gas can\nstore heat from compression, since sound in gases is a compression wave.\nAlthough (in the case of gases only) the speed of sound is expressed in terms of\na ratio of both density and pressure, these quantities cancel in ideal gases at\nany given temperature, composition, and heat capacity. This leads to a velocity\nformula for ideal gases which includes only the latter independent variables.\n\nIn common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in\nair. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance. Sound\ntravels faster in liquids and non-porous solids than it does in air. It travels\nabout 4.3 times as fast in water (1,484 m/s), and nearly 15 times as fast\nin iron (5,120 m/s), than in air at 20 degrees Celsius. Sound waves in\nsolids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), but\nthere is also a different type of sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs\nonly in solids. These different types of waves in solids usually travel at\ndifferent speeds, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of a compression sound\nwave in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear modulus and\ndensity. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's\nshear modulus and density.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Speed_of_sound","recorded":1372155023,"links":[],"instances":["material","physics","unit","physics","physical","unit","waves","unit","solid_mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aerodynamics","Chemical properties","Fluid dynamics","Sound measurements","Units of velocity"],"headings":["Basic concept","Basic","Dependence on the properties of the medium","Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics","Practical formula for dry air","Details","Effect of frequency and gas composition","Mach number","Experimental methods","Non-gaseous media","Gradients","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["elasticity","solid_mechanics"],["compression","physical"],["polarization","waves"],["dispersion","optics#group_and_phase_velocity"],["atmosphere","unit"],["mole","unit"],["knot","unit"],["knot","unit"],["knot","unit"],["node","physics"],["pipe","material"],["plasma","physics"]],"members":["pipe","node","mole","plasma","compression","knot","polarization","atmosphere","elasticity","dispersion"],"related":["Sound_wave","Elasticity_(solid_mechanics)","Air","Fluid_dynamics","Mach_number","Supersonic","Ideal_gas","Absolute_temperature","Pressure","Density","Molecular_weight","Molecules","Heat","Compression_(physical)","Earth's_atmosphere","Liquids","Solids","Water","Seismology","Compressibility","Shear_modulus","Toy_model","Elastic_modulus","Density","Ceteris_paribus","Hydrogen-1","Deuterium","Longitudinal_wave","Transverse_wave","Shear_wave","Polarization_(waves)","Orthogonal","Earthquake","Compressibility","Density","Shear_modulus","Bulk_modulus","Density","Adiabatic_index","Equations_of_state","Classical_mechanics","Derivative","Entropy","Special_relativity","Relativistic_Euler_equations","Sound_frequency","Ultrasound","KHz","Dispersion_relation","Phase_velocity","Group_velocity","Shear_modulus","Compressibility","Hot_chocolate_effect","Heat_capacity_ratio","Molecular_weight","Helium","Xenon","Ideal_gas","Temperature","Pressure","Density","Van_der_Waals_equation","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Water","Earth's_atmosphere","Temperature","Refraction","Acoustic_shadow","Sound_speed_gradient","Stratosphere","Ozone_layer","Thermosphere","Taylor_expansion","Celsius","Taylor_expansion","Heat_capacity_ratio","Atmosphere_(unit)","Stratosphere","Mean_free_path","Supersonic","Bulk_modulus","Adiabatic_index","Pressure","Density","Ideal_gas","Ideal_gas","Molar_gas_constant","Boltzmann_constant","Adiabatic_index","Noble_gas","Kelvin","Kilogram","Mole_(unit)","Isaac_Newton","Thermodynamics","Isothermal","Adiabatic","Specific_heat_capacity","Celsius","Celsius","Gas_constant","Refraction","Acoustic_shadow","Lapse_rate","American_Civil_War","Battle_of_Iuka","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Knot_(unit)","Knot_(unit)","Knot_(unit)","Ideal_gas","Bell_X-1","Boeing_X-43","Albert_Beaumont_Wood","Mean_free_path","Helium","Deuterium","Heat_capacity","Prandtl-Glauert_singularity","Speed","Flight_instruments","Pitot_tube","William_Derham","Isaac_Newton","Church_of_St_Laurence,_Upminster","Upminster","Microphone","Digital","Time","Frequency","Kundt's_tube","Node_(physics)","Antinode","Tuning_fork","Pipe_(material)","Water","Antinode","Volumetric","Earthquake","P-wave","S-wave","Bulk_modulus","Shear_modulus","Young's_modulus","Poisson's_ratio","Shear_velocity","Young's_modulus","Shear_modulus","Poisson's_ratio","Stiffness","Bulk_modulus","Ultrawave","Underwater_acoustics","Sonar","Acoustical_oceanography","World_Ocean_Atlas","SOFAR_channel","Salinity","Per_mil","Parts_per_thousand","Plasma_(physics)","Ion","Proton","Electron","Boltzmann's_constant","Adiabatic_index","SOFAR_channel","Refractive_index","Refraction","Optical_fiber","Project_Mogul","Nuclear_explosion","Elastic_wave","Second_sound","Sonic_boom","Sound_barrier","Underwater_acoustics","Vibrations"]}
