A chemical air filter consists of an absorbent or catalyst for the removal\nof airborne molecular contaminants such as volatile organic compounds or ozone.\nAir filters are used in applications where air quality is important, notably in\nbuilding ventilation systems and in engines.\n\nSome buildings, as well as aircraft and other man-made environments (e.g.,\nsatellites and space shuttles) use foam, pleated paper, or spun fiberglass\nfilter elements. Another method, air ionisers, use fibers or elements with a\nstatic electric charge, which attract dust particles. The air intakes of\ninternal combustion engines and compressors tend to use either paper, foam, or\ncotton filters. Oil bath filters have fallen out of favor. The technology of air\nintake filters of gas turbines has improved significantly in recent years, due\nto improvements in the aerodynamics and fluid-dynamics of the air-compressor\npart of the Gas Turbines.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Air_filter","recorded":1362485744,"links":32,"instances":["architecture","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.fleetmag.com/online/fmxlibrary/Heavy_Duty_Air_Filter_Elements.pdf"],"categories":["Auto parts","Filters","Particulate control","Engine components"],"headings":["Automotive cabin air filters","Internal combustion air filters","Filter classes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Air_filter%2C_opel_astra%282%29.JPG/220px-Air_filter%2C_opel_astra%282%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Air_filter%2C_opel_astra%281%29.JPG/220px-Air_filter%2C_opel_astra%281%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Dirty-air-filter.jpg/220px-Dirty-air-filter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","chemistry"],["ventilation","architecture"]],"members":["ventilation","absorption"],"related":["Particulate","Dust","Pollen","Mold","Bacterium","Air","Absorption_(chemistry)","Catalyst","Volatile_organic_compounds","Ozone","Ventilation_(architecture)","Aircraft","Fiberglass","Air_ioniser","Static_electricity","Filter_paper","Foam","Cotton","Allergen","MERV","HEPA","Fuel_injection","Carburetor","SAE_International","Automobile","Cotton","Gauze","Sump","Labyrinth","Inertia","Small_engine","Automobile_emissions_control","Hydrocarbons","Air_purifier","Clean_Air_Delivery_Rate","Cyclonic_separation","HEPA","Impingement_filter","Nose_filter","Oil_filter","Respirator"]}
