A sound\nwave is a variation in air pressure, while in light and other electromagnetic\nradiation the strength of the electric and the magnetic field vary. Water waves\nare variations in the height of a body of water. In a crystal lattice vibration,\natomic positions vary.\n\nWavelength is a measure of the distance between repetitions of a shape feature\nsuch as peaks, valleys, or zero-crossings, not a measure of how far any given\nparticle moves. For example, in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near\nthe water's surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height,\nunrelated to wavelength.<ref name=Pinet> {{cite book |title=Invitation to\nOceanography |author = Paul R Pinet |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=6TCm8Xy-\nsLUC&pg=PA237 |page = 237 |publisher = Jones & Bartlett Publishers |isbn = 0-7637-5993-\n7 |edition = 5th |year = 2008 }}</ref>\n","title":"wavelength","headings":["Sinusoidal waves","More general waveforms","Interference and diffraction","Subwavelength","Angular wavelength","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Wavenumber","2: Zero_crossing","2: Standing_wave","2: Sound_wave","2: Light","2: Electromagnetic_radiation","2: Dispersion_relation","2: Speed_of_light","2: Angular_frequency","2: Wave_vector","2: Plane_wave","2: Aliasing","2: Airy_disk","1: Physics","1: Sinusoidal_wave","1: Greek_letter","1: Modulation","1: SI","1: Meter","1: Frequency","1: Water_wave","1: Sound","1: Sound_pressure","1: Electric_field","1: Magnetic_field","1: Lattice_vibration","1: Linear","1: Phase_velocity","1: Free_space","1: Red","1: Nanometre","1: Electromagnetic_spectrum","1: Speed_of_sound","1: Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","1: Hertz","1: Metre","1: Millimetre","1: Boundary_conditions","1: Speed_of_light#Cavity_resonance","1: Amplitude","1: 3-space","1: Cosine","1: Sine","1: Vacuum#In_electromagnetism","1: Refraction","1: Electromagnetic_waves","1: Snell's_law","1: Dispersive_prism","1: Refract","1: Periodic_function","1: Differential_equation","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: Brillouin_zone","1: Energy_bands","1: Phonons","1: Wave#Travelling_waves","1: Superposition_principle","1: Cnoidal_wave","1: Jacobi_elliptic_function","1: Ocean_wave","1: Wave_packet","1: Fourier_analysis","1: Louis_de_Broglie","1: Momentum","1: Planck's_constant","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: De_Broglie_wavelength","1: Electron","1: Cathode_ray_tube","1: Wave_function","1: Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle","1: Interferometry","1: Double-slit_experiment","1: Diffraction","1: Fraunhofer_diffraction","1: Fresnel_diffraction","1: Small-angle_approximation","1: Sinc_function","1: Angular_resolution","1: Telescope","1: Radiotelescope","1: Microscopes","1: Bessel_function","1: Rayleigh_criterion","1: Numerical_aperture","1: Microscope_objective","1: Entrance_pupil","1: Optical_fibre","1: Rayleigh_scattering","1: Aperture","1: Extraordinary_optical_transmission","1: Zero-mode_waveguide","1: Photonics","1: Subwavelength_imaging","1: Reduced_Planck_constant","1: Angular_wavenumber","1: Emission_spectrum","1: Fraunhofer_lines","1: Index_of_wave_articles","1: Length_measurement","1: Spectral_line","1: Spectrum","1: Spectroscopy"]}
