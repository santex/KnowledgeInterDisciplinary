They are\nbelieved to be the product of sexual selection for traits which give an\nindividual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive\ninteractions. They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics â the\nsex organs â which are directly necessary for reproduction to occur.\n\nWell-known secondary sex characteristics include manes of male lions and long\nfeathers of male peacocks. Other dramatic examples include the tusks of male\nnarwhals, enlarged proboscises in male elephant seals and proboscis monkeys, the\nbright facial and rump coloration of male mandrills, and horns in many goats and\nantelopes. Male birds and fish of many species have brighter coloration or other\nexternal ornaments. Differences in size between sexes are also considered\nsecondary sexual characteristics.\n\nIn humans, visible secondary sex characteristics include enlarged breasts of\nfemales and facial hair and adam's apple on males.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Secondary_sex_characteristics","recorded":1362486162,"links":28,"instances":["anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Secondary sexual characteristics|*"],"headings":["Evolutionary roots","In humans","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Peacock.displaying.better.800pix.jpg/280px-Peacock.displaying.better.800pix.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Descent_of_Man_fig48.jpg/150px-Descent_of_Man_fig48.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Primary_and_secondary_sexual_characteristics_of_the_human_male.jpg/400px-Primary_and_secondary_sexual_characteristics_of_the_human_male.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["hip","anatomy"],["hip","anatomy"]],"members":["hip","morphology"],"related":["Feather","Sex","Reproductive_system","Sexual_selection","Courtship","Aggression","Sex_organ","Lion","Peacock","Narwhals","Proboscis","Elephant_seals","Proboscis_monkeys","Mandrills","Goats","Antelopes","Animal_coloration","Sexual_dimorphism","Breast","Facial_hair","Adam's_apple","Charles_Darwin","Sexual_selection","Plumage","Genetic_drift","Sexy_son_hypothesis","Genetic_fitness","Metabolism","Good_genes_hypothesis","Sexual_differentiation","Gestation","Gonads","Morphology_(biology)","Puberty","Testosterone","Dihydrotestosterone","Prostate","Estradiol","Hormones","Breast","Androgen","Estrogen","Testosterone","Muscle","Vocal_cord","Bone","Human_voice","Face","Skeleton","Androgen","Androgenic_alopecia","Puberty","Epiphyseal","Body_hair","Underarm_hair","Abdominal_hair","Chest_hair","Pubic_hair","Androgenic_alopecia","Femur","Facial_hair","Larynx","Human_voice","Human_height","Human_skull","Bone","Muscle","Shoulder","Magnus_Hirschfeld_Archive_of_Sexology","Sweat_gland","Acne","Body_odor","Waist–hip_ratio","Body_fat_percentage","Breasts","Estrogen","Uterus","Endometrium","Menstrual_cycle","Breasts","Nipples","Body_hair","Underarm_hair","Pubic_hair","Femur","Hip_(anatomy)","Columbia_Mailman_School_of_Public_Health","Waist-hip_ratio","Desmond_Morris","Subcutaneous_fat","Fat","Buttocks","Thigh","Hip_(anatomy)","Body_shape","Estrogenic_fat","Female_body_shape","Sex_differences_in_humans","Sexual_dimorphism","Menstrual_cycle","Virilization"]}
