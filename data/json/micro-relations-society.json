{"cursor":"30147","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'society', or a 'human society', is a group of people related to each other\nthrough persistent relations, or a large social grouping sharing the same\ngeographical or virtual territory, subject to the same political authority and\ndominant cultural expectations. Human societies are characterized by patterns of\nrelationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive\nculture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of\nsuch relationships among its constituent members. In the social sciences, a\nlarger society often evinces stratification and/or dominance patterns in\nsubgroups.\n\nInsofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in\nways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both\nindividual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many\ncases found to overlap.\n\nA society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and\nvalues within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a\nsubculture, a term used extensively within criminology.\n\nMore broadly, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, or industrial\ninfrastructure, made up of a varied collection of individuals. Members of a\nsociety may be from different ethnic groups. A society can be a particular\nethnic group, such as the Saxons; a nation state, such as Bhutan; or a broader\ncultural group, such as a Western society. The word society may also refer to an\norganized voluntary association of people for religious, benevolent, cultural,\nscientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes. A \"society\" may even,\nthough more by means of metaphor, refer to a social organism such as an ant\ncolony or any cooperative aggregate such as, for example, in some formulations\nof artificial intelligence.\n","linknr":809,"url":"society","recorded":1362669677,"links":140,"instances":["disambiguation","cultural_anthropology","sociology","disambiguation","archaeology","sociology","polity"],"pdf":["http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf"],"categories":["Anthropology","Anthropological
