In this sense, the term is used to refer not only to the information\nand communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, but also to the\nway in which people interact with this technology in support of business\nprocesses. Kroenke, D M. (2008). Experiencing MIS. Prentice-Hall, Upper\nSaddle River, NJ\n\nSome make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and\nbusiness processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but\nare not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end use of\ninformation technology. Information systems are also different from business\nprocesses. Information systems help to control the performance of business\nprocesses. O'Brien, J A. (2003). Introduction to information systems:\nessentials for the e-business enterprise. McGraw-Hill, Boston, MA\n\nAlter argues for an information system as a special type of work system. A work\nsystem is a system in which humans and/or machines perform work using resources\nto produce specific products and/or services for customers. An information\nsystem is a work system whose activities are devoted to processing (capturing,\ntransmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying)\ninformation. Alter, S. The Work System Method: Connecting People, Processes,\nand IT for Business Results. Works System Press, CA\n\nAs such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and\nactivity systems on the other. An information system is a form of communication\nsystem in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An\ninformation system can also be considered a semi-formal language which supports\nhuman decision making and action.\n\nInformation systems are the primary focus of study for the information systems\ndiscipline and for organizational informatics.
