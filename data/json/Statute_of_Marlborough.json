{"cursor":"4296","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Statute of Marlborough' (52 Hen 3) was a set of laws passed by King Henry\nIII of England in 1267. There were twenty-nine chapters, of which four are still\nin force. The full title was Provisions made at Marlborough in the presence of\nour lord King Henry, and [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] [[King of the\nRomans]], and the [[Edward I of England|Lord Edward]] eldest son of the said\nKing Henry, and the [[Pope Adrian V|Lord Ottobon]], at that time [[Papal\nlegate|legate]] in England.\n\nIt is so named as it was passed at Marlborough, where a Parliament was being\nheld. The preamble dates it as \"...the two and fiftieth year of the reign of\nKing Henry, son of [[John of England|King John]], in the utas of Saint\nMartin...\", which would give a date of November 19, 1267; \"utas\" is an archaic\nterm to denote the eighth day after an event, in this case the feast day of\nSaint Martin.\n\nIt is the oldest piece of statute law in the United Kingdom that has not yet\nbeen repealed. The famous Magna Carta was originally passed in 1215, but the\nversion currently in force only dates to a reissue in 1297 (25 Edw. I). The\noldest piece of extant Scottish law is the Royal Mines Act 1424\n\nThe chapters currently valid are c.1, c.4, & c.15 (often referred to as the\n'Distress Act 1267'), Chapter 2 also covered distresses, but was repealed\nby the Statute Law Revision Act 1948 which seek to govern the recovery of\ndamages (\"distresses\") and make it illegal to obtain recompense for damages\nother than through the courts, and c.23 (the 'Waste Act 1267'), Whilst the\nbulk of the chapter remains in force, the first paragraph was repealed by the\nStatute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1881 which seeks to prevent\ntenant farmers from \"making waste\" to land they are in tenancy of. Chapter 15\nsets out places in which \"distresses\" are forbidden to be taken; these include\nthe King's Highway and the Common Street. In other words, actions to remedy a\nbreach of some kind by one person against another may not be taken in the\nstreet etc.\n\nRepealed chapters include legislation on resisting the King's officers, the\nconfirmation of charters, wardship, redisseisin, suits of court, Sheriff's\nturns, beaupleader, real actions, essoins, juries, guardians in socage,\namercements for default of summons, pleas of false judgement, replevin,\nfreeholders, inquest, murder, benefit of clergy, and prelates.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, chapter 1 of this statute may be cited as \"the Distress\nAct 1267\". The citation of this chapter by this short title was authorised\nby section 5 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948. Due to\nthe repeal of those provisions, it is now authorised by section 19(2) of the\nInterpretation Act 1978. In the Republic of Ireland, chapters 1 and 4 and\n15 may be cited together as the Distress Act 1267. The citation of these\nchapters by this short title is authorised by\n[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0005/sec0001.html section 1(1)]\nof, and Part I of\n[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0005/sched2.html Schedule 2] to,\nthe Short Titles Act 1962. The comma is omitted on the authority of section\n14(3)(a) of the Interpretation Act 2005.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Statute_of_Marlborough","recorded":1374546331,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Henry_III_of_England","/wiki/England","/wiki/Richard,_Earl_of_Cornwall","/wiki/King_of_the_Romans","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Pope_Adrian_V","/wiki/Papal_legate","/wiki/Marlborough,_Wiltshire","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/John_of_England","/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Day","/wiki/Martin_of_Tours","/wiki/Statute_law","/wiki/United_Kingdom","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Redisseisin&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Beaupleader","/wiki/Essoin","/wiki/Socage","/wiki/Replevin","/wiki/Benefit_of_clergy","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Quia_Emptores","/wiki/Henry_de_Bracton","/wiki/Statutes_of_Mortmain","/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Magna_Carta","/wiki/Royal_Mines_Act_1424","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Statute_Law_Revision_Act_1948","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Statute_Law_Revision_and_Civil_Procedure_Act_1881","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Short_title","/wiki/Statute_Law_Revision_Act_1948","/wiki/Interpretation_Act_1978","#cite_ref-5","http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0005/sec0001.html","http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0005/sched2.html","/wiki/Short_Titles_Act_1962","/w/index.php?title=Interpretation_Act_2005&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Waste_Act_1267","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0118403311","http://www.davros.org/legal/oddities.html","/w/index.php?title=Statute_of_Marlborough&action=edit&section=4","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen3cc1415/52/1/contents","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","http://www.legislation.gov.uk//aep/Hen3c23/52/23/contents","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80%931839","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1840%E2%80%931859","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1860%E2%80%931879","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1880%E2%80%931899","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1900%E2%80%931919","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1920%E2%80%931939","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1940%E2%80%931959","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1960%E2%80%931979","/wiki/List_of
