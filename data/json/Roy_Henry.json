{"cursor":"4332","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" by Roy Henry: Folio 12v of the Old Hall Manuscript.]] 'Roy Henry' (\"King\"\n Henry) (fl. around 1410) was an English composer, almost certainly a king of\n England, probably Henry V, but also possibly Henry IV. His music, two\n compositions in all, appears in a position of prominence in the Old Hall\n Manuscript.\n\nMusicologists have not been able to agree on which English monarch wrote the two\nmass movements which appear, at the head of their respective sections, in the\nOld Hall Manuscript. Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, was in his early\nforties when the music was most probably written, since stylistic evidence\nplaces it around 1410. That he was still mentally able at this period, and had\nleisure time to think and design, is clear from his payment for the metal used\nin the construction of a cannon made to his own design in 1409 (see Mortimer,\nFears of Henry IV, pp. 319â20). In addition, there is more evidence of his\nbeing an accomplished musician than his son. One contemporary referred to him as\na 'sparkling musician'; he obtanied the first known recorder and both he and his\nwife played the harp. (His accounts record a number of payments for harp\nstrings: see Mortimer, Fears of Henry IV, pp. 46â7). As Henry V was so busy\nafter his accession - and abroad on campaign continually from 1417 - the sacred\ncomposition falls more naturally into his father's twilight years than the son's\nmartial ones. Two other reasons suggest the father as the composer: one would\nhave expected clarification of the name if it had been the second of the two\nKing Henrys; also the connection of the manuscript with the duke of Clarence\nsuggests Henry IV, as Clarence and Henry V were not close whereas Clarence was\nhis father's favourite son.\n\nHenry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was known to have cultivated music in\nhis youth. An early biography of Henry V states:\n\nâ¦he was in his youth a diligent follower of idle practices, much\ngiven to instruments of music, and fired with the torches of Venus\nherself. Recent research has shown that work on the Old Hall\nManuscript probably ceased on the death of Thomas, Duke of Clarence, in 1421.\nSince Thomas was King Henry V's brother, and his chapel's musicians are now\nknown to have included Leonel Power, and the manuscript itself passed to Henry\nV's chapel on the death of Thomas, some people favor Henry V as the identity of\nRoy Henry. Obviously the manuscript could not have been passed to the long-dead\nhenry IV at this time, so this is not a conclusive argument. But it is worth\nnoting that Henry V's extraordinary piety - outdoing even his father in matters\nof religion - is consistent with the composition of sacred music, and we can be\nsure of his musical education. It is impossible to say for certain which man was\nthe composer without further evidence.\n\nRoy Henry's music consists of two movements of the ordinary of the mass: a\nGloria and a Sanctus, both for three voices, and written in a fairly low\nregister. The music itself is skillfully written, and unusually for the time, no\nspecific plainchant can be identified as a source; both pieces may be freely\ncomposed, or the underlying chant may be part of the enormous lost repertory of\nmusic from the early 15th century, hence unidentifiable (the vast majority of\nmanuscripts of the time were destroyed in the 1530s during Henry VIII's\nDissolution of the Monasteries).\n","linknr":89,"url":"Roy_Henry","recorded":1375077356,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:OldHallMSFolio12v.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/OldHallMSFolio12v.jpg/220px-OldHallMSFolio12v.jpg","/wiki/File:OldHallMSFolio12v.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Gloria_in_Excelsis_Deo","/wiki/Old_Hall_Manuscript","/wiki/England","/wiki/Henry_V_of_England","/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England","/wiki/Old_Hall_Manuscript","/wiki/Mass_(music)","/wiki/Leonel_Power","/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)","/wiki/Plainchant","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=edit&section=1","http://www.grovemusic.com","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&oldid=513293640","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Medieval_composers","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:15th-century_English_people","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roy+Henry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Roy+Henry","/wiki/Roy_Henry","/wiki/Talk:Roy_Henry","#","/wiki/Roy_Henry","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Roy_Henry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Roy_Henry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&oldid=513293640","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7372936","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Roy_Henry&id=513293640","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Roy+Henry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Roy+Henry&oldid=513293640&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Roy_Henry&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7372936#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Henry","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["liturgy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English
