Before he was 20 he rarely visited the theatre. It\nwas while he was working as a quality control supervisor at an engineering firm\nin the Midlands that he became interested in amateur dramatics. He came to the\nattention of Bob Hamlyn, artistic director of the Belgrade Theatre, in Coventry\nafter his sensitive and emotional portrayal of Charlie Gordon in the Charles\nStrouse musical, [[Flowers for Algernon]]. Hamlyn cast him as \"third flunky\nfrom the left\" in another show by Strouse, [[Annie (musical)|Annie]]. It was at\nthis time, while Willetts was in his thirties, that he began his meteoric rise\nto the top.\n\nDirector Trevor Nunn put\nWilletts into the chorus of the original London production of [[Les MisÃ©rables\n(musical)|Les MisÃ©rables]] and within a year he was understudy to Colm Wilkinson\nin the lead role of Jean Valjean, which Willetts eventually took over when\nWilkinson left in 1986 to join the Broadway company. In 1987, when Michael\nCrawford departed London for the US premier of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's [[The\nPhantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]], Willetts\nsucceeded him at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End's hottest ticket. He\nsubsequently played the role of the Phantom in Manchester on the UK tour to\ncritical acclaim, winning an Evening News Theatre Award. In 1990, he was given\nhis first opportunity to originate a role when he appeared opposite Petula Clark\nin [[Someone Like You (musical)|Someone Like You]], a musical for which she had\ncomposed the score.\n\nSince then, Willetts has appeared in a concert version of [[Jesus Christ\nSuperstar]], taken the lead role in Leicester Haymarket's acclaimed production\nof Stephen Sondheim's [[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]], appeared as Old\nDeuteronomy in the 20th anniversary production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's [[Cats\n(musical)|Cats]] in London, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-\n74501417.html The House That Dave Built], [[ Coventry Telegraph]], May 14,\n2001 and as Jean Valjean in the 10th anniversary production of Les\nMisÃ©rables in Sydney, Australia. He created the role of Heathcliff in the studio\nrecording of Bernard J. Taylor musical version of Wuthering Heights.\n\nIn 2004 he appeared in the West End production of [[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]\nalongside Maria Friedman. In December of the same year he appeared as Captain\nHook in [[Peter Pan]] in Bromley. Most recently he has played the starring role\nin [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (musical)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]\nin the West End (2006). He recently played the role of Emile de Becque in a UK\ntouring production of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein|Rogers and Hammerstein's]]\n[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]], which toured the UK until July\n2008. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10058318.html Happy\ntalk as actor finally gets the girl], [[Hull Daily Mail]], September 8,\n2007\n\nHe appeared in a scaled down production of [[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset\nBoulevard]] at the Comedy Theatre (now The Harold Pinter) as Max in 2008-09.\n\nDave is currently reprising the role of Julian Marsh in a UK Tour of [[42nd\nStreet (musical)|42nd Street]] for UK Productions.
