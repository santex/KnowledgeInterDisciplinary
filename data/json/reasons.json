(Those are reasons in the 'normative' sense.) For example, the\nfact that a doctor's patient is grimacing is a reason to believe the patient is\nin pain. The fact that the patient is in pain is a reason for the doctor to do\nthings to alleviate the pain.\n\nIn another sense of the term, reasons are explanations of why things happened.\n(These are reasons in the 'explanatory' sense.) For example, the reason why the\npatient is in pain is that her nerves are sending signals from her tissues to\nher brain.\n","title":"Reason%20%28argument%29","headings":["Normative vs. explanatory reasons","Normative reasons","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Arguments","1: T._M._Scanlon","1: Derek_Parfit","1: Cause","1: Rational_agent","1: Informal_logic","1: Premise","1: Co-premise","1: Argument","1: Logic","1: Main_contention"]}
