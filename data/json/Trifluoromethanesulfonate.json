{"cursor":"4303","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Trifluoromethanesulfonate', also known by the trivial name 'triflate', is a\nfunctional group with the formula CF 3SO 3-. The triflate\ngroup is often represented by -OTf, as opposed to -Tf (triflyl). For example,\nn-butyl triflate can be written as\nCH 3CH 2CH 2CH 2OTf.\n\nThe triflate anion, CF 3SO 3- is an extremely\nstable polyatomic ion, being the conjugate base of triflic acid\n(CF 3SO 3H), one of the strongest acids known. It is defined\nas a superacid, because it is more acidic than pure sulfuric acid.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Trifluoromethanesulfonate","recorded":1362512267,"links":22,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sulfonic acids","Leaving groups","Triflates|*"],"headings":["Applications","Triflate salts","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Triflate.png/150px-Triflate.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Triflate_mesomeric_stability_transp.png/600px-Triflate_mesomeric_stability_transp.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/ScOTf3-mediated_aldol_condensation_transp.png/600px-ScOTf3-mediated_aldol_condensation_transp.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"]],"members":["salt"],"related":["Functional_group","Trifluoromethylsulfonyl","Polyatomic_ion","Conjugate_acid","Triflic_acid","Acid","Superacid","Sulfuric_acid","Leaving_group","Organic_reactions","Nucleophilic_substitution","Suzuki_coupling","Heck_reaction","SN2_reaction","Nucleophile","Water","Resonance_stabilization","Trifluoromethyl","Electron-withdrawing_group","Group_11_element","Group_13_element","Lanthanide","Lithium_ion_batteries","Electrolyte","Salt_(chemistry)","Sodium","Boron","Silver","Silver_triflate","Barium_triflate","Lewis_acid","Organic_chemistry","Aluminium_chloride","Lanthanide_triflates","Scandium_triflate","Aldol_reaction","Diels-Alder_reaction","Mukaiyama_aldol_addition","Benzaldehyde","Silyl_enol_ether","Cyclohexanone","Chemical_yield","Yttrium","Counterion","Methyl_triflate","Nonaflate","Trifluoromethanesulfonic_acid","Metal_triflimidate","Comins'_reagent"]}
