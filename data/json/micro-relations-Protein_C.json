{"cursor":"44662","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Protein C', also known as 'autoprothrombin IIA' and 'blood coagulation\nfactor XIV', is a zymogenic\n(inactive) protein, the activated form of which plays an important role in\nregulating blood clotting, inflammation, cell death, and maintaining the\npermeability of blood vessel walls in humans and other animals. 'Activated\nprotein C' ('APC') performs these operations primarily by proteolytically\ninactivating proteins Factor V a and Factor VIII a. APC is\nclassified as a serine protease as it contains a residue of serine in its active\nsite. In humans, protein C is encoded by the PROC gene,\nwhich is found on chromosome 2.\n\nThe zymogenic form of protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that\ncirculates in blood plasma. Its structure is that of a two-chain polypeptide\nconsisting of a light chain and a heavy chain connected by a disulfide bond. The protein C zymogen is activated when it binds to thrombin,\nanother protein heavily involved in coagulation, and protein C's activation is\ngreatly promoted by the presence of thrombomodulin and endothelial\nprotein C receptors (EPCRs). Because of EPCR's role, activated protein C is\nfound primarily near endothelial cells (i.e., those that make up the walls of\nblood vessels), and it is these cells and leukocytes (white blood cells) that\nAPC affects. Because of the crucial\nrole that protein C plays as an anticoagulant, those with deficiencies in\nprotein C, or some kind of resistance to APC, suffer from a significantly\nincreased risk of forming dangerous blood clots (thrombosis).\n\nResearch into the clinical use of activated protein C also known as drotrecogin\nalfa-activated (branded Xigris) has been surrounded by controversy. The\nmanufacturer Eli Lilly and Company ran an aggressive marketing campaign to\npromote its use in people with severe sepsis and septic shock including the\nsponsoring of the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. A 2011\nCochrane review however found that its use cannot be recommended as it does not\nimprove survival (and increases bleeding risk).\n","linknr":989,"url":"Protein_C","recorded":1362484457,"links":37,"instances":["chemistry","biochemistry","human","medical","unit","protein_and_supramolecular","chemistry","biology","medical","race","biochemistry","activated"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/content/251/2/355.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/251/2/355.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/258/9/5548.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/258/9/5548.full.pdf"],"categories":["Coagulation
