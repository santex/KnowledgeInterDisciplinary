The term originated in the BDSM\nclub and party communities, indicating the activities taking place within in a\nscene. It has since extended to the full range of BDSM actions.\n\nPlay can take many forms. It ranges from light \"getting to know you\" sessions\nwhere participants discover each other's likes and dislikes to extreme, extended\nplay between committed individuals that know each other's limits and are willing\nto push or be pushed at their boundaries. While physical activities are better\nknown and more infamous, it also includes 'mental play' such as erotic hypnosis\nand mind games.\n\nBDSM play is usually the primary topic of negotiation, especially for casual\n'players' and limited scenes. Most BDSM clubs and local communities offer\nclasses and materials about negotiating play scenes.
