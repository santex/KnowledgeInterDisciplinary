He is best known for his work on foraging, especially the marginal\nvalue theorem, and life history theory, especially sex allocation and\nscaling/allometric rules. He is a MacArthur Fellow and a Fellow of the American\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences. Three of his papers are Science Citation Classics.\n\nCharnov gained his PhD in evolutionary ecology from the University of Washington\nin 1973. He is a Distinguished Professor (Emeritus) of Biology at the University\nof New Mexico.\n\nHis research interests are:\n\nMetabolic ecology: temperature and body size in the determination of biological\ntimes and rates; Evolutionary ecology: population genetics, evolutionary game\ntheory, and optimization models to understand the evolution of life histories,\nsex allocation, sexual selection, and foraging decisions.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Eric_Charnov","recorded":1372152234,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1947 births","University of Washington alumni","University of New Mexico faculty","Living people","MacArthur Fellows","American ecologists","Population geneticists","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences"],"headings":["Bibliography","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Evolutionary_ecology","Foraging","Marginal_value_theorem","Life_history_theory","Sex_allocation","MacArthur_Fellow","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","University_of_Washington","University_of_New_Mexico","Metabolic_ecology","Evolutionary_ecology","Population_genetics","Evolutionary_game_theory","Life_history_theory","Sex_allocation","Sexual_selection","Foraging"]}
