These\ndinoflagellates adhere to coral, algae and seaweed, where they are eaten by\nherbivorous fish who in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. In this way\nthe toxins move up the food chain and bioaccumulate. Gambierdiscus toxicus is\nthe primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar\ntoxins that cause ciguatera. These toxins include ciguatoxin, maitotoxin,\nscaritoxin and palytoxin. Predator species near the top of the food chain in\ntropical and subtropical waters, such as barracudas, snapper, moray eels,\nparrotfishes, groupers, triggerfishes and amberjacks, are most likely to cause\nciguatera poisoning, although many other species cause occasional outbreaks of\ntoxicity. Ciguatoxin is odourless, tasteless and very heat-resistant, so ciguatoxin-\nladen fish cannot be detoxified by conventional cooking.\n\nResearchers suggest that ciguatera outbreaks caused by cooling climatic\nconditions propelled the migratory voyages of Polynesians between 1000 and 1400.
