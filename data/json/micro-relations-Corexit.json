It is produced by\n Nalco Holding Company, which merged with Ecolab in 2011 and is associated with\n BP and Exxon. Corexit was the most-used dispersant in the Deepwater\n Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, with COREXIT 9527 having been replaced\n by COREXIT 9500 after the former was deemed unacceptably toxic. Oil that would normally rise to the surface of the water is\n broken up by the dispersant into small globules that can then remain suspended\n in the water. In 2012, a study found that Corexit used\n during the Gulf spill had increased the toxicity of the oil by up to 52\n times.
