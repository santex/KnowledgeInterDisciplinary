Recorded throughout\n1992 to 1993 and released in 1994, the album spawned two top ten singles and a\nthird top forty single. At the time her music career commenced, Pearen had been\na popular cast member of the Australian drama series [[E Street]]. She was one\nof many Australian actresses who ventured into a music career, following the\nsuccess of Kylie Minogue as well as Dannii Minogue, Natalie Imbruglia and also\nPearen's E Street co-star Melissa Tkautz, who scored a successful number one hit\nas well as other popular songs in the early 90's.\n\nFour singles were released from Intimate. The first single \"In Your Room,\"\npeaked at number ten on the ARIA Charts in late 1992. The second single \"I Want\nYou\" also peaked at number ten in early 1993. After the album was released in\n1994, the third single \"Walkaway Lover\" peaked at number thirty-five. Finally\nthe fourth single \"Joy\" was released in 1995 and peaked at number seventy-one.\nThe album itself peaked at number fifty-six on the ARIA Albums Chart in 1994.\n\nSo far, this is the only album released by Pearen as she has been very busy as a\npopular television personality. She did however contribute some songs to the\nsoundtrack of the 1995 film [[All Men Are Liars]], which she also starred in.\n\n\"I Want You\" was nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release in 1994.
