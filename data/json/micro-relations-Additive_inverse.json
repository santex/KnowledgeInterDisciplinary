The additive inverse of is denoted by unary\nminus: â. This can be seen as a shorthand for a common subtraction notation:\n: =  â }}\nwith \"0\" omitted, although in a correct typography there should be no space\nafter unary \"â\".\n\nFor example, the additive inverse of 7 is â7, because\n7 + (â7) = 0, and the additive inverse of â0.3 is 0.3,\nbecause â0.3 + 0.3 = 0 .\n\nIn other words, the additive inverse of a number is the number's negative. For\nexample, the additive inverse of 8 is −8, the additive inverse of 10002 is\n−10002 and the additive inverse of is .\n\nThe additive inverse of a number is defined as its inverse element under the\nbinary operation of addition. It can be calculated using multiplication by â1;\nthat is, = −1 Ã }} .\n\nIntegers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex number all have additive\ninverses, as they contain negative as well as positive numbers. Natural numbers,\ncardinal numbers, and ordinal numbers, on the other hand, do not have additive\ninverses within their respective sets. Thus, for example, we can say that\nnatural numbers do have additive inverses, but because these additive inverses\nare not themselves natural numbers, the set of natural numbers is not ''closed''\nunder taking additive inverses.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Additive_inverse","recorded":1362896912,"links":41,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","punctuation","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abstract algebra","Arithmetic","Elementary algebra"],"headings":["General definition","Other examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["0","number"],["space","punctuation"],["set","mathematics"],["closure","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["net","mathematics"]],"members":["closure","net","matrix","space","set"],"related":["Number","Addition","0_(number)","Unary_operation","Minus_sign","Subtraction","Typography","Space_(punctuation)","Inverse_element","Binary_operation","Multiplication","−1","Integer","Rational_number","Real_number","Complex_number","Natural_number","Cardinal_number","Ordinal_number","Set_(mathematics)","Closure_(mathematics)","Commutative","Identity_element","Associativity","Abelian_group","Vector_space","Sequence","Matrix_(mathematics)","Net_(mathematics)","Vector_space","Scalar_multiplication","Euclidean_space","Inversion_in_a_point","Modular_arithmetic","Multiplicative_inverse","Additive_identity"]}
