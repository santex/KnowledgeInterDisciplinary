The formal definition of cachexia is the loss of\nbody mass that cannot be reversed nutritionally: Even if the affected patient\neats more calories, lean body mass will be lost, indicating a primary pathology\nis in place.\n\nCachexia is seen in patients with cancer, AIDS,\nchronic obstructive lung disease, multiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure,\ntuberculosis, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, mercury poisoning (acrodynia) and\nhormonal deficiency.\n\nIt is a positive risk factor for death, meaning if the patient has cachexia, the\nchance of death from the underlying condition is increased dramatically. It can\nbe a sign of various underlying disorders; when a patient presents with\ncachexia, a doctor will generally consider the possibility of cancer, metabolic\nacidosis (from decreased protein synthesis and increased protein catabolism),\ncertain infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, AIDS), chronic pancreatitis,\nand some autoimmune disorders, or addiction to amphetamine. Cachexia physically\nweakens patients to a state of immobility stemming from loss of appetite,\nasthenia, and anemia, and response to standard treatment is usually poor.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Cachexia","recorded":1362552376,"links":34,"instances":["symptom","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Disease settings","Mechanism","Treatment","Prevalence","Cancer cachexia","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["anorexia","symptom"],["sign","medicine"]],"members":["anorexia","sign"],"related":["Greek_language","Weight_loss","Muscle_atrophy","Anorexia_(symptom)","Lean_body_mass","Cancer","AIDS","Chronic_obstructive_lung_disease","Multiple_sclerosis","Congestive_heart_failure","Tuberculosis","Familial_amyloid_neuropathy","Mercury_poisoning","Sign_(medicine)","Cancer","Metabolic_acidosis","Catabolism","Infectious_disease","Autoimmune_disorder","Amphetamine","Asthenia","Anemia","Cancer","Congestive_heart_failure","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Wasting","Skeletal_muscle","Muscle_atrophy","Inflammation","Cytokine","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Interferon","Interleukin_6","Tumor","Proteolysis","Kwashiorkor","Marasmus","Malnutrition","Ghrelin","Steroid","Corticosteroid","Progesterone","Medical_marijuana","N-3_fatty_acid","Omega-3_fatty_acid","Quality_of_life","Eicosapentaenoic_acid","ALD518","Anti-IL-6","Lean_body_mass","GTx-024","Selective_androgen_receptor_modulator","VT-122","Etodolac","SNT_207979","ALD518","SUN11031","ActRIIB-Fc","CK-2017357","MT-102","Celecoxib","Testosterone","Vitamin_D","OHR/AVR118","Chemokine","Cytokine","TNF-alpha","Activin","Myostatin","ActRIIB_receptor","SActRIIB","5-HT3_antagonist","COX-2_inhibitor","Leptin","Hypothalamic","Orexigenic","Ubiquitin-proteasome_pathway","Lipolysis","Cytokines","TNF-alpha","IGF-1","Interleukin_6","IL1B","Interferon-gamma","NF-κB","Myofibrillar","5-HT3_antagonist","Cox-2_inhibitor","Thalidomide","Omega-3_fatty_acids","Eicosapentaenoic_acid","Gluconeogenesis","Antioxidants","Progestogen","Megestrol_acetate","Medroxyprogesterone_acetate","Cyclooxygenase-2","Progressive_disease","Terminal_illness","Journal_of_Cachexia,_Sarcopenia_and_Muscle"]}
