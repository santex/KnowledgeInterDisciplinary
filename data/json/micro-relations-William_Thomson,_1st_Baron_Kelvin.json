At the University of\nGlasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and\nformulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to\nunify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely\nwith mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. He also had a career as\nan electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public\neye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic\ntelegraph project he was knighted by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William\nThomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on\nthe mariner's compass, which had previously been limited in reliability.\n\nLord Kelvin is widely known for determining the correct value of absolute zero\nas approximately -273.15 Celsius. A lower limit to temperature was known prior\nto Lord Kelvin, as shown in \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat\", Sadi\nCarnot, approx 1820 in French, before Lord Kelvin's birth in 1824. \"Reflections\"\nused -267 as the absolute zero temperature. Absolute temperatures are stated in\nunits of kelvin in his honour.\n\nOn his ennoblement in 1892 in honour of his achievements in thermodynamics, and\nof his opposition to Irish Home Rule, [http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-\n6596/158/1/011001 Kelvin and Ireland] Raymond Flood, Mark McCartney and Andrew\nWhitaker (2009) J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 158 011001\np.162 he adopted the title [[Baron]] Kelvin of [[Largs]] and is\ntherefore often described as Lord Kelvin. He was the first UK scientist to be\nelevated to the House of Lords. The title refers to the River Kelvin, which\nflows close by his laboratory at the University of Glasgow. His home was the\nimposing red sandstone mansion Netherhall, in Largs on the Firth of Clyde.\nDespite offers of elevated posts from several world renowned universities Lord\nKelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining Professor of Natural Philosophy for\nover 50 years, until his eventual retirement from that post. The Hunterian\nMuseum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of\nLord Kelvin including many of his original papers, instruments and other\nartefacts such as his smoking pipe.\n\nAlways active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around\n1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British\ncompany Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman\nKodak.
