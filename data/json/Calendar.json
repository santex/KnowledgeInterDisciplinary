This is done by giving names to periods\n of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of\n a single, specific day within such a system. Periods in a calendar (such as\n years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the\n cycle of the sun or the moon. Many civilizations and societies have devised a\n calendar, usually derived from other calendars on which they model their\n systems, suited to their particular needs.\n\nA calendar is also a physical device (often paper). This is the most common\nusage of the word. Other similar types of calendars can include computerized\nsystems, which can be set to remind the user of upcoming events and\nappointments.\n\nA calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar.\n\nThe English word calendar is derived from the Latin word kalendae, which was the\nLatin name of the first day of every month.
