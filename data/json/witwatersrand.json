The word in\nAfrikaans means \"the ridge of white waters\".\n\nGeologically it is complex, but the principal formations are quartzites,\nconglomerates and shales of the Witwatersrand System.\n\nThe Witwatersrand range forms a continental divide with rivers to the north such\nas the Crocodile River draining into the Limpopo River and Indian Ocean and with\nthe run-off to the south draining into the Orange River and Atlantic. The\nWitwatersrand lies within the province of Gauteng, formerly called the PWV area,\nan acronym for Pretoria, Witwatersrand, and Vereeniging.\n",
