A\n region termed \"inner wall zone\" (IWZ) has been observed between the cytoplasmic\n membrane and the mature cell wall. ,\n Matias, V. R., and T. J. Beveridge. 2005.

Composition of the IWZ has not been as yet\nclearly determined.\n\nAlthough the bacteria are conventionally divided into two main groups â Gram-\npositive and -negative, based upon their Gram-stain retention property â this\nclassification system is ambiguous as it can refers to three distinct aspects\n(staining result, cell-envelope organization, taxonomic group), which do not\nnecessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.

However, although Gram-staining response of bacteria is an empirical\ncriterion, its basis lies in the marked differences in the ultrastructure and\nchemical composition of the two main kinds of prokaryotic cells that are found\nin nature. These two kinds of cells are distinguished from each other based upon\nthe presence or absence of an outer lipid membrane, which is a more reliable and\nfundamental characteristic of the bacterial cells. Gupta, R. S. (1998). What are archaebacteria: lifeâs third domain\nor monoderm prokaryotes related to Gram-positive bacteria? A new proposal for\nthe classification of prokaryotic organisms. Molecular Microbiology. 29(3):695-\n707.\n\nAll Gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single unit lipid membrane; they\ngenerally contain a thick layer (20-80 nm) of peptidoglycan responsible for\nretaining the Gram-stain. A number of other bacteria which are bounded by a\nsingle membrane but stain Gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan\nlayer (viz., mycoplasmas) or their inability to retain the Gram-stain due to\ntheir cell wall composition, also show close relationship to the gram-positive\nbacteria. For the bacterial (prokaryotic) cells that are bounded by a single\ncell membrane the term \"mononderm bacteria\" or \"monoderm prokaryotes\" has been\nproposed. In contrast to Gram-positive\nbacteria, all archetypical Gram-negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic\nmembrane as well as an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of\npeptidoglycan (2-3 nm) between these membranes. The presence of both inner\nand outer cell membranes forms and define the periplasmic space or periplasmic\ncompartment. These bacterial cells with two membranes have been designated as\ndiderm bacteria. The distinction\nbetween the monoderm and diderm prokaryotes is supported by conserved signature\nindels in a number of important proteins (viz. DnaK, GroEL). Gupta, R. S.\n(2011). Origin of diderm (Gram-negative) bacteria: antibiotic selection pressure\nrather than endosymbiosis likely led to the evolution of bacterial cells with\ntwo membranes. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 100:171-182.\n\nIn diderm bacteria, the periplasm contains a thin cell wall composed of\npeptidoglycan. In addition, it includes solutes such as ions and proteins, which\nare involved in wide variety of functions ranging from nutrient binding,\ntransport, folding, degradation, substrate hydrolysis, to peptidoglycan\nsynthesis, electron transport, and alteration of substances toxic to the cell\n(xenobiotic metabolism). Importantly, the\nperiplasm is devoid of ATP.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Periplasmic_space","recorded":1362889575,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Bacteriology"],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Gram_negative_cell_wall.svg/250px-Gram_negative_cell_wall.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cell_wall","Inner_membrane","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Gram-negative","Bacterium","Gram-positive","Bacterium","Cytoplasmic_membrane","Cell_wall","Streptococcus_gordonii","Gram-negative","Gram-positive","Gram-positive","Gram-negative","Gram-positive_bacteria","Prokaryote","Conserved_signature_indels","Bacterium","Cell_wall","Peptidoglycan","Peptidoglycan","Electron_transport","Xenobiotic_metabolism"]}
