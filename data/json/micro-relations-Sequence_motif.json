{"cursor":"22037","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In genetics, a 'sequence motif' is a nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern\nthat is widespread and has, or is conjectured to have, a biological\nsignificance. For proteins, a sequence motif is distinguished from a structural\nmotif, a motif formed by the three dimensional arrangement of amino acids, which\nmay not be adjacent.\n\nAn example is the ''N''-glycosylation site motif:\n\n: Asn, followed by anything but Pro, followed by either Ser or Thr, followed by\n: anything but Pro\n\nwhere the three-letter abbreviations are the conventional designations for amino\nacids (see genetic code).\n","linknr":277,"url":"Sequence_motif","recorded":1362566378,"links":16,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb97/matsuda.pdf","http://helix-web.stanford.edu/psb97/matsuda.pdf"],"categories":["Bioinformatics"],"headings":["Overview","Motif bioinformatics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["translation","cell"],"related":["Genetics","Nucleotide","Amino_acid","Sequence","Biology","Structural_motif","N-glycosylation","Amino_acid","Genetic_code","Exon","Gene","Genetic_code","Protein_motif","Protein","Tertiary_structure","Secondary_structure","Noncoding_DNA","Translation_(biology)","Nucleic_acid","DNA","DNA","Junk_DNA","Satellite_DNA","RNA_splicing","DNA_binding_protein","DNA_binding_site","Signal_peptide","Cell_(biology)","Phosphorylation","Database","Sequence_analysis","BLAST","Bioinformatics","Consensus_sequence","Sequence_logo","Hidden_Markov_model","IQ_motif","Multiple_EM_for_Motif_Elicitation","GCM_transcription_factors","Regular_expression","PROSITE","IUPAC","Position_weight_matrix","TRANSFAC","Operon","Biomolecular_structure","Multiple_EM_for_Motif_Elicitation","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Protein_primary_structure","Sequence_mining","Structural_motif","Short_linear_motif"]}
