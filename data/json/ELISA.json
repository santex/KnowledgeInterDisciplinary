Then, a further specific\nantibody is applied over the surface so it can bind to the antigen. This\nantibody is linked to an enzyme, and, in the final step, a substance containing\nthe enzyme's substrate is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable\nsignal, most commonly a color change in the substrate.\n\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a\nparticular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized\non a solid support (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-\nspecifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by\nanother antibody specific to the same antigen, in a \"sandwich\" ELISA). After the\nantigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with\nthe antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme, or\ncan itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme\nthrough bioconjugation. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a\nmild detergent solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are not\nspecifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding\nan enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity\nof antigen in the sample.\n\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of ligand binding assays instead of\nstrictly \"immuno\" assays, though the name carried the original \"immuno\" because\nof the common use and history of development of this method. The technique\nessentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid\nphase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an\nenzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the\nwashes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain\nspecifically bound or \"immunosorbed\" by antigen-antibody interactions to the\nsolid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike\nother spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well\n(e.g. a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction\nproducts immunosorbed on the solid phase which is part of the plate, so are not\neasily reusable.\n","linknr":344,"url":"ELISA","recorded":1362510025,"links":47,"instances":["information_theory","biochemistry","food","assay"],"pdf":["http://www.chimera-biotec.com/data/pdf/Cytokine_Quant_Comp_Final.pdf","http://www.chimera-biotec.com/data/pdf/Cytokine_Quant_Comp_Final.pdf"],"categories":["Immunologic tests"],"headings":["Principle","History","Types","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Microtiter_plate.JPG/230px-Microtiter_plate.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg/220px-Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/ELISA_diagram.png/200px-ELISA_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/ELISA-sandwich.svg/300px-ELISA-sandwich.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/ELISA.jpg/220px-ELISA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Elisa10.jpg/220px-Elisa10.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["signal","information_theory"],["multiplex","assay"],["egg","food"]],"members":["signal","substrate","egg","multiplex"],"related":["Microtiter_plate","Biochemistry","Assay","Medical_diagnosis","Plant_pathology","Quality_control","Enzyme_substrate","Polystyrene","Microtiter_plate","Adsorption","Enzyme","Secondary_antibody","Bioconjugation","Detergent","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Signal_(information_theory)","Ligand_binding_assays","Reflectometry","Spectrophotometry","Ligand_binding_assays","Immunoassay","Antigen","Antibody","Immunoassay","Radioimmunoassay","Radioactive","Rosalyn_Sussman_Yalow","Solomon_Berson","Peroxidase","ABTS","3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine","Jerker_Porath","Chromogenic","Fluorogenic","Electrochemiluminescence","Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Multiplex_(assay)","Attogram","Microtiter_plate","Bovine_serum_albumin","Casein","Block","Primary_antibody","Secondary_antibody","Pregnancy_test","Secondary_antibody","Ogive","Blood_plasma","HIV_test","West_Nile_virus","Food","Food_allergy","Milk","Peanut","Walnut","Almond","Egg_(food)","Malaria","Chagas_disease","Paratuberculosis","In_vitro_diagnostics","Medical_laboratories","Enterotoxin","Assay","Eva_Engvall","ELISPOT","Immunoassay","Immunoscreening","Radioimmunoassay","Secretion_assay","Lateral_flow_test","Magnetic_immunoassay","Plaque_reduction_neutralization_test","University_of_Arizona"]}
