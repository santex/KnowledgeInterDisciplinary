Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in\nfundamental worth or social status, according to The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy. Arneson Richard, \"Egalitarianism\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy (2002.) Web:\n The Cultural theory of\nrisk holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules\nand principles, and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with\nfatalism termed as its opposite. Thompson et al., Cultural Theory\n(1990.) According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term has two\ndistinct definitions in modern English. http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism It is defined either as a political\ndoctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same\npolitical, economic, social, and civil rights {{Cite web\n| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/egalitarianism title=egalitarianism\n| author=The American Heritage Dictionary year=2003\n}} or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic\ninequalities among people or the decentralization of power. Some sources define\negalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of\nhumanity. Erdal, D. &\nWhiten, A.
