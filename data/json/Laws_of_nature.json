{"cursor":"14513","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'physical law' or 'scientific law' is, according to the Oxford English\ndictionary, \"a theoretical principle deduced from particular facts, applicable\nto a defined group or class of phenomena, and expressible by the statement that\na particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be\npresent.\" Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated\nscientific experiments and observations over many years and which have become\naccepted universally within the scientific community. The production of a\nsummary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental\naim of science. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.\n\nThe distinction between natural law in the political-legal sense and law of\nnature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts\nbeing equally derived from [[physis]], the Greek word (translated into Latin as\nnatura) for nature. Some modern philosophers, e.g. Norman Swartz, use\n\"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are\ninferred by scientists.
