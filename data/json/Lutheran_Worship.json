Published in 1982 by Concordia Publishing House in St. Louis,\nMissouri, it is the LC-MS's third English-language hymnal and was intended to\nreplace [[The Lutheran Hymnal]] (TLH) (1941). However, dissatisfaction with\nvarious revisions has led numerous congregations to continue using the previous\nhymnal, and according to a 1999 LC-MS Commission on Worship survey, The Lutheran\nHymnal is still used by 36% of churches in the Synod as their primary hymnal.\nThe publication of another new hymnal, [[Lutheran Service Book]] in 2006, has\nrestored many of the former hymnal's features in the hope that more widespread\nuse can be achieved.\n\nLutheran Worship is, essentially, a revision of the green-covered [[Lutheran\nBook of Worship]] of 1978 that was the common liturgical book and hymnal of the\nold Lutheran Church in America, The American Lutheran Church and the Association\nof Evangelical Lutheran Churches, which later merged in 1988 to form the\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America until 2007. The LC-MS began work on the\nLBW in 1965 as a revision of TLH of 1941 and the other Lutheran churches' book,\nthe [[Service Book and Hymnal]] (SBH) of 1958 and invited other Lutheran\ndenominations in North America to participate in the creation of the hymnal. Due\nto disagreements and compromise with some of the other denominations involved in\nthe project, however, the LBW was published in 1978 without the endorsement of\nthe very church body which initiated its production, when more conservative\nleaders assumed leadership after 1974 amidst a theological controversy and\nschism. Following the rejection of the LBW, the LC-MS quickly set about revising\nthe new hymnal to remove the objectionable content, and LW was published in\n1982. Lutheran Worship includes orders for Holy Communion entitled Divine\nService I (a revised and updated version of the old The Common Service liturgy\nof 1888, which influenced the further development of American Lutheran liturgies\nand was incorporated in The Common Service Book of 1917, adopted by the old\nUnited Lutheran Church in America, a predecessor of the LCA to 1962), Divine\nService II (two settings, very similar to liturgies included in the LBW), and\nDivine Service III (a brief outline of a service based on Martin Luther's German\nMass). It also includes orders for Matins, Vespers, and Compline, as well as\nservices for Holy Baptism and Confirmation. There is also Morning Prayer,\nEvening Prayer, the Bidding Prayer, the Litany, the Lectionary, Luther's Small\nCatechism, Confession (Individual and Corporate), and a collection of Psalms.\nThe bulk of the hymnal consists of 11 canticles and chants, 491 hymns, and 18\nspiritual songs.\n\nDespite the revisions undertaken by the LC-MS, many members and congregations\nstill rejected LW due to what many viewed as unnecessary and awkward\nmodifications in language to well-known materials. Objections centered around\nthe modifications made to Divine Service I and a number of well-known hymns.\nFollowing the precedent set by the LBW and the common trend around North\nAmerican Christianity at the time, archaic language was widely updated,\nresulting in worshipers frequently stumbling over hymn verses and passages that\nhad been familiar to them for many years. Examples of hymns that were\nsignificantly altered in the new hymnal include \"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\", \"I\nAm Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus\", and \"We Give Thee But Thine Own\", all of which\nare well-known and familiar hymns among Lutherans but were heavily modified in\nLW (\"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\" is perhaps the most notorious example of all, as\nits first line was changed to \"My Faith Looks Trustingly\"). Additionally, many\nfamiliar hymns were set to new melodies that proved unpopular. Examples include\n\"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty\", \"The Day of Resurrection\", and \"God Loved the\nWorld So That He Gave\". In many ways, LW proved to be a major contributor to the\ncontroversies that tore at the LC-MS in the later part of the twentieth century,\nas the synod suddenly found itself lacking unity even in the hymnal used in its\ncongregations. By 1999, only 58% of the synod was using LW as its primary\nhymnal, with the majority of the remaining congregations retaining TLH and a\nhandful of others using LBW or other hymnals such as SBH.\n\nLutheran Worship is commonly referred to as the \"Blue hymnal,\" because of its\nbound cover in contrast with TLH (or the SBH of 1958) - the \"Red hymnal\". The\none notable exception to \"Lutheran Worship\" being blue is in the case of\nConcordia Lutheran Church in San Antonio, TX, whose founding pastor, the\nReverend Doctor Guido Merkens, insisted at a synodical meeting that he wanted\ngreen covers. Not wanting to ruffle the feathers of the man who at that time had\nthe fastest-growing LC-MS church in the nation, a popular syndicated TV show\nknown as \"Breakthrough,\" and a \"Television Sunday School\" with a wide audience,\nthe Synod and publishers relented, and hundreds of \"Lutheran Worship\" hymnals\nwere produced in a dark green color to match the color scheme of Dr. Merkens'\nchurch. A new hymnal published in 2006, [[Lutheran Service Book]], is intended\nto replace both LW and TLH as the common hymnal of the LC-MS. Concordia\nPublishing House has announced that all LW-related supplemental materials,\nincluding specialized accompaniment and large-print editions and the agenda,\nwill go out of print when current supplies are depleted, although the pew\nedition will continue to be produced for the foreseeable future. LW remains an\nofficial hymnal of the LC-MS, and it is unlikely that it will ever be formally\ndecommissioned.\n","linknr":239,"url":"Lutheran_Worship","recorded":1375072565,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Lutheran_Worship&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Lutheran_Worship&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Lutheranism","/wiki/Divine_Service_(Lutheran)","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_-_Missouri_Synod","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_-_Missouri_Synod","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_-_Canada","/wiki/Publisher","/wiki/Concordia_Publishing_House","/wiki/The_Lutheran_Hymnal","/wiki/Lutheran_Service_Book","/wiki/Hymn","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_-_Missouri_Synod","/wiki/1982_in_literature","/wiki/Concordia_Publishing_House","/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri","/wiki/The_Lutheran_Hymnal","/wiki/Lutheran_Service_Book","/wiki/Lutheran_Book_of_Worship","/wiki/Lutheran_Church_in_America","/wiki/American_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Association_of_Evangelical_Lutheran_Churches","/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America","/wiki/Service_Book_and_Hymnal","/wiki/Lutheranism","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/1978_in_literature","/wiki/Eucharist_in_the_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Divine_Service_(Lutheran)","/w/index.php?title=Common_Service&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/United_Lutheran_Church_in_America","/wiki/Martin_Luther","/wiki/Matins","/wiki/Vespers","/wiki/Compline","/wiki/Baptism","/wiki/Confirmation_(sacrament)#Anglican.2FEpiscopal_and_Lutheran_views","/wiki/Litany","/wiki/Lectionary","/wiki/Luther%27s_Small_Catechism","/wiki/Confession_(religion)","/wiki/Psalms","/wiki/Canticle","/wiki/Chant","/wiki/North_America","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Lutheran_Service_Book","/w/index.php?title=Lutheran_Worship&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Concordia_Publishing_House","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0570039835","/wiki/Template:Lutheran_Divine_Service","/wiki/Template_talk:Lutheran_Divine_Service","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Lutheran_Divine_Service&action=edit","/wiki/Divine_Service_(Lutheran)","/wiki/Lutheranism","/wiki/Trinitarian_formula","/wiki/Penitential_Rite","/wiki/Confiteor#Usage_in_Lutheranism","/wiki/Declaration_of_Grace","/wiki/Asperges","/wiki/Introit","/wiki/Gloria_Patri","/wiki/Kyrie","/wiki/Gloria_in_excelsis_Deo","/wiki/Dominus_Vobiscum","/wiki/Oremus","/wiki/Collect","/wiki/Old_Testament","/wiki/Gradual","/wiki/Psalms#The_Psalms_in_Christian_worship","/wiki/Epistle","/wiki/Alleluia_(chant)","/wiki/Tract_(liturgy)","/wiki/Lent","/wiki/Gospel_(liturgy)","/wiki/Hymn_of_the_day","/wiki/Homily","/wiki/Postil","/wiki/Sermon","/wiki/Nicene_Creed","/wiki/Athanasian_Creed","/wiki/Trinity_Sunday","/wiki/Offertory","/wiki/General_Intercessions","/wiki/Eucharist_in_the_Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Preface_(liturgy)","/wiki/Sursum_corda","/wiki/Sanctus","/wiki/Hosanna","/wiki/Anaphora_(liturgy)","/wiki/Epiclesis","/wiki/Words_of_Institution#Lutheran_Churches","/wiki/Memorial_Acclamation","/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer","/wiki/Holy_kiss","/wiki/Pax_(liturgy)","/wiki/Elevation_(liturgy)","/wiki/Agnus_Dei","/wiki/Eucharist_in_the_Lutheran_Church#Manner_of_reception","/wiki/Nunc_dimittis","/wiki/Postcommunion","/wiki/Benedicamus_Domino","/wiki/Benediction","/wiki/Dismissal_(liturgy)","/wiki/Ite_missa_est","/wiki/Acolyte","/wiki/Bishop#Lutheranism","/wiki/Cantor_(church)","/wiki/Choir","/wiki/Crucifer","/wiki/Deacon#Lutheran_Communities","/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)#Lutheranism","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers#History_within_Protestantism","/wiki/Lector","/wiki/Pastor#Protestantism","/wiki/Priest#Lutheran","/wiki/Church_usher","/wiki/Altar#Protestant_Churches","/wiki/Altar_bell","/wiki/Altar_crucifix","/wiki/Altar_rails","/wiki/Kneeler","/wiki/Piscina","/wiki/Processional_cross","/wiki/Church_tabernacle","/wiki/Altar_candle","/wiki/Paschal_candle","/wiki/Sanctuary_lamp","/wiki/Votive_candle","/wiki/Ciborium_(container)","/wiki/Chalice_(cup)#Christian","/wiki/Cruet","/wiki/Offertory#Collection_of_alms","/wiki/Holy_water","/wiki/Incense","/wiki/Religious_use_of_incense#Christianity","/wiki/Paten","/wiki/Sacramental_bread","/wiki/Wafer","/wiki/Sacramental_wine","/wiki/Thurible","/wiki/Vestments","/wiki/Alb","/wiki/Chasuble","/wiki/Dalmatic","/wiki/Geneva_gown","/wiki/Humeral_veil","/wiki/Stole_(vestment)","/wiki/Surplice","/wiki/Tunicle","/wiki/Liturgica
