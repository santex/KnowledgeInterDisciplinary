Chairman\nProfessor Sir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, P 9:\n\"...it is necessary to produce about 100 GM plants to obtain one that has the\ndesirable characters for its use as a basis of a new GM crop variety. ...Most of\nthese so-called conventional plant breeding methods (such as gene transfer by\npollination, mutation breeding, cell selection and induced polyploidy) have a\nsubstantially greater discard rate. Mutation breeding, for instance, involves\nthe production of unpredictable and undirected genetic changes and many\nthousands, even millions, of undesirable plants are discarded in order to\nidentify plants with suitable qualities for further breeding.\" than\nmutagenesis (mutation breeding) where an organism is exposed to radiation or\nchemicals to create a non-specific but stable change. Other techniques by which\nhumans modify plants include selective breeding; plant breeding, and somaclonal\nvariation.\n\nIn most cases the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not\noccur naturally in this species. Examples include resistance to certain pests,\ndiseases or environmental conditions, or the production of a certain nutrient or\npharmaceutical agent.\n\nCritics have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds, including\necological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms\nare subject to intellectual property law. GM crops also are involved in\ncontroversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops\nis safe and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs.\n","linknr":965,"url":"Transgenic_plant","recorded":1362507206,"links":71,"instances":["element","biochemistry","biology","biology","biology","biology","epidemiology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/96/11/5937.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/96/11/5937.full.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/content/80/15/4803.full.pdf","http://www.isaaa.org/kc/Publications/pdfs/isaaabriefs/Briefs%201.pdf","http://www.isaaa.org/kc/Publications/pdfs/isaaabriefs/Briefs%201.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v328/n6125/pdf/328033a0.pdf","http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/05/download/isaaa-brief-05-1997.pdf","http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/05/download/isaaa-brief-05-1997.pdf","http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2010/10/08/pp.110.164681.full.pdf","http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/7/1441.full.pdf","http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/18965/18965D.pdf","http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/18965/18965D.pdf","http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/report_GMOpipeline_online_preprint.pdf","http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca6602p62-93331.pdf","http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca6602p62-93331.pdf","http://www.ilsi.org/Documents/2011%20AM%20Presentations/CERAPaarlberg.pdf","http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/nass/Acre/2010s/2010/Acre-06-30-2010.pdf","http://www.ncfap.org./documents/2007biotech_report/Quantification_of_the_Impacts_on_US_Agriculture_of_Biotechnology_Executive_Summary.pdf","http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/NPH-1.pdf","http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/aphisdocs2/95_35201p_com.pdf","http://www.apaari.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/biosafety_regulations_of_asia-pacific_countries.pdf","http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf"],"categories":["Genetic
