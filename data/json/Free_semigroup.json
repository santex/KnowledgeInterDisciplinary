{"cursor":"19553","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In abstract algebra, the 'free monoid' on a set A is the monoid whose elements\nare all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements from A. It is\nusually denoted A ∗ . The identity element is the unique\nsequence of zero elements, often called the empty string and denoted by Îµ or Î»,\nand the monoid operation is string concatenation. The 'free [[semigroup]]' on A\nis the subsemigroup of A ∗ containing all elements except the\nempty string. It is usually denoted A +. , [http://books.google.com/books?id=eATLTZzwW-\nsC&pg=PA2]\n\nMore generally, an abstract monoid (or semigroup) S is described as 'free' if it\nis isomorphic to the free monoid (or semigroup) on some set.\n\nAs the name implies, free monoids and semigroups are those objects which satisfy\nthe usual universal property defining free objects, in the respective categories\nof monoids and semigroups. It follows that every monoid (or semigroup) arises as\na homomorphic image of a free monoid (or semigroup). The study of semigroups as\nimages of free semigroups is called combinatorial semigroup theory.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Free_semigroup","recorded":1362372655,"links":12,"instances":["algebra","group_theory","mathematics","computing","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semigroup theory","Formal languages","Free algebraic structures","Combinatorics on words"],"headings":["Examples","Conjugate words","Free generators and rank","Free hull","Morphisms","Endomorphisms","The free commutative monoid","Generalization","Free monoids and computing","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/5/7e55ae772014e49db4eae170a0b54bde.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/b/7/6b75f25c59c5d3ad0fe840cbde1b848e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/a/dca8560f5b8c7f7f90f2e1cae506edf6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/8/7/58798a0f073109ee40d2408cdb5a2b3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/b/8/3b833856bc606c52cc73b491a8544186.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/b/aab890885edd9ed6dd30a6420df1547b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/b/63b2178edfe1563a56bf3a6d63e59873.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/7/eb7b5e73c306a57a5ab338255b7fc045.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["category","mathematics"],["conjugation","group_theory"],["band","algebra"],["list","computing"],["map","higher-order_function"],["fold","higher-order_function"]],"members":["fold","map","band","conjugation","category","list","set"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Set_(mathematics)","Monoid","Character_string","Identity_element","Empty_string","String_concatenation","Isomorphic","Universal_property","Free_object","Category_(mathematics)","Natural_numbers","Kleene_star","Formal_language","Automata_theory","Regular_language","Monoid_homomorphism","Circular_shift","Conjugation_(group_theory)","Free_group","Kleene_star","Cardinality","Prefix_code","Monoid_morphism","Hilbert's_basis_theorem","Identity_map","Monoid","Composition_of_functions","Morphism","Split_epimorphism","Idempotent","Semilattice","Band_(algebra)","Sturmian_word","Multiset","Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic","Prime_number","Free_partially_commutative_monoid","Combinatorics","Parallel_computing","Computer_science","List_(computing)","Monoid_homomorphism","Map_(higher-order_function)","Fold_(higher-order_function)","MapReduce","String_operations"]}
