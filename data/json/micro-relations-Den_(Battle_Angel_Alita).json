{"cursor":"56898","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Battle Angel Alita' manga series features a cast of characters designed by\nYukito Kishiro. The series takes place around the city of Scrapyard where\nresidents, of whom many are heavily modified by cybernetics to better cope with\nthe hard life, are forced to make a living.\n\nThe series focuses on Alita, the protagonist and title character, a young cyborg\nwith amnesia struggling to uncover her forgotten past through the only thing she\nremembers from it: fighting. Early on in the story, Daisuke Ido, a bounty-\nhunting cybernetic doctor who finds and revives Alita plays a major role as\nwell, but midway through the manga he becomes marginalized as focus begins to\nincreasingly shift to Desty Nova, an eccentric nanotechnology scientist who has\nfled from Tiphares. Nova is the mastermind behind many of the enemies and trials\nthat Alita faces, but does not make an actual appearance until more than two\nyears into the story, although he is alluded to early on. Finally, Kaos, Desty\nNova's son, a frail and troubled radio DJ with psychometric powers, also begins\nto play a crucial role after he comes in contact with Alita. He broadcasts his\npopular radio show from the wastelands outside the Scrapyard, staying away from\nthe increasing conflict between Tiphares and the rebel army Barjack.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Den_(Battle_Angel_Alita)","recorded":1362904080,"links":12,"instances":["paranormal","song","battle_angel_alita"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Battle Angel characters|","Lists of anime and manga characters|Battle Angel"],"headings":["Protagonist","Antagonists","Supporting characters","Other","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["psychometry","paranormal"],["hunter-warrior","battle_angel_alita"],["hunter-warrior","battle_angel_alita"],["astronomy","song"],["psychometry","paranormal"],["hunter-warrior","battle_angel_alita#clive_lee"],["vector","battle_angel_alita"]],"members":["psychometry","astronomy","vector"],"related":["Battle_Angel_Alita","Yukito_Kishiro","Alita","Protagonist","Bounty_hunter","Nanotechnology","Psychometry_(paranormal)","Barjack","Yukito_Kishiro","Martial_art","Panzer_Kunst","Motorball","Hunter-warrior_(Battle_Angel_Alita)","Bounty_hunter","Manga","Yukito_Kishiro","Battle_Angel_OVA","Cybernetics","Physician","Cyborgs","Alita","Hunter-warrior_(Battle_Angel_Alita)","Cyborgs","Karma","Nanomachines","Flan","Astronomy_(song)","Blue_Ã–yster_Cult","Battle_Angel_Alita","Abdomen","Infrared","Psychometry_(paranormal)","Zapan","Vector_(Battle_Angel_Alita)","Zapan","Motorball","Battle_Angel_OVA","Battle_Angel_OVA","Jashugan","Koyomi_K.","Manga","Motorball","Battle_Angel_Alita","Manga","Death_Race_2000","Manga","Railway_gun","Bounty_hunter","Criminal_justice","Police","Yukito_Kishiro","Martial_arts","Bloodhound"]}
