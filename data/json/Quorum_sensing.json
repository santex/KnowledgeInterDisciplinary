{"cursor":"33645","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Quorum sensing' is a system of stimulus and response correlated to population\ndensity. Many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene\nexpression according to the density of their local population. In similar\nfashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest. In\naddition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several\nuseful applications for computing and robotics.\n\nQuorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any decentralized\nsystem, as long as individual components have: (a) a means of assessing the\nnumber of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a\nthreshold number of components is detected.\n","linknr":661,"url":"Quorum_sensing","recorded":1362511375,"links":44,"instances":["biology","biochemistry","honeybee","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.nsls.bnl.gov/newsroom/science/2002/pdfs/2002-09-Hughson.pdf","http://www.nsls.bnl.gov/newsroom/science/2002/pdfs/2002-09-Hughson.pdf","http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf","http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf","http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf","http://www.media.mit.edu/resenv/classes/MAS965/readings/SwarmBots.pdf"],"categories":["Bacteriology","Cell communication","Complex systems theory","Behavior","Superorganisms"],"headings":["Bacteria","Archaea","Quorum quenching","Social insects","Computing and robotics","See also","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Bacterial_Quorum_Sensing_by_CarolineDahl.jpg/220px-Bacterial_Quorum_Sensing_by_CarolineDahl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg/140px-Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"],["mutualism","biology"],["homology","biology#orthology"],["homology","biology"],["swarming","honeybee"]],"members":["mutualism","receptor","swarming","homology","transcription"],"related":["Bacteria","Gene_expression","Social_insects","Decentralized_system","Bacteria","Species","Molecules","Cell_signaling","Oligopeptides","Gram-positive_bacteria","N-Acyl_Homoserine_Lactone","Gram-negative_bacteria","Autoinducer","Autoinducer-2","Signaling_molecules","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Inducer","Transcription_(genetics)","Genes","Diffusion","Positive_feedback","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Luciferase","Mutualism_(biology)","Symbiont","Photophore","Hawaiian_bobtail_squid","Plankton","Luciferase","Bioluminescence","AI-2","Operon","ABC_transporter","Kinase","Dihydroxyacetone_phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","Glucose","Catabolite_repression","AI-2","Biofilms","Swarming_motility","Exopolysaccharide","Immune_system","Biofilm","Disease","Gene_regulation","Bacteria","Anaerobiosis","Organism","Garlic","Gammaproteobacterium","Bacterial_small_RNA","Crystal_structure","X-ray_crystallography","AI-2","Biomolecules","Boron","Periplasmic_space","Binding_protein","Lactonase","Gram-negative","Proteobacteria","Phylogeny","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Gammaproteobacteria","Homology_(biology)","Decentralized_system","Tandem_running","Honey_bee","Swarming_(honeybee)","Waggle_dance","Cell_signaling","Collective_behavior","Microbial_intelligence","Royal_Society_of_Chemistry","Bonnie_Bassler"]}
