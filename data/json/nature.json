For other uses, see [[Nature\n:(disambiguation)]] and [[Natural (disambiguation)]].\n, Australia]] in the Swiss Alps]] strikes during the eruption of the Galunggung\nvolcano, West Java, in 1982.]]\n\n'Nature', in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the 'natural world',\n'physical world', or 'material world'. \"Nature\" refers to the phenomena of the\nphysical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the\nsubatomic to the cosmic.\n\nThe word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or \"essential qualities,\ninnate disposition\", and in ancient times, literally meant \"birth\".<ref name=\"etymonline-\nnature\"></ref> Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word [[physis]]\n(φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants,\nanimals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.<ref>A\nuseful though somewhat erratically presented account of the pre-Socratic use of\nthe concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard The Greek Concept of Nature,\nSUNY Press, 2006. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in\nHomer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally,\nthese senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word\nnature is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. Presocratic Tradition from\nParmenides to Democritus (volume 2 of his History of Greek Philosophy),\nCambridge UP, 1965.</ref><ref>The first known use of physis was by Homer in\nreference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον\nἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι 'φύσιν' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying,\nArgeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed\nme its 'nature'.) [[Odyssey]] 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt\nwith thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's [http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux\nGreek Lexicon].) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see\nearlier note.</ref> The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is\none of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core\napplications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily\ngained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern\nscientific method in the last several centuries.<ref>Isaac Newton's Philosophiae\nNaturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), for example, is translated \"Mathematical\nPrinciples of Natural Philosophy\", and reflects the then-current use of the\nwords \"natural philosophy\", akin to \"systematic study of nature\"</ref><ref>The\netymology of the word \"physical\" shows its use as a synonym for \"natural\" in\nabout the mid-15th century: </ref>\n\nWithin the various uses of the word today, \"nature\" often refers to geology and\nwildlife. Nature may refer to the general realm of various types of living\nplants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate\nobjects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own\naccord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy\nof which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the \"natural\nenvironment\" or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general\nthose things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or\nwhich persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and\nhuman interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified\nas, for example, \"human nature\" or \"the whole of nature\". This more traditional\nconcept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction\nbetween the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as\nthat which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.\nDepending on the particular context, the term \"natural\" might also be\ndistinguished from the , the supernatural, or synthetic.\n",
