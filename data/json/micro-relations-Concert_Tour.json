The\nperformance may be by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by\na musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, a choir, or a musical band. Concerts\nare held in a wide variety and size of settings, from private houses and small\nnightclubs, dedicated concert halls, entertainment centres and parks to large\nmultipurpose buildings, and even sports stadiums. Indoor concerts held in the\nlargest venues are sometimes called \"arena concerts\" or \"amphitheatre concerts\".\nRegardless of the venue, musicians usually perform on a stage. Concerts often\nrequire live event support with professional audio equipment. Before recorded\nmusic, concerts would provide the only opportunity one would generally have to\nhear musicians play. Informal names for a concert include \"show\" and \"gig\".\n","linknr":281,"url":"Concert_Tour","recorded":1362566218,"links":58,"instances":["australia","entertainer","tour","theatre","band","musical_performance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concerts|","Music performance"],"headings":["Types of concert","Revenue","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Classical_spectacular10.jpg/220px-Classical_spectacular10.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Bernardo_Strozzi_Kontsert.jpg/220px-Bernardo_Strozzi_Kontsert.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/VogueBlondAmbitionUndergGround.jpg/220px-VogueBlondAmbitionUndergGround.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/ECMB-2011GSUsher5bByVernBarber.jpg/220px-ECMB-2011GSUsher5bByVernBarber.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Jerry-Mickey_at_Red_Rocks_taken_08-11-87.jpg/220px-Jerry-Mickey_at_Red_Rocks_taken_08-11-87.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/U2_360_Zooropa_Oakland.jpg/220px-U2_360_Zooropa_Oakland.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stage","theatre"],["gig","musical_performance"],["madonna","entertainer"],["kiss","band"],["soundwave_festival","australia"],["bad","tour"],["madonna","entertainer"]],"members":["soundwave_festival","madonna","bad","stage","kiss","gig"],"related":["Rod_Laver_Arena","Melbourne","Australia","Performance","Music","Audience","Musician","Recital","Musical_ensemble","Orchestra","Choir","Musical_band","House","Nightclub","Concert_hall","Entertainment_centre","Parks","Stadium","Amphitheatre","Stage_(theatre)","Live_event_support","Professional_audio","Gig_(musical_performance)","Kadrioru","Musical_genre","Jazz","Bluegrass_music","Stage_lighting","Special_effect","Theatrical_smoke_and_fog","Pyrotechnics","Costumes","Singer","Accompaniment","Dancing","Moshing","The_Flaming_Lips","Cher","Alice_Cooper","Daft_Punk","Lady_Gaga","Madonna_(entertainer)","Pink_Floyd","Jean_Michel_Jarre","Sarah_Brightman","Kiss_(band)","Eau_Claire_Municipal_Band","Eau_Claire,_Wisconsin","Festivals","Jam_Cruise","Mayan_Holidaze","Big_Day_Out","Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival","Falls_Festival","Glastonbury_Festival","Newport_Jazz_Festival","Oxegen","Parachute_Music_Festival","Rock_In_Rio","Rockwave_Festival","Salzburg_Festival","Summer_Sonic_Festival","Woodstock_Festival","Soundwave_festival_(australia)","Warped_Tour","Concert_tour","Red_Rocks_Amphitheater","Michael_Jackson","Bad_(tour)","Performing_arts_presenters","Admission_to_an_event_or_establishment","Benefit_concert","Charitable_organization","Vans","AT&T_Inc.","Warped_Tour","U2_360_Tour","The_Rolling_Stones","A_Bigger_Bang_Tour","Sticky_&_Sweet_Tour","Madonna_(entertainer)","Benefit_concert","Guerrilla_gig","House_concert","List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours","Live_PA","Performing_arts_presenters","Rave","Recorded_live_track","Rehearsal","Rock_concert","Rock_festival","Smoking_concerts"]}
