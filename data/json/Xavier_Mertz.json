He took part in the Far Eastern Party, a\n1912â13 component of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which claimed his\nlife. The Mertz Glacier is named after him.\n\nThe son of a textile machinery manufacturer, Mertz studied patent law at the\nUniversity of Bern, and science at the University of Lausanne, specialising in\nglacier and mountain formations. While a student, Mertz became active as a\nskier, competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many\nof the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist\nand explorer Douglas Mawson for his Australasian Antarctic Expedition. He was\ninitially employed as a ski instructor, but in Antarctica Mertz instead joined\nBelgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis in the care of the expedition's Greenland Huskies.\n\nIn the summer of 1912â13, Mertz and Ninnis were chosen by Mawson to accompany\nhim on the Far Eastern Party, using the dogs to push rapidly from the\nexpedition's base in AdÃ©lie Land towards Victoria Land. After Ninnis and a\nsledge carrying most of the food disappeared down a crevasse from the hut, Mertz\nand Mawson headed back west, gradually using the dogs to supplement their\nremaining food stocks. About from safety, Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on\nalone. The cause of Mertz's death has never been firmly established; the\ncommonly accepted theory is hypervitaminosis A (an excessive intake of vitamin\nA) from consuming the livers of the Huskies. Counter-theories suggest he may\nhave died from cold exposure, a change in diet, or psychological stresses.\n","linknr":423,"url":"Xavier_Mertz","recorded":1362511272,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1883 births","1913 deaths","Swiss explorers","Swiss Protestants","Deaths by poisoning","Antarctic expedition deaths","Australasian Antarctic Expedition"],"headings":["Early life","Antarctic","Legacy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Xavier_Mertz.jpg/180px-Xavier_Mertz.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Xavier_Mertz_signature.png/150px-Xavier_Mertz_signature.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Mertz_exploring_ice_ravines.jpg/170px-Mertz_exploring_ice_ravines.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Mertz_on_the_ice_cliff.jpg/220px-Mertz_on_the_ice_cliff.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Final_photograph_of_the_Far_Eastern_party.jpg/220px-Final_photograph_of_the_Far_Eastern_party.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Memorial_cross_for_Mertz_and_Ninnis.jpg/170px-Memorial_cross_for_Mertz_and_Ninnis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Basel","George_V_Land","Hypervitaminosis_A","Far_Eastern_Party","Australasian_Antarctic_Expedition","Basel","Far_Eastern_Party","Australasian_Antarctic_Expedition","Mertz_Glacier","Patent","University_of_Bern","University_of_Lausanne","Alps","Douglas_Mawson","Belgrave_Edward_Sutton_Ninnis","Greenland_Dog","Adélie_Land","Victoria_Land","Crevasse","Hypervitaminosis_A","Vitamin_A","Basel","University_of_Bern","Patent","Bern","Cross-country_skiing","Ski_jumping","Alps","Mont_Blanc","First_ascent","Doctor_of_Laws","University_of_Lausanne","Douglas_Mawson","Ernest_Shackleton","Nimrod_Expedition","Greenland_Dog","SY_Aurora","Hobart","Belgrave_Edward_Sutton_Ninnis","Royal_Fusiliers","John_King_Davis","Macquarie_Island","Wireless","Cape_Denison","Adélie_Land","Charles_Laseron","Herbert_Murphy","Manhauling","Commonwealth_Bay","Victoria_Land","Glacier","Crevasse","Waterproofing","Mertz_Glacier","Telegram","Colitis","John_Burton_Cleland","University_of_Adelaide","Major_depressive_disorder","Dysentery","Hypervitaminosis_A","Vitamin_A","Phillip_Law","Australian_National_Antarctic_Research_Expeditions","Vegetarian","Heroic_Age_of_Antarctic_Exploration","Basel","George_V_Land"]}
