A solid state smart leaf sensor technology was\ndeveloped by the University of Colorado at Boulder for NASA in 2007. It was\ndesigned to help monitor and control agricultural water\ndemand. http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2007/244.html AgriHouse\nreceived a National Science Foundation (NSF) STTR grant in conjunction with the\nUniversity of Colorado to further develop the solid state leaf sensor technology\nfor precision irrigation control in 2007.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Leaf_sensor","recorded":1362482874,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nsf.gov/news/newsletter/jul_07/NSF_Current_July_2007.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/news/newsletter/jul_07/NSF_Current_July_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Sensors","Plant physiology"],"headings":["Precision monitoring","See also","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/SG-1000_rev5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/16px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg/16px-Wikibooks-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plant_physiology","US_patent","University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder","NASA","National_Science_Foundation","Turgidity","Aeroponics","Agriculture","Hydroponics","Irrigation"]}
