{"cursor":"4712","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Statistics in basketball are kept to evaluate a player or a team's performance.\n\nSome statistics are\n* 'GP', 'GS': games played, games started\n* 'PTS': points\n* 'FGM', 'FGA', 'FG%': field goals made, attempted and percentage\n* 'FTM', 'FTA', 'FT%': free throws made, attempted and percentage\n* '3FGM', '3FGA', '3FG%': three-point field goals made, attempted and percentage\n* 'REB', 'OREB', 'DREB': rebounds, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds\n* 'AST': assists\n* 'STL': steals\n* 'BLK': blocks\n* 'TO': turnovers\n* 'EFF': efficiency: NBA's efficiency rating: (PTS + REB + AST + STL + BLK - FG\n  missed - FT missed - TO)\n* 'PF': personal fouls\n* 'MIN': minutes\n* 'AST/TO': assist to turnover ratio\n* 'PER': Player Efficiency Rating: John Hollinger's Player Efficiency Rating\n* 'PIR': Performance Index Rating: Euroleague's and Eurocup's Performance Index\n  Rating: (Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks + Fouls Drawn) -\n  (Missed Field Goals + Missed Free Throws + Turnovers + Shots Rejected + Fouls\n  Committed)\n\n\nAverages per game are denoted by '*PG' (PPG, RPG, APG, SPG etc.). Sometime the\nplayers statistics are divided by minutes played and multiplied by 48 minutes\n(had he played the entire game), denoted by '* per 48 min.'.\n\nA player who makes double digits in a game in any two of the PTS, REB, AST, STL,\nand BLK statistics is said to make a double double; in three statistics, a\ntriple double; in four statistics, a quadruple double. A quadruple double is\nextremely rare (and has only occurred four times in the NBA). There is also a\n5x5, when a player records at least a 5 in each of the 5 statistics.\n\nThe NBA also posts to the statistics section of its Web site a simple composite\nefficiency statistic, denoted EFF and derived by the formula, ((Points +\nRebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks) - ((Field Goals Att. - Field Goals Made) +\n(Free Throws Att. - Free Throws Made) + Turnovers)). While conveniently\ndistilling most of a players key statistics in one numerical score, the formula\nis not highly regarded by the statistics community, with the alternative Player\nEfficiency Rating developed by ESPN basketball statistician John Hollinger being\nmore widely used to compare the overall efficiency of players.\n\nLovers of basketball statistics often enjoy comparing dozens of more arcane\nstatistics, many of which show how well a player works within the team context.\nContinually updated databases hosted by Web sites can generate sortable charts\nand graphs in an interactive fashion. A few clicks can show, for example, who\namong shooting guards gets blocked the most per shot attempt, or who leads a\nparticular team in any given category.\n\nIn fantasy basketball, statistics are used in a formula as the measurement of a\nplayer's performance.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Basketball_statistics","recorded":1375078886,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Starting_lineup","/wiki/Point_(basketball)","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Field_goal_percentage","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Assist_(basketball)","/wiki/Steal_(basketball)","/wiki/Block_(basketball)","/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)","/wiki/Efficiency_(basketball)","/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)","/wiki/Player_Efficiency_Rating","/wiki/John_Hollinger","/wiki/Performance_Index_Rating","/wiki/Euroleague","/wiki/Eurocup_Basketball","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Double-double","/wiki/Triple_double","/wiki/Quadruple_double","/wiki/NBA","/wiki/Efficiency_(basketball)","/wiki/Player_Efficiency_Rating","/wiki/John_Hollinger","/wiki/Fantasy_basketball","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Player_Efficiency_Rating","/wiki/Efficiency_(basketball)","/wiki/Similarity_score","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=edit&section=2","http://knickerblogger.net/a-laymans-guide-to-advanced-nba-statistics/","http://www.basketball-reference.com","http://www.nba.com/statistics/","http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/stats","/wiki/Template:Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Template_talk:Basketball_statistics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Basketball_statistics&action=edit","/wiki/Games_played","/wiki/Starting_lineup","/wiki/Minute_(basketball)","/wiki/Point_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)","/wiki/Assist_(basketball)","/wiki/Steal_(basketball)","/wiki/Block_(basketball)","/wiki/Foul_(basketball)","/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Field_goal_percentage","/wiki/Three-point_field_goal","/wiki/Free_throw","/wiki/Double_(basketball)","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Double-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Triple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Quadruple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Quintuple-double","/wiki/Double_(basketball)#Five-by-five","/wiki/Offense_efficiency_rating","/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating","/wiki/Offensive_rating","/wiki/Defensive_rating","/wiki/True_shooting_percentage","/wiki/Rebound_rate","/wiki/Performance_Index_Rating","/wiki/Efficiency_(basketball)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&oldid=513277855","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Basketball_statistics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Basketball+statistics&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Basketball+statistics","/wiki/Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Talk:Basketball_statistics","#","/wiki/Basketball_statistics","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Basketball_statistics","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&oldid=513277855","/w/index.php?title=Basketball_statistics&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4867754","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Basketball_statistics&id=513277855","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Basketball+statistics","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Basketball+statistics&oldid=513277855&wr
