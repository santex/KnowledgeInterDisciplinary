While the practice of wine tasting is as\nancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become\nestablished from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters\n(such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving formal\nterminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and\ngeneral characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use\nsimilar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more\ngeneral, personal appreciation.
