{"cursor":"21240","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'mass density' or 'density' of a material is its mass per unit volume. The\nsymbol most often used for density is 'Ï' (the lower case Greek letter rho).\nMathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume:\n\n: \\rho = \\frac{m}{V},\n\nwhere Ï is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for\ninstance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is also defined as\nits weight per unit volume, although this quantity is more properly\ncalled specific weight.\n\nDifferent materials usually have different densities, so density is an important\nconcept regarding buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium and iridium are the\ndensest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure but\nnot the densest materials.\n\nLess dense fluids float on more dense fluids if they do not mix. This concept\ncan be extended, with some care, to less dense solids floating on more dense\nfluids. If the average density (including any air below the waterline) of an\nobject is less than water it will float in water and if it is more than water's\nit will sink in water.\n\nIn some cases density is expressed as the dimensionless quantities specific\ngravity or relative density, in which case it is expressed in multiples of the\ndensity of some other standard material, usually water or air/gas. (For example,\na specific gravity less than one means that the substance floats in water.)\n\nThe mass density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. (The\nvariance is typically small for solids and liquids and much greater for gasses.)\nIncreasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and\ntherefore increase its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with\nsome exceptions) decreases its density by increasing the volume of that\nsubstance. In most materials, heating the bottom of a fluid results in\nconvection of the heat from bottom to top of the fluid due to the decrease of\nthe density of the heated fluid. This causes it to rise relative to more dense\nunheated material.\n\nThe reciprocal of the density of a substance is called its specific volume, a\nrepresentation commonly used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property\nin that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density;\nrather it increases its mass.\n","linknr":445,"url":"densities","recorded":1362559355,"links":100,"instances":["word","chemistry","chemistry","oceanography","fluid","element","density","unit","mass","mass","unit","letter","material"],"pdf":["http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~jaj/Ast162/lectures/notesWL22.pdf","http://www.adamequipment.com/education/Documents/EdExp1.pdf"],"categories":["Density|","Physical quantities"],"headings":["History","Measurement of density","Changes of density","Density of solutions","Densities","Other common units","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/c/9/7c9de596fb27edd3d3be7bfc69ac0f9e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/0/b/d0bfed76cc3fc696d4334fd0dd9c618c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/e/f7ef784b6775b51c994a8b8dc3b968e5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/a/9ea345044d0b54aae73c0986be7ff412.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/0/4805f4a566aa747fa087e9c72a2e96a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/c/c/bccfc7022dfb945174d9bcebad2297bb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/6/e16c70ec7265d34e42337501ca0a90cf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/1/6918fcccc7c449475334b0f7790ce831.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Air_density_vs_temperature.jpg/400px-Air_density_vs_temperature.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rho","letter"],["displacement","fluid"],["eureka","word"],["homogeneous","chemistry"],["bar","unit"],["mass_concentration","chemistry"],["atmosphere","unit"],["cork","material"],["mercury","element"],["pound","mass"],["slug","mass"],["spice","oceanography"],["orders_of_magnitude","density"]],"members":["eureka","homogeneous","mass_concentration","spice","displacement","mercury","orders_of_magnitude","bar","slug","pound","atmosphere","rho","cork"],"related":["Mass","Volume","Rho_(letter)","Weight","Volume","Specific_weight","Buoyancy","Packaging","Osmium","Iridium","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Dimensionless","Specific_gravity","Relative_density","Convection","Specific_volume","Thermodynamics","Intensive_property","Archimedes","Hiero_II_of_Syracuse","Goldsmith","Gold","Wreath","Alloy","Displacement_(fluid)","Eureka_(word)","Vitruvius","De_architectura","SI","Kilogram","Cubic_metre","Cgs","Gram","Cubic_centimetre","US_customary_units","Homogeneous_(chemistry)","Weighing_scale","Hydrometer","Dasymeter","Hydrostatic_weighing","Bulk_density","Pressure","Temperature","Water","Silicon","Compressibility","Bar_(unit)","Thermal_expansivity","Kelvin","Celsius","Ideal_gas","Molar_mass","Gas_constant","Absolute_temperature","Solution","Mass_concentration_(chemistry)","Volume_concentration","Atmosphere_(unit)","Supercooling","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Air","Aerographite","Metallic_microlattice","Aerogel","Styrofoam","Liquid_hydrogen","Cork_(material)","Lithium","Wood","Potassium","Sodium","Ice","Water","Water","Plastics","Polypropylene","PETE","PVC","Tetrachloroethene","Magnesium","Beryllium","Glycerol","Silicon","Aluminium","Diiodomethane","Diamond","Titanium","Selenium","Vanadium","Antimony","Zinc","Chromium","Manganese","Tin","Iron","Niobium","Cadmium","Cobalt","Nickel","Copper","Bismuth","Molybdenum","Silver","Lead","Thorium","Rhodium","Mercury_(element)","Tantalum","Uranium","Tungsten","Gold","Plutonium","Platinum","Iridium","Osmium","Interstellar_medium","Earth","Inner_Core","Earth","Sun","White_dwarf","Ohio_State_University","Neutron_star","Atomic_nuclei","Black_hole","Schwarzschild_radius","Black_hole","SI","Kilogram","Cubic_metre","Kilogram","Litre","Gram","Millilitre","Metric_ton","Water","Solid","Liquid","US_customary_units","Avoirdupois_ounce","Cubic_inch","Pound_(mass)","Cubic_foot","Cubic_yard","US_liquid_gallon","Bushel","Slug_(mass)","Imperial_units","Precious_metal","Troy_weight","List_of_elements_by_density","Charge_density","Buoyancy","Bulk_density","Dord","Energy_density","Lighter_than_air","Number_density","Orthobaric_density","Specific_weight","Spice_(oceanography)","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Orders_of_magnitude_(density)","Girolami_method"]}
