{"cursor":"33652","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\ns in a cell nucleus.]]\n\nThe 'cell cycle', or 'cell-division cycle', is the series of events that take\nplace in a cell leading to its division and duplication (replication). In cells\nwithout a nucleus (prokaryotic), the cell cycle occurs via a process termed\nbinary fission. In cells with a nucleus (eukaryotes), the cell cycle can be\ndivided in two periods: interphaseâduring which the cell grows, accumulating\nnutrients needed for mitosis and duplicating its DNAâand the mitotic (M) phase,\nduring which the cell splits itself into two distinct cells, often called\n\"daughter cells\" and the final phase, cytokinesis, where the new cell is\ncompletely divided. The cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-\ncelled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by\nwhich hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed.\n","linknr":614,"url":"Cell_cycle","recorded":1362512960,"links":57,"instances":["genetics","gene","biology","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell cycle|*","Cellular processes","Cellular senescence"],"headings":["Phases","Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle","Checkpoints","Role in tumor formation","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Major_events_in_mitosis.svg/350px-Major_events_in_mitosis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Cell_Cycle_2-2.svg/300px-Cell_Cycle_2-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Paul_Nurse_portrait.jpg/150px-Paul_Nurse_portrait.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Signal_transduction_pathways.svg/300px-Signal_transduction_pathways.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["conservation","genetics"],["p27","gene"],["p57","gene"]],"members":["conservation","p57","cell","p27"],"related":["Cell_nucleus","Cell_(biology)","Prokaryotic","Binary_fission","Eukaryotes","Interphase","DNA_replication","Fertilized_egg","Hair","Skin","Blood_cell","G1_phase","S_phase","G2_phase","Interphase","Mitosis","Chromosomes","Cytokinesis","Cytoplasm","G0_phase","Mitosis","Mitosis","G1_phase","G2_phase","S_phase","G0_phase","G0_phase","Interphase","G1_phase","DNA","S_phase","DNA_replication","G2_phase","Cell_division","Mitosis","Interphase","G0_phase","Eukaryote","Neuron","Cellular_differentiation","G1_phase","S_phase","DNA","Chromosome","Chromatid","Ploidy","Mitotic_phase","M_phase","Karyokinesis","Prophase","Metaphase","Anaphase","Telophase","Cytokinesis","Eukaryotic","Chromosome","Cell_nucleus","Cytokinesis","Cytoplasm","Organelle","Cell_membrane","Cell_division","Eukaryote","Animal","Nuclear_envelope","Fungi","Yeast","Cell_nucleus","Prokaryote","Binary_fission","Chromosomes","Sister_chromatids","Cytokinesis","Endoreplication","Fungus","Slime_mould","Drosophila_melanogaster","Apoptosis","Mutation","Cancer","Cyclin","Cyclin-dependent_kinase","Leland_H._Hartwell","R._Timothy_Hunt","Paul_M._Nurse","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Conservation_(genetics)","Heterodimer","Phosphorylation","Cyclin-CDK","Transcription_factor","DNA_replication","Ubiquitination","Proteasome","Pre-replication_complex","Origin_of_replication","Genome","Gene_copy_number","Mitosis","Mitotic_spindle","Ubiquitin_ligase","Anaphase-promoting_complex","Kinetochore","Cyclin_D","Growth_factor","Cyclin-dependent_kinase_4","Retinoblastoma","Retinoblastoma_protein","E2F","Cyclin_E","Cyclin_A","DNA_polymerase","Thymidine_kinase","Cyclin-dependent_kinase_2","Cyclin_B","Nuclear_envelope","Prophase","Tumor","Tumor_suppressor","P21","P27_(gene)","P57_(gene)","P53","TGF_β","P16INK4a","P19ARF","Cdc25","Transcription_factors","G1_phase","S_phase","Phosphorylation","Cdk1","Midblastula_transition","MRNA","Cell_cycle_checkpoint","DNA_damage","Restriction_point","Postreplication_checkpoint","P53","Tumor","Retinoblastoma_protein","P53","Chemotherapy","Radiotherapy","Debulking","Synchronous_culture"]}
