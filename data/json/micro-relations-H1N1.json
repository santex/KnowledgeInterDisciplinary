{"cursor":"22740","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Influenza A (H1N1) virus' is the subtype of influenza A virus that was the most\ncommon cause of human influenza (flu) in 2009. Some strains of H1N1 are endemic\nin humans and cause a small fraction of all influenza-like illness and a small\nfraction of all seasonal influenza. H1N1 strains caused a small percentage of\nall human flu infections in 2004â2005. Other strains of H1N1 are\nendemic in pigs (swine influenza) and in birds (avian influenza).\n\nIn June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the new strain of swine-\norigin H1N1 as a pandemic. This strain is often called 'swine flu' by the public\nmedia. This novel virus spread worldwide and had caused about 17,000 deaths by\nthe start of 2010. On August 10, 2010, the World Health Organization declared\nthe H1N1 influenza pandemic over, saying worldwide flu activity had returned to\ntypical seasonal patterns.\n\nAs of 26 April 2011, an H1N1 pandemic preparedness alert has been issued by the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) for the Americas. The affected areas\nhave included the Chihuahua region of Mexico where its severity and work load\nhave been high. It is reported by the aforementioned Recombinomics source that\nthe current vaccine (California/7/2009) for H1N1 influenza lost its\neffectiveness in 2011. This point is all the more significant since it is the\ncurrent virus target for the northern hemisphere's flu vaccine, and is the\nintended choice for the southern hemisphere.\n","linknr":561,"url":"H1N1","recorded":1362501617,"links":52,"instances":["biology","influenza","biology"],"pdf":["http://publicmind.fdu.edu/h1n1/release.pdf"],"categories":["Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|1N1"],"headings":["Swine influenza","Notable incidents","In pregnancy","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/H1N1_navbox.jpg/160px-H1N1_navbox.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/AntigenicShift_HiRes_vector.svg/200px-AntigenicShift_HiRes_vector.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/40px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["strain","biology"],["hybrid","biology"],["hemagglutinin","influenza"]],"members":["strain","hemagglutinin","hybrid"],"related":["Influenza_A_virus","Influenza","Human_influenza","Influenza-like_illness","Seasonal_influenza","Swine_influenza","Avian_influenza","World_Health_Organization","Pandemic_H1N1/09_virus","2009_flu_pandemic","World_Health_Organization","H1N2","H3N1","H3N2","H2N3","Zoonosis","Fever","Sore_throat","Headache","1918_flu_pandemic","Strain_(biology)","Avian_influenza","Virus","Infection","Disease","Pandemic","History","Cytokine_storm","H5N1","Avian_influenza","Immune_system","Cytokine","Lung","Leukocyte","Spain","Europe","World_War_I","Epidemic","Antigenic_drift","Influenza_vaccine","2009_flu_pandemic","2009_flu_pandemic_virus","Hybrid_(biology)","Reassortment","Human_influenza","Swine_influenza","Hemagglutinin_(influenza)","Neuraminidase","Matrix_protein","Influenza-like_illness","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","WHO","Hong_Kong_flu","Barack_Obama","National_emergency","Fairleigh_Dickinson_University","Pulmonary_embolism","Andrew_Miller_MD","T_helper","Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome","Oseltamivir","Zanamivir","Amantidine","Rimantidine","Teratogenic","Embryotoxic","Institute_of_Medicine","Department_of_Health,_Education_and_Welfare","Richard_Neustadt","Harvey_V._Fineberg","1976_swine_flu"]}
