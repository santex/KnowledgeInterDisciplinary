It is the unconsolidated or loose covering of fine rock\nparticles that covers the surface of the earth. Birkeland,\nPeter W. Soils and Geomorphology. 3rd edition. New York: Oxford University\nPress, 1999. Soil is the end product of the influence of the climate\n(temperature, precipitation), relief (slope), organisms (flora and fauna),\nparent materials (original minerals), and time. In engineering terms, soil is\nreferred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid\ngeology'. In horticulture, the terms 'soil' is defined as the layer that\ncontains organic material that influences and has been influenced by plant roots\nand may range in depth from centimetres to many metres.\n\nSoil is composed of particles of broken rock (parent materials) which have been\naltered by physical, chemical and biological processes that include weathering\n(disintegration) with associated erosion (movement). Soil is altered from its\nparent material by the interactions between the lithosphere, hydrosphere,\natmosphere, and biosphere. It is a mixture of\nmineral and organic materials in the form of solids, gases and\nliquids. Voroney, R. P., 2006. \"The Soil Habitat\". In Soil Microbiology,\nEcology and Biochemistry, Eldor A.

Physical Edaphology Accordingly, soils are often treated as a three-\nstate system. Most soils have a density between 1 and 2\ng/cmÂ³.
