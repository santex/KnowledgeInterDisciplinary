Color\nmanagement helps to achieve the same appearance on all of these devices,\nprovided the devices are capable of delivering the needed color intensities.\n\nParts of this technology are implemented in the operating system (OS), helper\nlibraries, the application, and devices. A cross-platform view of color\nmanagement is the use of an ICC-compatible color management system. The\nInternational Color Consortium (ICC) is an industry consortium that has defined:\n\n* An open standard for a Color Matching Module (CMM) at the OS level\n* color profiles for: ** Devices, including devicelink-profiles that represent a\n  complete color transformation from source device to target device ** Working\n  spaces, the color spaces in which color data is meant to be manipulated\n\nThere are other approaches to color management besides using ICC profiles. This\nis partly due to history and partly because of other needs than the ICC standard\ncovers. The film and broadcasting industries make use of many of the same\nconcepts, but they more frequently rely on boutique solutions. The film\nindustry, for instance, often uses 3D LUTs (lookup table) to represent a\ncomplete color transformation. At the consumer level, color management currently\napplies more to still images than video, in which color management is still in\nits infancy. {{cite web\n | first = Mark last = Fairchild title = A Color Scientist Looks at Video url =\n | http://www.cis.rit.edu/fairchild/PDFs/PRO29.pdf accessdate = 2008-05-09\n}}\n","linknr":482,"url":"Rendering_intent","recorded":1362480477,"links":31,"instances":["photography","web_browser","image"],"pdf":["http://www.cis.rit.edu/fairchild/PDFs/PRO29.pdf","http://www.cis.rit.edu/fairchild/PDFs/PRO29.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_colspace.pdf","http://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_colspace.pdf"],"categories":["Color","Computer graphics"],"headings":["Hardware","Color profiles","Color transformation","Implementation","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clipping","photography"],["clipping","photography"],["burned","image"],["channel","digital_image#alpha_channel"],["safari","web_browser"]],"members":["clipping","channel","safari","burned"],"related":["Color","Image_scanner","Digital_camera","Computer_printer","LCD","Operating_system","International_Color_Consortium","ICC_profile","ICC_profile","3D_LUT","Lookup_table","Color_space","Gamma_correction","8-bit_color","Tristimulus_colorimeter","Spectrophotometer","Gamut","SRGB","TIFF","JPEG","Portable_Network_Graphics","Encapsulated_PostScript","Portable_Document_Format","Scalable_Vector_Graphics","ICC_Profile","International_Color_Consortium","Metadata","SRGB","Adobe_RGB_color_space","ProPhoto","Posterization","Clipping_(photography)","Color_space","International_Color_Consortium","CIELAB","CIEXYZ","Gamut","CMYK","Clipping_(photography)","Burned_(image)","Color_cast","ColorSync","LittleCMS","Apple_Inc.","Mac_OS","ColorSync","Windows_Vista","Microsoft","Windows_Color_System","Heidelberger_Druckmaschinen","X_Window_System","ICC_profile","Linux_color_management","Freedesktop.org","LittleCMS","TIFF","Photoshop","Color_channels","RGB","CMYK","Photoshop","Color_separation","ICC_profile","Web_browser","Safari_(web_browser)","Mozilla_Firefox","Google_Chrome","OS_X","Color_chart","Digital_printing","International_Color_Consortium","IT8","Linux_color_management"]}
