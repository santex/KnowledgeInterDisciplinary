{"cursor":"1474","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" that bind to multiple antigen molecules.]] An 'isotype' usually refers to any\n related proteins/genes from a particular gene family. In immunology, the\n \"immunoglobulin isotype\" refers to the genetic variations or differences in the\n constant regions of the heavy and light chains. In humans, there are five heavy\n chain isotypes and two light chain isotypes:\n\n* heavy chain ** Î± - IgA 1, 2 ** Î´ - IgD ** Î³ - IgG 1, 2, 3, 4 ** Îµ - IgE\n  ** Î¼ - IgM\n* light chain ** Îº ** Î»\n\nImmunoglobulin class switching can be used to change the class of the heavy\nchain, but not of the light chain.\n\nIsotypes are distinct forms of light or heavy chains which are present in all\nmembers of a species, encoded at distinct genetic loci. Kappa and lambda are\nisotypes of light chains. Delta (Î´), gamma:1 (Î³1), etc. are isotypes of heavy\nchains. All isotypes can be readily found in all normal sera.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Isotype_(immunology)","recorded":1362486727,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunology"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Mono-und-Polymere.svg/200px-Mono-und-Polymere.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/IgG_molecular_surface.jpg/55px-IgG_molecular_surface.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Gene_family","Immunology","Immunoglobulin","Heavy_chain","IgA","IgD","IgG","IgE","IgM","Light_chain","Immunoglobulin_class_switching","Idiotype","University_of_South_Carolina_School_of_Medicine","Southern_Illinois_University_Carbondale"]}
