{"cursor":"24938","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, New South Wales, Australia]] (Variscan orogeny)]] in the Barstow Formation\nnear Barstow, California]] A geological 'fold' occurs when one or a stack of\noriginally flat and planar surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or\ncurved as a result of permanent deformation. folds are those due to slumping of\nsedimentary material before it is lithified. Folds in rocks vary in size from\nmicroscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur singly as isolated\nfolds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes, on a variety of scales.\n\nFolds form under varied conditions of stress, hydrostatic pressure, pore\npressure, and temperature gradient, as evidenced by their presence in soft\nsediments, the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks, and even as primary flow\nstructures in some igneous rocks. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale\nconstitutes a fold belt, a common feature of orogenic zones. Folds are commonly\nformed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a result of\ndisplacement on a non-planar fault (fault bend fold), at the tip of a\npropagating fault (fault propagation fold), by differential compaction or due to\nthe effects of a high-level igneous intrusion e.g. above a laccolith.\n","linknr":442,"url":"Fold_(geology)","recorded":1362560624,"links":70,"instances":["geology","geology","physics","physics","geology","geometry","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/geology/bradley/bradley_pubs/Paleoslope_Maine_1998.pdf","http://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/geology/bradley/bradley_pubs/Paleoslope_Maine_1998.pdf","http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/abstracts/2003barcelona/short/83257.pdf","http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/abstracts/2003barcelona/short/83257.pdf"],"categories":["Structural
