From 1930 until his death 70 years later,\nQuine was continually affiliated with Harvard University in one way or another,\nfirst as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and\nset theory, and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several\nbooks in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard\nfrom 1956 to 1978. A recent poll conducted among analytic philosophers named\nQuine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.

Accessed 8 March 2010. He won\nthe first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993, for \"his systematical\nand penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are\nbased on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for\ntheories on knowledge and linguistic meaning.\" [http://www.kva.se/en/Prizes/Prize-winner-\npage/?laureateId=368 \"Prize winner page\"]. The Royal Swedish Academy of\nSciences. Kva.se. Retrieved 29 August 2010. In 1996 he was awarded the\nKyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for his \"outstanding contributions to the\nprogress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based\non keen insights in logic, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of\nlanguage.\"\n\nQuine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the\nmain proponent of the view that philosophy is not merely conceptual analysis.\nHis major writings include \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951), which attacked the\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic propositions and advocated a form of\nsemantic holism, and [[Word and Object]] (1960), which further developed these\npositions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis,\nadvocating a behaviorist theory of meaning. He also developed an influential\nnaturalized epistemology that tried to provide \"an improved scientific\nexplanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis\nof meager sensory input.\" [http://www.iep.utm.edu/quine-sc/\n\"Quine's Philosophy of Science\"]. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\nIep.utm.edu. 27 July 2009. Accessed 8 March 2010. He is also important in\nphilosophy of science for his \"systematic attempt to understand science from\nwithin the resources of science itself\" and for his conception\nof philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that\n\"philosophy of science is philosophy\nenough.\" [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2251091?cookieSet=1 \"Mr Strawson on\nLogical Theory\"]. WV Quine. Mind Vol. 62 No. 248. Oct. 1953. In philosophy\nof mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the\n\"QuineâPutnam indispensability thesis,\" an argument for the reality of\nmathematical entities.
