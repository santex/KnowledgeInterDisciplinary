Since opening in 1999,\nthe school has continued to grow and develop; gaining specialist schools status\nin 2005. Its headteacher is Michael McKenzie.\n\nThe school was opened to year 7 pupils on 9 September 1999. For the first year,\nthe school co-existed with the closing College of North East London and students\noccupied just one floor of the old block (built in the 1960s). The extension in\n2006 won a commendation at the Civic Trust Awards.\n\nThe expansion of Alexandra Park School has added a number of key elements: a\nmain teaching block for art and design technology, with general teaching spaces\nand a sixth form suite overlooking a courtyard; a science centre with four\nlaboratories; and a performance arts department, with a drama studio and music\npractice rooms. The scheme was designed and built to a fast timetable, and\nincorporated a number of \"green\" technologies.\n\nThe school draws its students from a wide geographical area that includes the\nrelatively prosperous wards in the borough as well as some of the most deprived\nwards in the country: over 40% of the total intake comes from the latter area.\nThe percentage of students speaking a language other than English is well above\naverage, as is the proportion entitled to a free school meal and the proportion\nof students who have a learning difficulty or disability. The school is\ninvolved in the National College for School Leadership, provides extended\nservice and holds the following awards: Investors in People, Sports Mark and\nHealthy Schools.\n\nAlexandra Park School offers students opportunities children may not get\nelsewhere; there are many exchange student programs running including France,\nSpain and South Africa. Due to their specialist school status, Alexandra Park\ncan offer students an Astronomy GCSE. This started in 2009 offered to year\nnine students.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Alexandra_Park_School","recorded":1364139598,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Alexandra_School_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Academy_(English_school)","/wiki/England","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Alexandra_Park_School&params=51.6021_N_-0.1369_E_region:GB_type:edu_dim:100","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Haringey","/wiki/Department_for_Education","http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=131758","http://www.education.gov.uk/cgi-bin/schools/performance/school.pl?urn=131758","/wiki/Ofsted","http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_providers/full/(urn)/131758","/wiki/Coeducational","http://www.apsch.org.uk","/wiki/Specialist_school","/wiki/Academy_(English_school)","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Haringey","/wiki/North_London","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Free_school_meal","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/National_College_for_School_Leadership","/wiki/Investors_in_People","/wiki/Sports_Mark","/wiki/Healthy_Schools","#Location","#ICT","#OFSTED_inspections","#Notable_alumni","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Alexandra_Park,_London","/wiki/Muswell_Hill","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=ICT_Register&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Teaching_and_learning&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Independent_learners&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=ILearning&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/ICT_(education)","/w/index.php?title=5_i_philosophy&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Independent_learners&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/OfSTED","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Nile_Ranger","/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.","/wiki/Azania_Stewart","/wiki/Great_Britain_women%27s_national_basketball_team","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://web.archive.org/web/20071230191835/http://www.nicholashare.co.uk/news/index.htm","http://www.nicholashare.co.uk/news/index.htm","http://web.archive.org/web/20071230191835/http://www.nicholashare.co.uk/news/index.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.ict-register.net/show-schools.php?region=L","http://www.ict-register.net/show-schools.php?region=L","/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Park_School&action=edit&section=6","http://www.alexandrapark.haringey.sch.uk","http://www.apsanet.org.uk","/wiki/Template:Schools_and_colleges_in_Haringey","/wiki/Template_talk:Schools_and_colleges_in_Haringey","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Schools_and_colleges_in_Haringey&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Haringey","/wiki/Primary_School","/wiki/Coleridge_Primary_School","/wiki/Lordship_Lane_Primary_School","/wiki/Secondary_school","/wiki/Fortismere_School","/wiki/Gladesmore_Community_School","/wiki/Greig_City_Academy","/wiki/Heartlands_High_School","/wiki/Highgate_Wood_Secondary_School","/wiki/Hornsey_Secondary_School_for_Girls","/wiki/The_John_Loughborough_School","/wiki/St_Thomas_More_RC_School_(London_Borough_of_Haringey)","/wiki/Woodside_High_School_(London)","/wiki/Special_school","/wiki/TreeHouse_School","/wiki/Independent_school_(UK)","/wiki/Channing_School_For_Girls","/wiki/Greek_Secondary_School_of_London","/wiki/Highgate_School","/wiki/Further_education","/wiki/The_College_of_Haringey,_Enfield_and_North_East_London","/wiki/Bruce_Castle_School","/wiki/Grove_House_School","/wik
