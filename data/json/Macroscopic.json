{"cursor":"2491","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'macroscopic scale' is the length scale on which objects or processes are of\na size that is measurable and observable.\n\nWhen applied to phenomena and abstract objects, the macroscopic scale describes\nexistence in the world as we perceive it, often in contrast to experiences\n(microscopy) or theories (microphysics, statistical physics) considering objects\nof geometric lengths smaller than one millimeter.\n\nA macroscopic view of a ball is just that: a ball. A microscopic view could\nreveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of puckered cracks and\nfissures (as viewed through a microscope) or, further down in scale, a\ncollection of molecules in a roughly spherical shape.\n\nIn classical mechanics, describing the movements of the above mentioned ball,\ncan be considered a mainly macroscopic theory; on the much smaller scale of\natoms and molecules, classical mechanics no longer applies and the movement of\nparticles is described by quantum mechanics. As another example, near the\nabsolute minimum of temperature, the BoseâEinstein condensate exhibits\nelementary quantum effects on macroscopic scale.\n\nThe term \"megascopic\" is a synonym. No word exists that specifically refers to\nfeatures commonly portrayed at reduced scales for better understanding, such as\ngeographic areas or astronomical objects. \"Macroscopic\" may also refer to a\n\"larger view\", namely a view available only from a large perspective. A\nmacroscopic position could be considered the \"big picture\".\n\nThe opposite to the macroscopic scale is the microscopic scale: objects smaller\nthan those that can easily be seen by the naked eye and that require a lens or\nmicroscope to see them clearly.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Macroscopic","recorded":1362567119,"links":37,"instances":["optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Orders of magnitude"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"]],"members":["lens"],"related":["Length_scale","Measurement","Observation","Abstract_object","Microscopy","Microphysics","Statistical_physics","Length","Millimeter","Ball","Microscopic","Microscope","Molecule","Sphere","Classical_mechanics","Quantum_mechanics","Absolute_zero","Bose–Einstein_condensate","Microscopic_scale","Naked_eye","Lens_(optics)","Microscope","Microscopic_scale","Quantum_realm"]}
