Silver is sometimes bought in sets or combined\nto form sets, such as a set of silver candlesticks or a silver tea set.\n\nSilver requires a good deal of care, as it tarnishes and must be hand polished,\nsince careless or machine polishing ruins the patina and can completely erode\nthe silver layer in Sheffield plate.\n\nIn a great house, the footmen cleaned and polished the silver, overseen by the\nbutler who was responsible for it. In middle-income households the few items of\nsilver or silverplate may be displayed on a buffet or in a cabinet or china\ncabinet or breakfront, but a larger collection of silver is usually locked away\nin a secure room or a special silver safe.\n\nA silverman or silver butler has expertise and professional knowledge of the\nmanagement, secure storage, use and cleaning of all silverware, associated\ntableware and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special\nfunctions. This expertise covers the maintenance, cleaning and proper use and\npresentation of these assets to create aesthetically correct layouts for\neffective ambience at such splendid occasions. The role of silverman tends now\nto be restricted to some private houses and large organizations, in particular\nthe military.\n\n Image:Bath Candlestick one of a pair.jpg| Image:Bath Candlestick\ncentre.jpg Image:Bath Candlestick maker's mark on base.jpg|Mark of Robert Cooper\nImage:Waiter 1732.jpg|De Lamerie Image:BeachcroftSalverSalts&CreamJug.jpg|pair\nof salts, salver and cream jug bearing arms of family of Beachcroft (Arms\ngranted 12 Nov. 1717: Bendy of siz argent and gules three stags heads cabossed\nor, Crest: a beech tree proper behind six park pales argent) Image:Seven Bisse-\nChalloner Salvers.jpg|seven salvers (c.1735-1750).
