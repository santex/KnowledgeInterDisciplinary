{"cursor":"15684","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'accusative case' (abbreviated ) of a noun is the grammatical case used to\nmark the direct object of a transitive verb. The same case is used in many\nlanguages for the objects of (some or all) prepositions. It is a noun that is\nhaving something done to it, usually joined (such as in Latin) with the\nnominative case, making it an indirect object.\n\nThe accusative case existed in Proto-Indo-European and is present in some Indo-\nEuropean languages (including Latin, Sanskrit, Greek, German, Polish, Swedish,\nRomanian, Russian, Ukrainian), in the Uralic languages, in Altaic languages,\nand in Semitic languages (such as Hebrew and Classical Arabic). Finnic\nlanguages, such as Finnish and Estonian, have two cases to mark objects, the\naccusative and the partitive case. In morphosyntactic alignment terms, both\nperform the accusative function, but the accusative object is telic, while the\npartitive is not.\n\nModern English, which almost entirely lacks declension in its nouns, does not\nhave an explicitly marked accusative case even in the pronouns. Such forms as\nwhom, them, and her derive rather from the old Germanic dative forms, of which\nthe -m and -r endings are characteristic. This conflation of the old accusative,\ndative, instrumental, and (after prepositions) genitive cases is the [[oblique\ncase]]. Most modern English grammarians no longer use the Latin\naccusative/dative model, though they tend to use the terms objective for\noblique, subjective for nominative, and possessive for genitive (see\n[[Declension in English]]). Hine, a true accusative masculine third person\nsingular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the\n19th century. Oxford University Press.
