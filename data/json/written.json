Peter T. Daniels,\n\"The Study of Writing Systems\", in The World's Writing Systems, ed. Bright and\nDaniels, p. 3 It is distinguished from illustration, such as cave drawing\nand painting, and non-symbolic preservation of language via non-textual media,\nsuch as magnetic tape audio.\n\nWriting most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient\ncultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining\nfinancial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around\nthe 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia\noutgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording\nand presenting transactions in a permanent form. Robinson, 2003, p. 36 In both Ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica\nwriting may have evolved through calendrics and a political necessity for\nrecording historical and environmental events. The oldest known use of writing\nin China was in divination in the royal court.\n","linknr":669,"url":"written","recorded":1362897684,"links":111,"instances":["writing","script","writing","linguistics","linguistics","literary_theory","arts","boeotia","architecture","island"],"pdf":["http://www.uca.edu.ar/esp/sec-ffilosofia/esp/docs-institutos/s-cehao/boletin/damqatum3_eng2007.pdf"],"categories":["Writing","Nonverbal
