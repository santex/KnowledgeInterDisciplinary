For example, in\nthe English language, run, runs, ran and running are forms of the same lexeme,\nconventionally written as RUN .RUN is here intended to display in small caps.\nSoftware limitations may result in its display either in full-sized capitals\n(RUN) or in full-sized capitals of a smaller font; either is anyway regarded as\nan acceptable substitute for genuine small caps. A related concept is the\nlemma (or 'citation form'), which is a particular form of a lexeme that is\nchosen by convention to represent a canonical form of a lexeme. Lemmas are used\nin dictionaries as the headwords, and other forms of a lexeme are often listed\nlater in the entry if they are not common conjugations of that word.\n\nA lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category, has a certain meaning\n(semantic value), and in inflecting languages, has a corresponding inflectional\nparadigm; that is, a lexeme in many languages will have many different 'forms'.\nFor example, the lexeme RUN has a present third person singular form runs, a\npresent non-third-person singular form run (which also functions as the past\nparticiple and non-finite form), a past form ran, and a present participle\nrunning. (It does not include runner, runners, runnable, etc.) The use of the\nforms of a lexeme is governed by rules of grammar; in the case of English verbs\nsuch as RUN , these include subject-verb agreement and\ncompound tense rules, which determine which form of a verb can be used in a\ngiven sentence.\n\nA lexicon consists of lexemes.\n\nIn many formal theories of language, lexemes have subcategorization frames to\naccount for the number and types of complements they occur with in sentences and\nother syntactic structures.\n\nThe notion of a lexeme is very central to morphology, and thus, many other\nnotions can be defined in terms of it. For example, the difference between\ninflection and derivation can be stated in terms of lexemes:\n* Inflectional rules relate a lexeme to its forms.\n* Derivational rules relate a lexeme to another lexeme.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Lexeme","recorded":1362562863,"links":45,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","morphology","linguistic","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lexical units"],"headings":["Decomposition","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","linguistics"],["semantic_analysis","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"],["meaning","linguistic"],["sentence","linguistics"],["sentence","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["stem","linguistics"],["ending","linguistics"],["marker","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["stem","linguistics"]],"members":["sentence","stem","derivation","semantic_analysis","lemma","meaning","morphology","marker","ending","root"],"related":["Emic_unit","Morphology_(linguistics)","Semantic_analysis_(linguistics)","Linguistics","Word","English_language","Small_caps","Lemma_(morphology)","Headword","Grammatical_conjugation","Syntactic_category","Meaning_(linguistic)","Semantics","Inflection","Grammatical_person","Grammatical_number","Past_participle","Non-finite_verb","Participle","Grammar","Verb","Grammatical_tense","Sentence_(linguistics)","Lexicon","Theoretical_linguistics","Language","Subcategorization_frame","Sentence_(linguistics)","Syntax","Morphology_(linguistics)","Inflection","Derivation_(linguistics)","Morpheme","Root_(linguistics)","Derivation_(linguistics)","Desinence","Inflection","Stem_(linguistics)","Ending_(linguistics)","Inflection","Lexical_word","Marker_(linguistics)","Multiword_expression","Null_morpheme","Root_(linguistics)","Stem_(linguistics)"]}
