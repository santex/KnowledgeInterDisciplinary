In both senses, the construct was established at Confederation, through\nthe Constitution Act, 1867, as a federal constitutional monarchy, wherein the\nCanadian Crown acts as the core, or \"the most basic building block,\"\nof its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. The Crown is thus\nthe foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\nCanadian government. Further\nelements of governance are outlined in the rest of the Canadian constitution,\nwhich includes written statutes, court rulings, and unwritten conventions\ndeveloped over centuries.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Government_of_Canada","recorded":1372154950,"links":[],"instances":["canada","canada","canada","canada","government","canada","canada","constitutional","political"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1867 establishments in Canada","Government of Canada|","Politics of Canada"],"headings":["Usage","Monarchy","Executive power","Legislative power","Judicial power","Federalism","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["executive","government"],["convention","norm#government"],["office_of_the_prime_minister","canada"],["order_of_military_merit","canada"],["convention","norm#government"],["advice","constitutional"],["lieutenant_governor","canada"],["capital","political"],["electoral_district","canada"],["federal_court","canada"],["federal_court_of_appeal","canada"]],"members":["order_of_military_merit","federal_court","federal_court_of_appeal","office_of_the_prime_minister","convention","executive","lieutenant_governor","electoral_district","advice","capital"],"related":["Canada","Canadian_English","Queen-in-Council","Canadian_Confederation","Constitution_Act,_1867","Federation","Constitutional_monarchy","Monarchy_of_Canada","Westminster_system","Parliamentary_system","Democracy","Executive_(government)","Legislature","Judiciary","Constitution_of_Canada","Canadian_English","Press_release","Office_of_the_Prime_Minister_(Canada)","Constitution_Act,_1867","Constitutional_monarchy","Corporation","Order_of_Canada","Order_of_Military_Merit_(Canada)","Royal_Assent","Royal_sign-manual","Letters_patent","Order_in_Council","Elizabeth_II","Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom","Commonwealth_realm","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Governor_General_of_Canada","David_Lloyd_Johnston","Royal_Prerogative","Advice_(constitutional)","Minister_of_the_Crown","Cabinet_of_Canada","Confidence_and_supply","Constitutional_crisis","Federal_monarchy","Head_of_state","Lieutenant_Governor_(Canada)","Government","Queen's_Privy_Council_for_Canada","Responsible_government","Royal_Prerogative","Canadian_House_of_Commons","Minister_of_the_Crown","Cabinet_of_Canada","Prime_minister","Stephen_Harper","Confidence_and_supply","List_of_political_parties_in_Canada","Conservative_Party_of_Canada","Minority_government","Motion_of_non_confidence","Bicameral","Parliament_Hill","Capital_(political)","Ottawa","Senate_of_Canada","Upper_house","Lower_house","Electoral_district_(Canada)","Royal_Assent","Prorogation_in_Canada","Dropping_the_writ","Speech_from_the_throne","Parliament_Hill","Supreme_Court_of_Canada","Court_of_last_resort","Chief_Justice_of_Canada","Federal_Court_(Canada)","Federal_Court_of_Appeal_(Canada)","Tax_Court_of_Canada","Legislative_Assembly","Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","Mail","Census","Canadian_Forces","Criminal_law","Fishing","Currency","Bank","Weights_and_measures","Bankruptcy","Copyright","Patent","Aboriginal_people_in_Canada","Naturalization","Marriage","Divorce","Agriculture","Structure_of_the_Canadian_federal_government","Politics_of_Canada",".gc.ca"]}
