In mechanics terms, a bogie is a chassis or framework carrying wheels,\nattached to a vehicle, thus serving as a modular subassembly of wheels and\naxles. Bogies take various forms in various modes of transport. A bogie may\nremain normally attached (as on a railway carriage/car or locomotive, or on a\nsemi-trailer) or be quickly detachable (as the dolly in a road train); it may\ncontain a suspension within it (as most rail and trucking bogies do), or be\nsolid and in turn be suspended (as most bogies of tracked vehicles are); it may\nbe mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage/car or locomotive, or\nadditionally jointed and sprung (as in the landing gear of an airliner).\n",
