{"cursor":"2926","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Natural gums' are polysaccharides of natural origin, capable of causing a large\nviscosity increase in solution, even at small concentrations. In the food\nindustry they are used as thickening agents, gelling agents, emulsifying agents,\nand stabilizers. In other industries, they are also used as adhesives, binding\nagents, crystan inhibitors, clarifying agents, encapsulating agents,\nflocculating agents, swelling agents, foam stabilizers, etc. Most often these\ngums are found in the woody elements of plants or in seed coatings.\n\nNatural gums can be classified according to their origin. They can also be\nclassified as uncharged or ionic polymers (polyelectrolytes). Examples include\n(E number food additive code):\n\n* Natural gums obtained from seaweeds: ** Polyelectrolytes: *** Agar (E406); ***\n  Alginic acid (E400) and Sodium alginate (E401); *** Carrageenan (E407);\n* Natural gums obtained from non-marine botanical resources: **\n  Polyelectrolytes: *** Gum arabic (E414), from the sap of [[Acacia]] trees ***\n  Gum ghatti, from the sap of [[Anogeissus]] trees *** Gum tragacanth (E413),\n  from the sap of [[Astragalus]] shrubs *** Karaya gum (E416), from the sap of\n  [[Sterculia]] trees ** Uncharged: *** Guar gum (E412), from guar beans ***\n  Locust bean gum (E410), from the seeds of the carob tree *** Beta-glucan, from\n  oat or barley bran *** Chicle gum, an older base for chewing gum obtained from\n  the chicle tree *** Dammar gum, from the sap of Dipterocarpaceae trees ***\n  Glucomannan (E425), from the konjac plant *** Mastic gum, a chewing gum from\n  ancient Greece obtained from the mastic tree *** Psyllium seed husks, from the\n  [[Plantago]] plant *** Spruce gum, a chewing gum of American Indians obtained\n  from spruce trees *** Tara gum (E417), from the seeds of the tara tree\n\n* Natural gums produced by bacterial fermentation: ** Polyelectrolytes: ***\n  Gellan gum (E418) ** Uncharged: *** Xanthan gum (E415)\n","linknr":155,"url":"Natural_gum","recorded":1362481482,"links":26,"instances":["botany","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Food additives","Natural gums|*","Chewing gum","Edible thickening agents","Polysaccharides"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Natural_gum_of_plum_tree_01.jpg/300px-Natural_gum_of_plum_tree_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Biscuit_components.jpg/35px-Biscuit_components.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gum","botany"],["fermentation","biochemistry"]],"members":["gum","fermentation"],"related":["Polysaccharide","Viscosity","Thickening_agent","Gelling_agent","Emulsion","Adhesive","Crystal","Flocculation","Gum_(botany)","Polymer","Polyelectrolyte","E_number","Seaweed","Agar","Alginic_acid","Sodium_alginate","Carrageenan","Gum_arabic","Anogeissus_latifolia","Tragacanth","Gum_karaya","Guar_gum","Guar","Locust_bean_gum","Carob_tree","Beta-glucan","Oat","Barley","Bran","Chewing_gum","Dammar_gum","Dipterocarpaceae","Glucomannan","Konjac","Psyllium_seed_husks","Spruce_gum","Spruce","Caesalpinia_spinosa","Bacteria","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Gellan_gum","Xanthan_gum"]}
