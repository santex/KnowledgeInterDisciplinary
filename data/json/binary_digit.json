      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\nA 'bit' is the basic unit of information in computing and digital\ncommunications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be\nphysically implemented with a two-state device. The most common representation\nof these values are . The term bit is a contraction of 'binary digit'.\n\nThe two values can also be interpreted as logical values (true/false, yes/no),\nalgebraic signs (+/&minus;), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued\nattribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of\nthe underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different\nassignments may be used even within the same device or program. The length of a\nbinary number may be referred to as its bit-length.\n\nIn information theory, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a\nbinary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability,<ref>John B.\nAnderson, Rolf Johnnesson (2006) Understanding Information Transmission.</ref>\nor the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes\nknown.<ref>Simon Haykin (2006), Digital Communications</ref>\n\nIn quantum computing, a quantum bit or qubit is a quantum system that can exist\nin superposition of two bit values, true and false.\n\nThe symbol for bit, as a unit of information, is either simply bit (recommended\nby the ISO/IEC standard 80000-13 (2008)) or lowercase b (recommended by the IEEE\n1541 Standard (2002)). A group of eight bits is commonly called one byte, but\nhistorically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.\n",
