Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on\nprevious observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available\nscientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often\nused synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific\ntheory]]. A scientific hypothesis is a proposed explanation of a phenomenon\nwhich still has to be rigorously tested. In contrast, a scientific theory has\nundergone extensive testing and is generally accepted to be the accurate\nexplanation behind an observation. A 'working hypothesis' is a\nprovisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.\n\nA different meaning of the term hypothesis is used in formal logic, to denote\nthe antecedent of a proposition; thus in the proposition \"If P, then Q\", P\ndenotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); Q can be called a consequent. P is the\nin a (possibly counterfactual) [[wiktionary:what if|What If]] question.\n\nThe adjective hypothetical, meaning \"having the nature of a hypothesis\", or\n\"being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis\", can refer\nto any of these meanings of the term \"hypothesis\".\n","recorded":1362124264,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"230","instances":["album","narrative","logic","drama"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific method","Imagination","Mental structures","Philosophy of science"],"headings":["Uses","Scientific hypothesis","Working hypothesis","Hypotheses, concepts and measurement","See also","References"],"tags":[["antecedent","logic"],["plot","narrative"],["hypothesis","album"],["hypothesis","drama"],["hypothetical","album"],["antecedent","logic"],["hypothesis","drama"],["plot","narrative"],["http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/hip%c3%b3tesis","m%c3%a9todo_cient%c3%adfico"],["http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d7%94%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%a8%d7%94","%d7%9e%d7%93%d7%a2"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg/220px-Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PD-icon.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Orbit","Explanation","Phenomenon","Scientific_method","Testable","Observation","Theory","Research","Formal_logic","Antecedent_(logic)","Proposition","Consequent","Counterfactual_conditional","Plot_(narrative)","Theatre_of_ancient_Greece","Ancient_Greek","Plato","Socrates","Virtue","Wilbur_Knorr","Gregory_Vlastos","Calculation","Morris_Raphael_Cohen","Ernest_Nagel","Robert_Bellarmine","Galileo_Galilei","Mathematical_model","Conservation_of_energy","Constant_of_motion","Sadi_Carnot","James_Prescott_Joule","Emmy_Noether","Existential_quantification","Universal_quantification","Prediction","Reasoning","Deductive_reasoning","Experiment","Laboratory","Nature","Karl_Popper","Falsificationism","Verificationism","Confirmation_holism","Scientific_method","Crucial_experiment","Thought_experiment","Experience","Hans_Christian_Ã˜rsted","Richard_Feynman","Testability","Falsifiability","Parsimony","Occam's_razor","Entity","The_Century_Company","Exploratory_research","Conceptual_framework","Patricia_M._Shields","Journal_of_Public_Affairs_Education","Patricia_M._Shields","Imre_Lakatos","Paul_Feyerabend","Concept","D-N","Proposition","Conceptual_framework","Conceptual_framework","Carl_Gustav_Hempel","Conceptual_framework","Correlation","Statistical_test","Null_hypothesis","Alternative_hypothesis","Sample_size","Axiom","Case_study","Conceptual_framework","Confirmation_holism","Conjecture","Explanandum","Hypothesis_theory","Cognitive_psychology","Logic","Logical_positivism","Operationalization","Isaac_Newton","Reductionism","Research_design","Scientific_method","Scientific_theory","Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge","Theorem","Theory","Thought_experiment","Working_hypothesis"],"members":["hypothetical","plot","antecedent","hypothesis"],"book":[]}
