{"cursor":"7700","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'pentose phosphate pathway' (also called the 'phosphogluconate pathway' and\nthe 'hexose monophosphate shunt') is a process that generates NADPH and pentoses\n(5-carbon sugars). There are two distinct phases in the pathway. The first is\nthe oxidative phase, in which NADPH is generated, and the second is the non-\noxidative synthesis of 5-carbon sugars. This pathway is an alternative to\nglycolysis. While it does involve oxidation of glucose, its primary role is\nanabolic rather than catabolic. For most organisms, it takes place in the\ncytosol; in plants, most steps take place in plastids.\n","linknr":509,"url":"Pentose_phosphate_pathway","recorded":1362580927,"links":44,"instances":["biochemist","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metabolic pathways","Phosphorus"],"headings":["Outcome","Phases","See also","Erythrocytes and the pentose phosphate pathway","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Pentose_Phosphate_Pathway.png/400px-Pentose_Phosphate_Pathway.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Ox_Pentose_phosphate_pathway.svg/500px-Ox_Pentose_phosphate_pathway.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Nichtox_Pentosephosphatweg.png/600px-Nichtox_Pentosephosphatweg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Metabolism_790px_partly_labeled.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Gtk-dialog-info.svg/15px-Gtk-dialog-info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Metabolism_790px.png/50px-Metabolism_790px.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reduction","chemistry"],["frank_dickens","biochemist"]],"members":["frank_dickens","reduction"],"related":["NADPH","Pentose","Carbon","Sugar","Oxidation","Glycolysis","Glucose","Cytosol","Plastid","Fatty_acid_synthesis","R5P","Erythrose-4-phosphate","Reduction_(chemistry)","Oxidative_stress","Glutathione","Glutathione_reductase","Glutathione_peroxidase","Fenton's_reagent","Hydrogen_peroxide","Phagocytes","Respiratory_burst","NADP","NADPH","Glucose-6-phosphate","Ribulose_5-phosphate","Glucose_6-phosphate","6-phosphoglucono-&delta;-lactone","Glucose_6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Dehydrogenation","NADPH","6-phosphoglucono-&delta;-lactone","6-phosphogluconate","6-phosphogluconolactonase","Hydrolysis","6-phosphogluconate","Ribulose_5-phosphate","6-phosphogluconate_dehydrogenase","Decarboxylation","NADPH","Ribulose_5-phosphate","Ribulose_5-phosphate","Ribose_5-phosphate","Ribulose_5-phosphate","Xylulose_5-phosphate","Xylulose_5-phosphate","Ribose_5-phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Sedoheptulose_7-phosphate","Transketolase","Sedoheptulose_7-phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Erythrose_4-phosphate","Fructose_6-phosphate","Transaldolase","Xylulose_5-phosphate","Erythrose_4-phosphate","Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate","Fructose_6-phosphate","Transketolase","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Allosteric","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Acyl_CoA","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","NADPH","RNA","Thiamine_deficiency","Frank_Dickens_(biochemist)","Plasmodium_falciparum"]}
