{"cursor":"49455","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'(also known as 'The Charter of\nRights and Freedoms' or simply the 'Charter', ) is a bill of rights entrenched\nin the Constitution of Canada. It forms the first part of the Constitution Act,\n1982. The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and\ncivil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas\nand levels of government. It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of\nprinciples that embody those rights. The Charter was signed into law by Queen\nElizabeth II of Canada on April 17, 1982 along with the rest of the Act.\n\nThe Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was enacted in\n1960. However, the Bill of Rights was only a federal statute, rather than a\nconstitutional document. As a federal statute, it was limited in scope, was\neasily amendable by Parliament, and it had no application to provincial laws.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the\nCourt was reluctant to declare laws inoperative. Only one federal law was\ndeclared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada: [[R. v. Drybones]] (1969),\n[1970] S.C.R. 282. For an example of the narrow interpretation of the Supreme\nCourt of Canada see Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R.\n1349. The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights\nmotivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for human\nrights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the\nprinciples enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hogg,\nPeter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario:\nThomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 689. The British Parliament formally\nenacted the Charter as a part of the Canada Act 1982 at the request of the\nParliament of Canada in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of\nPrime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\n\nOne of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly\nexpand the scope of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with\nrespect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than\nwas the Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter\nrights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and\nregulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when Canadian case\nlaw was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. However, the\nCharter granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more\ncreative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than\nwhat was typical under the common law and under a system of government that,\ninfluenced by Canada's mother country the United Kingdom, was based upon\nParliamentary supremacy. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad\nsupport from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents\nof increased judicial power. The Charter only applies to government laws and\nactions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal\ngovernments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to\nprivate activity.\n","linknr":758,"url":"Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms","recorded":1372154363,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Human_Rights_and_Freedoms","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Canada.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/150px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_Canada","/wiki/The_Crown","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada","/wiki/Title_and_style_of_the_Canadian_monarch","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada","/wiki/David_Johnston","/wiki/Executive_(government)","/wiki/Queen-in-Council","/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada","/wiki/Stephen_Harper","/wiki/Cabinet_of_Canada","/wiki/28th_Canadian_Ministry","/wiki/Structure_of_the_Canadian_federal_government","/wiki/President_of_the_Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","/wiki/Privy_Council_Office_(Canada)","/wiki/Clerk_of_the_Privy_Council_(Canada)","/wiki/Government_of_Canada","/wiki/Public_Service_of_Canada","/wiki/Legislature","/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada","/wiki/41st_Canadian_Parliament","/wiki/Senate_of_Canada","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Canadian_Senate","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate_(Canada)","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate_(Canada)","/wiki/Canadian_Senate_divisions","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_Canada","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_House_of_Commons_(Canada)","/wiki/Official_Opposition_(Canada)","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Official_Opposition_(Canada)","/wiki/Official_Opposition_Shadow_Cabinet_(Canada)","/wiki/Elections_in_Canada","/wiki/List_of_Canadian_federal_electoral_districts","/wiki/Canadian_electoral_system","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_2011","/wiki/Judiciary","/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Canada","/wiki/Beverley_McLachlin","/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada","/wiki/British_North_America_Acts","/wiki/Peace,_order_and_good_government","/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_federalism","/wiki/Monarchy_in_the_Canadian_provinces","/wiki/Lieutenant_governor_(Canada)","/wiki/Executive_Council_(Canada)","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Canadian_provinces","/wiki/Municipal_government_in_Canada","/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Canada","/wiki/Political_culture_of_Canada","/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Canada","/wiki/Office-holders_of_Canada","/wiki/Category:Political_movements_in_Canada","/wiki/First_Nations_government_(Canada)","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Canada","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Can-vote-stub.svg/15px-Can-vote-stub.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Canadian_politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Canada","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_Canada","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Canada&action=edit","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Bill_of_rights","/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982","/wiki/Politics_of_Canada","/wiki/Civil_rights","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Government_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadians","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights","/wiki/Statute","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Human_right","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Canada_Act_1982","/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada","/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau","/wiki/Judicial_review","/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada","/wiki/Law_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_federalism","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliamentary_supremacy","/wiki/Judicial_power","#Features","#History","#Interpretation_and_enforcement","#Comparisons_with_other_human_rights_documents","#The_Charter_and_national_values","#Criticism","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms&action=edit&section=1","/wiki
