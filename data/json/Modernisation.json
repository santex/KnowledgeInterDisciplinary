The\nteleology of modernization is described in social evolutionism theories,\nexisting as a template that has been generally followed by societies that have\nachieved modernity. Brugger and Hannan, p. 1â3. Dixon, p. 1â4 While it may theoretically be possible for\nsome societies to make the transition in entirely different ways, there have\nbeen no counterexamples provided by reliable sources.\n\nHistorians link modernization to the processes of urbanization and\nindustrialisation, as well as to the spread of education. As Kendall (2007)\nnotes, \"Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of\nindustrialization.\" Diana Kendall, Sociology in Our Times (2007) p. 11\nIn sociological critical theory, modernization is linked to an overarching\nprocess of rationalisation. When modernization increases within a society, the\nindividual becomes that much more important, eventually replacing the family or\ncommunity as the fundamental unit of society. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/mode-\nrnization\n\nModernization theory and history have been explicitly used as guides for\ncountries eager to develop rapidly, such as China. Indeed, modernization has\nbeen proposed as the most useful framework for World history in China, because\nas one of the developing countries that started late, \"China's modernization has\nto be based on the experiences and lessons of other countries.\".
