A substance that causes a reaction is\ncalled an allergen. These reactions are acquired, predictable, and rapid.\nAllergy is one of four forms of hypersensitivity and is formally called [[Type I\nhypersensitivity|type I]] (or immediate) hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions\nare distinctive because of excessive activation of certain white blood cells\ncalled mast cells and basophils by a type of antibody called Immunoglobulin E\n(IgE). This reaction results in an inflammatory response which can range from\nuncomfortable to dangerous.\n\nMild allergies like hay fever are very common in the human population and cause\nsymptoms such as red eyes, itchiness, and runny nose, eczema, hives, or an\nasthma attack. Allergies can play a major role in conditions such as asthma. In\nsome people, severe allergies to environmental or dietary allergens or to\nmedication may result in life-threatening reactions called anaphylaxis. Food\nallergies, and reactions to the venom of stinging insects such as wasps and bees\nare often associated with these severe reactions.\n\nA variety of tests exist to diagnose allergic conditions. If done they should be\nordered and interpreted in light of a person's history of exposure as many\npositive test results do not mean a clinically significant allergy. Tests include placing possible allergens on the skin and\nlooking for a reaction such as swelling and blood tests to look for an allergen-\nspecific IgE.\n\nTreatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens, use of medications\nsuch as anti-histamines that specifically prevent allergic reactions, steroids\nthat modify the immune system in general, and medications such as decongestants\nthat reduce the symptoms. Many of these medications are taken by mouth, though\nepinephrine, which is used to treat anaphylactic reactions, is injected.\nImmunotherapy uses injected allergens to desensitize the body's response.\n","linknr":1397,"url":"Allergy","recorded":1362482520,"links":72,"instances":["cell_biology","immunology","genetics","biology","dermatology","fruit","biology","classification_of_human_beings","nutrition","medicine","food"],"pdf":["http://www.worldallergy.org/publications/slit-wao-pp_final.pdf","http://www.worldallergy.org/publications/slit-wao-pp_final.pdf","http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/contents/81e384d6-0328-4653-9cc2-2aa7baa3c56a.pdf"],"categories":["Allergology|","Effects
