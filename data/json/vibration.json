The oscillations may be periodic such as the motion of a\npendulum or random such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.\n\nVibration is occasionally \"desirable\". For example the motion of a tuning fork,\nthe reed in a woodwind instrument or harmonica, or mobile phones or the cone of\na loudspeaker is desirable vibration, necessary for the correct functioning of\nthe various devices.\n\nMore often, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound\nâ€“ noise. For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric motors, or\nany mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted. Such vibrations can\nbe caused by imbalances in the rotating parts, uneven friction, the meshing of\ngear teeth, etc. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.\n\nThe study of sound and vibration are closely related. Sound, or \"pressure\nwaves\", are generated by vibrating structures (e.g. vocal cords); these pressure\nwaves can also induce the vibration of structures (e.g. ear drum). Hence, when\ntrying to reduce noise it is often a problem in trying to reduce vibration.
