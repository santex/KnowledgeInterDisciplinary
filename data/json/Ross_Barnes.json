He\nplayed for the dominant Boston Red Stockings teams of the early 1870s, along\nwith Albert Spalding, Cal McVey, George Wright, Harry Wright, Jim O'Rourke, and\nDeacon White. Despite playing for these star-studded teams, many claim that Ross\nwas the most valuable to his teams.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1870, Ross starred for the Rockford Forest Citys, along with Albert\nSpalding, attaining professional status in the second year. When the National\nAssociation was formed in 1871, Harry Wright signed both men to his new team in\nBoston. Barnes' major league career thus started when he was 21. He split time\nbetween second base and shortstop for the Boston Red Stockings of the new\nNational Association. Barnes led the league with 66 runs scored and 91 total\nbases, finishing second in batting average at .401.\n\nIn 1872 he led the Association with a .432 batting average, a .585 slugging\npercentage, 99 base hits, 134 total bases, and 28 doubles. The Red Stockings\nbegan a four-year dominance of the Association, with Barnes a key player\neach year.\n\nBarnes again led the Association in 1873, hitting .425, as well as leading in\non-base percentage (.456), slugging percentage (.584), base hits (137), runs\nscored (125), total bases (188), doubles (29), bases on balls (28), and stolen\nbases (13).\n\nHis .340 BA in 1874 was only good enough for eighth in the league, while his\n.364 was good for second in 1875, while leading again in runs scored (115), base\nhits (143) and on base percentage (.375).\n\nBefore the 1875 season ended, Barnes and four other Boston players signed\ncontracts with the Chicago White Stockings. When word leaked out in Boston\nbefore the end of the season, Barnes and his teammates were reviled by Boston\nfans, being called \"seceders\", a strong epithet just a decade after the Civil\nWar. It was likely that the National Association would void the signing, but\nChicago owner William Hulbert preempted the move by forming the National League,\nand causing the NA to disband.\n\nRoss Barnes has the career NA records in runs (459), hits (530), doubles (99),\nwalks (55), stolen bases (73), total bases (695), times on base (585), runs\nproduced (694), batting average (.390), on-base percentage (.413), and slugging\npercentage (.511).\n\nBarnes' new team finished first in the NL's first season with a 55â12 record,\nwhile Boston fell to fourth. Ross led the National League batting (.429), on\nbase percentage (.462), slugging (.562), runs (126), hits (138), bases (190),\ndoubles (21), triples (14), and walks (20). In the 1876 season, Barnes also\nestablished the single-season record for runs per game (1.91), a mark which\nstill stands.\n\nFor those first six years of major league play, Barnes had hit .397. However,\n1876 was to be his last dominant season.\n\nIn 1877, he fell ill with what was then only described as an \"ague\" (fever),\nplayed only 22 games, and did not play well when he was in the lineup. The\nillness robbed Barnes of much of his strength and agility, and shortened his\ncareer. While many baseball histories originally blamed the change in rules that\noutlawed the \"fair-foul\" hit, of which Barnes was an acknowledged master, his\nillness has become a more widely accepted explanation for his loss of\nproductivity.\n\nThe remainder of his career was an effort to return to glory ending in\nmediocrity. He played for the Tecumseh team in the International Association\n(arguably baseball's first minor league) in 1878, returned to the National\nLeague with the Cincinnati club in 1879, sat out all of 1880, and finished his\nprofessional career in 1881, playing his last season in Boston, the site of his\nformer glory. After 1876, he never hit better than .272, and his other totals\nwere barely half of those from his glory days. He retired at age 31. He finished\nhis career with 859 hits, 698 runs, and a .359 average, in only 499 games played\nand 2392 at bats. His 1.4 runs per game played remains the best of all time.\n\nBarnes has been rated as the best player of the National Association, and during\nhis peak, from 1871 to 1876, he was a dominant offensive force. His skill at the\nfair-foul bunt caused rule changes, and his defensive abilities were highly\nregarded. A teammate of multiple members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was\nthe most valuable batter. He also has the distinction of having hit the first\nhome run in National League history, on May 2,\n1876. [http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1876 The\nChronology - 1876 | BaseballLibrary.com ]\n\nA lifelong bachelor, Barnes held a variety of white-collar jobs in the Chicago\narea after his baseball career ended until his death from heart disease in 1915.\n","linknr":403,"url":"Ross_Barnes","recorded":1375076890,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ross_Barnes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Barnes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ross_Barnes_1872.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Ross_Barnes_1872.jpg/200px-Ross_Barnes_1872.jpg","/wiki/Second_baseman","/wiki/Mount_Morris,_New_York","/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois","/wiki/History_of_the_Atlanta_Braves#Boston_years","/wiki/History_of_the_Atlanta_Braves#Boston_years","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Rockford_Forest_Citys","/wiki/History_of_the_Atlanta_Braves#Boston_years","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds_(1876%E2%80%931880)","/wiki/History_of_the_Atlanta_Braves#Boston_years","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Stolen_base","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Second_base","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/History_of_the_Atlanta_Braves#Boston_years","/wiki/Albert_Spalding","/wiki/Cal_McVey","/wiki/George_Wright_(sportsman)","/wiki/Harry_Wright","/wiki/Jim_O%27Rourke_(baseball)","/wiki/Deacon_White","/wiki/Rockford_Forest_Citys","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/On-base_percentage","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/William_Hulbert","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Total_bases","/wiki/Times_on_base","/wiki/Runs_produced","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/On-base_percentage","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/Minor_league","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds_(1876%E2%80%931880)","/wiki/Games_played","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Home_run","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Barnes&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_runs_scored_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_doubles_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_triples_champions","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_titles_leaders","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Barnes&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/barnero01.shtml","#cite_ref-2","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1876","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0910137358","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0967371805","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0786407794","/w/index.php?title=Ross_Barnes&action=edit&section=3","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/barnero01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=barnes001ros","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_Batting_Champions","/wiki/Deacon_White","/wiki/Template:NL_batting_title","/wiki/Template_talk:NL_batting_title","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NL_batting_title&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions#National_League","/wiki/Deacon_White","/wiki/Paul_Hines","/wiki/Paul_Hines","/wiki/George_Gore","/wiki/Cap_Anson","/wiki/Dan_Brouthers","/wiki/Dan_Brouthers","/wiki/King_Kelly","/wiki/Roger_Connor","/wiki/King_Kelly","/wiki/Sam_Thompson","/wiki/Cap_Anson","/wiki/Dan_Brouthers","/wiki/Jack_Glasscock","/wiki/Billy_Hamilton_(baseball)","/wiki/Dan_Brouthers","/wiki/Billy_Hamilton_(baseball)","/wiki/Hugh_Duffy","/wiki/Jesse_Burkett","/wiki/Jesse_Burkett","/wiki/Willie_Keeler","/wiki/Willie_Keeler","/wiki/Ed_Delahanty","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Jesse_Burkett","/wiki/Ginger_Beaumont","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Cy_Seymour","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Sherry_Magee","/wiki/Honus_Wagner","/wiki/Heinie_Zimmerman","/wiki/Jake_Daubert","/wiki/Jake_Daubert","/wiki/Larry_Doyle_(baseball)","/wiki/Hal_Chase","/wiki/Edd_Roush","/wiki/Zack_Wheat","/wiki/Edd_Roush","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Bubbles_Hargrave","/wiki/Paul_Waner","/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby","/wiki/Lefty_O%27Doul","/wiki/Bill_Terry","/wiki/Chick
