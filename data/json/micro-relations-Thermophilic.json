Thermophilic\n  | eubacteria are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.\n\nThermophiles are found in various geothermally heated regions of the Earth,\nsuch as hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park (see image) and\ndeep sea hydrothermal vents, as well as decaying plant matter, such as peat\nbogs and compost.\n\nUnlike other types of bacteria, thermophiles can survive at much hotter\ntemperatures, where as other bacteria would be damaged and sometimes killed if\nexposed to the same temperatures.\n\nAs a prerequisite for their survival, thermophiles contain enzymes that\ncan function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in\nmolecular biology (for example, heat-stable DNA polymerases for PCR), and\nin washing agents.\n\n\"Thermophile\" is derived from the (thermotita), meaning heat, and\n(philia), love.\n\nA scientific conference for those who study thermophiles has been held since\n1990 at locations throughout the world, including Viterbo, Italy; Reykjavik,\nIceland; New Delhi, India; and Bergen, Norway. The 2011 edition was held in Big\nSky, Montana, hosted by Montana State\nUniversity.
