It is bounded by Europe,\nAnatolia and the Caucasus and is ultimately connected to the Atlantic Ocean via\nthe Mediterranean and the Aegean Seas and various straits. The Bosphorus Strait\nconnects it to the Sea of Marmara, and the Strait of the Dardanelles connects\nthat sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. These waters separate\neastern Europe and western Asia. The Black Sea is also connected to the Sea of\nAzov by the Strait of Kerch.\n\nThe Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), Surface\nAreaâ a maximum depth of , Maximum Depthâ and a volume of\n. The Black Sea forms in an east-west trending elliptical depression\nwhich lies between Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south,\nthe Caucasus Mountains to the east and features a wide shelf to the northwest.\nThe longest east-west extent is about .\n\nImportant cities along the coast include Batumi, Burgas, ConstanÈa, Giresun,\nHopa, Kerch, Mangalia, NÄvodari, Novorossiysk, Odessa, Ordu, Poti, Rize, Samsun,\nSevastopol, Sochi, Sukhumi, Trabzon, Varna, Yalta and Zonguldak.\n\nThe Black Sea has a positive water balance; that is, a net outflow of water per\nyear through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles into the Aegean Sea.\nMediterranean water flows into the Black Sea as part of a two-way hydrological\nexchange. The Black Sea outflow is cooler and less saline, and floats over the\nwarm, more saline Mediterranean inflow â as a result of differences in density\ncaused by differences in salinity â leading to a significant anoxic layer well\nbelow the surface waters. The Black Sea also receives river water from large\nEurasian fluvial systems to the north of the Sea, of which the Don, Dnieper and\nDanube are the most significant.\n\nIn the past, the water level has varied significantly. Due to these variations\nin the water level in the basin the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have\nsometimes been land. At certain critical water levels it is possible for\nconnections with surrounding water bodies to become established. It is through\nthe most active of these connective routes, the Turkish Straits, that the Black\nSea joins the world ocean. When this hydrological link is not present, the Black\nSea is a lake, operating independently of the global ocean system. Currently the\nBlack Sea water level is relatively high, thus water is being exchanged with the\nMediterranean. The Turkish Straits connect the Black and Aegean Seas and\ncomprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Black_Sea","recorded":1372152398,"links":[],"instances":["geologist","russia","geologist","author","meteorology","landform","burgas","country","turkey","greek","genus","world_war_ii","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anoxic
