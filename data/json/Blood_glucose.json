One of the\n effects of a sugar-rich vs a starch-rich meal is highlighted. ]] The\n 'blood sugar concentration' or 'blood glucose level' is the amount of glucose\n (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The body naturally tightly\n regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis.\n\nGlucose is the primary source of energy for the body's cells, and blood lipids\n(in the form of fats and oils) are primarily a compact energy store. (There are\nexceptions. For example, because their dietary metabolizable carbohydrates tend\nto be used by rumen organisms, Van Soest, P. J. 1994. Nutritional ecology\nof the ruminant. 2nd Ed. Cornell Univ. Press. 476 pp. ruminants tend to\nbe continuously gluconeogenic; Young, J. W. 1977. Gluconeogenesis in\ncattle: significance and methodology. J. Dairy Sci. 60: 1â15.\nconsequently their hepatocytes must rely on such primary energy sources as\nvolatile fatty acids, absorbed from the rumen, rather than glucose.) Glucose is\ntransported from the intestines or liver to body cells via the bloodstream, and\nis made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin, produced by the\nbody primarily in the pancreas.\n\nThe mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mM\n(5.5 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL, i.e. milligrams/deciliter); [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-\n9.html What are mg/dl and mmol/l? How to convert? Glucose? Cholesterol?]\nAdvameg, Inc. however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Glucose\nlevels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day\n(termed \"the fasting level\"), and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few\nmillimolar. The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-\ndiabetics, should be between 70 and 100 mg/dL. Blood sugar levels for those\nwithout diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 125 mg/dL.\n[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003482.htm NIH â National\nInstitutes of Health] The blood glucose target range for diabetics,\naccording to the American Diabetes Association, should be 70 â 130 mg/dL\nbefore meals, and less than 180 mg/dL after meals (as measured by a blood\nglucose monitor). [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-glucose-target-\nrange/MY00494 mayoclinic.com â The Mayo Clinic]\n\nBlood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical\ncondition. A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels\nare referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by\npersistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent\ndisease related to failure of blood sugar regulation. Intake of alcohol causes\nan initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also,\ncertain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.
