It\nis a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in\none culture can sometimes be quite rude or simply eccentric in another\ncultural context.\n\nWhile the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and\ncomfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be\nmanipulated to inflict shame on a designated party.\n\nAnthropologists Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson identified two kinds of\npoliteness, deriving from Erving Goffman's concept of face:\n* 'Negative politeness': Making a request less infringing, such as \"If you don't\n  mind...\" or \"If it isn't too much trouble...\"; respects a person's right to\n  act freely. In other words, deference. There is a greater use of indirect\n  speech acts.\n* 'Positive politeness': Seeks to establish a positive relationship between\n  parties; respects a person's need to be liked and understood. Direct speech\n  acts, swearing and flouting Grice's maxims can be considered aspects of\n  positive politeness because: ** they show an awareness that the relationship\n  is strong enough to cope with what would normally be considered impolite (in\n  the popular understanding of the term); ** they articulate an awareness of the\n  other person's values, which fulfills the person's desire to be accepted.\n\nSome cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In\nthis way politeness is culturally bound. Some countries that are considered\nespecially polite are England and Japan.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Politeness","recorded":1362674885,"links":28,"instances":["self_image","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociolinguistics","Etiquette"],"headings":["Techniques to show politeness","Linguistic devices","Criticism of the theory","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Politeness_-_Punch_cartoon_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16619.png/220px-Politeness_-_Punch_cartoon_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16619.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["face","self_image"],["hedge","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"]],"members":["face","morphology","hedge"],"related":["Manners","Etiquette","Culture","Shame","Stephen_C._Levinson","Erving_Goffman","Face_(self_image)","Speech_acts","Profanity","Gricean_maxim","Hedge_(linguistics)","Polite_lie","Euphemism","Connotation","Tag_question","Lexicon","Morphology_(linguistics)","T-V_distinction","Social_norms","Japanese_language","Suppletion","Honorific_speech_in_Japanese","Social_graces","Formality","Politeness_theory","Politeness_maxims","Intercultural_competence","Polite_fiction","Stephen_C._Levinson","Joachim_Grzega"]}
