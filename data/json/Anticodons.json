It does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic\nmachinery of a cell (ribosome) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence\n(codon) in a messenger RNA (mRNA). As such, tRNAs are a necessary component of\nprotein translation, the biological synthesis of new proteins according to the\ngenetic code.\n\nThe specific nucleotide sequence of a mRNA specifies which amino acids are\nincorporated into the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is\ntranscribed, and the role of tRNA is to specify which sequence from the genetic\ncode corresponds to which amino acid. One end of the tRNA matches the\ngenetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon. The anticodon\nforms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. The\nmRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons, each of which is\nrecognized by a particular tRNA. On the other end of the tRNA is a covalent\nattachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the anticodon sequence. Each\ntype of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, so each\norganism has many types of tRNA (in fact, because the genetic code contains\nmultiple codons that specify the same amino acid, there are many tRNA molecules\nbearing different anticodons which also carry the same amino acid).\n\nThe covalent attachment to the tRNA 3â end is catalyzed by enzymes called aminoacyl-\ntRNA synthetases. During protein synthesis, tRNAs with attached amino acids are\ndelivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in\nbacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes), which aid in decoding the mRNA codon sequence.\nIf the tRNA's anticodon matches the mRNA, another tRNA already bound to the\nribosome transfers the growing polypeptide chain from its 3â end to the amino\nacid attached to the 3â end of the newly-delivered tRNA, a reaction catalyzed by\nthe ribosome.\n","linknr":683,"url":"Anticodons","recorded":1362484108,"links":56,"instances":["nucleoside","molecular_biology","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/oct2006/453.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/oct2006/453.pdf"],"categories":["RNA","Protein biosynthesis","Non-coding RNA"],"headings":["Structure","Anticodon","Aminoacylation","Binding to ribosome","tRNA genes","tRNA biogenesis","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Peptide_syn.png/250px-Peptide_syn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/TRNA-Phe_yeast_en.svg/220px-TRNA-Phe_yeast_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/TRNA-Phe_yeast_1ehz.png/220px-TRNA-Phe_yeast_1ehz.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["translation","biology"],["lysidine","nucleoside"],["translation","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["lysidine","directionality","splicing","translation","transcription"],"related":["Gene","TRNA","RNA","Nucleotides","Nucleic_acids","DNA","RNA","Ribosome","Codon","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Protein","Genetic_code","Amino_acid","Genetic_code","Codon","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase","Ribosome","Elongation_factor","EF-Tu","EEF-1","Primary_structure","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Translation_(biology)","Ribosome","RNA_Tertiary_Structure","5'_end","Phosphate","D_arm","Dihydrouridine","T_arm","Pseudouridine","Methylation","Inosine","Pseudouridine","Lysidine_(nucleoside)","Nucleotides","Genetic_code","MRNA","Wobble_base_pair","Inosine","Pseudouridine","Hydrogen_bond","Genetic_code","Glycine","Aminoacylation","Amino_acid","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase","Adenosine_triphosphate","Pyrophosphate","Adenosine_monophosphate","Glutamate","Ribosome","MRNA","Translation_(biology)","EF-Tu","EF-Tu","EEF-1","MRNA","Codon","Codon","Prokaryotic_initiation_factor-2","Ribosome","Genes","Genome","Nematode","Genetics","Cell_nucleus","Non-coding_RNA","Mitochondria","Pseudogenes","Chromosomes","Eukaryotic","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase_III","RNA_polymerase_III","Thymidine","Intron","Splicing_(genetics)","Archaea","Endonuclease","RNase_P","TRNase_Z","Nucleotidyl_transferase","Nuclear_export","Cytoplasm","Aminoacylation","Yeast","Mitochondria","Francis_Crick","Alex_Rich","Don_Caspar","Princeton_University","United_Kingdom","King's_College_London","Robert_W._Holley","Cornell_University","X-ray_crystallography","Kim_Sung-Hou","Alexander_Rich","Aaron_Klug","MRNA","TmRNA","Non-coding_RNA","Intron","Translation_(genetics)","Transfer_RNA-like_structures","Kim_Sung-Hou","Wobble_hypothesis","TRNADB"]}
