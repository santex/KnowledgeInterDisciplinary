The chief exercised the\nhereditary right of inaugurating O'Neill as king or overlord of Ulster. In\nmedieval times, members of the sept were territorial magnates in Counties\nMonaghan and Armagh, and two places called Ballyagan, (from \"baile\", a\nsettlement), one in County Londonderry and the other in County Antrim, further\nlocate the O'Hagans.\n\nChiefs of the Clan Feargusa, they descended from Fergus CerrbÃ©l mac Conaill\nCremthainne (Fergus Crooked Mouth) grandson of Niall of the Nine Hostages said\nto be High King of Ireland from 370 to 406 who in turn descends from Conn of the\nHundred Battles the Milesian Gaelic King of Tara / Ireland in the 2nd Century.\nFor over six hundred years the O'Hagans were hereditary brehons and inaugurators\nof O'Neill (surname) who were descended from the UÃ­ NÃ©ill.\n\nBefore the 13th century branches of the sept were established in County Monaghan\nand County Armagh and soon spread into the neighbouring counties of Antrim,\nLondonderry and Down.
