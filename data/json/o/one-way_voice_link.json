{"cursor":"2361","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'one-way voice link (OWVL)' is typically a radio based communication method\nused by spy networks to communicate with agents in the field typically (but not\nexclusively) using shortwave radio frequencies.\n\nShortwave frequencies were and are generally highly preferred for their long\nrange, as a communications link of 1200 km is easily possible. VHF and UHF\nfrequencies can be used for one way voice circuits, but are generally not\npreferred as their range is at best 300 km (on flat terrain). Since the\n1970s infrared point to point communication systems have been used that offer\none way voice links, but the number of users was always limited.\n\nThis communications system often employs recorders to transmit pre-recorded\nmessages in real time or in 'burst transmissions,' which minimize the time that\na spy needs to be 'on the air'. Voice scrambling systems have been selectively\nused for this kind of communications circuit since the 1980s, based on\noperational needs.\n\nSince personal computers became cheap and readily available in the 2000s, time\ncompressed voice scrambling for one way and bi-directional circuits is a\npractically free technology (but there is no readily available public domain or\nopen source software for experimenters).\n\nOne way voice links have existed outside of espionage, for example the NICAM\ntransmission system was modified in the UK to allow for a one way voice link to\nBBC mobile units. This one way voice link was typically used for sports events,\nas it was highly flexible.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"one-way_voice_link","recorded":1371065239,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Espionage techniques"],"headings":["Historical context","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Spy","Shortwave_radio","VHF","UHF","Burst_transmission","Open_source_software","NICAM","Cold_War","STASI","Falklands_War","Numbers_station"]}
