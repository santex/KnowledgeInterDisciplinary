A choice of surface normal allows one to use the right-\nhand rule to define a \"clockwise\" direction of loops in the surface, as needed\nby Stokes' theorem for instance. More generally, orientability of an abstract\nsurface, or manifold, measures whether one can consistently choose a \"clockwise\"\norientation for all loops in the manifold. Equivalently, a surface is\n'orientable' if a two-dimensional figure such as in the space cannot be moved\n(continuously) around the space and back to where it started so that it looks\nlike its own mirror image .\n\nThe notion of orientability can be generalised to higher dimensional manifolds\nas well. A manifold is orientable if it has a consistent choice of orientation,\nand a connected orientable manifold has exactly two different possible\norientations. In this setting, various equivalent formulations of orientability\ncan be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality.\nFormulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of\nhomology theory, whereas for differentiable manifolds more structure is present,\nallowing a formulation in terms of differential forms. An important\ngeneralization of the notion of orientability of a space is that of\norientability of a family of spaces parameterized by some other space (a fiber\nbundle) for which an orientation must be selected in each of the spaces which\nvaries continuously with respect to changes in the parameter values.\n","title":"Orientability","headings":["Orientable surfaces","Orientability of manifolds","Orientable double cover","Orientation of vector bundles","Related concepts","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Manifold","3: Differential_form","3: Structure_group","2: Euclidean_space","2: Surface_normal","2: Möbius_strip","2: Singular_homology","2: Tangent_bundle","1: Mathematics","1: Surface","1: Right-hand_rule","1: Stokes'_theorem","1: Connected_space","1: Homology_theory","1: Differentiable_manifolds","1: Fiber_bundle","1: Homeomorphic","1: Sphere","1: Torus","1: Real_projective_plane","1: Klein_bottle","1: Langton's_ant","1: 3-manifold","1: Solid_Klein_bottle","1: Relative_homology","1: Coordinate_atlas","1: Jacobian_determinant","1: Frame_bundle","1: Volume_form","1: Covering_space","1: Index_of_a_subgroup","1: Vector_bundle","1: Reduction_of_the_structure_group","1: Determinant","1: Smooth_function","1: General_linear_group","1: Homotopy_group","1: Homotopy_equivalence","1: Symmetric_group","1: Alternating_group","1: Even_and_odd_permutations","1: Lorentzian_manifold","1: Causal_structure","1: General_relativity","1: Space-time","1: Character_theory","1: Associated_bundle","1: Curve_orientation"]}
