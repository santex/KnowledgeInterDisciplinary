This genus also contains several other species\nvariously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese\nbunching onion (A. fistulosum), Egyptian onion (A. ×proliferum), and Canada\nonion (A. canadense). The name \"wild onion\" is applied to a number of Allium\nspecies but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation and its wild original\nform is not known. The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant,\nbut is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.\n\nThe onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and the bulb at the\nbase of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. In the\nautumn the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and\nbrittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or\nstorage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases,\nparticularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm and various fungi that cause\nrotting. Some varieties of A. cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce\nmultiple bulbs.\n\nOnions are cultivated and used around the world. As a foodstuff they are usually\nserved cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also\nbe eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped\nand contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes. Consumption is\nbelieved to benefit health in that onions contain phenolics and flavonoids that\nhave potential anti-inflammatory, anti-cholesterol, anticancer and antioxidant\nproperties.\n",
