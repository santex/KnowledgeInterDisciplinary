{"cursor":"34347","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Octane rating' or 'octane number' is a standard measure of the performance of a\nmotor or aviation fuel. The higher the octane number, the more compression the\nfuel can withstand before detonating. In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane\nrating are used in high-compression engines that generally have higher\nperformance. In contrast, fuels with low octane numbers (but high cetane\nnumbers) are ideal for diesel engines. Use of gasoline with less octane numbers\nmay lead to the problem of engine knocking.
