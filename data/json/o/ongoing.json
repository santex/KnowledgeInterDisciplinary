It is a period of time between the past and\n the future, and can vary in meaning from being an instant to a day or longer.\n In radiocarbon dating, the \"present\" is defined as AD 1950.\n\nIt is sometimes represented as a hyperplane in space-time, Sattig, T.\n(2006).

Page 37. typically called \"now\",\nalthough modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane can not be defined\nuniquely for observers in relative motion.
