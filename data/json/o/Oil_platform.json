{"cursor":"28357","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"ian coast is a semi-submersible platform. ]] in the North sea]] An 'oil\nplatform', often referred to as an 'offshore platform' or, somewhat incorrectly,\n'oil rig', is a large structure with facilities to drill wells, to extract and\nprocess oil and natural gas, and to temporarily store product until it can be\nbrought to shore for refining and marketing. In many cases, the platform\ncontains facilities to house the workforce as well.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor,\nmay consist of an artificial island, or may float.\n\nRemote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by\numbilical connections; these subsea solutions may consist of one or more subsea\nwells, or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells.\n","linknr":598,"url":"Oil_platform","recorded":1362578998,"links":52,"instances":["offshore_installation_manager","engineering","device","platform","ship","oil_platform","oil_platform","oil_production","oil"],"pdf":["http://www.parliament.uk/post/pn065.pdf"],"categories":["Oil
