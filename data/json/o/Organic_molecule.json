For historical reasons\ndiscussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides,\ncarbonates, simple oxides of carbon (such as CO and CO 2), and\ncyanides, as well as the allotropes of carbon such as diamond and graphite, are\nconsidered inorganic. The distinction between \"organic\" and \"inorganic\" carbon\ncompounds, while \"useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry... is\nsomewhat arbitrary\". Spencer L. Seager, Michael R. Slabaugh.\nChemistry for Today: general, organic, and [[biochemistry]]. Thomson\nBrooks/Cole, '2004', p. 342. ISBN 0-534-39969-X\n\nOrganic chemistry is the science concerned with all aspects of organic\ncompounds. Organic synthesis is the methodology of their preparation.\n","linknr":308,"url":"Organic_molecule","recorded":1362375544,"links":73,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic compounds|","Organic chemistry"],"headings":["History","Classification","Nomenclature","Databases","Structure determination","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Methane-2D-stereo.svg/150px-Methane-2D-stereo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"]],"members":["salt"],"related":["Gas","Liquid","Solid","Chemical_compound","Molecule","Carbon","Carbide","Carbonate","Oxide","Cyanide","Allotropes_of_carbon","Diamond","Graphite","Inorganic_compound","Organic_matter","Inorganic","Spencer_L._Seager","Organic_chemistry","Organic_synthesis","Methodology","Alchemy","Vitalism","Empedocles","Friedrich_Wöhler","Oxalic_acid","Cyanogen","Wöhler_synthesis","Urea","Salt_(chemistry)","Potassium_cyanate","Ammonium_sulfate","Steel","Carbonates","Metal_carbonyls","Oxides","Cyanides","Allotropes_of_carbon","Inorganic_compound","Nomenclature_of_Organic_Chemistry","Benzenehexol","Mesoxalic_acid","Carbon_tetrachloride","Mellitic_acid","Mars","Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Teflon","Tefzel","Haloalkane","Urea","Heteroatom","Organometallic_compound","Metal","Organophosphorus_compound","Phosphorus","Small_molecule","Polymer","Natural_compound","Sugar","Alkaloid","Terpenoid","Vitamin_B12","Stereoisomer","Biochemistry","Antigen","Carbohydrate","Enzymes","Hormones","Lipids","Fatty_acids","Neurotransmitters","Nucleic_acids","Protein","Peptide","Amino_acids","Lectin","Vitamins","Fats_and_oils","Polymer","Plastics","Rubber","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry","Chemical_Abstracts_Service","Reaxys","Medicinal_chemistry","Structure_determination","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","NMR_spectroscopy","X-ray_crystallography","Organometallic_compound","List_of_organic_compounds","List_of_compounds","Inorganic_compound"]}
