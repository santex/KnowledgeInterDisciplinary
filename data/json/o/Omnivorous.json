{"cursor":"13613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\ns are omnivores.]] An 'Omnivore', meaning 'all-eater' (Latin omni, vorare: \"all,\neverything\", \"to devour\"), is a (\"many foods\") species that is a consumer of a\nvariety of material as significant food sources in their natural diet. These\nfoods may include plants, animals, algae and fungi.\n\nOmnivores often are opportunistic, general feeders with neither carnivore nor\nherbivore specializations for acquiring or processing food, and are capable of\nconsuming and do consume both animal protein and vegetation. Many\nomnivores depend on a suitable mix of animal and plant food for long-term good\nhealth and reproduction.\n","linknr":638,"url":"Omnivorous","recorded":1362373558,"links":76,"instances":["food_chain","bird","biology","biology","herbivory","language","ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/greysquirrel-annex.pdf/%24FILE/greysquirrel-annex.pdf","http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/greysquirrel-annex.pdf/%24FILE/greysquirrel-annex.pdf"],"categories":["Eating behaviors"],"headings":["Definition","Omnivorous species","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Corvus_corax_%28FWS%29.jpg/220px-Corvus_corax_%28FWS%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Brown_bears_salmon.jpg/220px-Brown_bears_salmon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg/160px-Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["latin","language"],["consumer","food_chain"],["kingdom","biology"],["order","biology"],["rhea","bird"],["browsing","herbivory"],["productivity","ecology"]],"members":["consumer","rhea","order","kingdom","browsing","latin","productivity"],"related":["Latin_(language)","Consumer_(food_chain)","Food","Plant","Animal","Algae","Fungus","Generalist_and_specialist_species","Carnivore","Herbivore","Fuzzy_logic","Taxonomy","Ecology","Chameleon","Mineral_lick","Kingdom_(biology)","Animal","Plant","Biologist","Philology","Taxon","Taxon","Order_(biology)","Bat","Felidae","Mustelidae","Parasitoid","Ruminant","Larva","Mosquito","Carnivore","Plant","Herbivore","Mammal","Hominidae","Pig","Badger","Bear","Coati","Hedgehog","Opossum","Skunk","Sloth","Squirrel","Raccoon","Chipmunk","Mouse","Rats","Bird","Berry","Nectar","Insect","Worm","Fish","Rodent","Cassowary","Chicken","Crow","Corvidae","Kea","Rallidae","Rhea_(bird)","Lizards","Turtles","Piranha","Catfish","Invertebrate","Bear","Polar_bear","Taxonomic_rank","Carnivora","Carnivore","Wolf","Dog","Dingo","Coyote","Eastern_gray_squirrel","Cyanocobalamin","Browsing_(herbivory)","Carnivore","Consumer-resource_systems","Grazing","List_of_feeding_behaviours","List_of_herbivorous_animals","Plant-based_diet","Pollination","Productivity_(ecology)","Seed_dispersal","Seed_predation","Zhç‰©"]}
