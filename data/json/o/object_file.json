Object files are produced\nby an assembler, compiler, or other language translator, and used as input to\nthe linker, which in turn typically generates an executable or library by\ncombining parts of object files. There are various formats for object files, and\nthe same object code can be packaged in different object files.\n\nIn addition to the object code itself, object files may contain metadata used\nfor linking or debugging, including: information to resolve symbolic cross-\nreferences between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding\ninformation, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"object_file","recorded":1371249437,"links":[],"instances":["computer_programming","computer_science","computing","computing","computing","computer_programming","computer_programming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Executable file formats","Compiler construction","Computer libraries","Programming language implementation"],"headings":["Object file formats","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["assembler","computer_programming"],["translator","computing"],["linker","computing"],["library","software"],["relocation","computer_science"],["comment","computer_programming"],["profiling","computer_programming"],["library","computing"],["relocation","computer_science"],["linker","computing"]],"members":["comment","relocation","linker","translator","library","profiling","assembler"],"related":["Object_code","Machine_code","Assembler_(computer_programming)","Compiler","Translator_(computing)","Linker_(computing)","Executable","Library_(software)","Metadata","Relocation_(computer_science)","Stack_unwinding","Comment_(computer_programming)","Debug_symbol","Profiling_(computer_programming)","File_format","Unix","Porting","COFF","Executable_and_Linkable_Format","Library_(computing)","Executable","Programmer","Responsiveness","Memory_segmentation","Paging","Virtual_memory","COFF","Stabs","DWARF","GNU_Project","Binary_File_Descriptor_library","API","Text_segment","Data_segment","Static_variable","BSS_segment","Relocation_(computer_science)","Dynamic_linking","Linker_(computing)","Object_code"]}
