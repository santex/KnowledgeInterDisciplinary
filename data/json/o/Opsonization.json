{"cursor":"2852","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'opsonin' (from the Latin opsonium, to relish), is any molecule that enhances\nphagocytosis by marking an antigen for an immune response (i.e., causes the\nphagocyte to \"relish\" the marked cell). However, the term is usually used in\nreference to molecules that act as a binding enhancer for the process of\nphagocytosis, especially antibodies, which coat the negatively charged molecules\non the membrane. Molecules that activate the complement system are also\nconsidered opsonins. Phagocytic cells do not have an Fc receptor for IgM, making\nIgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis. However, IgM is extremely efficient\nat activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. Opsonins can\nalso refer to molecules that target a cell for destruction through the action of\nnatural killer (NK) cells.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Opsonization","recorded":1362512988,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system"],"headings":["Mechanism","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Opsonin.png/220px-Opsonin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/IgG_molecular_surface.jpg/55px-IgG_molecular_surface.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Antigen","Phagocytosis","Antibodies","Complement_system","Fc_receptor","Natural_killer_cell","Antigen","Antibody","Complement_system","Antibodies","IgG","IgM","C3b","C4b","IC3b","Mannose-binding_lectin","Antibody_opsonization","Mannan-binding_lectin"]}
