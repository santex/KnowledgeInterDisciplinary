Since the degree of operationalization\ncan vary itself, it can result in a more or less operational\ndefinitions.<ref></ref> The procedures included in definitions should be\nrepeatable by anyone or at least by peers.\n\nAn example of operational definition of the term weight of an object,\noperationalized to a degree, would be the following: \"weight is the numbers that\nappear when that object is placed on a weighing scale\". According to it, the\nweight can be any of the numbers shown on the scale after, including the very\nmoment the object is put on it. Clearly, the inclusion of the moment when one\ncan start reading the numbers on the scale would make it more fully an\noperational definition. Nonetheless, it is still in contrast to those purely\ntheoretical definitions.\n\n the ingredients, time sequences at which every step should be done, and the\n duration of each step.
