The emerging field of\nregenerative medicine is allowing scientists and engineers to create organs to\nbe re-grown from the patient's own cells (stem cells, or cells extracted from\nthe failing organs). Organs and/or tissues that are transplanted within the same\nperson's body are called autografts. Transplants that are recently performed\nbetween two subjects of the same species are called allografts. Allografts can\neither be from a living or cadaveric source.\n\nOrgans that can be transplanted are the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas,\nintestine, and thymus. Tissues include bones, tendons (both referred to as\nmusculoskeletal grafts), cornea, skin, heart valves, and veins. Worldwide, the\nkidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs, followed closely by the liver\nand then the heart. The cornea and musculoskeletal grafts are the most commonly\ntransplanted tissues; these outnumber organ transplants by more than tenfold.\n\nOrgan donors may be living, or brain dead. Tissue may be recovered from donors\nwho are cardiac dead â up to 24 hours past the cessation of heartbeat. Unlike\norgans, most tissues (with the exception of corneas) can be preserved and stored\nfor up to five years, meaning they can be \"banked\". Transplantation raises a\nnumber of bioethical issues, including the definition of death, when and how\nconsent should be given for an organ to be transplanted and payment for organs\nfor transplantation. See WHO Guiding Principles on human cell, tissue and\norgan transplantation, Annexed to [http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A62/A62_15-\nen.pdf World Health Organization, 2008.] Further sources in the\n[http://www.who.int/ethics/en/eth_bibliography_transplantation.pdf Bibliography\non Ethics of the WHO]. Other ethical issues include transplantation\ntourism and more broadly the socio-economic context in which organ harvesting or\ntransplantation may occur. A particular problem is organ trafficking. See\n[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/9/feature0904/en/index.html Organ\ntrafficking and transplantation pose new challenges]. Some organs, such as\nthe brain, cannot yet be transplanted in humans.\n\nIn the United States of America, tissue transplants are regulated by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) which sets strict regulations on the safety\nof the transplants, primarily aimed at the prevention of the spread of\ncommunicable disease. Regulations include criteria for donor screening and\ntesting as well as strict regulations on the processing and distribution of\ntissue grafts. Organ transplants are not regulated by the FDA.\n\nTransplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of\nmodern medicine. Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems\nof transplant rejection, during which the body has an immune response to the\ntransplanted organ, possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to\nimmediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant\nrejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate\ndonor-recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs.\n","linknr":947,"url":"Organ_transplant","recorded":1362510743,"links":75,"instances":["surgeon","magazine","biology","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.istanbulsaglik.gov.tr/w/sb/tedk/pdf/organ_nakli_genel_istatistikler.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A62/A62_15-en.pdf","http://www.who.int/ethics/en/eth_bibliography_transplantation.pdf","http://www.ebmt.org/6NursesGroup/NGdocs/Education2007/Drugs_C_Paillet.pdf","http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/BeckerEliasOrgans(5-06).pdf","http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/Tabarrok%20Comment%20April%202004.pdf","http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/health/Source/2006transplantNWSLTTR_en.pdf","http://www.thelancetglobalhealthnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Health-System-Reform-in-China-CMT-11.pdf","http://www.thelancetglobalhealthnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/Health-System-Reform-in-China-CMT-11.pdf","http://www.cofs.org/COFS-Publications/Budiani_and_Delmonico-AJT_April_2008.pdf","http://www.cofs.org/COFS-Publications/Budiani_and_Delmonico-AJT_April_2008.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A62/A62_15-en.pdf","http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A62/A62_15-en.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
