{"cursor":"73573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in the mitochondrion is the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes.\n The NADH and succinate generated in the citric acid cycle are oxidized,\n releasing energy to power the ATP synthase.]]\n\n'Oxidative phosphorylation' (or OXPHOS in short) is the metabolic pathway in\nwhich the mitochondria in cells use their structure, enzymes, and energy\nreleased by the oxidation of nutrients to move hydrogen from ADP to phosphate to\nreform ATP. Although the many forms of life on earth use a range of different\nnutrients, ATP is the molecule that supplies energy to metabolism. Almost all\naerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably\nso pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared\nto alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.\n\nDuring oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from electron donors\nto electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions\nrelease energy, which is used to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions\nare carried out by a series of protein complexes within the cell's intermembrane\nwall mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the\ncells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron\ntransport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved,\nwhereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of\nelectron donors and acceptors.\n\nThe energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain\nis used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a\nprocess called [[chemiosmosis]]. This generates potential energy in the form of\na pH gradient and an electrical potential across this membrane. This store of\nenergy is tapped by allowing protons to flow back across the membrane and down\nthis gradient, through a large enzyme called ATP synthase. This enzyme uses this\nenergy to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP), in a phosphorylation\nreaction. This reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the rotation\nof a part of the enzyme; the ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor.\n\nAlthough oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, it produces\nreactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which lead to\npropagation of free radicals, damaging cells and contributing to disease and,\npossibly, aging (senescence). The enzymes carrying out this metabolic pathway\nare also the target of many drugs and poisons that inhibit their activities.\n","linknr":1464,"url":"Oxidative_phosphorylation","recorded":1362504990,"links":65,"instances":["electricity","thermodynamics","biochemistry","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/145/8/1817.pdf","http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/145/8/1817.pdf","http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/033/0525/0330525.pdf","http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/033/0525/0330525.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/252/23/8440.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/252/23/8440.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/265/20/11409.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/265/20/11409.pdf","http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/175/10/3020.pdf","http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/175/10/3020.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["Cellular
