{"cursor":"10115","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Overview and Scrutiny' is a function of local authorities in England and Wales.\nIt was introduced by the Local Government Act 2000 which created separate\nExecutive and Overview and Scrutiny functions within councils.\n\nCouncils operating Executive Arrangements are required to create an Overview and\nScrutiny Committee which is composed of councillors who are not on the Executive\nCommittee of that council. Overview and Scrutiny Committees are required to meet\nthe rules on proportionality defined in the Local Government And Housing Act\n1989 (i.e. the committee must reflect the respective sizes of the political\ngroups on the council). Councils which operate Alternative Arrangements are\nrequired to create an Overview and Scrutiny committee which is similarly\npolitically proportionate. (Alternative Arrangements are normally operated by\ncouncils covering an area with a population of less than 85,000 but can also\ninclude larger councils, for example Brighton and Hove until 2008).\n\nSome local authorities subdivide their main Overview and Scrutiny Committee into\nsub-committees, often titled Select Committees after parliamentary practice,\nthough a wide variety of designations and structures are in use.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Overview_and_Scrutiny","recorded":1362665573,"links":10,"instances":["uk","government","westminster_system","government"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Local government in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Functions of Overview and Scrutiny","Since the 2010 General Election","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["executive","government"],["select_committee","westminster_system"],["labour_party","uk"],["cabinet","government"]],"members":["labour_party","cabinet","select_committee","executive"],"related":["Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom","England_and_Wales","Local_Government_Act_2000","Executive_(government)","Executive_Arrangements","Local_Government_And_Housing_Act_1989","Alternative_Arrangements","Brighton_and_Hove","Select_Committee_(Westminster_System)","Parliamentary","Local_Government_Act_2000","Policy_framework","Key_decisions","Forward_Plan","Policy_framework","Her_Majesty's_Government","Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2001","Unitary_authority","County_council","National_Health_Service","Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2001","Police_and_Justice_Act_2006","Local_Government_and_Public_Involvement_in_Health_Act_2007","Local_Democracy,_Economic_Development_and_Construction_Act_2009","Total_Place","Labour_Party_(UK)","Localism_Bill","House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","Royal_Assent","Local_government_in_England","Local_government_in_Wales","Devolved","Report_stage","Local_Government_Act_2000","Councillors","Cabinet_(government)","Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom","Elected_mayors_in_the_United_Kingdom"]}
