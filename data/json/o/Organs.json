The main\ntissue is the one that is unique for the specific organ. For example, the main\ntissue in the heart is the myocardium, while sporadic tissues include the\nnerves, blood and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often\ncooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological\norganisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be\nidentified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional\nanalogues of organs are called organelles.\n\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that is a hollow tube or pouch, such as the\nstomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary\nbladder.
