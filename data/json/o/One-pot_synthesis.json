{"cursor":"2039","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry a 'one-pot synthesis' is a strategy to improve the efficiency of a\nchemical reaction whereby a reactant is subjected to successive chemical\nreactions in just one reactor. This is much desired by chemists because avoiding\na lengthy separation process and purification of the intermediate chemical\ncompounds would save time and resources while increasing chemical yield.\n\nAn example of a one-pot synthesis is the total synthesis of tropinone or the\nGassman indole synthesis. Sequential one-pot syntheses can be used to generate\neven complex targets with multiple stereocentres, such as\noseltamivir, which may significantly shorten the number of steps\nrequired overall and have important commercial implications.\n\nA sequential one-pot synthesis with reagents added to a reactor one at a time\nand without work-up is also called a 'telescoping synthesis'.\n\nIn one such procedure  the reaction of 3-N-tosylaminophenol 'I' with\nacrolein 'II' affords a hydroxyl substituted quinoline 'III' through 4\nsequential steps without workup of the intermediate products The addition\nof acrolein (blue) is a Michael reaction catalyzed by N,N-diisopropylamine, the\npresence of ethanol converts the aldehyde group to an acetal but this process is\nreversed when hydrochloric acid is introduced (red). The enolate reacts as an\nelectrophile in a Friedel-Crafts reaction with ring-closure. The alcohol group\nis eliminated in presence of potassium hydroxide (green) and when in the final\nstep the reaction medium is neutralized to pH 7 (magenta) the tosyl group is\neliminated as well. :\n","linknr":119,"url":"One-pot_synthesis","recorded":1362504779,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical synthesis"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Hydroxyquinoline.png/500px-Hydroxyquinoline.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work-up","chemistry"]],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Reactant","Separation_process","List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry","Chemical_compounds","Chemical_yield","Total_synthesis","Tropinone","Gassman_indole_synthesis","Stereocentre","Oseltamivir","Work-up_(chemistry)","Acrolein","Phenols","Quinoline","Michael_reaction","N,N-diisopropylamine","Ethanol","Aldehyde","Acetal","Hydrochloric_acid","Enolate","Electrophile","Friedel-Crafts_reaction","Alcohol","Elimination_reaction","Potassium_hydroxide","PH","Tosyl"]}
