The expressions involved are usually grammatically singular terms.\nSo, substitution of co-referential expressions into an opaque context does not\nalways preserve truth. For example, \"Lois believes x is a hero\" is an opaque\ncontext because \"Louis believes Superman is a hero\" is true while \"Lois believes\nClark Kent is a hero\" is false, even though 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are co-\nreferential expressions.\n\nThe term is used in philosophical theories of reference, and is to be contrasted\nwith \"referentially transparent context\". In rough outline:\n\n*Opacity: \"Mary believes that Cicero is a great orator\" gives rise to an opaque\ncontext; although Cicero was also called 'Tully', we can't simply substitute\n'Tully' for 'Cicero' in this context (\"Mary believes that Tully is a great\norator\") and guarantee the same truth value, for Mary might not know that the\nnames 'Tully' and 'Cicero' refer to one and the same thing. Of course, if Mary\ndoes believe that Cicero is a great orator, then there is a sense in which Mary\nbelieves that Tully is a great orator, even if she does not know that 'Tully'\nand 'Cicero' corefer. It is the sense forced on us by \"direct reference\"\ntheories of proper names, i.e. those that maintain that the meaning of a proper\nname just is its referent.\n\n*Transparency: \"Cicero was a Roman orator\" gives rise to a transparent context;\nthere is no problem substituting 'Tully' for 'Cicero' here: \"Tully was a Roman\norator\". Both sentences necessarily express the same thing if 'Cicero' and\n'Tully' refer to the same person. Note that this element is missing in the\nopaque contexts, where a shift in the name can result in a sentence that\nexpresses something different from the original.\n\nSimilar usage of the term applies for artificial languages such as programming\nlanguages and logics. The Cicero-Tully example above can be easily adapted.\nUse the notation [t] as a quotation that mentions a term\nt . Define a predicate L to the effect that the\nletters making up a term number six. Then [x] induces an opaque\ncontext, or is 'referentially opaque', because L([Cicero]) is\ntrue while L([Tully]) is false. Programming languages often have\nricher semantics than logics' semantics of truth and falsity, and so an\noperator such as [x] may fail to be referentially transparent for\nother reasons as well.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Opaque_context","recorded":1362553742,"links":18,"instances":["programming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy of language"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/8/8c834d30bbe046c99321eb71949382e5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/5/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/0/d20caec3b48a1eef164cb4ca81ba2587.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/5/3e5314e9fd31509fdeb83faa0f729ba2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/f/1/1f19d4609cc9fd80228ab1fd0182a332.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/7/5b7e0085d88305cd7024625436ed9549.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/5/3e5314e9fd31509fdeb83faa0f729ba2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operator","programming"]],"members":["operator"],"related":["Philosophy","Theory_of_reference","Cicero","Artificial_language","Programming_language","Logic","Operator_(programming)","Masked_man_fallacy","Transitivity_of_identity","W.V.O._Quine","Pure_function","Fuzzy_concept","Saul_Kripke"]}
