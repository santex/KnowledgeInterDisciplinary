{"cursor":"40193","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nMethods of 'outcome-based education' (OBE) are student-centered learning methods\nthat focus on empirically measuring student performance (the \"outcome\"). OBE\ncontrasts with traditional education, which primarily focuses on the resources\nthat are available to the student, which are called inputs. While OBE\nimplementations often incorporate a host of many progressive pedagogical models\nand ideas, such as reform mathematics, block scheduling, project-based learning\nand whole language reading, OBE in itself does not specify or require any\nparticular style of teaching or learning. Instead, it requires that students\ndemonstrate that they have learned the required skills and content. However in\npractice, OBE generally promotes curricula and assessment based on\nconstructivist methods and discourages traditional education approaches based on\ndirect instruction of facts and standard methods.\n\nEach independent education agency specifies its own outcomes and its own methods\nof measuring student achievement according to those outcomes. The results of\nthese measurements can be used for different purposes. For example, one agency\nmay use the information to determine how well the overall education system is\nperforming, and another may use its assessments to determine whether an\nindividual student has learned required material.\n\nOutcome-based methods have been adopted for large numbers of students in several\ncountries. In the United States, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills started\nin 1991. In Australia, implementation of OBE in Western Australia was widely\ncriticised by parents and teachers and was\nmostly dropped in January 2007. In South Africa, OBE\nwas dropped in mid 2010. On a smaller scale, some OBE\npractices, such as not passing a student who does not know the required\nmaterial, have been used by individual teachers around the world for centuries.\n\nOBE was a popular term in the United States during the 1980s and early 1990s.\nIt is also called 'mastery education', 'performance-based education', and\nother names.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Outcome-based_education","recorded":1362576145,"links":25,"instances":["psychological_school","education","remuneration"],"pdf":["http://www.utar.edu.my/fes/file/OBE.pdf","http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/testing/writing/9798writing.pdf","http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/testing/writing/9798writing.pdf","http://www.wcer.wisc.edu/archive/nise/Publications/Occasional_Papers/vol5.pdf","http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/OtherPDFs/B_to_B_Reform_Iserbyt_book.pdf"],"categories":["Education reform","Curricula","Philosophy of education","Pedagogy","High school diploma","Standards-based education","Critical pedagogy","Performance management"],"headings":["What is OBE?","Claims in favor of OBE","Criticism","OBE programs","Performance-based economy","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["constructivism","learning_theory"],["constructivism","psychological_school"],["clas","education"],["commission","remuneration"]],"members":["constructivism","clas","commission"],"related":["Student-centered_learning","Empirical","Traditional_education","Reform_mathematics","Block_scheduling","Project-based_learning","Whole_language","Constructivism_(learning_theory)","Traditional_education","Direct_instruction","United_States","Texas_Assessment_of_Academic_Skills","Australia","Western_Australia","South_Africa","Means","Aristotle","Four_causes","Efficient_cause","Final_cause","Curriculum_framework","Diploma","Standards-based_assessment","Outcomes","Shakespeare","Shakespearean_tragedy","National_Science_Education_Standards","NCTM","Principles_and_Standards_for_School_Mathematics","Grading_on_a_curve","Traditional_education","Social_promotion","Grade_retention","Norm-referenced_test","Social_promotion","Continuous_improvement","Normal_distribution","World_class_standards","21st_Century_Skills","Illiterate","Innumerate","Grade_inflation","IQ_tests","Standardized_test","High-stakes_test","Norm-referenced_test","Vocational_training","Social_promotion","Washington_Assessment_of_Student_Learning","Skip_counting","Creationism","Constructivism_(psychological_school)","Inquiry-based_science","Tax_reform","School_to_work","Internship","Tertiary_Entrance_Rank","Significant_digits","William_Spady","New_courses_of_study","Ljiljanna_Ravlich","South_Africa","Apartheid","Curriculum_2005","Texas_Assessment_of_Academic_Skills","Washington_Assessment_of_Student_Learning","CLAS_(education)","Massachusetts_Comprehensive_Assessment_System","Goals_2000","No_Child_Left_Behind_Act","High_school_graduation_examination_in_the_United_States","High-stakes_test","High_school_diploma","Hauptschule","Construction","Allied_health_professions","Business","European_Commission","Washington_Accord","Piecework","Commission_(remuneration)","Seniority","Civil_service_examination","Dropping_out","Apprenticeship","Mastery_learning","Traditional_mathematics","Washington_Accord","Lanyrd"]}
