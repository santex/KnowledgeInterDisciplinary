{"cursor":"2877","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Optimization', in computer and table-top role-playing games, is a term intended\nto describe a play style or set of play styles alternately referred to by the\nterms munchkin gaming, powergaming, min-maxing, \"roll-playing\", or twinking, but\nwithout the pejorative connotation of those terms. The core idea of optimization\nas a play style is that of deriving enjoyment from choosing and benefiting from\nthe game mechanical options that best optimize one's character's performance for\nsome specific purposeâ€”most commonly, speed of power or wealth\naccumulation. Players who primarily enjoy this play style are called\n'optimizers'. This reflects, at least in large part, an effort by game\ndevelopers and operators to recognize and validate this style of play, and to be\nable to discuss it and the players who enjoy it without resorting to the\ntraditional, pejorative terms.\n\nIn the Bartle taxonomy of gamer styles, Achievers (\"Diamonds\") are most\ntypically enthusiastic optimizers, while the play style of Socializers\n(\"Hearts\") is the most distant from (and generally antipathic to) optimization.\nExplorers (\"Spades\") generally enjoy discovering the best methods of\noptimization, but may be more interested in continued experimentation than in\nconsistently applying those methods. Killers (\"Clubs\") have a complex\nrelationship with optimization. To whatever extent the game style rewards\noptimization with power, Killers will appear to be optimizers as they work to\nmaintain their competitiveness. Insofar as Killers optimize in player versus\nenvironment (PvE) play, though, the driving force is typically not a positive\nenjoyment of optimization, but a desire to \"get through the boring parts\" as\nrapidly as possible, reducing time spent grinding, and reach what is, to them,\nthe \"real\" game, player versus player (PvP) conflict. PvP play, depending on the\ngame style, may have a strong optimization element, providing an \"ultimate\" test\nof one player's optimization skills against another's, but this is de-emphasized\nin games where PvP success depends more on non-game-mechanical factors such as\nthe player's reaction time and tactical adaptability. Killers who are also\noptimizers, then, tend to find more enjoyment in games where characters'\nstatistics more strongly predict who will win in combat. Non-optimizer Killers,\non the other hand, tend to prefer games where conflict outcomes are determined\nmore by the player than the character, and may actively dislike games that\nreward optimization.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Optimization_(role-playing_games)","recorded":1374780649,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Role-playing_game","/wiki/Munchkin_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Powergaming","/wiki/Min-maxing","/wiki/Twinking","/wiki/Game_mechanics","/wiki/Bartle_Test","/wiki/Player_versus_environment","/wiki/Grinding_(video_gaming)","/wiki/Player_versus_player","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Munchkin_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Powerleveling","/wiki/Powergaming","/wiki/Min-maxing","/wiki/Twinking","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&oldid=422557214","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Role-playing_game_terminology","/wiki/Category:Video_game_gameplay","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_March_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Optimization+%28role-playing+games%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Optimization+%28role-playing+games%29","/wiki/Optimization_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Talk:Optimization_(role-playing_games)","#","/wiki/Optimization_(role-playing_games)","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Optimization_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Optimization_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&oldid=422557214","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7098965","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Optimization_%28role-playing_games%29&id=422557214","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Optimization+%28role-playing+games%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Optimization+%28role-playing+games%29&oldid=422557214&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Optimization_(role-playing_games)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7098965#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(role-playing_games)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["video_gaming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Role-playing
