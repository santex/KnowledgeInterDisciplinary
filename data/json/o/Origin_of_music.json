Prehistoric music is\nfollowed by ancient music in different parts of the world, but still exists in\nisolated areas.\n\nPrehistoric music thus technically includes all of the worldâs music that has\nexisted before the advent of any currently-extant historical sources concerning\nthat music of the early stage of development of the human. However, it is more\ncommon to refer to the \"prehistoric\" music which still survives as folk,\nindigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other\nperiods within Music Archaeology.\n","linknr":812,"url":"Origin_of_music","recorded":1362373317,"links":35,"instances":["music","sound","music","instrument"],"pdf":["http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf","http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf","http://vogelwarte.mpg.de/documents/leitner/Behaviour2.pdf","http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf","http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf","http://www.uni-graz.at/richard.parncutt/publications/Pa08_prenatal_musicaescientiae.pdf","http://www.uni-graz.at/richard.parncutt/publications/Pa08_prenatal_musicaescientiae.pdf","http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/musicae.pdf","http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/PDF/musicae.pdf","http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf","http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf"],"categories":["Ancient music","Ethnomusicology","Paleolithic"],"headings":["Origins","Prehistoric musical instruments","Flutes","Archaeoacoustic methodology","Cycladic culture","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Cycladic_idol_03_2_retouched.jpg/220px-Cycladic_idol_03_2_retouched.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["repetition","music"],["hum","sound"],["bullroarer","music"],["gudi","instrument"]],"members":["bullroarer","hum","repetition","gudi"],"related":["History_of_music","Music","Literate","Prehistory","Geological_history","Ancient_music","Folk_music","Music_Archaeology","Sound","Rhythm","Phenomena","Patterns","Repetition_(music)","Tonality","Sound_mimesis_in_various_cultures","Imitation_of_sounds_in_shamanism","Monkey","Territorialism","Dialogue","Zoomusicology","Intentionality","Emotion","Altered_state_of_awareness","Motherese","Fetus","Mother","Infant","Communication","Charles_Darwin","Sexual_selection","Honest_signal","Handicap_principle","Singing","Dancing","Female_choice","Cooperative_breeding","Songbird","Australia","Africa","Butcherbird","Malurus","White-browed_sparrow_weaver","Joseph_Jordania","Battle_trance","Collective_identity","Trance","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Shamanistic","Ritual","Battle_cry","Jordania","Humming","Musical_instrument","Human_voice","Singing","Hum_(sound)","Whistling","Click_consonant","Cough","Yawn","Neanderthal","Hyoid","Paleolithic_flutes","Percussion_instruments","Clapping","Rhythm","Paleolithic","Phalanges","Whistle","Bullroarer_(music)","Rasp","Oldowan","Paleolithic","Anthropological","Archaeological","Hominidae","Noise","Greece","Salpinx","Aulos","Ancient_Greece","Ravana","Ravanahatha","Sri_Lanka","Ravanahatha","Rajasthan","Dinesh_Subasinghe","Ravanahatha","Flute","Divje_Babe_flute","Slovenia","Femur","Cave_bear","Geißenklösterle","Hohle_Fels","Ulm","Germany","Venus_of_Hohle_Fels","Human","Neanderthals","Wicklow","Ireland","Gudi_(instrument)","Jiahu","Red-crowned_crane","Xia_Zhi","Qing_Shang","Chinese_musical_system","Archaeoacoustics","Keros","Neolithic","Early_Cycladic_culture","Aulos","Lyre","Harp","Mythology","Ancient_music","Behavioral_modernity","Cognitive_neuroscience_of_music","Evolutionary_musicology","International_Study_Group_on_Music_Archaeology","Onomatopoeia","Origin_of_language","Origins_of_religion","Prehistoric_art","Sound_symbolism","Ethnopoetics","Jerome_Rothenberg","Steven_Mithen","Suzanne_Haik_Vantoura"]}
