Such usage is still reflected today in the\nOrthodox liturgy, e.g. \"unite them to your Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church\"\n(from the litany of the catechumens, Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom). Current\nconvention however, favors the name \"Orthodox Church\", perhaps partly to avoid\nconfusion with the Roman Catholic Church, especially its Eastern rites. But,\nespecially in official contexts, the Orthodox Church continues to use the title\n\"Catholic Church\", and Orthodox authorities such as Saint Raphael of Brooklyn\nhave asserted that the full name of the church includes the term \"Catholic\" as\nin [http://books.google.com/books?id=oeKOUb6OcG4C&pg=PA101&dq=%22The+Church+of+-\nthe+East+has+never+from+the+first+been+known+by+any+other+name+than+Catholic,+n-\nor+has+she+set+aside+this+title+in+any+official+document.%22&lr= \"Holy Orthodox\nCatholic Apostolic Church\"].

Thus, Orthodox Christians throughout the world\nuse various ethnic or national titles: \"Greek\", \"Russian\", \"Serbian\",\n\"Romanian\", \"Ukrainian\", \"Bulgarian\", \"Antiochian\", \"Albanian\", \"Carpatho-\nRussian\", or more inclusively, as \"Eastern Orthodox\"\n([http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7061 Rev. Alciviadis C. Calivas, \"The\nGreek (Eastern) Orthodox Church. What's in our name?\").] is the second\nlargest Christian church in the world, with an\nestimated 225â300 million adherents, primarily in Eastern\nand Southeastern Europe and the Middle East. It is the religious affiliation of\nthe majority of the populations of Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece,\nMacedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine;\nsignificant minority populations exist in Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and Syria. It\nteaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church established by\nJesus Christ in his Great Commission The Holy Bible: Matthew 28:16-20, Mark\n16:14-18, Luke 24:44-49 to the disciples almost 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe Church's structure is composed of several self-governing ecclesial bodies,\neach geographically (and often nationally) distinct but unified in theology and\nworship. Each self-governing body (autocephalous jurisdiction), often but not\nalways encompassing a nation, is shepherded by a Holy Synod whose duty, among\nother things, is to preserve and teach the apostolic and traditions and related\nchurch practices. Like the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, Assyrian\nChurch of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy and some other churches, Orthodox bishops\ntrace their lineage back to the apostles through the process of apostolic\nsuccession.\n\nThe Orthodox Church traces its development back to the earliest church\nestablished by St. Paul and the Apostles, through the ancient Roman Empire and\nits continuation the Byzantine Empire. It regards itself\nas the historical and organic continuation of the original Church founded by\nChrist and His apostles. Ware, p. 8 It practices what it understands\nto be the original faith passed down from the Apostles (that faith which has\nbeen believed everywhere, always, and by all, namely Holy Tradition), believing\nin growth and development without alteration of the faith. In non-doctrinal, non-\nliturgical matters the church has always shared in local cultures, adopting or\nadapting (conventional) traditions from among practices it found to be\ncompatible with the Christian life, and in turn shaping the cultural development\nof the nations around it, including Greek, Slavic, Middle Eastern, North\nAfrican, British, Saxon, and Celtic peoples. (For an example, see Yule log).\n\nThrough baptism, Orthodox Christians enter a new life of salvation through\nrepentance, whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the\nHoly Spirit. Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person,\nthrough the imitation of Christ and [[hesychasm]], Metropolitan Hierotheos\nof Nafpaktos, The mind of the Orthodox Church, 2000, Glossary cultivates\nthe practice of unceasing prayer (often with use of the Jesus Prayer). This life\noccurs within the life of the church as a member of the Body of\nChrist. Archimandrite George, Abbot of the Holy Monastery of St. Gregorios\non Mount Athos, Theosis, 2006, p. 34 It is through the fire of God's love\nin the action of the Holy Spirit that the Christian becomes more holy, more\nwholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the\nnext. \"http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7114\"; Deification\". Cross, F.\nL., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press. 2005 Born in God's image, each person is called to\ntheosis, fulfillment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having\ndivinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by\ncooperatively accepting His gift of grace. Archimandrite George, Abbot of\nthe Holy Monastery of St. Gregorios on Mount Athos, Theosis, 2006, p. 21\n\nThe Orthodox Church, in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ, and\nsimilarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in\nChrist of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ's\nmembers, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have\npassed on to the heavenly life. The church includes the Christian saints from\nall times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant,\nAdam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts. Metropolitan Hierotheos of\nNafpaktos, The mind of the Orthodox Church, 2000, pp. 25-30 In orthodox\nservices, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as\none community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins\nheaven to earth. This unity of the Church is sometimes called the communion of\nthe saints.
