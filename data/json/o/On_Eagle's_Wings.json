{"cursor":"2406","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'On Eagles' Wings' is a devotional song composed by Michael Joncas, a priest, in\n1979 after Vatican Council II, when the Catholic Church began using vernacular\nhymns at Mass. Its words are loosely based on Psalm 91 and . The song was then\npublished by North American Liturgy Resources and was later purchased by New\nDawn Music, a subsidiary of Oregon Catholic Press. It quickly proved to be quite\npopular as a contemplative song at Catholic Masses as well as at Protestant\nservices; it is now sung in churches of many denominations including Pentecostal\nchurches and was performed at many of the funerals of victims of September 11.\nIt is often performed either at the beginning or the ending of a Roman Catholic\nFuneral Mass.\n\nFr. Joncas has stated that his preference for the title would be \"On Eagle's\nWings,\" indicating that the wings belong to a single eagle which is\nmetaphorically related to God, but he said he could make an argument for \"On\nEagles' Wings,\" indicating wings that belong to many eagles, since there would\nbe many wings needed to lift up the multiple people in covenant with God.\n\nLyrics:\n\nYou who dwell in the shelter of the Lord, Who abide in His shadow for\nlife, Say to the Lord, \"My Refuge, My Rock in Whom I trust.\"\n\nCHORUS: And He will raise you up on eagle's wings, Bear you on the\nbreath of dawn, Make you to shine like the sun, And hold you in the\npalm of His Hand.\n\nThe snare of the fowler will never capture you, And famine will bring you\nno fear; Under His Wings your refuge, His faithfulness your\nshield.\n\nCHORUS\n\nYou need not fear the terror of the night, Nor the arrow that flies by\nday, Though thousands fall about you, Near you it shall not\ncome.\n\nCHORUS\n\nFor to His angels He's given a command, To guard you in all of your\nways, Upon their hands they will bear you up, Lest you dash your\nfoot against a stone.\n\nCHORUS And hold you in the palm of His Hand.\n","linknr":114,"url":"On_Eagle's_Wings","recorded":1375083501,"links":["/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merge","/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect","/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy","http://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22&num=50","http://www.google.com/search?q=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22&tbm=nws&tbs=ar:1","http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22","http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22","http://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22&acc=on&wc=on","http://images.google.com/images?safe=off&as_rights=(cc_publicdomain%7ccc_attribute%7ccc_sharealike%7ccc_noncommercial%7ccc_nonderived)&q=%22On+Eagle%26%2339%3Bs+Wings%22","/wiki/Michael_Joncas","/wiki/Vatican_Council_II","/wiki/Psalm_91","/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah","/wiki/Liturgy","/wiki/Oregon_Catholic_Press","/wiki/Catholic","/wiki/Protestant","/wiki/Pentecostal","/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks","/wiki/Catholic_Funeral","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit&section=1","http://www.ocp.org/songs/1526","/wiki/File:Musical_notes.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Musical_notes.svg/30px-Musical_notes.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit","/wiki/Template:1970s-song-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:1970s-song-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1970s-song-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&oldid=560050466","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Contemporary_Catholic_music","/wiki/Category:1979_songs","/wiki/Category:1970s_song_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_topics_of_unclear_notability","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=On+Eagle%27s+Wings&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=On+Eagle%27s+Wings","/wiki/On_Eagle%27s_Wings","/wiki/Talk:On_Eagle%27s_Wings","#","/wiki/On_Eagle%27s_Wings","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/On_Eagle%27s_Wings","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/On_Eagle%27s_Wings","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&oldid=560050466","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7090961","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&id=560050466","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=On+Eagle%27s+Wings","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=On+Eagle%27s+Wings&oldid=560050466&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=On_Eagle%27s_Wings&printable=yes","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B7%B2%E3%81%AE%E7%BF%BC","#","/
