      "text" : " of Himachal Pradesh, India]] 'Outdoor recreation' or 'outdoor activity' is\n leisure pursuits engaged in the outdoors, especially in (but not limited to)\n natural or semi-natural settings out of town. Examples include adventure\n racing, backpacking, bicycling, camping, canoeing, canyoning, caving,\n fishing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, kayaking, mountaineering,\n photography, adventure park, rock climbing, running, sailing, skiing, and\n surfing. Outdoor recreation may also refer to a team sport game or practice\n held in an outdoor setting.\n\nThe two primary purposes for outdoor recreation are beneficial use and\npleasurable appreciation.<ref name = Rolston_1985>Rolston, H III. 1985. Valuing\nwildlands. Env. Ethics.7 (1): 23-48</ref><ref name = Rolston_1988>Rolston, H\nIII. 1988. Environmental ethics: Duties to and values in the natural world.\nPhiladelphia, PA: Temple University Press.</ref>\n\nBeneficial use is related to the physical and social rewards that goal-directed\nactivity instills in individuals or groups. Some outdoor goal-directed\nactivities are: backpacking, canoeing, canyoning, caving, climbing, hiking, hill\nwalking, hunting, kayaking, and rafting. Arguably broader groupings of goal-\ndirected outdoor activities would include water sports, snow sports, and\nhorseback riding. Goal-directed outdoor activities are predominately physical,\nthough they may also be mentally, emotionally, and spiritually rewarding. The\noutdoors as a physical or social setting may meet the needs of physical health,\nself-sufficiency, risk-taking, the building of social ties (including\nteambuilding), and the needs of achievement (such as practicing, enhancing and\nchallenging skills, testing stamina and endurance, and seeking adventure or\nexcitement). The outdoors can be an environment in which people \"show what they\ncan do\".<ref name = Rolston_1988 />\n\n\nPleasurable appreciation encourages experiences of being \"let in on natures\nshow\".<ref name = Rolston_1988 /> Enhancement of inner perceptual and/or\nspiritual life may be experienced through outdoor activities and outdoor-related\nactivities such as nature study, aesthetic contemplation, meditation, painting,\nphotography, archeological or historical research, and indigenous culture among\nothers. These activities may also be physically rewarding.\n\nMany people in modern civilizations believe that the value of nature is found\nonly in its \"utilitarian value\" (beneficial use). They would discount the inner\nperceptual and/or spiritual benefits of the \"intrinsic value of nature\" that may\nbe experienced during pleasurable appreciation.\n\nOutdoor activities may also be pursued for the purposes of finding peace in\nnature, enjoying life, and relaxing. They are alternatives to expensive forms of\ntourism. Outdoor activities are also frequently used as a medium in education\nand teambuilding.\n",
