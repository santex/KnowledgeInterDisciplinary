Not to be confused with the\nphilosophy concepts of [[ontology]], or the medical term [[oncology]], and\n[[odontology]]\n\n'Ontogeny' (also 'ontogenesis' or '[[morphogenesis]]') is the origin and the\ndevelopment of an organism â for example: from the fertilized egg to mature\nform. It covers in essence, the study of an organism's lifespan. The word\n\"ontogeny\" comes from the Greek á½Î½ÏÎ¿Ï, ontos, present participle singular of\nÎµá¼¶Î½Î±Î¹, \"to be\"; and from the suffix -geny, which expresses the concept of \"mode\nof production\". See -geny in the Oxford English Dictionary, second edition,\n1989; online version March 2011, accessed 09 May 2011. Earlier version first\npublished in New English Dictionary, 1898.  In more general terms,\nontogeny is defined as the history of structural change in a unity, which can be\na cell, an organism, or a society of organisms, without the loss of the\norganization which allows that unity to exist. Maturana, H. R., Varela F. J.\n(1987). The Tree of Knowledge: The Biological Roots of Human Understanding.\nBoston: Shambhala Publications Inc., page 74 More recently, the term\nontogeny has been used in cell biology to describe the development of various\ncell types within an organism.\n\nOntogeny comprises a field of study in disciplines such as developmental\nbiology, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience, and\ndevelopmental psychobiology.\n\nWithin biology, ontogeny pertains to the developmental history of an organism\nwithin its own lifetime, as distinct from phylogeny, which refers to the\nevolutionary history of species. In practice, writers on evolution often speak\nof species as \"developing\" traits or characteristics. This can be misleading.\nWhile developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent\nevolutionary (e.g., phylogenetic) processes Gould, S.J. (1977). Ontogeny and\nPhylogeny. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University\nPress (see evolutionary developmental biology), individual organisms\ndevelop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny).\n","linknr":201,"url":"Ontogeny","recorded":1362373297,"links":51,"instances":["psychoanalysis","psychoanalysis"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":["See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/HumanEmbryogenesis.svg/300px-HumanEmbryogenesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Human_embryo_8_weeks_2.JPG/300px-Human_embryo_8_weeks_2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/15px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Anatomy_of_an_egg_unlabeled_horizontal.svg/30px-Anatomy_of_an_egg_unlabeled_horizontal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ontogeny","psychoanalysis"],["phylogeny","psychoanalysis"]],"members":["phylogeny","ontogeny"],"related":["Organism","Fertilisation","Ovum","Mature","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Humberto_Maturana","Francisco_Varela","Cell_biology","Cell_types","Developmental_biology","Developmental_psychology","Developmental_cognitive_neuroscience","Developmental_psychobiology","Phylogeny","Evolution","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Recapitulation_theory","Phylogeny","Organogenesis","Ontogeny_(psychoanalysis)","Phylogenetics","Phylogeny_(psychoanalysis)","Apoptosis"]}
