''Top''': An operator\nis a segment of DNA that acts as an on/off switch for transcription. The gene is\nessentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the\nrepressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding\nto the promoter and making lactase. 'Bottom': The gene is turned on. Lactose is\ninhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter,\nand express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will\ndigest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The\nrepressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase.]]\nIn genetics, an 'operator' is a segment of DNA to which a transcription factor\nprotein binds. It is classically defined in the ''lac'' operon as a segment\nbetween the promoter and the genes of the operon. In the case of a repressor,\nthe repressor protein physically obstructs the RNA polymerase from transcribing\nthe genes. An inducer (protein) can displace a repressor (protein) from the\noperator site (DNA), which results in an uninhibited operon.\n\nAlso, an operator regulates \"gene expression.\"\n","linknr":91,"url":"Operator_(biology)","recorded":1362538367,"links":17,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Regulatory sequences"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Lac_Operon.svg/250px-Lac_Operon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["promoter","transcription"],"related":["Genetics","DNA","Transcription_factor","Lac_operon","Promoter_(biology)","Operon","Repressor","Repressor","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_(genetics)","Genes","Inducer","Repressor","Operon"]}
