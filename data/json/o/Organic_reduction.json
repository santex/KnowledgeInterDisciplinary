In organic chemistry\noxidations and reductions are different from ordinary redox reactions because\nmany reactions carry the name but do not actually involve electron transfer in\nthe electrochemical sense of the word. March Jerry; (1885).\nAdvanced Organic Chemistry reactions, mechanisms and structure (3rd ed.). New\nYork: John Wiley & Sons, inc. ISBN 0-471-85472-7 \n\nSimple functional groups can be arranged in order of increasing oxidation state.\nThe oxidation numbers are only an approximation:\n* oxidation number -4 for alkanes,\n* oxidation number -2 for alkenes, alcohols, alkyl halides, amines,\n* oxidation number 0 for alkynes, ketones, aldehydes, geminal diols,\n* oxidation number +2 for carboxylic acids, amides, chloroform and\n* oxidation number +4 for carbon dioxide, tetrachloromethane.\n\nMethane is oxidized to carbon dioxide because the oxidation number changes from\n-4 to +4. Classical reductions include alkene reduction to alkanes and classical\noxidations include oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. In oxidations electrons\nare removed and the electron density of a molecule is reduced. In reductions\nelectron density increases when electrons are added to the molecule. This\nterminology is always centered around the organic compound. For example, it is\nusual to refer to the reduction of a ketone by lithium aluminium hydride, but\nnot to the oxidation of lithium aluminium hydride by a ketone. Many oxidations\ninvolve removal of hydrogen atoms from the organic molecule, and the reverse\nreduction adds hydrogens to an organic molecule.\n\nMany reactions classified as reductions also appear in other classes. For\ninstance conversion of the ketone to an alcohol by lithium aluminium hydride can\nbe considered a reduction but the hydride is also a good nucleophile in\nnucleophilic substitution. Many redox reactions in organic chemistry have\ncoupling reaction reaction mechanism involving free radical intermediates. True\norganic redox chemistry can be found in electrochemical organic synthesis or\nelectrosynthesis.
