{"cursor":"13677","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'optical cavity' or 'optical resonator' is an arrangement of mirrors that\nforms a standing wave cavity resonator for light waves. Optical cavities are a\nmajor component of lasers, surrounding the gain medium and providing feedback of\nthe laser light. They are also used in optical parametric oscillators and some\ninterferometers. Light confined in the cavity reflect multiple times producing\nstanding waves for certain resonance frequencies. The standing wave patterns\nproduced are called modes; longitudinal modes differ only in frequency while\ntransverse modes differ for different frequencies and have different intensity\npatterns across the cross section of the beam.\n\nDifferent resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two\nmirrors and the distance between them. (Flat mirrors are not often used\nbecause of the difficulty of aligning them to the needed precision.) The\ngeometry (resonator type) must be chosen so that the beam remains stable (that\nthe size of the beam does not continually grow with multiple reflections).\nResonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam\nwaist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point)\ninside the cavity.\n\nOptical cavities are designed to have a large Q factor; a beam will\nreflect a very large number of times with little attenuation. Therefore the\nfrequency line width of the beam is very small indeed compared to the frequency\nof the laser.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Optical_cavity","recorded":1362485956,"links":50,"instances":["waves","optics","wave_propagation","optics","physics","optics"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070107170320/http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_1.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_1.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070107170320/http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_1.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070107170308/http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_2.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_2.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070107170308/http://www.stanford.edu/~siegman/beams_and_resonators_2.pdf"],"categories":["Optical devices|Cavity, optical","Laser science"],"headings":["Resonator modes","Resonator types","Spherical cavity","Stability","Practical resonators","Optical delay lines","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Optical-cavity1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Laser_resonator_stability.svg/300px-Laser_resonator_stability.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/9/709a24f95dac898a916c46d92b7ce569.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/f/cef6d90700d2cf52013f7ca094d9b92b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interference","wave_propagation"],["intensity","physics"],["filter","optics"],["prism","optics"],["coma","optics"],["polarization","waves"]],"members":["polarization","filter","interference","prism","intensity","coma"],"related":["Mirror","Standing_wave","Cavity_resonator","Light_wave","Laser","Gain_medium","Feedback","Optical_parametric_oscillator","Interferometer","Standing_wave","Resonance","Longitudinal_mode","Transverse_mode","Q_factor","Attenuation","Line_width","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Frequency","Longitudinal_mode","Transverse_mode","Intensity_(physics)","Gaussian_beam","Fabry–Pérot_interferometer","Arcseconds","Optical_microcavity","Semiconductor_laser","Optical_coating","Fabry–Pérot_interferometer","Diffraction","Richard_K._Chang","Lasing","Ethanol","Microdroplets","Rhodamine_6G","Dye","Optical_resonances","Wavelength","Refractive_index","Morphology-dependent_resonance","Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis","Amplified_spontaneous_emission","Optical_path_length","Collimated","Gaussian_beam","Hermite_polynomials","Ince_polynomials","Acousto-optic_modulator","Cavity_dumping","Vacuum","Spatial_filter","Transverse_mode","Filter_(optics)","Prism_(optics)","Diffraction_grating","Aberration_in_optical_systems","Brewster's_angle","Coma_(optics)","Optical_fibre","Delay_line","Polarization_(waves)","Gaussian_beam","Optical_feedback","Multiple-prism_grating_laser_oscillator","Springer_Verlag"]}
