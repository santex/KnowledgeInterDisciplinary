However, \"relatively high,\" in the case\nof ozone, is still very small with regard to ordinary oxygen, and is less than\nten parts per million, with the average ozone concentration in Earth's\natmosphere being only about 0.6 parts per million. The ozone layer is mainly\nfound in the lower portion of the stratosphere from approximately above Earth,\nthough the thickness varies seasonally and geographically.\n\nThe ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry\nand Henri Buisson. Its properties were explored in detail by the British\nmeteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer (the\nDobsonmeter) that could be used to measure stratospheric ozone from the ground.\nBetween 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring\nstations, which continue to operate to this day. The \"Dobson unit\", a convenient\nmeasure of the columnar density of ozone overhead, is named in his honor.\n\nThe ozone layer absorbs 97â99% of the Sun's medium-frequency ultraviolet light\n(from about 200 nm to 315 nm wavelength), which potentially damages\nexposed life forms on Earth.\n\n in the ozone layer.]]\n","linknr":297,"url":"Ozone_layer","recorded":1362477486,"links":85,"instances":["mathematician","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://yly-mac.gps.caltech.edu/N2O/Prasad/Matsumi_O3_cr0205255%20copy.pdf"],"categories":["Oxygen","Ozone depletion","Atmosphere of Earth","Ozone"],"headings":["Origin of ozone","Ultraviolet light and ozone","Distribution of ozone in the stratosphere","Ozone depletion","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Ozone_cycle.svg/350px-Ozone_cycle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ozone_solar_UV_absorb_DNA_action.jpg/300px-Ozone_solar_UV_absorb_DNA_action.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Ozone_altitude_UV_graph.svg/300px-Ozone_altitude_UV_graph.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Nimbus_ozone_Brewer-Dobson_circulation.jpg/300px-Nimbus_ozone_Brewer-Dobson_circulation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Future_ozone_layer_concentrations.gif/400px-Future_ozone_layer_concentrations.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sydney_chapman","mathematician"],["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["sydney_chapman","radical"],"related":["Earth's_atmosphere","Ozone","Stratosphere","Charles_Fabry","Henri_Buisson","G._M._B._Dobson","Spectrophotometry","Dobson_spectrometer","Dobson_unit","Area_density","Sun","Ultraviolet_light","Sydney_Chapman_(mathematician)","Ultraviolet_light","Oxygen","Molecule","Atom","Ozone-oxygen_cycle","Stratosphere","Wavelength","Nano-metre","Sunburn","Skin_cancer","Ultraviolet","Brewer-Dobson_circulation","Ozone_hole","United_States","Nitric_oxide","Nitrous_oxide","Hydroxyl","Chlorine","Bromine","Chemical_species","Organohalogen","Chlorofluorocarbon","Haloalkane","Stratosphere","Radical_(chemistry)","Northern_hemisphere","Ozone_hole","Nitrous_oxide","United_States","Canada","Norway","Chlorofluorocarbon","Aerosol_spray","Ozone_hole","Montreal_Protocol","American_Geophysical_Union","Hydrochlorofluorocarbon","OzonAction_Programme"]}
