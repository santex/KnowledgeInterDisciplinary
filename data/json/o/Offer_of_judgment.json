{"cursor":"3527","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Offer of Judgment rule' is a tort reform law aimed at controlling\nunnecessary litigation and at encouraging settlement. Under this rule, if a\nsettlement offer designated as an offer of judgment is made in civil litigation,\nthe offer is rejected and the final court decision is less favorable than the\nfinal offer that was made, then the party who rejected the offer is subject to\ncertain penalties.\n\nThe penalties vary by state, but often include some combination of an award to\nthe other party of certain attorneys' fees, compensable litigation costs and\nprejudgment interest. Most jurisdictions limit these awards to fees, costs and\ninterest accumulated after the offer is made or rejected. In addition, the party\nwho rejected the offer may lose their entitlement to certain attorneys' fees,\ncompensable litigation costs and prejudment interest. Here again, most\njurisdictions provide that the party who rejected the offer loses no more than\ntheir entitlement to the attorneys' fees, costs and interest incurred after the\nmaking or rejection of the settlement offer.\n\nThe rule is not applicable in divorce proceedings or child custody proceedings.\n\nThis rule was first introduced in a number of states in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries, subsequently adopted in 1938 in the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, and is currently designated as Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Many states have modified the rule by varying degrees. A survey of\nstate Offer of Judgement Provisions has been compiled by the American College of\nTrial Lawyers and indicates the use by each state. In the U.S. state of Maryland\nthe rule is only applicable to medical malpractice cases.\n\nThis rule became law in the U.S. state of Georgia on 27 April 2006. In Georgia,\nthe threshold was set such that the final court decision must be no more than\n25% less favorable than the last settlement offer or the rejector becomes liable\nfor attorney fees. However, the Georgia Supreme Court struck the statute down in\n2007, on the ground that it purported to act retroactively and was therefore\nunconstitutional. Fowler Properties, Inc. v. Dowland, 282 Ga. 76\n(2007)\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court's 1998 adoption of a replacement offer of judgment rule\nin NRCP 68 introduced a tremendous degree of flexibility to parties that choose\nto serve offers of judgment. This high degree of flexibility is unique to\nNevada, and it has greatly complicated Nevada's offer of judgment law. In\ndeparting from prior law and from the practice in every other state, the 1998\nRule allows for the following: unapportioned offers of judgment may be served to\nmultiple parties under limited circumstances; any unrelated parties may serve an\nunapportioned offer to any party; a party may draft an offer for a lump sum or\nfor an amount that includes any combination of costs, attorneys' fees and\ninterest; a party may draft an offer that apportions the offered amounts by\nclaim; a party (or multiple parties) may serve an apportioned offer to multiple\nparties that includes a condition that it be accepted by all parties; and a\nparty may proceed to trial but shield itself from offer of judgment penalties by\n\"accepting\" an apportioned offer of judgment that is conditioned by the\nacceptance of all parties where all parties do not accept.\n","linknr":77,"url":"Offer_of_judgment","recorded":1363410929,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Tort_reform","/wiki/Settlement_offer","/wiki/Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure","/wiki/Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure","/wiki/U.S._state","/wiki/Medical_malpractice","/wiki/U.S._state","/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&oldid=490944042","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Tort_law","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Offer+of+judgment&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Offer+of+judgment","/wiki/Offer_of_judgment","/wiki/Talk:Offer_of_judgment","#","/wiki/Offer_of_judgment","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Offer_of_judgment","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Offer_of_judgment","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&oldid=490944042","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Offer_of_judgment&id=490944042","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Offer+of+judgment","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Offer+of+judgment&oldid=490944042&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Offer_of_judgment&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offer_of_judgment","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tort law"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["georgia","u.s._state"]],"members":["georgia"],"related":["Tort_reform","Settlement_offer","Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure","Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure","U.S._state","Medical_malpractice","U.S._state","Georgia_(U.S._state)"]}
