{"cursor":"3786","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Oral poetry' is poetry that is composed and transmitted without the aid of\nwriting. The complex relationships between written and spoken literature in some\nsocieties can make this definition hard to maintain. Oral poetry is sometimes\nconsidered to include any poetry which is performed live. In many cultures, oral\npoetry overlaps with, or is identical with, song. Meanwhile, although the term\noral etymologically means 'to do with the mouth', in some cultures oral poetry\nis also performed by other means, such as talking drums in some African\ncultures. Oral poetry exists most clearly within oral cultures, but it can\nsurvive, and indeed flourish, in highly literate cultures.\n\nOral poetry differs from oral literature in general because oral literature\nencompasses linguistic registers which are not considered poetry. In most oral\nliterature, poetry is defined by the fact that it conforms to metrical rules;\nexamples of non-poetic oral literature in Western culture include some jokes,\nspeeches and storytelling.\n\nAn influential movement in the study of oral poetry, both because it helped to\nbring oral poetry within the realms of academic literary study and because it\nilluminated the ways in which poetic form and orality interrelate, has been the\noral-formulaic theory developed by Milman Parry and Albert Lord. This theory\nshowed how stock phrases could enable poets to improvise verse. One consequence\nof Parry and Lord's work is that orally improvised poetry (as opposed to poetry\nwhich is composed without the use of writing but then memorised and performed\nlater) is sometimes seen as the example par excellence of oral poetry. Examples\nof orally improvised poetry are the epics of the Serbo-Croatian guslars studied\nby Parry and Lord, Basque [[bertsolaritza]], and freestyle rap.\n\nMuch oral poetry, however, is memorised verbatim - though the precise wording,\nparticularly of words which are not essential to sense or metre, do tend to\nchange from one performance to another, and one performer to another.

Although\nthe original composition of a memorised oral poem may have been undertaken\nwithout the use of writing, memorial traditions sometimes originate in a written\ntext. Likewise, memorised oral poems can come to be written down, leading to a\nsituation in which written versions in turn influence memorised versions.\nProminent examples of memorised oral poetry are some nursery rhymes, ballads and\nmedieval Scandinavian skaldic verse.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Oral_poet","recorded":1374763023,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Oral_poetry","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poet&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Poetry","/wiki/Song","/wiki/Mouth","/wiki/Drum_(communication)","/wiki/Oral_culture","/wiki/Literacy","/wiki/Oral_literature","/wiki/Meter_(poetry)","/wiki/Jokes","/wiki/Public_speaking","/wiki/Storytelling","/wiki/Oral-Formulaic_Composition","/wiki/Milman_Parry","/wiki/Albert_Lord","/wiki/Bertsolaritza","/wiki/Freestyle_rap","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Nursery_rhyme","/wiki/Ballad","/wiki/Skaldic_verse#Skaldic_poetry","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Argentina","/wiki/Bertsolaritza","/wiki/Malta","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Lazio","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Tuscany","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Oral_tradition","/wiki/Sound_poetry","/wiki/Oral-Formulaic_Composition","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","//mt.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C4%A7ana#G.C4.A7ana_Spirtu_Pront","#cite_ref-3","http://www.cantoabraccio.it","#cite_ref-4","http://www.accademiadellottava.it/filmati.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&oldid=544313233","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Poetics","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oral+poetry&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Oral+poetry","/wiki/Oral_poetry","/wiki/Talk:Oral_poetry","#","/wiki/Oral_poetry","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Oral_poetry","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Oral_poetry","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&oldid=544313233","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7099402","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Oral_poetry&id=544313233","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Oral+poetry","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Oral+poetry&oldid=544313233&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Oral_poetry&printable=yes","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poesia_oral","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7099402#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_poetry","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["communication","poetry"],"pdf":[],"cat
