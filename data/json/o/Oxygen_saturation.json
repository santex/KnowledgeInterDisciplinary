{"cursor":"2535","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Oxygen saturation' or 'dissolved oxygen' (DO) is a relative measure of the\namount of oxygen that is dissolved or carried in a given medium. It can be\nmeasured with a dissolved oxygen probe such as an oxygen sensor or an optode in\nliquid media, usually water. The standard unit is milligrams per litre (ppm), or\nmgL -1 .\n\nOxygen saturation can be measured regionally and non-invasively. Arterial\noxygenation is commonly measured using pulse oximetry. Tissue saturation at\nperipheral scale can be measured using NIRS. This technique can be applied on\nboth muscle and brain.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Oxygen_saturation","recorded":1362480478,"links":12,"instances":["environmental","chemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Blood","Water quality indicators","Oxygen"],"headings":["Oxygen  in medicine","Environmental oxygen saturation"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissolution","chemistry"],["tissue","biology"],["hypoxia","environmental"]],"members":["hypoxia","dissolution","tissue"],"related":["Oxygen","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Oxygen_sensor","Optode","Artery","Pulse_oximetry","Near-infrared_spectroscopy","Medicine","Oxygen","Tissue_(biology)","Blood","Lung","Hemoglobin","Sustainability","Ecosystem","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Pond","River","Aerobic_organism","Fish","Anaerobic_organism","Bacteria","Fish_kill","Balance_of_nature","Species"]}
