A classic ode\nis structured in three major parts: the [[strophe]], the [[antistrophe]], and\nthe [[epode]]. Different forms such as the homostrophic ode and the irregular\node also exist. It is an elaborately structured poem praising or glorifying an\nevent or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally.\n\nGreek odes were originally poetic pieces accompanied by symphonic orchestras. As\ntime passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions\nwhether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always\nwith accompaniment). The primary instruments used were the aulos and the lyre\n(the latter of which was the most revered instrument to the Ancient Greeks). The\nwritten ode, as it was practiced by the Romans, returned to the/ L E2 lyrical\nform of the Lesbian lyricists.\n\nThere are three typical forms of odes:the Pindaric, Horatian, and irregular.\nPindaric odes follow the form and style of Pindar. Horatian odes follow\nconventions of Horace; the odes of Horace deliberately imitated the Greek\nlyricists such as Alcaeus and Anacreon. Odes by Catullus, as well as other\npoetry of Catullus, was particularly inspired by Sappho. Irregular odes are\nrhyming, but they do not employ the three-part form of the Pindaric ode nor the\ntwo- or four-line stanza of the Horatian ode.\n","title":"ode","headings":["English ode","Notable practitioners of the ode","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Thomas_Gray","2: William_Wordsworth","2: Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","2: John_Keats","2: Percy_Bysshe_Shelley","1: Lyric_poetry","1: Aulos","1: Lyre","1: Ancient_Greeks","1: Lesbos","1: Pindar","1: Horace","1: Anacreon","1: Catullus","1: Poetry_of_Catullus","1: Sappho","1: Stanza","1: Edmund_Spenser","1: Abraham_Cowley","1: John_Dryden","1: Terza_rima","1: Ode_to_a_Nightingale","1: Ode_on_Melancholy","1: Ode_on_a_Grecian_Urn","1: Ode_to_Psyche","1: To_Autumn","1: Laurence_Binyon","1: Rhyme_scheme","1: Pablo_Neruda","1: Edmund_Gosse"]}
