Interests associated with outdoor enthusiasts include\nhiking, fishing, hunting, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, canoeing, climbing\nand camping. The term 'outdoorsman' has also been used.\n\nU.S. president Teddy Roosevelt was an avid outdoorsman. Other notable\noutdoorsmen include Doug Peacock, Richard Wiese, Kenneth \"Speedy\" Raulerson,\nEarl Shaffer, Jo Gjende from Norway, Saxton Pope, Randy Stoltmann, Christopher\nCamuto, Henry Pittock, Eddie Bauer, Gaylord DuBois, Euell Gibbons, Clay Perry,\nArthur Hasketh Groom, Bill Jordan (outdoorsman), Corey Ford, and Étienne Brûlé.\nPublications catering to the lifestyle and those interested in it include\nmagazines like [[Outdoor Life]].\n\nSparsely populated areas with mountains, lakes, rivers, scenic views, and rugged\nterrain are popular with outdoor enthusiasts.
