Some are subsidized, and some require payment on\nbehalf of the author. Subsidized journals are financed by an academic\ninstitution, learned society or a government information center; those requiring\npayment are typically financed by money made available to researchers for the\npurpose from a public or private funding agency, as part of a research grant.\nThere have also been several modifications of open-access journals that have\nconsiderably different natures: hybrid open-access journals and delayed open-\naccess journals.\n\nOpen-access journals (sometimes called the \"gold road to open access\") are one\nof the two general methods for providing open access. The other one (sometimes\ncalled the \"green road\") is self-archiving in a repository. The publisher of an\nopen-access journal is known as an \"open-access publisher\", and the process, \"open-\naccess publishing\".\n\nIn successively looser senses, open-access journals may be considered as:\n* Journals entirely open access\n* Journals with research articles open access (hybrid open-access journals)\n* Journals with some research articles open access (hybrid open-access journals)\n* Journals with some articles open access and the other delayed access\n* Journals with delayed open access (delayed open-access journals)\n* Journals permitting self-archiving of articles\n\n__FORCETOC__\n","linknr":239,"url":"Open-access_journal","recorded":1362672549,"links":17,"instances":["academic_publishing","publishing"],"pdf":["http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/publishing/BergstromAndBergstrom04b.pdf","http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/publishing/BergstromAndBergstrom04b.pdf","http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf","http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf"],"categories":["Academic publishing","Open access (publishing)"],"headings":["Financing open-access journals","Debate","Current problems and projects","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["open_access","publishing"],["repository","academic_publishing"],["open_access","publishing"]],"members":["repository","open_access"],"related":["Scholarly_journal","Academic_institution","Learned_society","Research_grant","Hybrid_open-access_journal","Delayed_open-access_journal","Open_access_(publishing)","Self-archiving","Repository_(academic_publishing)","Open_access_(publishing)","Research_grant","Developing_country","BMC_journals","PLoS_ONE","Atmospheric_Chemistry_and_Physics","PeerJ","Business_model","Learned_society","Public_Library_of_Science","Peer_review","PLoS","BioMedCentral","Directory_of_Open_Access_Journals","Open_J-Gate","Bibliographic_database","PubMed","Impact_factor","Web_of_Science","Scopus","BMJ","Journal_of_Medical_Internet_Research","Medscape","BioMed_Central","PLoS_Biology","PLoS_Medicine","Scientific_journal","Creative_Commons","List_of_open-access_journals","Open-access_mandate","Open_content","Open_data","Public_domain","Public_Knowledge","Open_Access_Scholarly_Publishers_Association","Association_of_Research_Libraries","MIT_Press","CSIC"]}
