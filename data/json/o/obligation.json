      "text" : "An 'obligation' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether\nlegal or moral. There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as\nobligations of etiquette, social obligations, and possibly in terms of politics,\nwhere obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally\nlegal obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although\ncertain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as\nwell, whether as a tradition or for social reasons. Obligations vary from person\nto person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have\nfar more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have\nmore obligations than a child.<ref>Myron Old Bear, Sacred Journey of the\nMedicine Wheel (2008), p. 393: \"Adults have more obligations and are held to\nhigher standards of accountability than children are\".</ref> Obligations are\ngenerally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.\nFor example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to\nemployee maybe to ensure the fire exit isn't blocked or ensure that the plugs\nare put in firmly.\n\nThe word \"obligation\" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as\nbank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.\n",
