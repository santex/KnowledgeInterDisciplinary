This operation is also known as the 'opposite' (number),\n'sign change', and 'negation'.<ref> The term \"negation\" bears a reference to\nnegative numbers, which can be misleading, because the additive inverse of a\nnegative number is positive.</ref> For a real number, it reverses its sign: the\nopposite to a positive number is negative, and the opposite to a negative number\nis positive. Zero is the additive inverse of itself.\n\nThe additive inverse of is denoted by unary minus: − (see the discussion below).\nFor example, the additive inverse of 7 is −7, because\n7&nbsp;+&nbsp;(−7)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and the additive inverse of −0.3 is 0.3,\nbecause −0.3&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 .\n\nThe additive inverse is defined as its inverse element under the binary\noperation of addition (see the discussion below), which allows a broad\ngeneralization to mathematical objects other than numbers. As for any inverse\noperation, double additive inverse has no effect: x}}. , are mutually opposite]]\n",
