Chlorine halocarbons are the most common and are\ncalled organochlorides. Yoel Sasson. \"Formation of CarbonâHalogen Bonds\n(Cl, Br, I)\" in Patai's Chemistry of Functional Groups (2009). Wiley-VCH,\nWeinheim. \n\nMany synthetic organic compounds such as plastic polymers, and a few natural\nones, contain halogen atoms; they are known as halogenated compounds or\norganohalogens. Organochlorides are the most common industrially used\norganohalides, although the other organohalides are used commonly in organic\nsynthesis. Except for extremely rare cases, organohalides are not produced\nbiologically, but many pharmaceuticals are organohalides. Notably, many\npharmaceuticals such as Prozac have trifluoromethyl groups.\n\nFor information on inorganic halide chemistry, see halide\n","linknr":402,"url":"Organohalide","recorded":1362371454,"links":44,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1948/muller-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1948/muller-lecture.pdf","http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/search/pdfs/anniston/19570121_171.pdf","http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/search/pdfs/anniston/19570121_171.pdf"],"categories":["Organohalides|"],"headings":["Chemical families","History and context","Organoiodine compounds, including biological derivatives","Uses","Hazards","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Organohalogen-chlorides.png/300px-Organohalogen-chlorides.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical","Carbon","Atom","Covalent_bond","Halogen","Atom","Fluorine","Chlorine","Bromine","Iodine","Organofluorine_compound","Organochlorine_compound","Organobromine_compound","Organoiodine_compound","Organochloride","Plastic","Polymers","Fluoxetine","Halide","Chemical_structure","Organic_compound","Hydrogen","Atom","Molecular","Halogen","Atom","Haloalkane","Carbon","Atom","Chemical_bond","Haloalkene","Double_bond","Carbon","Atom","Haloaromatic","Carbon","Aromatic_ring","Halogen","Atom","Molecule","Substituent","Hydrogen","Halogen","Hydrogen","Methyl_bromide","Dioxine","Methane","Ethane","Tyrian_purple","Thyroxine","Thyroid_gland","Fluoroacetic_acid","Acc._Chem._Res.","Chemical_Society_Reviews","Thyroxin","Iodized_salt","Hyperthyroidism","Proteolysis","Thyroglobulin","Colloid","Thioamides","Tyrian_purple","Solvent","Pesticide","Refrigerant","Elastomer","Adhesive","Plasticizer","Plastic","Sucralose","Haloalkane","1,1,1-Trichloroethane","Carbon_tetrachloride","1,2-Dibromoethane","Refrigerants","Freon","DuPont","Methylene_chloride","1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane","Solvent","Perchloroethylene","Trichloroethylene","Polyvinyl_chloride","DuPont","PTFE","Aroclor","Monsanto_Company","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Halowax","Union_Carbide","Polychlorinated_naphthalene","Chlorobenzene","Disinfectant","Pesticide","DDT","Herbicides","2,4-D","Dielectric","Acetyl_chloride","Reactive","Bacteria","Mold","Polychlorinated_naphthalene","Chloracne","Polychlorinated_naphthalene","Liver_disease","DDT","Mosquito","Insect","Hydraulic","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Liver_disease","Submarine","Rachel_Carson","Pollution","DDT","Pesticide","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Mario_Molina","Sherwood_Rowland","Refrigerant","Chlorofluorocarbon","Atmosphere","Ozone","Ozone","Antarctica","Chlorofluorocarbon","IPCC_Fourth_Assessment_Report","Trichloroethylene","Solvent","Perfluorooctanoic_acid","Waste_disposal","Incineration","Corrosive","Hydrochloric_acid","Hydrofluoric_acid","Poison","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Furan","Halogenation"]}
