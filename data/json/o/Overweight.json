Being overweight is a common condition, especially where food supplies\nare plentiful and lifestyles are sedentary.\n\nExcess weight has reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1\nbillion adults being either overweight or obese. Increases have been\nobserved across all age groups.\n\nA healthy body requires a minimum amount of fat for the proper functioning of\nthe hormonal, reproductive, and immune systems, as thermal insulation, as shock\nabsorption for sensitive areas, and as energy for future use. But the\naccumulation of too much storage fat can impair movement and flexibility, and\ncan alter the appearance of the body.\n","linknr":391,"url":"Overweight","recorded":1362484915,"links":37,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf"],"categories":["Human weight"],"headings":["Classification","Health-related implications","Causes","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Body_mass_index_chart.svg/230px-Body_mass_index_chart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Overweight_biker.jpg/220px-Overweight_biker.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Overweight_teenage_boy_%28side%29.jpg/220px-Overweight_teenage_boy_%28side%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Variation_in_body_fat_12577.JPG/220px-Variation_in_body_fat_12577.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/GermanShep1_wb.jpg/220px-GermanShep1_wb.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","medicine"]],"members":["stress"],"related":["Adipose_tissue","Health","Dietary_energy_supply","Sedentary_lifestyle","Obese","Fat","Hormone","Reproductive_system","Immune_system","Thermal_insulation","Shock_absorber","Lipids","Body_shape","Body_mass_index","Obesity","Body_mass_index","Correlated","Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient","Body_volume_index","Obesity","Central_obesity","Weighing_scale","Body_type","Muscle","Calipers","Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis","Electrical_resistance","Rehydration","Body_temperature","Hydrostatic_equilibrium","Dual_energy_X-ray_absorptiometry","National_Institutes_of_Health","World_Health_Organization","Genetics","Health","Obesity","Mortality_rate","Cancer","Smoking","Developed_country","Discrimination","United_States","Obese","Calorie","Eating","Alcoholism","Eating_disorder","Binge_eating_disorder","Genetic_predisposition","Hormone","Hypothyroidism","Sleep","Physical_exercise","Sedentary_lifestyle","Malnutrition","Metabolic_disorder","Yo-yo_dieting","Overeating","Psychoactive_drug","Olanzapine","Smoking_cessation","Stimulant","Stress_(medicine)","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Dieting","Anti-obesity_drug","Bariatrics","Yo-yo_dieting","Body_image","Body_Volume_Index","Canadian_Obesity_Network","Childhood_obesity","Fat_acceptance_movement","Physical_attractiveness","Obesity","Underweight"]}
