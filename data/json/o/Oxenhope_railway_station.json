It\nis the terminus of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, with trains to Haworth\nand Keighley.\n\nOxenhope was not in the original plans for the railway, with Haworth being the\nproposed terminus. However, a local mill owner successfully campaigned for the\nrailway to be extended to Oxenhope, and the station opened in 1867, as the\nrailways terminus. On the original plans the railway was to extend into\nLowertown, and there is still a bridge (used as a road bridge) which was\nconstructed as part of the railway to allow this, however it was decided to\nterminate the railway at its current location.\n\nAs with the rest of the line, it was closed in 1962 under the Beeching Axe,\nbut was re-opened when the line was preserved in 1968. It now houses an\nexhibition shed, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, where some of the\nlocomotives that are not currently used on the line are stored. There is also\na station shop, buffet and a car park, and links with local bus services to\nBradford and Hebden Bridge.\n\nWhen the railway was reopened, it was envisaged that as the terminus of the\nline, Oxenhope would be the ideal place to base the locomotive department. To\nthis end, the goods shed was extended with a two road building including an\ninspection pit.\n\nHowever, the locomotive department once happily settled in Haworth never moved,\nso the intended locomotive shed is now the headquarters of the railway's\nCarriage & Wagon department, boasting workshop facilities, carriage lifting\njacks and extensive stores.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, there is now also a large two\nroad, twelve coach 'running shed' used to stable to coaches normally used on\nservice trains. It also has facilities for servicing coaches and provides a more\nhospitable environment for light maintenance.\n\nAlso located at Oxenhope is the railways 'Beer Store'. When the railway\nreopened, it boasted the facility to serve 'Real Ale' on board trains as a Jibe\nat British Rail, who were unable to do so on their new Inter City Buffet Cars.\nBecause normal cask ale cannot be used on a train (the movement would shake up\nthe sediment in the barrel and result in an undrinkable pint), the beer is\nstored at Oxenhope and decanted into containers for use on trains.\n\nRecently, this part of the railway has grown almost explosively, with an annual\n'Beer & Music Festival' now a firm fixture in the railway's calendar. Held in\nlate October, what started out as a weekend event is now a three or four day\nextravaganza, with four days worth of live music, consistently boasting over 100\ndifferent beers to choose from. However, to some degree the event is a victim of\nits own success. Despite hiring in extra catering and toilet facilities,\ncongestion is an issue and it is not unknown for emergency orders of extra beer\nbeing necessary on the Saturday to prevent the Sunday being a \"dry\" event.\n\n\n
