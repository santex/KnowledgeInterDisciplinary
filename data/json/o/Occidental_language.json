This was done through application of de Wahl's rule which is a\nset of rules for converting verb infinitives into derived nouns and adjectives.\nThe result is a language easy to understand at first sight for individuals\nacquainted with several Western European languages. Coupled with a simplified\ngrammar, this made Occidental exceptionally popular in Europe during the 15\nyears before World War II, and it is believed that it was at its height the\nfourth most popular planned language, after VolapÃ¼k, Esperanto and perhaps Ido\nin order of appearance.\n\nBut some have believed that its intentional emphasis on European forms coupled\nwith a Eurocentric philosophy espoused by several of its leading lights hindered\nits spread elsewhere. Harlow, Don. The Esperanto Book,\nchapter 3: [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html \"How to Build a\nLanguage\"]. Still, Occidental gained adherents in many nations including\nAsian nations. Before WWII it had grown to become the second largest\ninternational auxiliary language in numbers of adherents, after Esperanto. A\nmajority of Ido adherents took up Occidental in place of\nIdo.
