{"cursor":"89462","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ozone hole ever recorded (September 2006), over the Southern pole]]\n\n\n'Ozone depletion' describes two distinct but related phenomena observed since\nthe late 1970s: a steady decline of about 4% per decade in the total volume of\nozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime\ndecrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth's polar regions. The latter\nphenomenon is referred to as the 'ozone hole'. In addition to these well-known\nstratospheric phenomena, there are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone\ndepletion events.\n\nThe details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid-latitude\nthinning, but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of\nozone by atomic halogens. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/tour/part3.html title = Part III. The\n| Science of the Ozone Hole accessdate = 2007-03-05}}\n The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is\nphotodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants (CFCs, freons, halons).\nThese compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the\nsurface. {{cite web |author=Andino, Jean M.\n| url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=chlorofluorocarbons-cfcs title =\n| Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are heavier than air, so how do scientists suppose\n| that these chemicals reach the altitude of the ozone layer to adversely affect\n| it? date=21 October 1999 |publisher=Scientific American}}\n Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of\nhalo-carbons increased.\n\nCFCs and other contributory substances are referred to as 'ozone-depleting\nsubstances' ('ODS'). Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths\n(280â315 nm) of ultraviolet light (UV light) from passing through the\nEarth's atmosphere, observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated\nworldwide concern leading to adoption of the Montreal Protocol that bans the\nproduction of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon\ntetrachloride and trichloroethane. It is suspected that a variety of biological\nconsequences such as increases in skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations\nin the ocean's photic zone may result from the increased UV exposure due to\nozone depletion.\n","linknr":1263,"url":"Ozone_depletion","recorded":1362267981,"links":94,"instances":["chemistry","aerosol_propellants","scientist","satellite","mathematician"],"pdf":["http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/12/1353/2012/acp-12-1353-2012.pdf","http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/12/1353/2012/acp-12-1353-2012.pdf","http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf","http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf","http://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/reports/ozone_2002/06_chapter1.pdf","http://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/reports/ozone_2002/06_chapter1.pdf","http://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/04/bulletin_7_2004.pdf","http://www.wmo.ch/web/arep/04/bulletin_7_2004.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sroc/sroc_spm.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sroc/sroc_spm.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter9.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter9.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070221055911/http://www.ipcc.ch/press/SPM.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/press/SPM.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070221055911/http://www.ipcc.ch/press/SPM.pdf","http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/29/3/08_morrisette_evolution.pdf","http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/29/3/08_morrisette_evolution.pdf"],"categories":["Ozone
