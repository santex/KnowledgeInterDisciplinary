The opportunity cost is\nalso the \"cost\" (as a lost benefit) of the forgone products after making a\nchoice. Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described\nas expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\".\nThe notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that scarce\nresources are used efficiently. Thus, opportunity costs are not\nrestricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost\ntime, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be\nconsidered opportunity costs.\n","linknr":326,"url":"Opportunity_cost","recorded":1362901938,"links":62,"instances":["economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://mises.org/books/Social_Economics_Wieser.pdf","http://mises.org/books/Social_Economics_Wieser.pdf"],"categories":["Microeconomics","Costs","Economics terminology","Time-based economics"],"headings":["History","Opportunity costs in consumption","Opportunity costs in production","Non-monetary opportunity costs","Evaluation","Criticism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg/200px-GDP_PPP_Per_Capita_IMF_2008.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["real_versus_nominal_value","economics"],["utility","economics"],["production","economics"]],"members":["production","real_versus_nominal_value","utility"],"related":["Sacrifice","Mutually_exclusive","Economics","Scarcity","Utility","Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)","Production_possibilities_frontier","Utility_(economics)","Austria","Economist","Friedrich_von_Wieser","France","Classical_liberalism","Frédéric_Bastiat","Environmental_protection","Reformate","Production_(economics)","Factors_of_production","Marginal_theory_of_value","Time_value_of_money","Production_possibility_frontier","Utility","Keynesian","Budget_constraint","Economic_value_added","Opportunity_cost_of_capital","Parable_of_the_broken_window","Production-possibility_frontier","TANSTAAFL","Time_management","Trade-off","Robert_H._Frank"]}
