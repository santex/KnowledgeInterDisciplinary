The wood most\noften used is hardwood steamed into shape, like elm or hickory and sometimes\nwillow. A ring is attached by a plate to the centre underside of the yoke, to\nenable a pair of bullocks to be chained to other pairs in a team and thence\nhitched to the load.\n\nWhen rivers meander and are sometimes cut off from their course, they form an\n'[[oxbow lake]]' which is so named because of the distinctive '\"U\"' shape.\n",
