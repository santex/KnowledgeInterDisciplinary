Built as\nthe Parkland Junior Senior High School in 1953, the school opened in 1954 for\n1,157 students in grades seven through twelve. As enrollment grew, seventh and\neighth grade students were re-assigned to Troxell. Upon completion of\nSpringhouse Junior High School in 1971, seventh, eighth, and ninth grade\nstudents were assigned to each of the junior high schools. Parkland High School\n(now Orefield Middle School) served grades ten through twelve from 1971 until\n1999. From 1999-2001 the high school was completely renovated in effort to\nmirror a team-centered approach for middle school instruction. A $19 million\ndollar project was configured into nine houses that included classrooms, teacher\nplanning rooms, and a flexible teaching-learning area. This is the school's\ncurrent design.\n\nOrefield Middle School has a vast department of subjects such as Math, Reading,\nSocial Studies, Science, and Language Arts. The school also has exploratory\nclasses such as Art, Band, Chorus, Orchestra, Technology Education, Info Tech,\nand Family Consumer Sciences.\n\nThe upper level includes sixth grade houses and two seventh grade houses. Eight\ngrade houses and one seventh grade house are located on the lower level.\nAdditionally, all science rooms are located on the lower level.\n\nOrefield Middle School is the home of the âJaguars,â and the current enrollment\nis 1,183 students.\n\nIn the basement of the school, there is a bomb shelter.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Orefield_Middle_School","recorded":1364149241,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)","/wiki/Parkland_School_District","/wiki/Athletic_nickname","http://www.parklandsd.org/oms/","/wiki/Parkland_School_District","/wiki/Eighth_grade","/wiki/Middle_school","/wiki/Ninth_grade","/wiki/Parkland_High_School_(Allentown,_Pennsylvania)","/wiki/Social_studies","/wiki/Language_arts","/wiki/Vocational_education","/wiki/Sixth_grade","/wiki/Seventh_grade","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=edit&section=1","http://www.parklandsd.org/oms/","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Orefield_Middle_School&params=40.63092_N_-75.58120_E_type:landmark","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg/30px-Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg.png","/wiki/File:School.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/School.svg/25px-School.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Pennsylvania-school-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Pennsylvania-school-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Pennsylvania-school-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&oldid=526453890","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Public_middle_schools_in_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Category:Schools_in_Lehigh_County,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Category:Pennsylvania_school_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Orefield+Middle+School&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Orefield+Middle+School","/wiki/Orefield_Middle_School","/wiki/Talk:Orefield_Middle_School","#","/wiki/Orefield_Middle_School","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Orefield_Middle_School","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Orefield_Middle_School","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&oldid=526453890","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Orefield_Middle_School&id=526453890","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Orefield+Middle+School","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Orefield+Middle+School&oldid=526453890&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Orefield_Middle_School&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orefield_Middle_School","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["government_f
