{"cursor":"3589","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ole Brunell' as he was originally named, currently known as 'Shlomo Brunell',\nwas born in Swedish-speaking Kokkola, Finland in 1953.\n\nMr. Brunell was ordained as a minister in the Lutheran Church in 1978. He served\nas a pastor in both Finland and Australia. He preached and ministered in\nSwedish, English, and Finnish during his career as a minister.\n\nEventually, he ceased to believe in the teachings of the Lutheran Church, and\nultimately came not to believe in Christianity at all. Because of this, he could\nnot in good conscience continue as a minister. At the same time he ceased to be\na Lutheran. Although he left the church because he could not reconcile his\nbeliefs with church teachings, he also left the church because of what he saw as\nshabby treatment at the hands of the church hierarchy.\n\nDespite that he stopped believing in the Christian faith, he never stopped\nbelieving in God. For six years, he and his family had no formal religion. He\ndescribes this as a religious \"no man's land.\" He recalls that he had \"no\nholidays to celebrate, and not even a calendar to follow.\"\n\nAfter six years of deep soul searching, he, his wife, and four daughters all\ndecided to convert to Judaism. The first answer from the Orthodox Jewish\nestablishment was âno,â as is required according to conversion laws. But he\nwould not take ânoâ for an answer. Eventually the leaders relented, and all were\nconverted. Upon conversion, Mr. Brunell changed his first name from âOleâ to\nâShlomo ben Avraham,â and his wife changed her name from âRunaâ to âRuth.â These\nare names frequently chosen by converts. The family retained the name âBrunell.â\n\nThe entire family now lives in Israel. At least two of the daughters are now\nmarried (in a proper Jewish marriage) He now has a grandson, Daniel â Jewish by\nbirth â who was born in December 2006.\n\nMr. Brunell wrote of his experience in a book entitled âStrangers No More: One\nFamilyâs Exceptional Journey from Christianity to Judaism,â ISBN 965-229-304-0\npublished by Gefen Publishing House in Jerusalem in 2005.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Ole_Brunell","recorded":1375089015,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Swedish_language","/wiki/Kokkola","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Lutheran","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Swedish_language","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Finnish_language","/wiki/Lutheran_Church","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Lutheran","/wiki/Judaism","/wiki/Orthodox_Jewish","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Jewish_view_of_marriage","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9652293040","/wiki/Gefen_Publishing_House","/wiki/Jerusalem","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit&section=1","http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=23277&mode=a&sectionid=16&contentname=Heavenly_Ordained&recnum=24&reccount=131&subid=20513","/wiki/Jewish_Press","http://www.kyrkpressen.fi/paperarchive/KP0524.pdf","/wiki/Jerusalem_Post","/wiki/Gefen_Publishing_House","http://www.israelbooks.com/bookDetails.asp?book=364&catId=64,","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit&section=2","http://www.shlomobrunell.com","http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/97213","http://www.jewishpress.com/content.cfm?contentid=23277","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Star_of_David.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_of_David.svg/30px-Star_of_David.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Judaism-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Judaism-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Judaism-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&oldid=491090430","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1953_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Finnish_Orthodox_Jews","/wiki/Category:Finnish_emigrants_to_Israel","/wiki/Category:Israeli_Jews","/wiki/Category:Converts_to_Judaism_from_Protestantism","/wiki/Category:Former_Lutherans","/wiki/Category:Jewish_biography_stubs","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ole+Brunell&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ole+Brunell","/wiki/Ole_Brunell","/wiki/Talk:Ole_Brunell","#","/wiki/Ole_Brunell","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ole_Brunell","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ole_Brunell","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&oldid=491090430","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7085810","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ole_Brunell&id=491090430","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Ole+Brunell","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Ole+Brunell&oldid=491090430&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Ole_Brunell&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7085810#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Brunell","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bi
