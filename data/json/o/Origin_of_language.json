{"cursor":"108020","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'origin of language' in the human species has been the topic of scholarly\ndiscussions for several centuries. In spite of this, there is no consensus on\nits ultimate origin or age. One problem that makes the topic difficult to study\nis the lack of direct evidence, since neither languages nor the ability to\nproduce them fossilizes. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of\nlanguage must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the fossil\nrecord or from archaeological evidence, from contemporary language diversity,\nfrom studies of language acquisition, and from comparisons between human\nlanguage and systems of communication existing among other animals, particularly\nother primates. It is generally agreed that the origins of language are closely\ntied to the origins of modern human behavior, but there is little agreement\nabout the implications and directionality of this connection.\n\nThis fact that empirical evidence is limited has led many scholars to regard the\nentire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the Linguistic Society of\nParis went so far as to ban debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained\ninfluential across much of the western world until late in the twentieth\ncentury. Stam, J. H. 1976. Inquiries into the origins of language. New York:\nHarper and Row, p. 255. Today, there are numerous hypotheses about how,\nwhy, when, and where language might first have emerged. It might seem\nthat there is hardly more agreement today than there was a hundred years ago,\nwhen Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection provoked a rash\nof armchair speculations on the topic.

Since the early 1990s, however, a\ngrowing number of professional linguists, archaeologists, psychologists,\nanthropologists, and others have attempted to address with new methods what they\nare beginning to consider \"the hardest problem in science\".
