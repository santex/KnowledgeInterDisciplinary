It is the only known species of the genus Tubipora. This species is a\nsoft coral but with a unique, hard skeleton of calcium carbonate that contains\nmany organ pipe-like tubes. On each tube is a series of polyps which each have\neight feather-like tentacles. These tentacles are usually extended during the\nday, but will swiftly withdraw with any sort of disturbance. The skeleton is a\nbright red color, but is typically obscured by the numerous polyps, which are\ngreen or gray in color. In size, colonies can reach up to a meter across, while\nthe individual polyps are typically less than 3 mm wide and a few mm long. They\nare restricted to shallow waters and tend to live in sheltered areas. They eat\nplankton. They are close relatives to other soft coral and sea fans. Allen,\nGerald (June 20, 2001).
