A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a\ndimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it\n(for example, to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its\nlatitude and its longitude). The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is\nthree-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within\nthese spaces.\n\nIn physical terms, dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space (\nvolume) and its position in time (perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-\naxis), as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that\ncorrelate with both particle and field conceptions, interact according to\nrelative properties of mass—and are fundamentally mathematical in description.\nThese, or other axes, may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or\nstructure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences.\nPhysical theories that incorporate time, such as general relativity, are said to\nwork in 4-dimensional \"spacetime\", (defined as a Minkowski space). Modern\ntheories tend to be \"higher-dimensional\" including quantum field and string\ntheories. The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional\nfunction space.\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. High-dimensional\nspaces occur in mathematics and the sciences for many reasons, frequently as\nconfiguration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are\nabstract spaces, independent of the physical space we live in.\n","title":"Dimension%20%28mathematics%20and%20physics%29","headings":["In mathematics","In physics","Networks and dimension","Literature","Philosophy","More dimensions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Spacetime","4: Cartesian_coordinate_system","3: Tesseract","3: Space","3: Vector_space","3: Manifold","2: Cube","2: Surface","2: General_relativity","2: Minkowski_space","2: String_theory","2: Function_space","2: Minkowski_dimension","2: Hausdorff_dimension","2: Octonion","2: Cardinality","2: Tangent_space","2: Integer","2: Fractal_dimension","2: Hilbert_space","2: M-theory","2: KaluzaâKlein_theory","1: Physics","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_object","1: Coordinates","1: Sphere","1: Latitude","1: Longitude","1: Structure","1: Volume","1: Wave-particle_duality","1: Mass","1: Time","1: Quantum_field_theory","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Configuration_space","1: Lagrangian_mechanics","1: Hamiltonian_mechanics","1: Unit_circle","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Polar_coordinate","1: Euclidean_space","1: Inductive_dimension","1: RenÃ©_Descartes","1: Arthur_Cayley","1: William_Rowan_Hamilton","1: Ludwig_SchlÃ¤fli","1: Bernhard_Riemann","1: Habilitationsschrift","1: Quaternions","1: Connectedness","1: Locally","1: Homeomorphic","1: Differentiable_manifold","1: Geometric_topology","1: PoincarÃ©_conjecture","1: Regular_point_of_an_algebraic_variety","1: Hyperplane","1: Algebraic_set","1: Commutative_ring","1: Prime_ideal","1: Algebra_over_a_field","1: Normal_topological_space","1: Open_cover","1: Isolated_point","1: Fractal","1: Metric_space","1: Box-counting_dimension","1: Orthonormal_basis","1: Linear_combination","1: One-dimensional_space","1: Number_line","1: Angle","1: Two-dimensional_space","1: Polar_coordinate_system","1: Geographic_coordinate_system","1: Three-dimensional_space","1: Cylindrical_coordinate_system","1: Spherical_coordinate_system","1: Arrow_of_time","1: Classical_mechanics","1: T-symmetry","1: C-symmetry","1: Laws_of_thermodynamics","1: Entropy","1: Henri_PoincarÃ©","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Special_relativity","1: Superstring_theory","1: Bosonic_string_theory","1: Large_Hadron_Collider","1: Large_extra_dimensions","1: Electromagnetism","1: Large_extra_dimension","1: Universal_extra_dimension","1: Science_fiction","1: Planes_of_existence","1: Miles_J._Breuer","1: Murray_Leinster","1: Robert_A._Heinlein","1: Alan_E._Nourse","1: Madeleine_L'Engle","1: William_Sleator","1: Immanuel_Kant","1: Philosopher","1: Psychologist","1: Gustav_Fechner","1: Allegory_of_the_Cave","1: Plato","1: Metaphysical","1: Philosophical","1: Charles_Howard_Hinton","1: Esotericism","1: P._D._Ouspensky","1: Dimension_of_an_algebraic_variety","1: Exterior_dimension","1: Hurst_exponent","1: Isoperimetric_dimension","1: KaplanâYorke_dimension","1: Lebesgue_covering_dimension","1: Lyapunov_dimension","1: Pointwise_dimension","1: Poset_dimension","1: Q-dimension","1: Information_dimension","1: Correlation_dimension","1: Dimension_table","1: Dimensional_analysis","1: Hyperspace","1: Intrinsic_dimension","1: Space-filling_curve","1: Zero-dimensional_space","1: Real_number","1: Complex_number","1: List_of_uniform_tilings","1: Platonic_solid","1: Stereoscopy","1: Euler_angles","1: 3-manifold","1: Four-dimensional_space","1: Convex_regular_4-polytope","1: Quaternion","1: 4-manifold","1: Fourth_dimension_in_art","1: Fourth_dimension_in_literature","1: CalabiâYau_spaces","1: Curse_of_dimensionality","1: Edwin_A._Abbott","1: Project_Gutenberg","1: Thomas_Banchoff","1: Clifford_A._Pickover","1: Rudy_Rucker","1: Michio_Kaku"]}
