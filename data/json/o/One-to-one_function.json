In other words, every element of\nthe function's codomain is the image of at most one element of its domain. If in\naddition all of the elements in the codomain are in fact the image of some\nelement of the domain, then the function is said to be bijective (see figures).\n\nThe term one-to-one function must not to be confused with [[one-to-one\ncorrespondence]] which is an alternative term for a bijective function.\nOccasionally, an injective function from X to Y is denoted , using an arrow with\na barbed tail. The set of injective functions from X to Y may be denoted\nY X using a notation derived from that used for falling\nfactorial powers, since if X and Y are finite sets with respectively m and n\nelements, the number of injections from X to Y is n m (see the\ntwelvefold way).\n\nA function f that is not injective is sometimes called many-to-one. (However,\nthis terminology is also sometimes used to mean \"single-valued\", i.e., each\nargument is mapped to at most one value; this is the case for any function, but\nis used to stress the opposition with multi-valued functions, which are not true\nfunctions.)\n\nA monomorphism is a generalization of an injective function in category theory.\n","linknr":252,"url":"One-to-one_function","recorded":1362570254,"links":61,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","category_theory","mathematics","function"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings","Basic concepts in set theory","Types of functions"],"headings":["Definition","Examples","Injections can be undone","Injections may be made invertible","Other properties","Proving that functions are injective","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Injection.svg/200px-Injection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Bijection.svg/200px-Bijection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Surjection.svg/200px-Surjection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/7/d9798b592b3b3dc82b556bd631d672cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/6/4/a646411be3f46b68be9f83286ed25521.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Injective_function.svg/310px-Injective_function.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Non-injective_function1.svg/400px-Non-injective_function1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Non-injective_function2.svg/550px-Non-injective_function2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Injective_composition2.svg/300px-Injective_composition2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/c/57cec4137b614c87cb4e24a3d003a3e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/2/1/02129bb861061d1a052c592e2dc6b383.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/2/1/02129bb861061d1a052c592e2dc6b383.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/c/57cec4137b614c87cb4e24a3d003a3e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["image","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["domain","mathematics"],["map","mathematics"],["range","mathematics"],["image","mathematics"],["retract","category_theory"],["retract","category_theory"],["retract","category_theory"],["image","function"]],"members":["map","domain","function","range","retract","set","image"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Domain_of_a_function","Codomain","Image_(mathematics)","Bijective_function","Set_(mathematics)","Falling_factorial_power","Multi-valued_function","Monomorphism","Category_theory","Function_(mathematics)","Domain_(mathematics)","Contrapositive","Inclusion_map","Identity_function","Exponential_function","Surjective","Natural_logarithm","Real_line","Map_(mathematics)","Domain_of_a_function","Range_(mathematics)","Image_(mathematics)","Retract_(category_theory)","Retract_(category_theory)","Constructive_mathematics","Indecomposability","Retract_(category_theory)","Inverse_function","Inverse_function","Bijective","Multivalued_function","Bijective_function","Inverse_function","Inclusion_function","Monomorphism","Category_theory","Category_of_sets","Subset","Image_(function)","Up_to_isomorphism","Inclusion_function","Cardinal_number","Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder_theorem","Finite_set","Surjective","Bijective","Homomorphism","Embedding","Surjective_function","Bijective_function","Injective_module","Bijection,_injection_and_surjection","Horizontal_line_test","Injective_metric_space"]}
