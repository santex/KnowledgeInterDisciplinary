Although several empiraclly-derived\nstandards expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with\nearly telegraphy practice, the British Association for the Advancement of\nScience proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time\nand of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861. The definition\nof the \"ohm\" unit was revised several times. Today the ohm is a derived unit\nin the International System of Units, with its value expressed by the quantum\nHall effect.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Ohm","recorded":1362485108,"links":82,"instances":["typeface","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"],"categories":["SI derived units","Units of electrical resistance"],"headings":["Definition","Conversions","Power as a function of resistance","History","Realization of standards","Ohm symbol","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Electronic_multi_meter.jpg/220px-Electronic_multi_meter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Aeldre_kulmassemodstande.jpg/220px-Aeldre_kulmassemodstande.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/1/3a1ce116fda368e80bfaf04581d83c42.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/f/e/9fe11d132d4f2e7d19f4793e8b938957.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/75px-SI_base_unit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["siemens","unit"],["siemens","unit"],["siemens","unit#mho"],["symbol","typeface"],["power","physics"]],"members":["symbol","power","siemens"],"related":["Omega","SI_derived_unit","Electrical_resistance","Georg_Simon_Ohm","British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","International_System_of_Units","Quantum_Hall_effect","Electronic_color_code","Volt","Ampere","Electromotive_force","Volt","Ampere","Meter","Kilogram","Second","Coulomb","Joule","Siemens_(unit)","Linear","Resistor","Thermistor","Electrical_impedance","Siemens_(unit)","SI_derived_unit","Electric_conductance","Admittance","Multiplicative_inverse","Ohm's_law","Joule's_laws","Watt","Voltage","Ampere","Dimensional_analysis","British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","International_Electrical_Conference_1893","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","Metrology","Quantum_Hall_effect","Symbol_(typeface)","Watt","Power_(physics)","BS_1852","Unicode","Letterlike_symbols","Alt_code","Abohm","Ohm's_law","Resistor","Resistivity","History_of_measurement","International_System_of_Units","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures"]}
