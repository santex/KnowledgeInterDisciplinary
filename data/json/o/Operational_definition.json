(1995)\n [http://books.google.com/books?id=yNmTHbQiPEUC&pg=PA21 Research methods:\n Principles and Applications] p.21 Sevilla, Consuelo G. et al. (1992)\n [http://books.google.com/books?id=SK18tR3vTucC&pg=PA20 Research methods],\n revised edition p.20 defines something (e.g. a variable, term, or object)\n in terms of the specific process or set of validation tests used to determine\n its presence and quantity. That is, one defines something in terms of the\n operations that count as measuring it. The term was coined in\n philosophy of science book [[The Logic of Modern Physics]] (1927), by Percy\n Williams Bridgman, and is a part of the process of operationalization. One\n might use definitions that rely on operations in order to avoid the troubles\n associated with attempting to define things in terms of some intrinsic essence.\n\nAn example of an operational definition might be defining the weight of an\nobject in terms of the numbers that appear when that object is placed on a\nweighing scale. The weight then, is whatever results from following the (weight)\nmeasurement procedure, which should be repeatable by anyone. This is in contrast\nto operationalization that uses theoretical definitions.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Operational_definition","recorded":1362898497,"links":22,"instances":["philosophy","trait","mathematics","geometry","observational","statistics","philosophy","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Definition","Psychometrics","Philosophy of science"],"headings":["Overview","Application","Examples","Theoretical vs operational definition","See also","References and notes","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Pbnjmpegman.jpg/300px-Pbnjmpegman.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variable","mathematics"],["object","philosophy"],["identity","philosophy"],["calibration","statistics"],["intelligence","trait"],["artifact","observational"],["parallel","geometry"],["intelligence","trait"],["newton","unit"]],"members":["object","intelligence","variable","parallel","artifact","calibration","identity","newton"],"related":["Variable_(mathematics)","Terminology","Object_(philosophy)","Formal_verification","Philosophy_of_science","Percy_Williams_Bridgman","Operationalization","Essentialism","Weighing_scale","Theoretical_definition","Theoretical_definition","Identity_(philosophy)","Classifier","Semantics","Pattern_recognition","Calibration_(statistics)","Duck_test","Philosophical","Logical_positivism","Physical_sciences","Richard_Boyd","Philosophy","Percy_Williams_Bridgman","Logical_positivism","Phenomenalism","Ernst_Mach","Scientific_realism","Empiricism","Reductio_ad_absurdum","Theory_of_relativity","Relativity_of_simultaneity","Length_contraction","Quantum_mechanics","Observables","Psychology","Psychiatry","Intelligence_(trait)","IQ_test","Theoretical_definition","John_Stuart_Mill","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Psychologists","Noumenon","Phenomena","Behaviorism","Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale","Medical_diagnosis","Nomenclature","Mental_disorder","Classification_of_mental_disorders","DSM-III","West_Gate_Bridge","Melbourne","Australia","W._Edwards_Deming","Ontological","AI","End-user_computing","Knowledge-based_engineering","Subject_matter_expert","Duck_test","Simulation","Artifact_(observational)","Numerical_analysis","Non-monotonic_logic","Qualification_problem","Frame_problem","Ramification_problem","Temperature","Nicolas_LÃ©onard_Sadi_Carnot","International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","Electrical_resistance","Thermistor","Calibration","Electric_current","Force","Infinity","Parallel_(geometry)","Current_balance","Ampere","Temperature","Electric_current","Hardness","Intelligence_(trait)","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Shore_scleroscope","Brinell_hardness_test","Vickers_hardness_test","Rockwell_hardness_test","Knowledge-based_engineering","Duck_typing","Newton_(unit)","Spring_scale","Operationalization","Pragmatic_maxim","Pragmaticism","Pragmatism"]}
