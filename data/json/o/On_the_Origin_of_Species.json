Its full title was 'On the Origin of Species by Means\nof Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for\nLife'. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to 'The Origin\nof Species'. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations\nevolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It\npresented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent\nthrough a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had\ngathered on the ''Beagle'' expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings\nfrom research, correspondence, and experimentation.\n\nVarious evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in\nbiology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and\nthe general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English\nscientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while\nscience was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species\nwere controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were\nunchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated\nto other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely\ndebated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\n\nThe book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread\ninterest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings\nwere taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific,\nphilosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to\nthe campaign by T.H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise\nscience by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was\nwidespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of\ncommon descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection\nthe significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During the \"eclipse of\nDarwinism\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution\nwere given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary\nsynthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation\nthrough natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, now the\nunifying concept of the life sciences.\n","linknr":1854,"url":"On_the_Origin_of_Species","recorded":1362483051,"links":90,"instances":["philosophy","bird","science","genus","spirit","biology","1855","publisher","biology","mathematician","journalist","science","classification_of_human_beings","magazine","mythology","biology","publishing","stratigraphy","biology","philosophy","evolution","biology","pregnancy"],"pdf":["http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf"],"categories":["Books
