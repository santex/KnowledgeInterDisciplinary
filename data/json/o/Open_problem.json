Some questions remain unanswered for centuries before\nsolutions are found. Two notable examples in mathematics that have been solved\nand closed by researchers in the late twentieth century are Fermat's Last\nTheorem and the four color map theorem. K. Appel\nand W.

MR 58:27598d An\nimportant mathematics open problem solved in early 21st century is the PoincarÃ©\nconjecture.\n\nImportant open problems exist in many fields, such as physics, chemistry,\nbiology, computer science, and mathematics.
