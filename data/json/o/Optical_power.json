{"cursor":"2371","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Optical power' (also referred to as 'dioptric power', 'refractive power',\n'focusing power', or 'convergence power') is the degree to which a lens, mirror,\nor other optical system converges or diverges light. It is equal to the\nreciprocal of the focal length of the device: . High optical power\ncorresponds to short focal length. The SI unit for optical power is the inverse\nmetre (m â1 ), which is commonly called the dioptre.\n\nConverging lenses have positive optical power, while diverging lenses have\nnegative power. When a lens is immersed in a refractive medium, its optical\npower and focal length change.\n\nFor two or more thin lenses close together, the optical power of the combined\nlenses is approximately equal to the sum of the optical powers of each lens:\nP = P 1 + P 2. Similarly, the optical\npower of a single lens is roughly equal to the sum of the powers of each\nsurface. These approximations are commonly used in optometry.\n\nAn eye that has too much or too little refractive power to focus light onto the\nretina has a refractive error. A myopic eye has too much power so light is\nfocused in front of the retina. Conversely, a hyperopic eye has too little power\nso when the eye is relaxed, light is focused behind the retina. An eye with a\nrefractive power in one meridian that is different from the refractive power of\nthe other meridians has astigmatism. Anisometropia is the condition in which one\neye has a different refractive power than the other eye.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Optical_power","recorded":1362664890,"links":26,"instances":["eye","optics","optics","optics","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Optics|Power"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lens_triplet.svg/36px-Lens_triplet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"],["medium","optics"],["focus","optics"],["meridian","perimetry,_visual_field"],["astigmatism","eye"],["vergence","optics"]],"members":["astigmatism","medium","meridian","focus","lens","vergence"],"related":["Lens_(optics)","Mirror","Multiplicative_inverse","Focal_length","Inverse_metre","Dioptre","Converging_lens","Diverging_lens","Medium_(optics)","Thin_lens","Optometry","Human_eye","Focus_(optics)","Retina","Refractive_error","Myopic","Hyperopic","Meridian_(perimetry,_visual_field)","Astigmatism_(eye)","Anisometropia","Vergence_(optics)","Lens_clock","Vertometer","Lensmeter","Plate_scale"]}
