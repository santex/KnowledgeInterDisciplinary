{"cursor":"17193","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Orthogenesis', 'orthogenetic evolution', 'progressive evolution' or\n'autogenesis', is the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to evolve in a\nunilinear fashion due to some internal or external \"driving force\". The\nhypothesis is based on essentialism and cosmic teleology and proposes an\nintrinsic drive which slowly transforms species. George Gaylord Simpson (1953)\nin an attack on orthogenesis called this mechanism \"the mysterious inner\nforce\". George Gaylord Simpson, Life of the Past: An Introduction to\nPaleontology, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1953, p. 125. Classic\nproponents of orthogenesis have rejected the theory of natural selection as the\norganising mechanism in evolution, and theories of speciation for a rectilinear\nmodel of guided evolution acting on discrete species with \"essences\". The term\northogenesis was popularized by Theodor Eimer, though many of the ideas are much\nolder (Bateson 1909).
