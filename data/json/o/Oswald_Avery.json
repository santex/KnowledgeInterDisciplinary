The major part of his career was\nspent at the Rockefeller University Hospital in New York City. Avery was one of\nthe first molecular biologists and a pioneer in immunochemistry, but he is best\nknown for his discovery in 1944, with his co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn\nMcCarty, that DNA is the material of which genes and chromosomes are made.\n\nThe Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving\nscientist to not receive the Nobel Prize for his work, though he was nominated for the award throughout the\n1930s, '40s and '50s.\n\nThe lunar crater Avery was named in his honor.\n","linknr":346,"url":"Oswald_Avery","recorded":1362374061,"links":41,"instances":["crater","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://tennessee.gov/tsla/history/manuscripts/findingaids/70-128.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/avery-oswald-t.pdf"],"categories":["1877 births","1955 deaths","Canadian expatriate academics in the United States","American geneticists","Colgate University alumni","Canadian people of English descent","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","People from Halifax, Nova Scotia","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research","Recipients of the Copley Medal","Rockefeller University people","American microbiologists","American medical researchers","Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni"],"headings":["Biography","Breakthrough discovery","Bibliography","References","Further reading","Other sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Oswald_T._Avery_portrait_1937.jpg/150px-Oswald_T._Avery_portrait_1937.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Dna-split2.png/75px-Dna-split2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["avery","crater"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["avery","cell"],"related":["City_of_Halifax","Nova_Scotia","Nashville,_Tennessee","Molecular_biology","Rockefeller_University","Hospital","DNA","Royal_Society","Physician","Medicine","Researcher","Rockefeller_University","Hospital","Molecular_biology","Immunology","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","Colin_MacLeod","Maclyn_McCarty","DNA","Gene","Chromosome","Nobel_Prize","Arne_Tiselius","Lunar_crater","Avery_(crater)","City_of_Halifax","Colgate_University","Columbia_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons","Brooklyn,_New_York","Graves_disease","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Cell_(biology)","Protein","Frederick_Griffith","Heredity","Emeritus","Organic_compound","Protease","Enzyme","Deoxyribonuclease","Alfred_Hershey","Martha_Chase","Hershey-Chase_experiment","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Helical","Genetics","Joshua_Lederberg","Genetics","City_of_Halifax","Nashville,_Tennessee"]}
