This gaseous mixture is used for torches for the\nprocessing of refractory materials and was the first gaseous mixture\nused for welding. Theoretically, a ratio of 2:1 hydrogen:oxygen is enough to\nachieve maximum efficiency; in practice a ratio 4:1 or 5:1 is required to avoid\nan oxidizing flame. {{Cite book\n| last = Viall first = Ethan title = Gas Torch and Thermite Welding publisher =\n| McGraw-Hill year = 1921 page = 10| url =\n| http://archive.org/details/gastorchthermitw00vialrich\n}}\n\nThis mixture may sometimes be called by an old term 'knallgas' (German; \"bang-\ngas\"), although some authors used to define knallgas to be a generic term for\nthe mixture of fuel with precise amount of oxygen required for complete\ncombustion, thus 2:1 oxyhydrogen would be called \"hydrogen-knallgas\".
