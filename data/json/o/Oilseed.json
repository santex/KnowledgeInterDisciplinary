For this reason, vegetable\n | oils that are solid at room temperature are sometimes called 'vegetable\n | fats'. Vegetable oils are composed of triglycerides, as contrasted with waxes\n | which lack glycerin in their structure. Although many plant parts may yield\n | oil, Compare, for example, the list of raw materials from which essential\n | oils are extracted in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily\n | from seeds.\n\nOn food packaging, the term \"vegetable oil\" is often used in ingredients lists\ninstead of specifying the exact plant being used.\n","linknr":478,"url":"Oilseed","recorded":1362503868,"links":27,"instances":["food","british_television_series"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2009/January/Oilseedsfull0109.pdf","http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2009/January/Oilseedsfull0109.pdf","http://www.corn.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CornOil.pdf"],"categories":["Vegetable oils|","Cooking fats","Oils","Vegetable fats","Pet foods"],"headings":["Uses of triglyceride vegetable oil","Production","Particular oils","History in North America","Used oil","Negative health effects","Product labeling","See also","Notes and references","Other references","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Olive_oil_from_Oneglia.jpg/145px-Olive_oil_from_Oneglia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ram_press","food"],["panorama","british_television_series"]],"members":["ram_press","panorama"],"related":["Triglyceride","Plant","State_of_matter","Triglyceride","Wax","Glycerin","Essential_oil","Seed","Charlestown_State_Park","Indiana_University-Purdue_University_Fort_Wayne","Hickory_nut","Fat","Butter","Ghee","Olive_oil","Sesame_oil","Almond_oil","Flash_point","Soybean_oil","Canola_oil","Sunflower_oil","Safflower_oil","Peanut_oil","Cottonseed_oil","Coconut_oil","Palm_oil","Rice_bran_oil","Hydrogenation","Hydrogenation","Hydrogen","Catalyst","Nickel","Saturated_fat","Rancidification","Oxidation","Triglyceride","Trans_fats","Standard_of_Identity","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Soap","Candle","Perfume","Cosmetics","Drying_oil","Paint","Dammar","Electrical_insulation","Biodegradable","Flash_point","Oxygen","Crude_oil","Distillate","Fischerâ€“Speier_esterification","Hydraulic_fluid","Lubricant","Rancidification","Ben_oil","Mineral_oil","Castor_oil","Hydroxyl","Polyurethane","Natural_oil_polyols","Pet_food","AAFCO","Fruit","Biodiesel","Diesel_fuel","Vegetable_oil_blends","Straight_vegetable_oil","Pure_plant_oil","Viscosity","Vegetable_oil_economy","Biodiesel_around_the_world","National_Non-Food_Crops_Centre","Oil_mill","Health-food","Expeller","Screw_press","Ram_press_(food)","Mortar_and_pestle","Madhuca_longifolia","Hexane","Supercritical_carbon_dioxide","Hydrogenation","Margarine","Smoke_point","Trans_fat","Straight_vegetable_oil","Biodiesel","USDA","Metric_tons","Palm_oil","Tropical","Biofuel","Soybean_oil","Rapeseed_oil","Canola","Cultivar","Sunflower_oil","Biodiesel","Peanut_oil","Cottonseed_oil","Palm_kernel_oil","Seed","Coconut_oil","Soaps","Olive_oil","Cooking","Cosmetics","Soaps","Fuel","Oil_lamps","Biodiesel","Diesel_engine","Viscosity","Rudolf_Diesel","Peanut_oil","Corn_oil","Grape_seed_oil","Hazelnut_oil","Linseed_oil","Flax","Rice_bran_oil","Rice","Safflower_oil","Sesame_oil","India","Procter_&_Gamble","Ginning_mill","Crisco","Smuckers","Henry_Ford","Windex","The_Cincinnati_Post","E._W._Scripps_Company","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Omega-3","Deep_fryer","Potato","Snack_food","Fast_food_restaurant","Vegetable_oil_fuel","Biodiesel","Soap","Compound_feed","Pet_food","Detergent","Cosmetics","Commodity","Yellow_grease","European_Union","Catering","Low-density_lipoprotein","High-density_lipoprotein","Omega-6","Polyunsaturated_fatty_acids","Soybean_oil","Corn_oil","Sunflower_oil","Breast_cancer","Prostate_cancer","Mouse","Monounsaturated_fatty_acids","Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil","BBC","Panorama_(British_television_series)","Algae_culture","Biodiesel","Cholesterol","Cooking_oil","Decorticator","Deodoriser","Essential_oils","Expeller","Fatty_acid","Food_extrusion","Fragrance_oil","Lipid","List_of_macerated_oils","List_of_vegetable_oils","Non-food_crop","Oleochemistry","Olive_oil","Straight_vegetable_oil","Vernonia_oil","Vegetable_oil_recycling"]}
