      "text" : " in Rome)|thumbtime=6]] In disciplines such as philosophy and knowledge\n representation, the 'typeâ€“token distinction' is a distinction that separates a\n concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For\n example, the particular bicycle in your garage is a token of the type of thing\n known as \"The bicycle\". Whereas, the bicycle in your garage is in a particular\n place at a particular time, that is not true of \"the bicycle\" as used in the\n sentence: \"The bicycle has become more popular recently\". In logic, the\n distinction is used to clarify the meaning of symbols of formal languages.\n\nTypes are often understood ontologically as being concepts. They do not exist\nanywhere in particular because they are not physical objects. Types may have\nmany tokens. However, types are not directly producible as tokens are. You may,\nfor instance, show someone the bicycle in your garage, but you cannot show\nsomeone \"The bicycle\". Tokens always exist at a particular place and time and\nmay be shown to exist as a concrete physical object.\n\nIt can be quite useful to distinguish between an abstract \"type\" of thing, and\nthe various physical \"tokens\" or examples of that thing. This type-token\ndistinction is illustrated by way of examples. If we say that two people \"have\nthe same car\", we may mean that they have the same type of car (e.g. the same\nbrand and model), or the same particular token of the car (e.g. they share a\nsingle vehicle). This distinction is useful in other ways, during discussion of\nlanguage. In the phrase \"Grendel is Grendel is Grendel is Grendel\", there are\nonly two types of words (\"Grendel\" and \"is\") but there are seven tokens (four\n\"Grendel\" and three \"is\" tokens).\n",
