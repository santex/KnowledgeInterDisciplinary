{"cursor":"22439","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Object permanence' is the understanding that objects continue to exist even\nwhen they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any\nway). This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of developmental\npsychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of\ninfants' and children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet\nscientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in\nhuman development. Some researchers contend that it is acquired within the first\ntwo years of life, while others believe that it is an innate or built-in\nunderstanding present at birth.\n\nJean Piaget, the Swiss psychologist who first studied object permanence in young\ninfants, argued that object permanence is one of an infant's most important\naccomplishments, as without this concept, objects would have no separate,\npermanent existence. In Piaget's theory of cognitive development infants develop\nthis understanding by the end of the \"sensorimotor stage,\" which lasts from\nbirth to about two years of age. Piaget thought that\nan infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor\ndevelopment, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor\nrepresentations of objects. According to this view, it is through touching and\nhandling objects that infants develop object permanence.\n","linknr":316,"url":"Object_permanence","recorded":1362371470,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cognition","Child development","Developmental psychology"],"headings":["Early research","Stages","Contradicting evidence","In animals","Recent studies","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/US_Navy_100406-N-7478G-346_Operations_Specialist_2nd_Class_Reginald_Harlmon_and_Electronics_Technician_3rd_Class_Maura_Schulze_play_peek-a-boo_with_a_child_in_the_Children%27s_Ward_at_Hospital_Likas.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Developmental_psychology","Psychology","Jean_Piaget","Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development","Sensorimotor_stage","Motor_skill","A-not-B_error","A-not-B_error","Frontal_cortex","Near_infrared_spectroscopy","Magpie","Longitudinal_study","Carrion_crow","Blindness","Hearing_impairment","Down_syndrome","Cerebral_palsy","Language_acquisition","Elizabeth_Spelke","Renee_Baillargeon","Philosophical_realism","Idealism"]}
