However, because of\nreservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies,\nonly a fraction of this oil can be brought to the surface, and it is only this\nproducible fraction that is considered to be reserves. The ratio of producible\n'oil reserves' to total oil in place for a given field is often referred to as\nthe recovery factor. Recovery factors vary greatly among oil fields. The\nrecovery factor of any particular field may change over time based on operating\nhistory and in response to changes in technology and economics. The recovery\nfactor may also rise over time if additional investment is made in enhanced oil\nrecovery techniques such as gas injection, surfactants injection, water-\nflooding, {{cite web\n | title = Oil Reserves publisher = BP Global year = 2008 url = http://www.bp.c-\n | om/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9023799&contentId=7044111 accessdate =\n | 2009-05-16}}\n or microbial enhanced oil recovery.\n\nBased on data from OPEC at the beginning of 2011 the highest proved oil reserves\nincluding non-conventional oil deposits are in Venezuela (20% of global\nreserves), Saudi Arabia (18% of global reserves), Canada (13% of global\nreserves), Iran (9%). {{cite web\n | title = OPEC Share of World Oil Reserves 2010 publisher = OPEC year = 2011\n | url = http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/330.htm}}\n\nBecause the geology of the subsurface cannot be examined directly, indirect\ntechniques must be used to estimate the size and recoverability of the resource.\nWhile new technologies have increased the accuracy of these techniques,\nsignificant uncertainties still remain. In general, most early estimates of the\nreserves of an oil field are conservative and tend to grow with time. This\nphenomenon is called [[Oil_reserves#Reserves growth|reserves growth]]. {{cite journal\n | author = David F.
