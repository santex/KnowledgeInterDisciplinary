When dealing with metric spaces, there is a well-defined\ndistance between any two points. A subset U of a metric space is open if, for\nevery point p in U, there is some (possibly very small) positive distance such\nthat every point which is at least this close to p is also contained in U.\n\nThe notion of an open set provides a fundamental way to speak of nearness of\npoints in a topological space, without explicitly having a concept of distance\ndefined. Concepts that use notions of nearness, such as the continuity of\nfunctions, can be translated into the language of open sets.\n\nIn point-set topology, open sets are used to distinguish between points and\nsubsets of a space. The degree to which any two points can be separated is\nspecified by the separation axioms. The collection of all open sets in a space\ndefines the topology of the space. Functions from one topological space to\nanother that preserve the topology are the continuous functions. Although open\nsets and the topologies that they comprise are of central importance in point-\nset topology, they are also used as an organizational tool in other important\nbranches of mathematics. Examples of topologies include the Zariski topology in\nalgebraic geometry that reflects the algebraic nature of varieties, and the\ntopology on a differential manifold in differential topology where each point\nwithin the space is contained in an open set that is homeomorphic to an open\nball in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nPoint-set topology is the area of mathematics concerned with general topological\nspaces, and the relations between them. In the category of topological spaces,\nmorphisms are continuous functions between topological spaces. Continuous\nfunctions are readily observed to preserve topological structure, as they map\n\"points close together\" to \"points close together\"; that is, they preserve the\nstructure of open sets defined on the space.\n\nIn metric topology, one can concretely define a distance function between two\npoints, and thus metric spaces also have a topology, i.e. a certain structure of\nopen sets defined on them. Thus, as opposed to the pure topological invariants,\nmetric topology deals with isometries and the like; that is, distance preserving\nmaps. In this case, the idea of an open set is used as an organizational tool\nrather than an object of study. From the topological point of view, metric\nspaces are fairly well understood, although many open problems still remain in\nmetrizability theory.\n","linknr":252,"url":"Open_set","recorded":1362477261,"links":46,"instances":["mathematics","category_theory","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","set_theory","mathematics","set_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["General topology"],"headings":["Motivation","Definitions","Properties","Uses","Notes and cautions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Red_blue_circle.svg/220px-Red_blue_circle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/8/a383a3b55b89732c2298ed2e7350e528.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/8/a383a3b55b89732c2298ed2e7350e528.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/9/6/0969b386f6f36c93005270a70dbcd718.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/d/e1d71d7382dcd20c80a649071a9a1d30.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/a/06a20e4e8023e1e4861de5954cb979e5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/0/2d05e1f15387f87456155cd96cc06235.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/c/5/4c5af31a9ec8beb8ed602249d2e8866a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/b/b2b6caa107d3961faa45dea2afd83a84.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/6/d/66de1fec45aef0a72036c109d4ec2ea5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["boundary","topology"],["category","mathematics"],["morphism","category_theory"],["metric","mathematics"],["interval","mathematics#notations_for_intervals"],["neighbourhood","mathematics"],["neighbourhood","mathematics"],["union","set_theory"],["intersection","set_theory"],["function","mathematics"],["image","mathematics"],["neighbourhood","mathematics"]],"members":["function","morphism","metric","interval","image","boundary","neighbourhood","intersection","category","union","set"],"related":["Topology","Set_(mathematics)","Boundary_(topology)","Metric_spaces","Metric_space","Topological_space","Continuous_function","Topological_indistinguishability","Separation_axiom","Topology","Zariski_topology","Algebraic_geometry","Algebraic_variety","Differential_manifold","Differential_topology","Open_ball","Euclidean_space","Point-set_topology","Category_(mathematics)","Morphism_(category_theory)","Metric_topology","Topology","Isometries","Metrizability_theory","Topological_space","Topologically_distinguishable","Metric_(mathematics)","Real_number","Euclidean_space","Given_any","There_exists","Euclidean_distance","Neighbourhood_(mathematics)","Metric_space","Topological_space","Subset","If_and_only_if","Neighbourhood_(mathematics)","Countably_many","Empty_set","Clopen_set","Clopen_set","Union_(set_theory)","Intersection_(set_theory)","Topology","Topological_space","Metric_spaces","Uniform_spaces","Subset","Topological_interior","Function_(mathematics)","Preimage","Image_(mathematics)","Real_line","Topology","Rational_number","Real_numbers","Euclidean_topology","Clopen_set","Closed_set","Clopen_set","Neighbourhood_(mathematics)"]}
