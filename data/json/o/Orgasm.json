Experienced by males and females, orgasms are\ncontrolled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system. They are often\nassociated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple\nareas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements\nand vocalizations are expressed. The period after orgasm\n(known as a refractory period) is often a relaxing experience, attributed to the\nrelease of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin, as well as endorphins (or\n\"endogenous morphine\").\n\nHuman orgasms usually result from the stimulation of the penis in males,\ntypically accompanying ejaculation, and the clitoris in females. Sexual\nstimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or by or with a sex partner\n(penetrative sexual intercourse, non-penetrative sex, and other erotic sexual\nactivity).\n","linknr":1918,"url":"Orgasm","recorded":1362581926,"links":93,"instances":["emotion","mythology","tv_channel","physiology","sex_toy","anthropologist","sex_position","psychologist","biology","sexual_act","mythology","biology","sex"],"pdf":["http://www.anugrahaa.com/downloads/Fr.%20D.J.Antony%20-%20Trauma%20Counselling.pdf","http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf","http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf"],"categories":["Orgasm|","Human
