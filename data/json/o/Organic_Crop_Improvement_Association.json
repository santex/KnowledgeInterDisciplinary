OCIA certifies and\nverifies farm, livestock, processor/handlers, broker-traders, Community Grower\nGroups (CGGs), and Private Labels to various programs. OCIA certifies\noperations to the OCIA International Certification Standard, USDA National\nOrganic Program (NOP), Canada Organic Regime (COR), European Union Equivalent\nStandards (EU), Japanese Organic Agricultural Standards (JAS) and Quebec Organic\nReference Standards (Quebec). OCIA verifies to JAS, the US-Canada Organic\nEquivalence Arrangement, Bio-Suisse, Swiss Ordinance of Organic Farming, UTZ\nCertified, Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Shade-Grown Coffee (part of the OCIA\nInternational Certification Standard.)\n\nWith its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, OCIA has regional and chapter\noffices in Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, Japan, Guatemala, Peru and the U.S. OCIA\nwas founded in 1985 (incorporated in 1988) in Albany, New York by a group of\nfarmers, modeled on the \"crop improvement associations\" that came out of the\nDust Bowl era. These associations started as informal meetings where farmers\ncould discuss and ask advice about their land. In the 1970s as the organic\nmovement developed, \"organic\" crop improvement associations were formed. An\ninternational organization, OCIA continues to have a local approach with the\norganization largely being made up of local \"chapters.\" The organization has\nmembers primarily in Canada and the U.S. until a group of Peruvian farmers\njoined the organization in 1988. Expansion throughout Latin America continued,\nand now OCIA has members across the world.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Organic_Crop_Improvement_Association","recorded":1362551709,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic farming in the United States","Organic farming organizations","Organizations established in 1985","Product certification","Organizations based in Lincoln, Nebraska","Non-profit organizations based in Nebraska"],"headings":["External links","Notes and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/OCIA_Logo.svg/150px-OCIA_Logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fe/OCIA_-_Certified_Organic_Seal.svg/150px-OCIA_-_Certified_Organic_Seal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nonprofit_organization","Organic_certification","Organic_farming","USDA","National_Organic_Program","Canada_Organic_Regime","Japanese_Organic_Agricultural_Standards","Quebec_Organic_Reference_Standards","Dust_Bowl","Organic_movement"]}
