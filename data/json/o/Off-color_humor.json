{"cursor":"5825","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The term 'off-color humor' (also known as 'vulgar humor' or 'crude humor') is an\nAmericanism used to describe jokes, prose, poems, black comedy, blue comedy,\ninsult comedy, cringe comedy and skits that deal with topics that are considered\nto be in poor taste or overly vulgar by the prevailing morality of a culture.\nMost commonly labeled as \"off-color\" are acts concerned with sex, a particular\nethnic group, or gender. Other off-color topics include violence, particularly\ndomestic abuse; excessive swearing or profanity; \"toilet humor\"; national\nsuperiority or inferiority, pedophilic content, and any other topics generally\nconsidered impolite or indecent. Generally, the point of off-color humor is to\ninduce laughter by evoking a feeling of shock and surprise in the comedian's\naudience. In this way, off-color humor is related to other forms of postmodern\nhumor, such as the anti-joke.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Off-color_humor","recorded":1362666499,"links":14,"instances":["joke"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Humour","Off-color humor|"],"headings":["History","Veg and non-veg jokes","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_aristocrats","joke"]],"members":["the_aristocrats"],"related":["American_English","Jokes","Prose","Poem","Black_comedy","Ribaldry","Insult_comedy","Cringe_comedy","Sketch_comedy","Vulgarity","Morality","Culture","Sexual_intercourse","Racism","Sexism","Violence","Spousal_abuse","Profanity","Nationalism","Xenophobia","Pedophilia","Taboo","Indecent","Postmodern","Humor","Anti-joke","Ancient_Greek_comedy","Aristophanes","Euripides","William_Shakespeare","Jonathan_Swift","A_Modest_Proposal","Subversive","Lenny_Bruce","Obscenity","New_York_City","Redd_Foxx","Stand-up_comedy","Peter_Cook","Dudley_Moore","Alter-ego","Derek_and_Clive","Rudy_Ray_Moore","Andrew_Dice_Clay","Richard_Pryor","George_Carlin","Bill_Hicks","Dave_Chappelle","Censorship","The_Aristocrats_(joke)","Tom_Green","The_Tom_Green_Show","Freddy_got_Fingered","British_humour","Taboo","Political_correctness","B3ta","Sickipedia","Vegetarian","Times_of_India","Rationale_of_the_Dirty_Joke","Dick_joke","Rudeness","Nam-Ä±_Kemal_jokes","Ethnic_jokes"]}
