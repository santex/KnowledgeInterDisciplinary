{"cursor":"5574","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Portrait of Orla Lehmann, 1862 ]] 'Peter Martin Orla Lehmann' (15 May 1810\n– 13 September 1870) was a Danish statesman, a key figure in the\ndevelopment of Denmark's parliamentary government.\n\nHe was born in Copenhagen, son of Martin Christian Gottlieb Lehmann\n(1775–1856), assessor, later conference councillor (konferensraad) and\ndeputee in the College of Commerce. The father was German, born in Haselau at\nUetersen in Holstein, while the mother was Danish and daughter of a Mayor in\nCopenhagen. The family belonged to the same social circle as the Ãrsted brothers\nand the poet OehlenschlÃ¤ger. Orla was put in the German [[realschule]] in the\nSt. Petri parish, later moved to the Borgerdydskole and began his studies at the\nUniversity of Copenhagen in 1827. After a year studying literature, when he read\nHeine in the company of H. C. Andersen, he began his Law studies. After a study\nprogramme which he found tedious, he graduated in 1833.\n\nAlthough of German extraction, Orla Lehmann's sympathies were with the Danish\nNational Liberal Party. and he contributed to the liberal journal the\nKjÃ¸benhavnsposten while he was a student, and from 1839 to 1842 edited, with\nChristian N. David, the FÃ¦drelandet. In 1842 he was condemned to three months\nimprisonment for a radical speech. He took a considerable part in the\ndemonstrations of 1848, and was regarded as the leader of the Eider-Danes, that\nis, of the party which regarded the Eider River as the boundary of Denmark, and\nthe Duchy of Schleswig as an integral part of the kingdom.\n\nHe entered the Cabinet of Moltke I in March 1848, and was employed on diplomatic\nmissions to London and Berlin in connection with the Schleswig-Holstein Question\nbut left the cabinet the same year because of his dissatisfaction with the\npolitical situation. As a local official in Jutland he was for some months in\n1849 a prisoner of the Schleswig-Holsteiners at Gottorp. A member of the\nFolketing from 1851 to 1853, of the Landsting from 1854 to 1870, and from 1856\nto 1866 of the RigsrÃ¥d, he became Minister of the Interior in 1861 in the\ncabinet of K. C. Hall, retiring with him in 1863.\n\nDuring these years he was overshadowed by the younger National Liberals\nespecially by Hall, however he in many ways did a great work behind the\nscenes, for instance it was he who carried through the law of womenâs\neconomic independence. His last years were embittered by the defeat of 1864\nand by his presentiment of the new German great power. He died at Copenhagen\nin September 1870.\n\nBeing one of the most stirring speakers of early Danish parliamentarian life\n(almost like Lamartine in France) and besides a charming and committed man\nLehmann however seems to have lacked both sense of reality and a more heartfelt\nsense of democracy. As âthe freedom fighter of 1848â he remained a national hero\nin Denmark for several generations but he was not able to maintain his\ninfluence.\n\nHis book On the Causes of the Misfortunes of Denmark (1864) went through many\neditions, and his works were published posthumously in four volumes.\n\nHis two grandsons were the politician Ove Rode and the author Helge Rode.\n\n\n{{succession
