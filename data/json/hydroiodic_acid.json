Aqueous solutions of HI are known\nas 'hydroiodic acid' or 'hydriodic acid', a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide and\nhydroiodic acid are, however, different in that the former is a gas under\nstandard conditions; whereas, the other is an aqueous solution of said gas. They\nare interconvertible. HI is used in organic and inorganic synthesis as one of\nthe primary sources of iodine and as a reducing agent.\n",
