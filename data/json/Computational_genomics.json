{"cursor":"9613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Computational genomics' refers to the use of computational analysis to decipher\nbiology from genome sequences and related data, including both DNA\nand RNA sequence as well as other \"post-genomic\" data (i.e. experimental data\nobtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic DNA\nmicroarrays). As such, computational genomics may be regarded as a subset of\nbioinformatics, but with a focus on using whole genomes (rather than individual\ngenes) to understand the principles of how the DNA of a species controls its\nbiology at the molecular level and beyond. With the current abundance of massive\nbiological datasets, computational studies have become one of the most important\nmeans to biological discovery.
