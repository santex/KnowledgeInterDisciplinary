{"cursor":"17291","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn photography and cinematography, 'perspective distortion' is a warping or\ntransformation of an object and its surrounding area that differs significantly\nfrom what the object would look like with a normal focal length, due to the\nrelative scale of nearby and distant features. Perspective distortion is\ndetermined by the relative distances at which the image is captured and viewed,\nand is due to the angle of view of the image (as captured) being either wider or\nnarrower than the angle of view at which the image is viewed, hence the apparent\nrelative distances differing from what is expected. Related to this concept is\n'axial magnification' -- the perceived depth of objects at a given\nmagnification.\n\nPerspective distortion takes two forms: extension distortion and compression\ndistortion, also called wide-angle distortion and long-lens or telephoto distor-\ntion, [http://books.google.com/books?id=lYDbRc4QKK8C&pg=PA73&dq=%22long+len-\ns%22+distortion&hl=en&ei=y2gsTcq5D4-\nu8AbR3ISZCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=-\n%22long%20lens%22%20distortion&f=false Mark Galer, Photography Foundations for\nArt and Design, page 73] when talking about images with the same field\nsize. Extension or wide-angle distortion can be seen in images shot from close\nusing a wide-angle lens (with an angle of view wider than a normal lens). Object\nclose to the lens appears abnormally large relative to more distant objects, and\ndistant objects appear abnormally small and hence more distant â distances are\nextended. Compression, long-lens, or telephoto distortion can be seen in images\nshot from a distant using a long focus lens or the more common telephoto sub-\ntype (with an angle of view narrower than a normal lens). Distant objects look\napproximately the same size â closer objects are abnormally small, and more\ndistant objects are abnormally large, and hence the viewer cannot discern\nrelative distances between distant objects â distances are compressed.\n\nNote that perspective distortion is caused by distance, not by the lens per se\nâ two shots of the same scene from the same distance will exhibit identical\nperspective distortion, regardless of lens used. However, since wide-angle\nlenses have a wider field of view, they are generally used from closer, while\ntelephoto lenses have a narrower field of view and are generally used from\nfarther away. For example, if standing at a distance so that a normal lens\ncaptures someone's face, a shot with a wide-angle lens or telephoto lens from\nthe same distance will have exactly the same perspective on the face, though\nthe wide-angle lens may fit the entire body into the shot, while the telephoto\nlens captures only the nose. However, crops of these three images with the\nsame coverage will yield the same perspective distortion â the nose will look\nthe same in all three. Conversely, if all three lenses are used from distances\nsuch that the face fills the field, the wide-angle will be used from closer,\nmaking the nose larger, and the telephoto will be used from farther, making\nthe nose smaller.\n\nOutside of photography, expansion distortion is familiar to many through side-\nview mirrors (see \"objects in mirror are closer than they appear\") and\npeepholes, though these often use a fisheye lens, exhibiting different\ndistortion. Compression distortion is most familiar in looking through\nbinoculars or telescopes, as in telescopic sights, while a similar effect is\nseen in fixed-slit strip photography, notably a photo finish, where all capture\nis parallel to the capture, completely eliminating perspective (a side view).\n","linknr":423,"url":"Perspective_distortion_(photography)","recorded":1362893272,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science of photography","Photographic techniques"],"headings":["Optics","Influencing factors","Artistic uses","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Camera_focal_length_distance.gif/220px-Camera_focal_length_distance.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/a/e5a7472d780a5a032c7775cc5e3ce901.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/9/9b952eeb9cbd5368b6b6b35bee5a29e4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/a/8fa14cdd754f91cc6554c9e71929cce7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/4/e14c608ab0d4acc92ebe546fb90a817d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/1/e3161d080dc9631356d4000ce98a1b94.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/6/e562271b1acee8617ce783da7810d242.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/9/9b952eeb9cbd5368b6b6b35bee5a29e4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/a/e5a7472d780a5a032c7775cc5e3ce901.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/9/9b952eeb9cbd5368b6b6b35bee5a29e4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/d/63d486bf6571cb3db6f3c79ad1297156.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Angleofview_50mm_f4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Angleofview_28mm_f4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Angleofview_70mm_f4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Sameframe_100mm_f8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Sameframe_70mm_f8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Sameframe_50mm_f8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Sameframe_28mm_f8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Focal_length.jpg/220px-Focal_length.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Gondolas.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/Nybldgs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Photography","Cinematography","Normal_lens","Angle_of_view","Field_size","Wide-angle_lens","Long_focus_lens","Telephoto_lens","Side-view_mirror","Objects_in_mirror_are_closer_than_they_appear","Peephole","Fisheye_lens","Binoculars","Telescope","Telescopic_sight","Strip_photography","Photo_finish","Gaussian_optics","Angle_of_view","Camera","Normal_lens","Focal_length","Portrait","Angle_of_view","Wide_angle_lens","Normal_lens","Telephoto_lens","Field_size","Angle_of_view","Wide-angle_lens","Telephoto_lens","Depth_of_field","Normal_lens","Angle_of_view","Field_size","Rectilinear_lens","Curvilinear_perspective","Fisheye_lens","Barrel_distortion","Ultra_wide_angle_lens","Terry_Gilliam","Stanley_Kubrick","Orson_Welles","Sam_Peckinpah","Sidney_Lumet","Jean-Pierre_Jeunet","Marc_Caro","Monty_Python","Social_criticism","Leni_Riefenstahl","Telephoto","Adolf_Hitler","Low-angle_shot","Special_effect","Dolly_zoom","Zoom_lens","Nazgûl","Foreshortening","Perspective_correction_lens","Texture_gradient","Curvilinear_perspective"]}
