In some regions, a best before, use by\nor freshness date is required on packaged perishable foods.\n\nShelf life is the recommendation of time that products can be stored, during\nwhich the defined quality of a specified proportion of the goods remains\nacceptable under expected (or specified) conditions of distribution, storage and\ndisplay.\n\nMost shelf life dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected\nhandling and exposure to temperature. Use prior to the expiration date does not\nnecessarily guarantee the safety of a food or drug, while a product is not\nalways dangerous nor ineffective after the expiration date.\n","linknr":560,"url":"Expiry_date","recorded":1362543784,"links":38,"instances":["outbreak_in_the_us","physics","beer","sale","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.usamma.army.mil/assets/docs/dlar.pdf","http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb132629-food-date-labelling-110915.pdf"],"categories":["Food safety","Packaging","Pharmacy","Food retailing"],"headings":["Shelf life","Temperature control","Packaging","Parallel names","Issues associated with sell by / use by dates","Enforcement","Beer","Related concepts","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Expiration.jpg/220px-Expiration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Heat_Sealing_Film_for_Permeability_Test.jpg/200px-Heat_Sealing_Film_for_Permeability_Test.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Expiration_Tag.jpg/220px-Expiration_Tag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/FoilMilkBottleTop.JPG/220px-FoilMilkBottleTop.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Best_before_Canada.JPG/220px-Best_before_Canada.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","physics"],["swine_flu","outbreak_in_the_us"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["closeout","sale"],["samuel_adams","beer"]],"members":["swine_flu","stress","samuel_adams","closeout","denaturation"],"related":["Food","Pharmaceutical_drug","Chemical","Decomposition","Eating","Food_quality","Foodborne_illness","Stock_rotation","Food_waste","Light","Heat","Gas","Stress_(physics)","Food_poisoning","Tetracycline","Jay_Pomerantz","Medscape","Shelf_Life_Extension_Program","U.S._Department_of_Defense","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Swine_flu_(outbreak_in_the_US)","Tamiflu","Cipro","Preservative","Antioxidant","Induction_sealing","Vacuum","Bench_stock","MRE","Field_ration","Nitroglycerin","Explosive_material","Rubber","Sulfur","Chemical_bond","Vulcanization","Rubber_band","Rule_of_thumb","Activation_energy","Activation_energy","Enzyme","Bacterium","Fungi","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Refrigeration","Insulated_shipping_container","Cold_chain","Temperature_data_logger","Time_temperature_indicator","Moisture_vapor_transmission_rate","Desiccant","Oxidation","Oxygen_transmission_rate","Oxygen_absorber","Produce","Modified_atmosphere","Active_packaging","Hot_dog_bun","Salmonella","United_Kingdom","Refrigeration","Period-after-opening_symbol","Discount_store","Closeout_(sale)","Stock_rotation","Waste_&_Resources_Action_Programme","Chill_chain","WHO","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Foodborne_illness","Hilary_Benn","Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","Waste_&_Resources_Action_Programme","Canadian_Food_Inspection_Agency","Food_and_Drugs_Act","Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs","United_States","Lucky_Lager","Boston_Beer_Company","Samuel_Adams_(beer)","Anheuser-Busch","Accelerated_aging","Cold_chain","Food_waste","Modified_atmosphere","Moisture_vapor_transmission_rate","Packaging_and_labelling","Permeation","Redox","Shelf_stable"]}
