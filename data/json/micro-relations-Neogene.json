The second period in the Cenozoic Era, it follows the Paleogene Period and\nis succeeded by the Quaternary Period. The Neogene is subdivided into two\nepochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene.\n\nThe Neogene covers about 20 million years. During this period, mammals and birds\ncontinued to evolve into roughly modern forms, while other groups of life\nremained relatively unchanged. Early hominids, the ancestors of humans, appeared\nin Africa. Some continental movement took place, the most significant event\nbeing the connection of North and South America at the Isthmus of Panama, late\nin the Pliocene. This cut off ocean currents between the Atlantic and Pacific\noceans, causing climate changes and creating the Gulf Stream. The global climate\ncooled considerably over the course of the Neogene, culminating in a series of\ncontinental glaciations in the Quaternary Period that follows.\n","linknr":494,"url":"Neogene","recorded":1362539500,"links":69,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/documents/QP%2016-1.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/report06.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Neogene"],"headings":["Divisions","Climate and geography","Flora and fauna","Disagreements","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Blakey_20moll.jpg/240px-Blakey_20moll.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Miocene.jpg/220px-Miocene.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","Cenozoic_Era","Paleogene","Quaternary","Miocene","Pliocene","Mammal","Bird","Hominid","North_America","South_America","Isthmus_of_Panama","Gulf_Stream","Quaternary_glaciation","Quaternary","Isthmus_of_Panama","North_America","South_America","Himalayas","Africa","Eurasia","Paleogene","Quaternary_glaciation","Mammal","Bird","Hominid","Eurasia","Horse","Antelope","Bison","Quaternary","Marine_Geologist","Cenozoic","Paleogene","Quaternary","Gelasian","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","Miocene","Pliocene","International_Union_for_Quaternary_Research","Gauss-Matuyama_reversal","International_Union_of_Geological_Sciences","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy"]}
