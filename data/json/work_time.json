      "text" : "\n'Working time' is the period of time that an individual spends at paid\noccupational labor. Unpaid labors such as personal housework or caring for\nchildren/pets are not considered part of the working week. Many countries\nregulate the work week by law, such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods,\nannual holidays and a maximum number of working hours per week. Working time may\nvary from person to person often depending on location, culture, lifestyle\nchoice, and the profitability of the individuals livelihood. For example someone\nwho is supporting children and paying a large mortgage will need to work more\nhours to meet a basic cost of living than someone without children of the same\nearning power. As fewer people than ever are having children<ref>http://www.goo-\ngle.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&tdim=true&d-\nl=en&hl=en&q=total+fertility+rate+global</ref> choosing part time is becoming\nmore popular.<ref></ref>\n\n'Standard working hours' (or normal working hours) refers to the legislation to\nlimit the working hours per day, per week, per month or per year. If an employee\nneeds to work overtime, the employer will need to pay overtime payments to\nemployees as required in the law. Generally speaking, standard working hours of\ncountries worldwide are around 40 to 44 hours per week, and the additional\novertime payments are around 25% to 50% to the normal hourly payments. 'Maximum\nworking hours' refers to the maximum working hours of an employee. The employee\ncannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law.\n\nSome economists have recommended moving to a 21 hour standard work week to\naddress problems with unemployment, high carbon emissions, low well-being,\nentrenched inequalities, overworking, family care, and the general lack of free\ntime.<ref name=nef21 /><ref name=guardian /><ref name=gam /> Actual work week\nlengths have been falling in the developed world.<ref name=gapminder />\n",
