{"cursor":"1681","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Garden tourism' is a type of niche tourism involving visits or travel to\nbotanical gardens and places which are significant in the history of gardening.\nGarden tourists often travel individually in countries with which they are\nfamiliar but often prefer to join organized garden tours in countries where they\nmight experience difficulties with language, travel or finding accommodation in\nthe vicinity of the garden. In the year 2000 the Alhambra and the Taj Mahal both\nreceived over 2 million visitors. This poses problems for the landscape manager.\n\nThe list of famous gardens which attract garden tourists from afar includes:\n* Sissinghurst Castle Garden and Stourhead in England,\n* Versailles and Giverny in France,\n* Keukenhof in Holland,\n* Villa d'Este and Villa Lante in Italy,\n* Alhambra in Spain,\n* Longwood Gardens and Filoli in the USA,\n* Taj Mahal in India, *RyÅan-ji in Japan.\n\nMichel de Montaigne was one of the earliest garden tourists to record his\nimpressions of gardens (c1580). John Evelyn also recorded his visits to gardens\nin France and Italy, as did Fynes Moryson. At the start of the 21st century\nBritain had the largest number of gardens open to the public for tourist visits:\nover 3,500 gardens are listed in Gardens of England and Wales Open for Charity\n(the 'Yellow Book').\n","linknr":242,"url":"Garden_tourism","recorded":1362373105,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of tourism"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Keukenhof-Szmurlo.jpg/200px-Keukenhof-Szmurlo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Botanical_garden","History_of_gardening","Landscape_manager","Sissinghurst_Castle_Garden","Stourhead","Palace_of_Versailles","Giverny","Keukenhof","Villa_d'Este","Villa_Lante","Alhambra","Longwood_Gardens","Filoli","Taj_Mahal","Ryōan-ji","Michel_de_Montaigne","John_Evelyn","Fynes_Moryson","Garden"]}
