She was previously a United\nStates Senator for New York from 2001 to 2009. As the wife of President Bill\nClinton, she was also the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001. In\nthe 2008 election, Clinton was a leading candidate for the Democratic\npresidential nomination.\n\nA native of Illinois, Hillary Rodham first attracted national attention in 1969\nfor her remarks as the first student commencement speaker at Wellesley College.\nShe embarked on a career in law after receiving her J.D. from Yale Law School in\n1973. Following a stint as a Congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas\nin 1974 and married Bill Clinton in 1975. Rodham cofounded the Arkansas\nAdvocates for Children and Families in 1977 and became the first female chair of\nthe Legal Services Corporation in 1978. Named the first female partner at Rose\nLaw Firm in 1979, she was twice listed as one of the 100 most influential\nlawyers in America. As First Lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992\nwith husband Bill as Governor, she successfully led a task force to reform\nArkansas's education system. During that time, she was a member of the board of\ndirectors of Wal-Mart Stores and several other corporations.\n\nIn 1994, as First Lady of the United States, her major initiative, the Clinton\nhealth care plan, failed to gain approval from the U.S. Congress. However, in\n1997 and 1999, Clinton played a role in advocating the creation of the State\nChildren's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the\nFoster Care Independence Act. Her years as First Lady drew a polarized response\nfrom the American public. The only First Lady to have been subpoenaed, she\ntestified before a federal grand jury in 1996 due to the Whitewater controversy,\nbut was never charged with wrongdoing in this or several other investigations\nduring her husband's administration. The state of her marriage was the subject\nof considerable speculation following the Lewinsky scandal in 1998.\n\nAfter moving to the state of New York, Clinton was elected as a U.S. Senator in\n2000. That election marked the first time an American First Lady had run for\npublic office; Clinton was also the first female senator to represent the state.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, she supported the U.S.\nmilitary action in Afghanistan and voted for the Iraq War Resolution. She\nsubsequently opposed the George W. Bush administration on its conduct of the war\nin Iraq and on most domestic issues. Senator Clinton was reelected by a wide\nmargin in 2006. In the 2008 presidential nomination race, Hillary Clinton won\nmore primaries and delegates than any other female candidate in American\nhistory, but narrowly lost to Illinois Senator Barack Obama.\n\nObama went on to win the election\nand appoint Clinton as Secretary of State; she became the first former First\nLady to serve in a president's cabinet. She was at the forefront of the U.S.\nresponse to the Arab Spring, including advocating the military intervention in\nLibya. Clinton introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review\nprocess to the State Department, seeking to maximize departmental effectiveness\nand promote the empowerment of women worldwide, and used \"smart power\" as the\nstrategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values in the world. She became the\nmost widely traveled Secretary of State during her time in office, and\nchampioned the use of social media in getting the U.S. message out.\n","linknr":3692,"url":"Hillary_Clinton","recorded":1371230029,"links":["//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Clinton&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#semi","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","/wiki/File:Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg/220px-Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg","/wiki/List_of_Secretaries_of_State_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/James_Steinberg","/wiki/William_Joseph_Burns","/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice","/wiki/John_Kerry","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan","/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand","/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Barbara_Bush","/wiki/Laura_Bush","/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Arkansas","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/Illinois","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Chelsea_Clinton","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Wellesley_College","/wiki/Yale_Law_School","/wiki/United_Methodist_Church","/wiki/File:Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_Signature.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_Signature.svg/128px-Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_Signature.svg.png","http://www.hillaryclintonoffice.com/","/wiki/Template:HillaryRodhamClintonSegmentsUnderInfoBox","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:HillaryRodhamClintonSegmentsUnderInfoBox&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:HillaryRodhamClintonSegmentsUnderInfoBox&action=edit","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton%27s_tenure_as_Secretary_of_State","/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2008","/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008","/wiki/Senate_career_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_awards_and_honors","/wiki/List_of_books_about_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Diplomat","/wiki/List_of_Secretaries_of_State_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Barack_Obama","/wiki/United_States_Senator","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States","/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election","/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2008","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2008","/wiki/Illinois","/wiki/Commencement_speech","/wiki/Wellesley_College","/wiki/Juris_Doctor","/wiki/Yale_Law_School","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Arkansas","/wiki/Bill_Clinton","/wiki/Arkansas_Advocates_for_Children_and_Families","/wiki/Legal_Services_Corporation","/wiki/Rose_Law_Firm","/wiki/Board_of_directors","/wiki/Walmart","/wiki/Clinton_health_care_p
