{"cursor":"48740","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Anabaptists' (from Neo-Latin anabaptista, from the Greek : \"over\nagain\" and \"baptism\" ) are Christians of the Radical Reformation of\n16th-century Europe, considered Protestant by some, although some consider\nAnabaptism to be a distinct movement from Protestantism. . The Amish,\nHutterites, and Mennonites are direct descendants of the movement.\n\nThe name Anabaptist is derived from the Greek term anabaptista, or \"one who\nbaptizes over again.\" This name was given them by their enemies in reference to\nthe practice of \"re-baptizing\" converts who \"already had been baptized\" (or\nsprinkled) as infants. . Anabaptists required that baptismal\ncandidates be able to make their own confessions of faith and so rejected\nbaptism of infants. The early members of this movement abhorred the name\n\"Anabaptist\", claiming that since infant baptism was unscriptural and null and\nvoid, the baptizing of believers was not a \"re-baptism\" but in fact the 'first'\nbaptism for them. Balthasar HÃ¼bmaier wrote:\n\n}}\n\nAs a result of their views on the nature of baptism and other issues,\nAnabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th by\nboth Magisterial Protestants and Roman Catholics. Since the middle of the 20th century, the German-speaking world no longer\nuses the term \"WiedertÃ¤ufer\" (translation: \"Re-baptizers\") considering it\nbiased. The term \"TÃ¤ufer\" (translation: \"Baptizers\") is now used, which is\nconsidered more impartial. From the perspective of their persecutors, the\n\"Baptizers\" baptized for the second time those \"who as infants had already been\nbaptized\". Since the denigrative term Anabaptist signifies re-baptizing, it is\nconsidered a polemic term and therefore has been dropped from use in modern\nGerman. However, in the English-speaking world it is still in use in order to\ndistinguish the \"Baptizers\" more clearly from the \"Baptists\" who emerged\nlater.\n\nWhile most Anabaptists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the\nMount which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and\nparticipating in civil government, some who practiced re-baptism felt\ncontrariwise. For example, the Munsterites and\nBalthasar Hubmaier. They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though\nconservative Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites and some historians tend to\nconsider them as outside of true Anabaptism. Conrad Grebel wrote in a letter to\nThomas MÃ¼ntzer in 1524: .
