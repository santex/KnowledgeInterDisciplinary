The region at which radiation becomes considered as \"ionizing\" is not\nwell defined, since different molecules and atoms ionize at different energies.\nThe usual definitions have suggested that radiation with particle or photon\nenergies less than 10 electronvolts (eV) be considered non-ionizing. Another\nsuggested threshold is 33 electronvolts, which is the energy needed to ionize\nwater molecules. The light from the Sun that reaches the earth is largely\ncomposed of non-ionizing radiation, since the ionizing far-ultraviolet rays have\nbeen filtered out by the gases in the atmosphere, particularly oxygen. The\nremaining ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is in the non-ionizing band, and\ncauses molecular damage (for example, sunburn) by photochemical and free-radical-\nproducing means that do not ionize.\n\nDifferent biological effects are observed for different types of non-ionizing\nradiation. {{cite journal |url=http://www.who.int/peh-\nemf/meetings/archive/en/keynote3ng.pdf |format=PDF|title=Non-Ionizing Radiations\nâ Sources, Biological Effects, Emissions and Exposures |journal=Proceedings of\nthe International Conference on Non-Ionizing Radiation at UNITEN ICNIR2003\nElectromagnetic Fields and Our Health |date=20 â 22 October 2003 |author=Kwan-\nHoong Ng}} {{cite web |url=http://www.mcw.edu/gcrc/cop/static-fields-cancer-\nFAQ/toc.html |title=Static Electric and Magnetic Fields and Human Health\n|author=John E. Moulder}} A difficulty is that there is no controversy\nthat the upper frequencies of non-ionizing radiation near these energies (much\nof the spectrum of UV light and some visible light) is capable of non-thermal\nbiological damage, similar to ionizing radiation. Health debate therefore\ncenters on the non-thermal effects of radiation of much lower frequencies\n(microwave and radiowave radiation).\n","linknr":300,"url":"Non-ionizing_radiation","recorded":1362890166,"links":35,"instances":["injury","chemical_process"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/archive/en/keynote3ng.pdf","http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/archive/en/keynote3ng.pdf","http://www.zenobi.ethz.ch/publications/HelvChimActa_1766.pdf"],"categories":["Electromagnetic radiation","Medical physics","Heat transfer"],"headings":["Mechanisms of interaction with matter, including living tissue","Health risks","Types of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/EM-spectrum.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Radio_waves_hazard_symbol.svg/220px-Radio_waves_hazard_symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["browning","chemical_process"],["burn","injury"],["browning","chemical_process"]],"members":["burn","browning"],"related":["Electromagnetic_radiation","Energy","Quantum","Ionize","Electron","Atom","Molecule","Radiation","Electronvolt","Sun","Ultraviolet","UNITEN","Near_ultraviolet","Visible_light","Infrared","Microwave","Radio","Radioactive_decay","Photochemical_reactions","Radical_reaction","Aging","Browning_(chemical_process)","Mutagen","Black_light","Black_light","Photochemical_reaction","Cataract","Visible_light","Sunlight","Fire","List_of_laser_types","Photoaging","Infrared","Thermal_radiation","Incandescent_light_bulb","List_of_laser_types","Infrared","List_of_laser_types","Corneal","Infrared","Far-infrared_laser","Microwave","Wi-Fi","Body_tissue","Radio","Burn_(injury)","Cataract","Free_radical","Carcinogenic","Pyrimidine_dimer","Melanin","Melanocyte","Sun_tanning","Vitamin_D","Polycarbonate","Snow_blindness","Myriameter","Thermal_energy","Black_body","Temperature","Photosphere","Nuclear_weapon","Browning_(chemical_process)","Black_body","Planck's_law","Black_body","Wien's_displacement_law","Ionizing_radiation","Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity","Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health","Electromagnetic_radiation_and_health","Wireless_electronic_devices_and_health","Electronic_harassment"]}
