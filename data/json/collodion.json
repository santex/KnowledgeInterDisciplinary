There are two basic types; flexible and non-flexible. The flexible\ntype is often used as a surgical dressing or to hold dressings in place. When\npainted on the skin, collodion dries to form a flexible nitrocellulose film.\nWhile it is initially colorless, it discolors over time. Non-flexible collodion\nis often used in theatrical make-up.\n\n\nWatch the origins and the process of creating a collodion print via\n[http://www.eastmanhouse.org/ George Eastman House International Museum of\nPhotography and Film].
