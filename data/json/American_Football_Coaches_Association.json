According to its constitution, some of\nthe main goals of the American Football Coaches Association are to \"maintain the\nhighest possible standards in football and the profession of coaching football,\"\nand to \"provide a forum for the discussion and study of all matters pertaining\nto football and coaching.\" The AFCA, along with USA Today, is responsible for\nthe Division I Football Bowl Subdivision Coaches Poll that determines the\nnational champion each year. The AFCA is also responsible for the Top 25 poll\nfor Division II and Division III football.\n\nThe AFCA was founded in a meeting for 43 coaches at the Hotel Astor in New York\nCity on Dec. 27, 1921. It is headquartered in Waco, Texas (the headquarters\nbuilding is located across from Baylor University, formerly coached by AFCA\nexecutive director Grant Teaff).\n\nThe Association has over 10,000 members and represents coaches at all levels\nincluding the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Association\nof Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the National Association of\nIntercollegiate Athletics, the National Junior College Athletic Association, the\nNational Federation of State High School Associations, the National Football\nLeague, the Canadian Football League, USA Football, the National Football\nFoundation, College Football Hall of Fame, and Pop Warner Football. The AFCA is\nconsidered the primary professional association for football coaches at all\nlevels of competition.\n\nAnother primary goal of the American Football Coaches Association is the\npromotion of safety. The Association has established a code of ethics and has\nmade many safety recommendations. An annual injury survey begun by the AFCA in\nthe 1930s has provided valuable data and has led to a remarkable reduction of\ninjuries in the sport down through the years. The NCAA Rules Committee often\nfollows recommendations made by the AFCA.\n","linknr":180,"url":"American_Football_Coaches_Association","recorded":1375070371,"links":["/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Waco,_Texas","/wiki/Grant_Teaff","/wiki/Larry_Kehres","/wiki/Rob_Ash","http://afca.com","/wiki/USA_Today","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/Coaches_Poll","/wiki/Division_II_(NCAA)","/wiki/Division_III_(NCAA)","/wiki/Waco,_Texas","/wiki/Baylor_University","/wiki/Grant_Teaff","/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association","/wiki/National_Association_of_Collegiate_Directors_of_Athletics","/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics","/wiki/National_Junior_College_Athletic_Association","/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Canadian_Football_League","/wiki/USA_Football","/wiki/National_Football_Foundation","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/Pop_Warner_Football","#All-American_Teams","#AFCA_National_Championship_Trophy","#AFCA_Coach_of_the_Year","#Amos_Alonzo_Stagg_Award","#Tuss_McLaughry_Award","#Winners","#Presidents","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team","/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team","/wiki/2009_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_season#All-Americans","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/AFCA_National_Championship_Trophy","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/BCS_National_Championship_Game","/wiki/Coaches_Poll","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/AFCA_Coach_of_the_Year","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg_Award","/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg_Award","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/DeOrmond_%22Tuss%22_McLaughry","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur","/wiki/Bob_Hope","/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson","/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower","/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/Richard_Nixon","/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin","/wiki/Neil_Armstrong","/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)","/wiki/John_Wayne","/wiki/Gerald_Ford","/wiki/James_Van_Fleet","/wiki/James_Stewart","/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle","/wiki/Jerome_H._Holland","/wiki/Robert_Crippen","/wiki/John_Young_(astronaut)","/wiki/Ronald_Reagan","/wiki/Pete_Rozelle","/wiki/Pete_Dawkins","/wiki/Chuck_Yeager","/wiki/Lindsey_Nelson","/wiki/George_P._Shultz","/wiki/Burt_Reynolds","/wiki/Tom_Landry","/wiki/Eddie_Robinson_(Grambling_football_coach)","/wiki/George_H._W._Bush","/wiki/Andrew_Young","/wiki/Roger_Staubach","/wiki/Stephen_Ambrose","/wiki/Tommy_Franks","/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft,_Jr.","/wiki/Paul_Tagliabue","/wiki/Tom_Osborne","/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani","/wiki/Tony_Dungy","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_American_Football_Coaches_Association","/wiki/U.S._Military_Academy","/wiki/John_Heisman","/wiki/Bear_Bryant","/wiki/Darrell_Royal","/wiki/Eddie_Robinson_(Grambling_football_coach)","/wiki/Charles_McClendon","/wiki/Bo_Schembechler","/wiki/Vince_Dooley","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Walter_Camp_Man_of_the_Year","/wiki/Walter_Camp_Distinguished_American_Award","/wiki/Walter_Camp_Alumni_of_the_Year","/wiki/National_Football_Foundation_Distinguished_American_Award","/wiki/National_Football_Foundation_Gold_Medal_Winners","/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_Award_(NCAA)","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&action=edit&section=9","http://www.afca.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Football_Coaches_Association&oldid=525202934","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_football_organisations","/wiki/Category:College_football_coaches_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:College
