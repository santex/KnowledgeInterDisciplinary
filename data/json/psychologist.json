The common terms used to describe this central division\nin psychology are \"scientists\" or \"scholars\" (those who conduct research) and\n\"practitioners\" or \"professionals\" (those who apply psychological knowledge).\nThe training models endorsed by the APA require that applied psychologists be\ntrained as both researchers and practitioners,<ref>See:\nScientist–practitioner model and Practitioner-scholar model</ref> and that\nthey possess advanced degrees.\n\nMost typically, people encounter psychologists and think of the discipline as\ninvolving the work of clinical psychologists or counselling psychologists. While\ncounseling and psychotherapy are common activities for psychologists, these\napplied fields are just one branch in the larger domain of psychology.<ref>[http://everydaypsychology.com/2006/10/what-is-\npsychology.html What is Psychology?] at everydaypsychology.com</ref> Research\nand teaching comprise a major role among psychologists.
