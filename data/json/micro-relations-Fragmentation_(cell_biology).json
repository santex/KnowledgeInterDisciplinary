{"cursor":"11894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn cell biology, 'fragmentation' is the breaking apart of cells or cell\norganelles into smaller parts. There are two major ways in which fragmentation\nis useful for a cell: DNA cloning and apoptosis. DNA cloning is important in\nasexual reproduction or creation of identical DNA molecules, and can be\nperformed spontaneously by the cell or intentionally by laboratory researchers.\nApoptosis is the programmed destruction of cells, and the DNA molecules within\nthem, and is a highly regulated process. These two ways in which fragmentation\nis used in cellular processes describe normal cellular functions and common\nlaboratory procedures performed with cells. However, problems within a cell can\nsometimes cause fragmentation that results in irregularities such as red blood\ncell fragmentation and sperm cell DNA fragmentation.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Fragmentation_(cell_biology)","recorded":1362480614,"links":14,"instances":["molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology"],"headings":["DNA Cloning","Apoptosis","Irregularities","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg/100px-EcoRI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/SmaI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg/95px-SmaI_restriction_enzyme_recognition_site.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Apoptosis.png/220px-Apoptosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Schizocyte_smear_2009-12-22.JPG/220px-Schizocyte_smear_2009-12-22.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","molecular_biology"]],"members":["vector"],"related":["Cell_biology","Cell_organelles","Molecular_cloning","Asexual_reproduction","Reproductive_fragmentation","Recombinant_DNA","Gene","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Restriction_Enzymes","Endonuclease","Restriction_site","Palindromic_sequence","Methyl_group","DNA_ligase","Okazaki_fragments","Phosphodiester_bond","Sticky_and_blunt_ends","Apoptosis","Phagocytosis","DNA_laddering","Gel_electrophoresis","TUNEL_assay","Cell_cycle_analysis","Caspase-activated_DNase","DFFA","Caspase_3","Nucleosome","Schistocyte","Endothelium","Fibrin","Hemolytic_anemia","Iron_deficiency_anemia"]}
