{"cursor":"4981","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n by two of his great grandchildren ]] 'Thomas Burchell' (1799â1846) was a\n leading Baptist missionary and slavery abolitionist in Jamaica in the early\n nineteenth century. It is not uncommon for Jamaican parents to name their\n children 'Burchell'; indeed it is almost as popular a Christian name as Manley.\n\nBurchell, along with James Phillippo (1798â1879), William Knibb and Samuel\nOughton was one of the group of early Baptist missionaries sent from England to\nrespond to requests from pioneer African Baptists who had become free from\nslavery, for support in establishing chapels and education in Jamaica. They were\nrepresentatives of the Baptist Missionary Society of London and followed the\npioneering preaching of the African George Lisle.\n\nBurchell's time as a Baptist missionary in Jamaica spanned twenty-two years,\n1822â46; the most notorious years in the history of slavery abolition in the\ncolony, which included the persecution of Burchell and other Baptists after the\nChristmas Rebellion or Baptist War of 1831. Burchell narrowly escaped death by\nfleeing offshore, but persecuted more seriously, was the Deacon in the Montego\nBaptist Church pastored by Thomas Burchell: Samuel Sharpe. Born in 1801 in\nMontego Bay of African parentage, Sharpe died for the cause of slavery abolition\nat the hands of the 'Planters' and their governing militia, being executed on 23\nMay 1832. Initially buried in the sands of Montego Bay Harbour he was later\nsafely exhumed and given a hero's burial near the pulpit at Burchell Baptist\nchurch. He was made a national hero of Jamaica in 1975 and now appears on the\nJamaican fifty dollar bill.\n\nBaptist chapels as well as their members, suffered at the hands of the\n'Planters'. The Burchell Memorial Church which was established in 1824 by Rev.\nThomas Burchell, could however be rebuilt in 1834 after it was burnt down by an\nangry mob; unlike the loss of life. The Jamaican National Heritage Trust,\nfounded in 1958, now looks after the building at number one King Street and the\ncorner of Market Street, Montego Bay, in the parish of St. James, which was\nformerly the Manse of the Burchell Baptist Church.\n\nStarting in the 1830s, in anticipation of emancipation, the Jamaican Baptist\ncongregations, deacons and ministers pioneered the Caribbean concept of Free\nVillages, which was swiftly copied by other denominations. Many plantation\nowners and others in the landowing class made it clear they would never sell\nland to freed slaves, but provide only tied accommodation at the rents they\nchose. The aim was to prevent free labour choice and movement between employers,\nand keep labour costs low or negligible upon emancipation. To circumvent this,\nBaptist chapels' approached their Baptist financiers in England, who could\ninstruct land agents in London to buy Jamaican land and hold it for\nestablishment of free villages, not controlled by the planters. Sandy Bay was\nfounded as a Baptist Free Village for emancipated slaves on the initiative of\nBurchell, and today its playing field is named Burchell Field. Several others,\nincluding the very first, were founded through Burchell's Baptist associate,\nRev. James Phillippo.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Thomas_Burchell","recorded":1375059318,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Thomas_Burchell_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Thomas_Burchell.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Thomas_Burchell.jpg/220px-Thomas_Burchell.jpg","/wiki/File:Thomas_Burchell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Abney_Park_Cemetery","/wiki/Baptist","/wiki/Abolitionist","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/James_Phillippo","/wiki/William_Knibb","/wiki/Samuel_Oughton","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/Baptist_Missionary_Society","/wiki/George_Lisle_(Baptist)","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/Samuel_Sharpe","/wiki/Montego_Bay","/wiki/Category:Baptist","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/File:Baptism_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Anabaptist","/wiki/Baptist_beliefs","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers","/wiki/Soul_competency","/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state","/wiki/Sola_scriptura","/wiki/Congregationalist_polity","/wiki/Baptist_ordinance","/wiki/Baptist_offices","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_confessions","/wiki/List_of_Baptists","/wiki/John_Smyth_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/Thomas_Helwys","/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)","/wiki/John_Clarke_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/John_Bunyan","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Andrew_Fuller","/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon","/wiki/D._N._Jackson","/wiki/James_Robinson_Graves","/wiki/William_Bullein_Johnson","/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)","/wiki/Luther_Rice","/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_denominations","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_colleges_and_universities","/wiki/Portal:Baptist","/wiki/Template:Baptist","/wiki/Template_talk:Baptist","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baptist&action=edit","/wiki/Angry_mob","/wiki/James_Phillippo","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Abney_Park_Cemetery","/wiki/Stoke_Newington","/wiki/London","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Search/Thomas_Burchell","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&oldid=517085413","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1799_births","/wiki/Category:1846_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_abolitionists","/wiki/Category:English_Baptists","/wiki/Category:English_Baptist_ministers","/wiki/Category:Baptist_missionaries","/wiki/Category:English_Christian_missionaries","/wiki/Category:History_of_Jamaica","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_Abney_Park_Cemetery","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Baptist_clergy","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Burchell&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Thomas+Burchell","/wiki/Thomas_Burchell","/wiki/Talk:Thomas_Burchell","#","/wiki/Thomas_Burchell","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Burchell&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help
