{"cursor":"66545","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is a two-dimensional manifold that cannot be realized in three dimensions\n without self-intersection, shown here as Boy's surface.]] In mathematics, a\n 'manifold' of dimension n is a topological space that near each point resembles\n n-dimensional Euclidean space. More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional\n manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of\n dimension n. Lines and circles, but not figure eights, are one-dimensional\n manifolds. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include\n the plane, the sphere, and the torus, which can all be realized in three\n dimensions, but also the Klein bottle and real projective plane which cannot.\n\n\nAlthough near each point, a manifold resembles Euclidean space, globally a\nmanifold might not. For example, the surface of the sphere is not a Euclidean\nspace, but in a region it can be charted by means of geographic maps: map\nprojections of the region into the Euclidean plane. When a region appears in two\nneighbouring maps (in the context of manifolds they are called\n[[Atlas_(topology)#Charts|charts]]), the two representations do not coincide\nexactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a\ntransition map.\n\nThe concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern\nmathematical physics because it allows more complicated structures to be\ndescribed and understood in terms of the relatively well-understood properties\nof Euclidean space. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of\nequations and as graphs of functions. Manifolds may have additional features.\nOne important class of manifolds is the class of differentiable manifolds. This\ndifferentiable structure allows calculus to be done on manifolds. A Riemannian\nmetric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic\nmanifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical\nmechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in\ngeneral relativity.\n","linknr":782,"url":"Manifold","recorded":1362560162,"links":58,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","paper","geometry","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","soviet_mathematician","geometry","mathematician","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","set_theory","mathematician","differential_geometry","topology"],"pdf":["http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/homology/tophom.pdf"],"categories":["Topology","Differential
