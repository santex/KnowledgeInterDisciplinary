Social groups affected include membership\ngroups, in which individuals are \"formally\" members (such as political parties\nand trade unions), or social cliques in which membership is not clearly defined.\nA person affected by peer pressure may or may not want to belong to these\ngroups. They may also recognize dissociative groups with which they would not\nwish to associate, and thus they behave adversely concerning that group's\nbehaviors.\n\nPeer pressure is most commonly associated with youth, in part because most youth\nspend large amounts of time in schools and other fixed groups that they do not\nchoose and are seen as lacking the maturity to handle pressure from friends.\nAlso, young people are more willing to behave negatively towards those who are\nnot members of their own peer groups.\n\nPeer pressure can also have positive effects when people are pressured toward\npositive behavior, such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics or\nathletics, by their peers. This is most commonly seen in youths who are active\nin sports or other extracurricular activities where conformity with one's peer\ngroup is strongest.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Peer_pressure","recorded":1362480274,"links":38,"instances":["sociology","teacher","ethics","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group processes","Management","Youth","Social psychology"],"headings":["Risk behavior","Asch conformity","The Third Wave","Neural mechanisms","Explanation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Logo_sociology.svg/28px-Logo_sociology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["attitude","psychology"],["value","ethics"],["norm","sociology"],["ron_jones","teacher"]],"members":["norm","ron_jones","value","attitude"],"related":["Peer_group","Attitude_(psychology)","Value_(ethics)","Behavior","Conformity","Norm_(sociology)","Political_party","Trade_union","Clique","Youth","School","Sports","Peer_group","Risk","Adolescent","Alcohol","Tobacco","Drugs","Asch_conformity_experiments","Solomon_Asch","Swarthmore_College","The_Third_Wave","Ron_Jones_(teacher)","Cubberley_High_School","The_Holocaust","Leadership","Meeting","Presentation","Salvador,_Jos√©","Neuroimaging","Insular_cortex","Anterior_cingulate","Identity_shift_effect","Wendy_Treynor","Leon_Festinger","Social_psychology_","Cognitive_dissonance","Social_comparison_theory_","Social_rejection","Collective_narcissism","Groupshift","Groupthink","Milieu_control","Social_norms_marketing","Social_exclusion","Asch_experiment"]}
