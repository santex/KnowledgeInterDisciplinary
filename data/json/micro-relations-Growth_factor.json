{"cursor":"5252","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'growth factor' is a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating\ncellular growth, proliferation and cellular differentiation. Usually\nit is a protein or a steroid hormone. Growth factors are important for\nregulating a variety of cellular processes.\n\nGrowth factors typically act as signaling molecules between cells. Examples are\ncytokines and hormones that bind to specific receptors on the surface of their\ntarget cells.\n\nThey often promote cell differentiation and maturation, which varies between\ngrowth factors. For example, bone morphogenic proteins stimulate bone cell\ndifferentiation, while fibroblast growth factors and vascular endothelial growth\nfactors stimulate blood vessel differentiation (angiogenesis).\n","linknr":483,"url":"Growth_factor","recorded":1362565717,"links":32,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Growth factors|*","Immune system"],"headings":["Growth factors versus cytokines","Classes of growth factors","Uses in medicine","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","tissue","cell"],"related":["Cellular_growth","Cellular_differentiation","Protein","Steroid","Hormone","Cytokine","Hormone","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Cell_(biology)","Bone_morphogenetic_protein","Fibroblast_growth_factor","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Angiogenesis","Hematopoietic","Immune_system","Spleen","Thymus","Lymph_node","Circulatory_system","Bone_marrow","Tissue_(biology)","Molecule","Immune_system","G-CSF","GM-CSF","Fas_ligand","Cell_death","Evolution","Adrenomedullin","Angiopoietin","Autocrine_motility_factor","Bone_morphogenetic_protein","Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor","Epidermal_growth_factor","Erythropoietin","Fibroblast_growth_factor","Glial_cell_line-derived_neurotrophic_factor","Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor","Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor","Growth_differentiation_factor-9","Hepatocyte_growth_factor","Hepatoma-derived_growth_factor","Insulin-like_growth_factor","Myostatin","Nerve_growth_factor","Neurotrophins","Platelet-derived_growth_factor","Thrombopoietin","Transforming_growth_factor_alpha","Transforming_growth_factor_beta","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor","Wnt_Signaling_Pathway","Placental_growth_factor","Hematology","Oncology","Neutropenia","Myelodysplastic_syndrome","Leukemia","Aplastic_anaemia","Bone_marrow","Angiogenesis","Signal_transduction","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Cytokine","Angiogenesis","Human_Genome_Organisation","Growth_factor_receptor","Mitogen"]}
