{"cursor":"40566","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Crt_television.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Television' ('TV') is a telecommunication medium for transmitting and receiving\nmoving images that can be monochrome (black-and-white) or colored, with or\nwithout accompanying sound. \"Television\" may also refer specifically to a\ntelevision set, television programming, or television transmission.\n\nThe etymology of the word has a mixed Latin and Greek origin, meaning \"far\nsight\": Greek tele (}}), far, and Latin visio, sight (from video, vis- to see,\nor to view in the first person).\n\nCommercially available since the late 1920s, the television set has become\ncommonplace in homes, businesses and institutions, particularly as a vehicle for\nadvertising, a source of entertainment, and news. Since the 1950s, television\nhas been the main medium for molding public opinion. Since the 1970s the availability of video cassettes, laserdiscs,\nDVDs and now Blu-ray Discs, have resulted in the television set frequently being\nused for viewing recorded as well as broadcast material. In recent years,\nInternet television has seen the rise of television available via the Internet,\ne.g. iPlayer and Hulu.\n\nAlthough other forms such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) are in use, the\nmost common usage of the medium is for broadcast television, which was modeled\non the existing radio broadcasting systems developed in the 1920s, and uses high-\npowered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the television signal to\nindividual TV receivers.\n\nThe broadcast television system is typically disseminated via radio\ntransmissions on designated channels in the 54â890 MHz frequency\nband. [http://www.csgnetwork.com/tvfreqtable.html Television Frequency\nTable], CSGNetwork.com., a Division of Computer Support Group. Signals are\nnow often transmitted with stereo or surround sound in many countries. Until the\n2000s broadcast TV programs were generally transmitted as an analog television\nsignal, but during the decade several countries went almost exclusively digital.\n\nA standard television set comprises multiple internal electronic circuits,\nincluding those for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display\ndevice which lacks a tuner is properly called a video monitor, rather than a\ntelevision. A television system may use different technical standards such as\ndigital television (DTV) and high-definition television (HDTV). Television\nsystems are also used for surveillance, industrial process control, and guiding\nof weapons, in places where direct observation is difficult or dangerous. Some\nstudies have found a link between infancy exposure to television and\nADHD.
