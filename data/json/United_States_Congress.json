Congress\nhas a total of 535 voting members: 435 members in the House of Representatives\nand 100 members in the Senate. Members of the House of Representatives serve two-\nyear terms representing the people of a district. Congressional districts are\napportioned to states by population using the United States Census results, each\nstate in the union having at least one representative in the House of\nRepresentatives. Regardless of population, each of the 50 states has two\nsenators; the 100 senators each serve a six-year term. The terms are staggered\nso every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.\nEach staggered group of one-third of the senators are called 'classes'. No state\nof the United States has two senators from the same class. Most incumbents seek\nre-election, and their historical likelihood of winning subsequent elections\nexceeds 90 percent. In August 2012, a Gallup poll reported\nthat Congressâs approval rating amongst Americans was at 10%, matching a 38-year\nlow reached in November 2011.
