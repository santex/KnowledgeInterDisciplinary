{"cursor":"4120","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Spectral evidence' is a form of evidence based upon dreams and visions. It was\nadmitted in court during the Salem witch trials by the appointed chief justice,\nWilliam Stoughton. The booklet A Tryal of Witches taken from a contemporary\nreport of the proceedings of the Bury St. Edmunds witch trial of 1662 became a\nmodel for, and was referenced in the Trials when the magistrates were looking\nfor proof that such evidence could be used in a court of\nlaw. {{cite web\n  | last = Bunn first = Ivan title = The Lowestoft Witches\n  | url=http://www.lowestoftwitches.com/ accessdate = 2007-12-29 }}\n\nSpectral evidence was testimony that the accused witch's spirit (i.e. spectre)\nappeared to the witness in a dream or vision (for example, a black cat or wolf).\nThe dream or vision was admitted as evidence. Thus, witnesses (who were often\nthe accusers) would testify that \"Goody Proctor bit, pinched, and almost choked\nme,\" and it would be taken as evidence that the accused were responsible for the\nbiting, pinching and choking even though they were elsewhere at the time.\n\nThomas Brattle, a merchant of Salem, made note that \"when the afflicted do mean\nand intend only the appearance and shape of such an one, say G. Proctor, yet\nthey positively swear that G. Proctor did afflict them; and they were allowed to\ndo so; as though there was no real difference between G. Proctor and the shape\nof G. Proctor.\" [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-\n9831(196211)34%3A3%3C344%3ASODSEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4 Shadow of Doubt; Specter\nEvidence in Hawthorn's \"In Young Goodman Brown\", by David Levin, Standford\nUniversity (@JSTOR)]\n\nRev. Cotton Mather argued that it was appropriate to admit spectral evidence\ninto legal proceedings, but cautioned that convictions should not be based on\nspectral evidence alone as it was possible for the Devil to take the shape of an\ninnocent person. Robert Calef published More Wonders of the Invisible World to\ncriticize Mather for this position. Calef also made libelous statements about\nCotton and Increase Mather, suggesting that they sexually molested young girls.\nUpon reading the book, Increase Mather publicly burned the book in Harvard Yard.\n\n\nRev. Increase Mather became an opponent of spectral evidence - though not until\nafter the Salem hangings had taken place, and not on the basis that it was false\ntestimony by witnesses, but that it might be a deception by demons. He published\nCases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits Personating Men, Witchcrafts, infallible Proofs of Guilt in such as are accused with that\nCrime., [http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/mather.h-\ntml Cases of Conscience concerning evil SPIRITS, by Increase Mather] in\nwhich he argued that \"It were better that ten suspected witches should escape,\nthan that one innocent person should be condemned\".\n","linknr":107,"url":"Spectral_evidence","recorded":1374862273,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Vision_(religion)","/wiki/Salem_witch_trials","/wiki/William_Stoughton_(Massachusetts)","/wiki/Bury_St._Edmunds_witch_trial","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Goodwife","/wiki/Danvers,_Massachusetts","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Cotton_Mather","/wiki/Robert_Calef","/wiki/Harvard_Yard","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Increase_Mather","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Apparitional_experience","/wiki/Greenbrier_Ghost","/wiki/Booty_v_Barnaby","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-415-17109-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-7425-4697-7","#cite_ref-3","http://www.lowestoftwitches.com/","#cite_ref-4","http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9831(196211)34%3A3%3C344%3ASODSEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/mather.html","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit&section=3","http://www.salemwitchtrials.com/faqs.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&oldid=546477145","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Evidence_law","/wiki/Category:Salem_witch_trials","/wiki/Category:Witchcraft","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Spectral+evidence&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Spectral+evidence","/wiki/Spectral_evidence","/wiki/Talk:Spectral_evidence","#","/wiki/Spectral_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Spectral_evidence","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Spectral_evidence","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&oldid=546477145","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7575189","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Spectral_evidence&id=546477145","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Spectral+evidence","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Spectral+evidence&oldid=546477145&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Spectral_evidence&printable=yes","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spektrale_bevis","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7575189#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_evidence","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["religion","massachusetts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evidence
