Although Marx did not\nhimself invent the term, he developed the concept. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\nalready used the idea in a critical sense.[http://anarchism.pageabode.com/pjproudhon/proudhon-and-marx-on-\nexploitation]. It refers roughly to the new value created by workers that\nis in excess of their own labour-cost and which is therefore available to be\nappropriated by the capitalist, according to Marx; it allows then for profit and\nin so doing is the basis of capital accumulation. Marx, The Capital, Chapter\n8[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch08.htm] \"...It was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work\nfor his own subsistenceâthat is, to live, only insofar as he works for a certain\ntime gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter's co-consumers of\nsurplus value)...\" Karl Marx,\n[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm Critique of the\nGotha Programme. Sec.II]\n\n\n\nFor Marx, the gigantic increase in wealth and population from the 19th century\nonwards was mainly due to the competitive striving to obtain maximum surplus-\nvalue from the employment of labor, resulting in an equally gigantic increase of\nproductivity and capital resources. To the extent that increasingly the economic\nsurplus is convertible into money and expressed in money, the amassment of\nwealth is possible on a larger and larger scale (see capital accumulation and\nsurplus product).\n","linknr":581,"url":"Surplus_value","recorded":1362684308,"links":47,"instances":["sociology","economics","economist","property_law","polity","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Value
