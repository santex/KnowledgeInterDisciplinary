{"cursor":"130501","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Ai}}\n\n 'Artificial Intelligence' ('AI') is the intelligence of\nmachines and robots and the branch of computer science that aims to create\nit. AI textbooks define the field as \"the study and design of intelligent\nagents\" where an intelligent agent is a system\nthat perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances\nof success. John McCarthy, who coined the\nterm in 1955, defines it as \"the science\nand engineering of making intelligent machines.\"\n\n AI\nresearch is highly technical and specialised, deeply divided into subfields that\noften fail to communicate with each other. Some\nof the division is due to social and cultural factors: subfields have grown up\naround particular institutions and the work of individual researchers. AI\nresearch is also divided by several technical issues. There are subfields which\nare focused on the solution of specific problems, on one of several possible\napproaches, on the use of widely differing tools and towards the accomplishment\nof particular applications.\n\nThe central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge,\nplanning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and\nmanipulate objects. General intelligence (or\n\"strong AI\") is still among the field's long term goals. Currently popular approaches include statistical methods,\ncomputational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There are an\nenormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and\nmathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and\neconomics, and many others.\n\n The field was\nfounded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence â the\nsapience of [[Homo sapiens]] â can be so precisely described that it can be\nsimulated by a machine. See the Dartmouth proposal, under Philosophy,\nbelow. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and\nthe ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by\nmyth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.\nArtificial intelligence has been the subject of tremendous optimism The\noptimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers (see\noptimism in the history of AI) as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists\nsuch as Ray Kurzweil. but has also suffered stunning setbacks, The\n\"setbacks.\" referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966, the abandonment of\nperceptrons in 1970, the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp\nmachine market in 1987. Today it has become an essential part of the\ntechnology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult\nproblems in computer science.\n","linknr":3084,"url":"Artificial_Intelligence","recorded":1362567623,"links":175,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","artificial_intelligence","video_games","programming_language","computer_science","mythology","book","computer_science","mathematical_logic","computer_program","science_historian","algorithm","artificial_intelligence","computing","economics","computer_scientist","mythology","software","psychology","star_trek","asimov","artificial_intelligence_software","optimization","novelist","researcher","1982_tv_series","logic","mathematics","cognitive_architecture","robot"],"pdf":["http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf","http://world.std.com/~rjs/indinf56.pdf","http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080528135730/http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf","http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de//~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080528135730/http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.8384&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/documents/albus/4DRCS.pdf","http://www.csjournals.com/IJITKM/PDF%204-1/35.Sandeep%20Rajani.pdf","http://www.csjournals.com/IJITKM/PDF%204-1/35.Sandeep%20Rajani.pdf","http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070809020912/http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf","http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf","http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/assets/PDF/AIMag26-04-016.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070926023314/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/assets/PDF/AIMag26-04-016.pdf","http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/assets/PDF/AIMag26-04-016.pdf","http://www.spirituality.org.za/files/D%20Forster%20doctorate.pdf","http://www.spirituality.org.za/files/D%20Forster%20doctorate.pdf","http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/OnlinePubs-Nils/General%20Essays/AIMag04-04-002.pdf","http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/OnlinePubs-Nils/General%20Essays/AIMag04-04-002.pdf","http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_Detlor_AI_and_Society.pdf","http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_Detlor_AI_and_Society.pdf","http://www.aserenko.com/papers/AI_Society_Serenko_Social_Impacts_of_Agents.pdf","http://www.aserenko.com/papers/AI_Society_Serenko_Social_Impacts_of_Agents.pdf","http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf","http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf","http://www.patternrecognition.co.za/publications/cvdwalt_data_characteristics_classifiers.pdf","http://www.patternrecognition.co.za/publications/cvdwalt_data_characteristics_classifiers.pdf","http://www.techcast.org/Upload/PDFs/634146249446122137_Consciousness-Sagifinalversion.pdf","http://foba.lakeheadu.ca/serenko/papers/JOI_Serenko_AI_Journal_Ranking_Published.pdf","http://foba.lakeheadu.ca/serenko/papers/JOI_Serenko_AI_Journal_Ranking_Published.pdf"],"categories":["Artificial
