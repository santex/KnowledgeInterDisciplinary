Founded in\n1949, UNSW is recognised as one of Australiaâs leading teaching and research\ninstitutions, and has developed a strong reputation in a number of\nfields. About University of New South Wales,\n[http://www.universitas21.com/Member/membernewsouthwales.html Universitas 21],\nRetrieved on 2006-10-20 The university is a member of the \"Group of Eight\"\ncoalition of leading Australian universities and is also a founding member of\nUniversitas 21, an international network of leading research-intensive\nuniversities.\n\nUNSW consistently ranks amongst the top of Australian universities. As one of\nthe most prestigious and selective universities in Australia, http://www.uac.edu.au/documents/atar/2012-main-\ncutoffs.pdf graduates from the university are held in high regard by\nemployers and receive some of the highest starting salaries in comparison to\nother universities in Australia. Unsurprisingly, UNSW graduates hold more chief\nexecutive positions of ASX 200 listed companies than any other university in Australia. http://www.leadingcompany.com.au/managing-me/what-our-corporate-\nleaders-studied-at-university/201210152769?displaypage=start\n\nAustralian Government survey data of university graduates has indicated in the\npast that students who enter the Group of Eight come from higher income\nfamilies, and that graduates largely have higher paid occupations or positions\nof influence, prompting claims of elitism and social division.
