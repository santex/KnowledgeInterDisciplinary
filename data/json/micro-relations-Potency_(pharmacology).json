{"cursor":"2569","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the field of pharmacology, 'potency' is a measure of drug activity expressed\nin terms of the amount required to produce an effect of given intensity. A\nhighly potent drug (e.g., morphine, alprazolam, chlorpromazine) evokes a larger\nresponse at low concentrations, while a drug of lower potency (ibuprofen,\nacetylsalicylic acid) evokes a small response at low concentrations. It is\nproportional to affinity and efficacy.\n\nAffinity is the ability of the drug to bind to a receptor. Efficacy is the\nrelationship between receptor occupancy and the ability to initiate a response\nat the molecular, cellular, tissue or system level. The response is equal to the\neffect, or ('E'), and depends on both the drug binding and the drug-bound\nreceptor then producing a response; thus, potency depends on both affinity and\nefficacy. The agonist, the ligand, drug or hormone that binds to the receptor\nand initiates the response is usually abbreviated 'A' or 'D'. Below a certain\nconcentration of agonist ('[A]'), 'E' is too low to measure but at higher\nconcentrations it becomes appreciable and rises with increasing agonist\nconcentration '[A]' until at sufficiently high concentrations it can no longer\nbe increased by raising '[A]' and asymptotes to a maximum 'E max '.\n\nThe 'E max ' is the maximum possible effect for the agonist. The\nconcentration of 'A' at which 'E' is 50% of 'E max ' is termed the half\nmaximal effective concentration and is abbreviated' [A] 50 ', or more\ncommonly EC 50 . The term \"potency\" refers to the '[A] 50 '\nvalue. The lower the '[A] 50 ', the less the concentration of a drug is\nrequired to produce 50% of maximum effect and the higher the potency.\n\nHigher potency does not necessarily mean more side effects.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Potency_(pharmacology)","recorded":1362510327,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Potency_pharmacology.svg/320px-Potency_pharmacology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/40px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pharmacology","Morphine","Alprazolam","Chlorpromazine","Ibuprofen","Acetylsalicylic_acid","Intrinsic_activity","Intrinsic_activity","Half_maximal_effective_concentration","Adverse_drug_reaction"]}
