{"cursor":"5415","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'high king' is a king who holds a position of seniority over a group of other\nkings, without the title of Emperor; compare Great King and King of Kings. A\nhigh king is a king superior to other kings\n\nRulers who have been termed \"high king\" (by their contemporaries or by modern\nobservers) include: *Various ancient Irish and British rulers, notably the High\nKing (Ard [[RÃ­]]) of Ireland. Some other monarchs, such as King Arthur, Uther\nPendragon, and Vortigern, have been termed \"High King of Britain\" in some\naccounts. *The ruler of the Picts. *Some ancient Greek rulers, such as Agamemnon\n(see anax). *The most powerful king of the various Etruscan city-states. *Mepe-\nUmaglesi \"Most High King\" was a predicate of the Georgian Orthodox Mepe-Mepeta\n(\"King of Kings\") *In Lithuania, the title of \"Didysis KunigaikÅ¡tis\" is more\naccurately translated as \"high king\", although it is traditionally rendered as\n\"Grand Duke\" *In ancient Sumer, the rulers of all Sumer held the title of \"Nam-\nLugal\" (High King).

London: Cassell & Co.\n2001, p. 80.\n\nThe Bretwalda was essentially the high king of the Anglo-Saxons, though the name\nis rarely translated as such.\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong (literally Supreme Lord) in Malaysia could probably be\nseen as a \"high king\", as he is elected from among nine Malay rulers of the\nstates (seven Sultans, a Raja, and a Yang di-Pertuan Besar-literally Great Lord)\nby the Conference of Rulers (through informal agreement, on a rotational basis).\nIn practice, however, the term \"high king\" is rarely applied to the Yang di-\nPertuan Agong, rather \"King\".\n\nThe \"maharaja\" (Indian) could possibly be rendered as \"high king\", although the\nliteral meaning is closer to \"great king\".\n\n\"Taewang,\" meaning \"greatest of kings,\" was used by the later rulers of the\nKorean kingdom of Koguryo (and Silla, albeit to a rarer extent) to rank\nthemselves as equals to the Chinese Emperors or to express suzerainty over\nsurrounding states, particularly during the Three Kingdoms Era. \"Daewang\"\n(\"great king\") was used by rulers of other kingdoms and subsequent dynasties,\nincluding Baekje, whose king assumed the style of \"Daewang Pyeha\" (\"His Imperial\nHighness the Great King\") by the reign of Kimg Mu (600-640 AD) at the latest.\nHowever, after the Mongol Invasions of Korea, these rulers remained technically\nsubordinate to the Mongol Empire and later China until King Gojong declared the\nKorean Empire in 1897 and assumed the title of \"Hwangje,\" or Emperor (the Korean\nrendition of the Chinese \"huang di\").\n\nThe title \"King of Kings\" also expresses much the same concept as \"high\nking\" – it was used at various times by the Emperor of Persia\n([[shahanshah]]) and the Emperor of Ethiopia.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"High_king","recorded":1372152242,"links":[],"instances":["country","world","ancient","greek"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heads of state","Royal titles","Noble titles","Titles of national or ethnic leadership"],"headings":["Other uses","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["britons","ancient"],["anax","greek"],["georgia","country"],["narnia","world"],["elf","middle-earth"],["arda","middle-earth"]],"members":["arda","georgia","narnia","elf","britons","anax"],"related":["Monarch","Seniority","Emperor","Great_King","King_of_Kings","Irish_People","Britons_(ancient)","High_King_of_Ireland","Ireland","King_Arthur","Uther_Pendragon","Vortigern","High_King_of_Britain","Picts","Ancient_Greece","Agamemnon","Anax_(Greek)","Etruscan_civilization","Georgia_(country)","Mepe-Mepeta","Sumer","Sumerian_King_List","Bretwalda","Anglo-Saxons","Yang_di-Pertuan_Agong","Malaysia","Sultan","Raja","Yang_di-Pertuan_Besar","Conference_of_Rulers","Maharaja","India","Taewang","Korea","Koguryo","Silla","Emperor_of_China","Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea","Baekje","Mu_of_Baekje","Mongol_Invasions_of_Korea","Mongol_Empire","Gojong_of_the_Korean_Empire","Korean_Empire","Chinese_language","King_of_Kings","Persian_Empire","Emperor_of_Ethiopia","Ai_Takahashi","Reina_Tanaka","Saki_Shimizu","Maimi_Yajima","Yuuka_Maeda","C._S._Lewis","The_Chronicles_of_Narnia","Peter_Pevensie","Narnia_(world)","Edmund_Pevensie","Susan_Pevensie","Lucy_Pevensie","Aslan","J._R._R._Tolkien","Noldor","Middle-earth","Fëanor","Gil-galad","Ingwë","Vanyar","Elf_(Middle-earth)","Manwë","Arda_(Middle-earth)","Thingol","Arnor","Aragorn","Lloyd_Alexander","Wales","Bethesda_Softworks","Capo_di_tutti_capi","Emperor","Paramount_chief","Primus_inter_pares"]}
