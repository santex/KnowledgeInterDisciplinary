For the class of drugs, see [[alkylating\n:antineoplastic agent]].\n'Alkylation' is the transfer of an alkyl group from one molecule to another. The\nalkyl group may be transferred as an alkyl carbocation, a free radical, a\ncarbanion or a carbene (or their equivalents). March Jerry; (1985). Advanced\nOrganic Chemistry reactions, mechanisms and structure (3rd ed.). New York: John\nWiley & Sons, inc. ISBN 0-471-85472-7 Alkylating agents are widely used in\nchemistry because the alkyl group is probably the most common group encountered\nin organic molecules. Many biological target molecules or their synthetic\nprecursors are composed of an alkyl chain with specific functional groups in a\nspecific order. Selective alkylation, or adding parts to the chain with the\ndesired functional groups, is used, especially if there is no commonly available\nbiological precursor. Alkylation with only one carbon is termed methylation.\n\nIn oil refining contexts, 'alkylation' refers to a particular alkylation of\nisobutane with olefins. It is a major aspect of the upgrading of\npetroleum. {{cite book | title = Chemical Processing Handbook\n| editor=John J.
