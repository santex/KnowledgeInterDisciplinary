      "text" : ", the nucleosome, the 10nm \"beads-on-a-string\" fibre, the 30nm fibre and the\nmetaphase chromosome.]] 'Chromatin' is the combination of DNA and proteins that\nmake up the contents of the nucleus of a cell. The primary functions of\nchromatin are 1) to package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell, 2) to\nstrengthen the DNA to allow mitosis, 3) to prevent DNA damage, and 4) to control\ngene expression and DNA replication. The primary protein components of chromatin\nare histones that compact the DNA. Chromatin is only found in eukaryotic cells:\nprokaryotic cells have a very different organization of their DNA which is\nreferred to as a genophore (a chromosome without chromatin).\n\nThe structure of chromatin depends on several factors. The overall structure\ndepends on the stage of the cell cycle: during interphase the chromatin is\nstructurally loose to allow access to RNA and DNA polymerases that transcribe\nand replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase\ndepends on the genes present on the DNA: DNA coding genes that are actively\ntranscribed (\"turned on\") are more loosely packaged and are found associated\nwith RNA polymerases (referred to as euchromatin) while DNA coding inactive\ngenes (\"turned off\") are found associated with structural proteins and are more\ntightly packaged (heterochromatin).<ref></ref><ref> {{cite journal |author=Dame,\nR.T. |title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and\ncompaction of bacterial chromatin |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=56\n|issue=4 |pages=858–70 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15853876 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-\n2958.2005.04598.x}} </ref> Epigenetic chemical modification of the structural\nproteins in chromatin also alter the local chromatin structure, in particular\nchemical modifications of histone proteins by methylation and acetylation. As\nthe cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters mitosis or meiosis, the chromatin\npackages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the chromosomes during\nanaphase. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual\nchromosomes in many cells visible by optical microscope.\n\nIn general terms, there are three levels of chromatin organization:\n# DNA wraps around histone proteins forming nucleosomes; the \"beads on a string\"\n# structure (euchromatin). Multiple histones wrap into a 30 nm fibre consisting\n# of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form (heterochromatin). Higher-\n# level DNA packaging of the 30&nbsp;nm fibre into the metaphase chromosome\n# (during mitosis and meiosis).\nThere are, however, many cells which do not follow this organisation. For\nexample, spermatozoa and avian red blood cells have more tightly packed\nchromatin than most eukaryotic cells, and trypanosomatid protozoa do not\ncondense their chromatin into visible chromosomes for mitosis.\n",
