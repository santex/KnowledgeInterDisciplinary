Verificationism was inextricably tied with the covering law model of\nscientific explanation. As variants of analytic philosophy, See, e.g.,\n: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle \"Vienna Circle\"] in Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy verificationism dominated AngloAmerican\nphilosophy from the 1930s into the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 1920s, appalled both by the racism, bigotry, and nationalism\nflaring in Western societyâas in the negative eugenics movement and World War\nIâand by the countermovement toward metaphysics, mysticism, and intuition, a\ngroup of scientists and philosophers were inspired by developments in\nmathematics, logic, linguistics, and physics, especially relativity theory, and\nsought to offer the world a transparent, meaningful, universal language. Hans\nReichenbach led the Berlin Circle, while Moritz Schlick led the Vienna Circle,\ngathered around the University of Vienna and the CafÃ© Central. A 1929 pamphlet\nwritten by Otto Neurath, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap summarized the Vienna\nCircle's positions.\n\nIn the positivistic tradition promulgated in the 1830s by Auguste Comte, all\nepistemicâthat is, all knowledge, which is justified beliefâwas scientific, and\nall sciences would be unified by a common content and method. Yet logical\npositivists was mostly influenced by Ernst Mach's phenomenalismâwhich accorded\nthe mind virtually no power to attain knowledge beyond that delivered by direct\nsensory experienceâand by the putative operationalism of Percy Bridgman, as well\nas by an interpretation of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language. The\nverifiability principle demarcated the scientific as the verifiable and thus\nmeaningful, whereas the unverifiable was unscientific and\nmeaninglessâmetaphysic, emotive, or suchânot candidate to further review by\nphilosophers, tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.\n\nLogical positivism became famed for vigorous scientific antirealismârestricting\nscience to observable aspects of natureâalthough that motivation and aspect has\nbeen exaggerated. Still, scientific theory's content would be direct\nobservations, and its form would be mathematics modeling only patterns of\nsensory experience. Talk of unobservable aspects of nature, including causality,\nmechanism, and principles, was at best metaphoricalâtalk of observables in the\nabstractâor at worst emotional or metaphysical. By rational reconstruction,\nstatements and concepts expressed in ordinary language would be replaced with\nmore precise, standardized equivalents, and translated into a logical syntax\nreducible to symbolic logic. A scientific theory would be stated with its own\nmethod of verification, whereby a calculus in mathematical logic could be\noperated to verify the theory's falsity or truth.\n\nIn the late 1930s, members of the Vienna Circle fled Austria while A J Ayer\nimported verificationism to the English-speaking audience. With the close of\nWorld War II in 1945, logical positivism became milder, logical empiricism, led\nlargely by Carl Hempel, a member of the Vienna Circle who had migrated to\nAmerica. Ultimately, verificationism failed to resolve central problems, and after the\nSecond World War, its doctrines increasingly came under attack by thinkers such\nas Nelson Goodman, Willard Van Orman Quine, Norwood Hanson, Karl Popper, Thomas\nKuhn, J. L. Austin, Peter Strawson, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty.\n","linknr":1298,"url":"Logical_positivism","recorded":1362477036,"links":57,"instances":["mathematician","logic","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytic philosophy","Philosophical movements","Theories of language","Epistemological theories","Philosophy of science","Logical positivism|","Positivism","Empiricism","Philosophical schools and traditions","Linguistic turn","Meaning in religious language","Epistemology of science"],"headings":["Summary","Themes","History","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["berlin_circle","philosophy"],["hans_hahn","mathematician"],["tautology","logic"],["tautology","logic"],["tautology","logic"],["hans_hahn","mathematician"],["berlin_circle","philosophy"],["tautology","logic"],["hans_hahn","mathematician"]],"members":["hans_hahn","tautology","berlin_circle"],"related":["Epistemology","Empiricism","Mathematical_logic","Linguistics","Covering_law_model","Analytic_philosophy","Eugenics","World_War_I","Relativity_theory","Hans_Reichenbach","Berlin_Circle_(philosophy)","Moritz_Schlick","Vienna_Circle","University_of_Vienna","Café_Central","Otto_Neurath","Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)","Rudolf_Carnap","Positivism","Auguste_Comte","Epistemic","Ernst_Mach","Phenomenalism","Operationalism","Percy_Bridgman","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Philosophy_of_language","Verifiability_principle","Rational_reconstruction","Natural_language","Logical_syntax","Symbolic_logic","Mathematical_logic","Deductive_inference","Truth-value","A_J_Ayer","World_War_II","Carl_Gustav_Hempel","Nelson_Goodman","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","Norwood_Russell_Hanson","Karl_Raimund_Popper","Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn","J._L._Austin","Peter_Strawson","Hilary_Putnam","Richard_Rorty","Bertrand_Russell","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Vienna_Circle","Berlin_Circle","Rudolf_Carnap","Hans_Reichenbach","Vienna_Circle","Tautology_(logic)","Karl_Popper","Adolf_Hitler","Nazism","Germany","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Rudolf_Carnap","Karl_Popper","Verification_principle","Analytic_proposition","Metaphysics","Ontology","Theology","Metaphysics","Materialism","Metaphysical_naturalism","Empiricism","Verificationism","Cognitive_meaningfulness","Truth_value","A._J._Ayer","Tautology_(logic)","Hypothesis","General_relativity","Unified_Science","Special_science","Positivism","Ernst_Mach","Gottlob_Frege","Bertrand_Russell","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Metaphysics","Reductionism","Phenomenalism","Correspondence_theory_of_truth","Otto_Neurath","Coherence_theory_of_truth","Verificationism","Tautology_(logic)","Probability","Bertrand_Russell","Alfred_North_Whitehead","Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)","Rudolf_Carnap","Logicism","Type_theory","Immanuel_Kant","Protocol_sentence","Positivism","Hegelian_metaphysics","F_H_Bradley","Vienna_Circle","Moritz_Schlick","Berlin_Circle_(philosophy)","Hans_Reichenbach","A._J._Ayer","Analytic_philosophy","Philosophy_of_language","Philosophy_of_science","World_War_I","Cold_War","Verifiability_theory_of_meaning","Tautology_(logic)","Universal_quantifier","Karl_Popper","Falsifiability","The_problem_of_induction","Meaningless_statement","Atom","Inductive_reasoning","Hilary_Putnam","Hans_Reichenbach","Rudolf_Carnap","Received_view_of_theories","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","Thomas_Kuhn","Neurath's_boat","Nelson_Goodman","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","J._L._Austin","Peter_Strawson","John_Passmore","A._J._Ayer","Analytic_philosophy","Constructive_empiricism","Positivism","Postpositivism","Analytic_philosophy","Australian_realism","Positivism","Scientific_realism","Sociological_positivism","Raven_paradox","Alfred_Jules_Ayer","Gustav_Bergmann","Rudolf_Carnap","Herbert_Feigl","Philipp_Frank","Kurt_Grelling","Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)","Carl_Gustav_Hempel","Ernest_Nagel","Otto_Neurath","Hans_Reichenbach","David_rynin","Moritz_Schlick","Friedrich_Waismann","R._B._Braithwaite","Peter_Achinstein","Stephen_Francis_Barker","Stephen_Toulmin","The_Burkiss_Way"]}
