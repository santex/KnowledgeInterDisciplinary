{"cursor":"5271","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'host station' is a category of railway station on Melbourne's suburban rail\nnetwork which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. [http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/using-public-\ntransport/symbol-meanings-glossary/ Metlink Melbourne - Symbol Meanings &\nGlossary] In terms of station standards, a host station is a middle\nstandard station which sits between the low standard unmanned stations and the\nhigh standard premium stations.\n\nHost stations have the following facilities available during morning peak times\n(typically 6 am - 10 am Monday to Friday):\n* Open male and female toilets\n* Typically two station hosts (customer service staff who assist passengers with\n  queries and ticketing) and/or\n* An open, staffed customer service centre (booking office), in most cases\n  providing the same services as those of premium stations during hours where\n  staff are available.\n\nThe Host Station program was introduced by the Victorian Department of Transport\nin the early 2000s to ensure that over 80 per cent of suburban rail passengers\nstarted their journey from a staffed (host or premium) station. Like most other Melbourne railway stations, host stations\ncontain ticketing facilities, Passenger Information Displays, CCTV video\nsurvalience cameras and passenger information display boards (displaying\ntimetables, maps, network performance, disruption notices, etc.) which are\navailable from the first train of the day to the last.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Host_station","recorded":1375077430,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Railway_station","/wiki/Melbourne","/wiki/Railways_in_Melbourne","/wiki/Metro_Trains_Melbourne","#cite_note-glossary-1","/wiki/Premium_station","/wiki/Rush_hour","#cite_note-glossary-1","/wiki/Premium_station","/wiki/Government_of_Victoria_(Australia)","#cite_note-glossary-1","#cite_note-mtm-2","#Current_host_stations","#Stations_to_remain_as_host_stations","#Stations_to_be_upgraded_to_premium_stations","#Future_host_stations","#References","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-mtm-2","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Albion_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Armadale_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Ascot_Vale_railway_station","/wiki/Auburn_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Fairfield_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Glenhuntly_railway_station","/wiki/Heatherdale_railway_station","/wiki/Huntingdale_railway_station","/wiki/Jolimont_railway_station","/wiki/Malvern_railway_station","/wiki/Middle_Brighton_railway_station","/wiki/Moonee_Ponds_railway_station","/wiki/Murrumbeena_railway_station","/wiki/Ripponlea_railway_station","/wiki/Tooronga_railway_station","/wiki/Yarraville_railway_station","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Balaclava_railway_station","/wiki/Carnegie_railway_station","/wiki/Holmesglen_railway_station","/wiki/Hoppers_Crossing_railway_station","/wiki/Newmarket_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/North_Brighton_railway_station","/wiki/Ormond_railway_station","/wiki/Prahran_railway_station","/wiki/Syndal_railway_station","/wiki/Windsor_railway_station,_Melbourne","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Burwood_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Canterbury_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Gardiner_railway_station","/wiki/Glenbervie_railway_station","/wiki/Hawksburn_railway_station","/wiki/Hawthorn_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Hughesdale_railway_station","/wiki/Kensington_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Merlynston_railway_station","/wiki/McKinnon_railway_station","/wiki/Oak_Park_railway_station","/wiki/Pascoe_Vale_railway_station","/wiki/Regent_railway_station","/wiki/Rosanna_railway_station","/wiki/Royal_Park_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Sandown_Park_railway_station,_Melbourne","/wiki/Spotswood_railway_station","/wiki/Strathmore_railway_station","/wiki/Toorak_railway_station","/wiki/Tottenham_railway_station","/wiki/West_Footscray_railway_station","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-glossary_1-0","#cite_ref-glossary_1-1","#cite_ref-glossary_1-2","http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/using-public-transport/symbol-meanings-glossary/","#cite_ref-mtm_2-0","#cite_ref-mtm_2-1","http://www.metrotrains.com.au/Maps-Stations/Station-Facilities.html","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Premium_station","/wiki/Metro_Trains_Melbourne","/wiki/Metlink_Melbourne","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Host_station&oldid=427360738","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Railway_stations_in_Melbourne","/wiki/Category:Public_transport_in_Melbourne","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Host+station&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Host+station","/wiki/Host_station","/wiki/Talk:Host_station","#","/wiki/Host_station","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Host_station&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:
