{"cursor":"24758","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Foot binding' ( or , \"Lotus feet\") is the custom of applying painfully tight\nbinding to the feet of young girls to prevent further growth. The practice\npossibly originated among upperclass court dancers in the early Song dynasty,\nbut spread and eventually became common among all but the lowest of classes.\nEventually foot binding became very popular because men thought it to be highly\nattractive. Even today in China (Guangzhou), there are families with \"lotus foot\nancestry\". In Guangzhou in the late 19th century, for example, it was usual to\nbind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to\nbe brought up as a lady. Her normal-footed sisters would grow up to be bond-\nservants or domestic slaves, and, when old enough, the concubines of rich men or\nthe wives of laboring men - able to work in the fields alongside them. In\ncontrast, the tiny narrow feet of the \"ladies\" were considered beautiful and\nmade a woman's movements more feminine and dainty. It was assumed these eldest\ndaughters would never need to work. Although reformers challenged the practice,\nit was not until the early 20th century that footbinding began dying out, partly\nfrom changing social conditions and partly as a result of anti-footbinding\ncampaigns. Foot-binding resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of\nits subjects, and some elderly Chinese women still survive today with\ndisabilities related to their bound feet.\n","linknr":373,"url":"Foot_binding","recorded":1362371624,"links":54,"instances":["christian","film","concept","author","film"],"pdf":["http://www.asianetwork.org/exchange/2008-spring/anex2008-spring-ko.pdf"],"categories":["Body modification","Gender studies","Chinese women","Foot","Violence against women"],"headings":["History","Process","Reception and appeal","In literature, film, and television","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Zhongwen.svg/40px-Zhongwen.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Chaussure_chinoise_Saverne_02_05_2012_1.jpg/220px-Chaussure_chinoise_Saverne_02_05_2012_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Natural_vs._bound_feet_comparison%2C_1902.JPG/220px-Natural_vs._bound_feet_comparison%2C_1902.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/GebundenerFuss.jpg/163px-GebundenerFuss.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/GebundenFuss.jpg/187px-GebundenFuss.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Bound_feet_%28X-ray%29.jpg/220px-Bound_feet_%28X-ray%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/FootBindingRxSchema2.gif/220px-FootBindingRxSchema2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/A_HIGH_CASTE_LADYS_DAINTY_LILY_FEET.jpg/200px-A_HIGH_CASTE_LADYS_DAINTY_LILY_FEET.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/China.svg/32px-China.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/BathingSuit1920s.jpg/32px-BathingSuit1920s.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/15px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/15px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mission","christian"],["thousand_pieces_of_gold","film"],["snow_flower_and_the_secret_fan","film"],["bagua","concept"],["wang_ping","author"]],"members":["mission","snow_flower_and_the_secret_fan","bagua","wang_ping","thousand_pieces_of_gold"],"related":["Song_dynasty","Southern_Tang","Nanjing","Hakka_people","Routledge","Gansu","Dungan_people","Guangzhou","James_Legge","Manchu_people","Yunnan","Xiamen","Mission_(Christian)","Timothy_Richard","Social_Darwinism","Feminist","Brigitte_Kwan","Empress_Dowager_Cixi","Boxer_Rebellion","Qing","Qing","Republic_of_China","Taiwan","Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule","Feng_Xun","Chytridiomycota","Pearl_Buck","Flowers_in_the_Mirror","Lin_Tai-yi","Feng_Jicai","Ingrid_Bergman","Gladys_Aylward","Thousand_Pieces_of_Gold_(film)","Polly_Bemis","Chinese_American","American_pioneer","Emily_Prager","Lisa_Loomer","Body_modification","Lensey_Namioka","The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt","Lisa_See","Snow_Flower_and_the_Secret_Fan_(film)","Wayne_Wang","Bagua_(concept)","Artificial_cranial_deformation","Attraction_to_disability","Body_modification","Corset","Cosmetic_surgery","Foot_Emancipation_Society","Wang_Ping_(author)"]}
