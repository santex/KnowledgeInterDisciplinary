{"cursor":"35792","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Cybernetics' is a transdisciplinary approach\nfor exploring regulatory systems, their structures, constraints, and\npossibilities. Cybernetics is relevant to the study of systems, such as\nmechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems. Cybernetics is\napplicable when a system being analyzed is involved in a closed signaling loop;\nthat is, where action by the system generates some change in its environment and\nthat change is reflected in that system in some manner (feedback) that triggers\na system change, originally referred to as a \"circular causal\" relationship.\nSome say this is necessary to a cybernetic perspective. System Dynamics, a\nrelated field, originated with applications of electrical engineering control\ntheory to other kinds of simulation models (especially business systems) by Jay\nForrester at MIT in the 1950s.\n\nConcepts studied by cyberneticists (or, as some prefer, cyberneticians)\ninclude, but are not limited to: learning, cognition, adaption, social\ncontrol, emergence, communication, efficiency, efficacy, and connectivity.\nThese concepts are studied by other subjects such as engineering and biology,\nbut in cybernetics these are abstracted from the context of the individual\norganism or device.\n\nCybernetics was defined in the mid 20th century, by Norbert Wiener as \"the\nscientific study of control and communication in the animal and the\nmachine.\" The word \"cybernetics\" comes from the Greek\nmeaning to \"steer\" or \"navigate.\" Contemporary cybernetics began as an\ninterdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical\nnetwork theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology,\nneuroscience, anthropology, and psychology in the 1940s, often attributed to the\nMacy Conferences. During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved\nin ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from\nsecond-order cybernetics (about observing systems). Heinz von\nFoerster (1981), 'Observing Systems\", Intersystems Publications, Seaside, CA.\n More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in\nways that embraces first and second-order).\n\nFields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include\ngame theory, system theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics),\nperceptual control theory, sociology, psychology (especially neuropsychology,\nbehavioral psychology, cognitive psychology), philosophy, architecture, and\norganizational theory.
