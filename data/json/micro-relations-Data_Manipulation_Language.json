{"cursor":"4262","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'data manipulation language' ('DML') is a family of syntax elements similar to\na computer programming language used for inserting, deleting and updating data\nin a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered\na component of DML.\n\nA popular data manipulation language is that of Structured Query Language (SQL),\nwhich is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. SQL92 Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DLI, CODASYL\ndatabases, such as IDMS and others.\n\nData manipulation language comprises the SQL data change statements, which modify stored data but not the\nschema or database objects. Manipulation of persistent database objects, e.g.,\ntables or stored procedures, via the SQL schema statements, SQL92 4.22.2, SQL statements classified by\nfunction rather than the data stored within them, is considered to be part\nof a separate data definition language. In SQL these two categories are similar\nin their detailed syntax, data types, expressions etc., but distinct in their\noverall function.\n\nData manipulation languages have their functional capability organized by the\ninitial word in a statement, which is almost always a verb. In the case of SQL,\nthese verbs are:\n* SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...\n* INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...\n* UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...\n* DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...\n\nThe purely read-only SELECT query statement is classed\nwith the 'SQL-data' statements and\nso is considered by the standard to be outside of DML. The SELECT ... INTO form is considered to be DML because it manipulates\n(i.e. modifies) data. In common practice though, this distinction is not made\nand SELECT is widely considered to be part of DML. {{cite web |title=Data Manipulation Language Statements |url-\n=http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/sqlplsql.htm#i1-\n8503 |publisher=Oracle |quote=Data manipulation language (DML) statements query\nor manipulate data in existing schema objects. }}\n\nMost SQL database implementations extend their SQL capabilities by providing\nimperative, i.e. procedural languages. Examples of these are Oracle's PL/SQL and\nDB2's SQL PL.\n\nData manipulation languages tend to have many different flavors and capabilities\nbetween database vendors. There have been a number of standards established for\nSQL by ANSI, but vendors still provide their own extensions\nto the standard while not implementing the entire standard.\n\nData manipulation languages are divided into two types, procedural programming\nand declarative programming.\n\nEach SQL DML statement is a declarative command. The individual SQL statements\nare declarative, as opposed to imperative, in that they describe the program's\npurpose, rather than describing the procedure for accomplishing it.\n\nData manipulation languages were initially only used within computer programs,\nbut with the advent of SQL have come to be used interactively by database\nadministrators.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Data_Manipulation_Language","recorded":1362574582,"links":34,"instances":["sql","sql","search_processing_language","sql","sql","sql","sql"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data modeling","SQL"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["select","sql"],["insert","sql"],["update","sql"],["delete","sql"],["select","sql"],["select","sql"],["select","sql"],["spl","search_processing_language"],["select","sql"],["insert","sql"],["update","sql"],["delete","sql"],["create","sql"],["drop","sql"]],"members":["create","insert","spl","drop","delete","update","select"],"related":["Programming_language","Database","Structured_Query_Language","Data","Relational_database","Information_Management_System","CODASYL","IDMS","Data_definition_language","Verb","Select_(SQL)","Insert_(SQL)","Update_(SQL)","Delete_(SQL)","Select_(SQL)","Select_(SQL)","Select_(SQL)","Oracle_Database","Imperative_programming","Oracle_Database","PL/SQL","IBM_DB2","ANSI","Procedural_programming","Declarative_programming","Imperative_programming","Computer_program","Create,_read,_update_and_delete","Data_definition_language","Data_control_language","Query_language","SPL_(Search_Processing_Language)","Select_(SQL)","Insert_(SQL)","Update_(SQL)","Delete_(SQL)","Create_(SQL)","Drop_(SQL)"]}
