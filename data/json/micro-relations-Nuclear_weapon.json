The first fission (\"atomic\") bomb test released the same amount of\nenergy as approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. The first thermonuclear (\"hydrogen\")\nbomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately 10,000,000 tons of\nTNT. See Trinity (nuclear test) and Ivy Mike.\n\nA modern thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than can produce an explosive\nforce comparable to the detonation of more than 1.2 million tons (1.1 million\ntonnes) of TNT. Specifically the US B83 nuclear bomb, with a yield of up to\n1.2 Megatons. Thus, even a small nuclear device no larger than traditional\nbombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire and radiation. Nuclear weapons\nare considered weapons of mass destruction, and their use and control have been\na major focus of international relations policy since their debut.\n\nOnly two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare, both by the\nUnited States near the end of World War II. On 6 August 1945, a uranium gun-type\nfission bomb code-named \"Little Boy\" was detonated over the Japanese city of\nHiroshima. Three days later, on 9 August, a plutonium implosion-type fission\nbomb code-named \"Fat Man\" was exploded over Nagasaki, Japan. These two bombings\nresulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 peopleâmostly civiliansâfrom\nacute injuries sustained from the explosions. The role of the\nbombings in Japan's surrender, and their ethical status, remain the subject of\nscholarly and popular debate.\n\nSince the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been\ndetonated on over two thousand occasions for testing purposes and\ndemonstrations. Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of\nseeking them. The only countries known to have detonated nuclear weaponsâand\nthat acknowledge possessing such weaponsâare (chronologically by date of first\ntest) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by\nRussia), the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, India,\nPakistan, and North Korea. In addition, Israel is also widely believed to\npossess nuclear weapons, though it does not acknowledge having them. See also Mordechai Vanunu One\nstate, South Africa, fabricated nuclear weapons in the past, but as its\napartheid regime was coming to an end it disassembled its arsenal, acceded to\nthe NPT and accepted full-scope international safeguards.\n\nThe Federation of American Scientists estimates there are more than 17,000\nnuclear warheads in the world as of 2012, with around 4,300 of them considered\n\"operational\", ready for use.\n","linknr":1055,"url":"Nuclear_weapon","recorded":1362512618,"links":141,"instances":["nuclear_propulsion","weapon","campaign","nuclear_test","1899_and_1907"],"pdf":["http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/np_237_and_americium.pdf","http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/np_237_and_americium.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-8.pdf","http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf"],"categories":["1945
