      "text" : "\n\nThe term 'Melkite', also written 'Melchite', refers to various Byzantine Rite\nChristian churches and their members originating in the Middle East. The word\ncomes from the Syriac word malkoyo (), and the Arabic word Malakī (, meaning\n\"royal\", and by extension, \"imperial\").<ref>Dick (2004), p. 9</ref> When used in\nan ecclesiastical sense, it refers specifically to the Eastern Rite Catholic\nPatriarchate of Antioch.<ref name=Brockp76></ref>\n\nMelkites view themselves as the first Christian community, dating the Melkite\nChurch back to the time of the Apostles.<ref name=Littlep322></ref> This first\ncommunity is said to have been a mixed one made up of individuals who were\noriginally Greek, Roman, Syriac, and Jewish. After the Islamic conquests of the\nLevant in the 7th century, the Melkite community started incorporating Arabic\nlanguage in the liturgical traditions as the Middle East became gradually\nArabized.<ref name=Littlep322/> written in Syriac Sertâ book script (11th\ncentury, St. Catherine's Monastery, Mt. Sinai.]] The term Melkite was originally\nused as a pejorative term after the acrimonious division that occurred in\nEastern Christianity after the Council of Chalcedon (451). It was used by non-\nChalcedonians to refer to those who backed the council and the Byzantine Emperor\n(malko and its cognates are Semitic words for \"king\"). \"It was only towards the\nend of the fifth century that it took the name of Melkite\".<ref>History of the\nMelkite Church from its Origins to the Present Day, by Mgr. Joseph Nasrallah,\nMelkite Exarque in Paris. http://phoenicia.org/melkites.html</ref> The Melkites\nwere generally Greek-speaking city-dwellers living in the west of the Levant and\nin Egypt, as opposed to the more provincial Syriac- and Coptic-speaking non-\nChalcedonians. The Melkite Church was organised into three historic\npatriarchates — Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem — in union with the Patriarch\nof Constantinople. The non-Chalcedonians set up their own patriarchs in\nAlexandria (Coptic Orthodox Church) and Antioch (Syriac Orthodox Church). The\nNubian kingdom of Makuria (in modern Sudan) in contrast to their Non-\nChalcedonian Ethiopian Orthodox neighbours, also practiced the Melkite faith,\nfrom c. 575 until ca. 710 and had big Melkite minority until ca. 1400s.\n\nFrom 1342, Roman Catholic clergy were based in Damascus and other areas, and\nworked toward a union between Rome and the Orthodox. At that time, the nature of\nthe East-West Schism, normally dated to 1054, was undefined, and many of those\nwho continued to worship and work within the Melkite Church became identified as\na pro-Western party. In 1724, Cyril VI (Seraphim Tanas) was elected in Damascus\nby the Synod as Patriarch of Antioch. Considering this to be a Catholic takeover\nattempt, Jeremias III of Constantinople imposed a deacon, the Greek monk\nSylvester to rule the patriarchate instead of Cyril. After being ordained a\npriest, then bishop he was given Turkish protection to overthrow Cyril.\nSylvester's heavy-handed leadership of the church encouraged many to re-examine\nthe validity of Cyril's claim to the patriarchal throne.\n\nThe newly elected Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) also recognised the legitimacy\nof Cyril's claim and recognized him and his followers as being in communion with\nRome. From that point onwards, the Melkite Church was divided between the Greek\nOrthodox Church of Antioch, who continued to be appointed by the authority of\nthe Patriarch of Constantinople until the late nineteenth century, and the\nCatholics, who recognize the authority of the Pope of Rome. However, it is now\nonly the Catholic group who continue to use the title Melkite; thus, in modern\nusage, the term applies almost exclusively to the Arabic-speaking Greek\nCatholics from the Middle East.\n\nSome typically Grecian \"Ancient Synagogal\" priestly rites and hymns have\nsurvived partially to the present, notably in the distinct church services of\nthe Melkite and Greek Orthodox communities of the Hatay Province of Southern\nTurkey, Syria and Lebanon. Members of theses communities still call themselves\nRûm which literally means \"Roman\" or \"Asian Greek\" in Turkish, Persian and\nArabic (that is, those of the (Eastern) Roman Empire, what English speakers\noften call \"Byzantine\"). The term \"Rûm\" is used in preference to \"Ionani\" or\n\"Yāvāni\" which means \"European-\" or in Classical Arabic and Biblical Hebrew.\n",
