Many not necessarily mutually\nexclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory\nreception, maneuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide\nin warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks,\nhammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at\nnight. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos\nIsland off Costa Rica, and near Molokai Island in Hawaii. Large schools are also\nseen in southern and eastern Africa.\n",
