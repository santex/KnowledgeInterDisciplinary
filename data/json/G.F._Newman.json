He is known for\nhis two series [[Law and Order (UK miniseries)|Law and Order]] and [[The\nNation's Health (UK miniseries)|The Nation's Health]], each based on his books.\n\nNewman has very strong and sometimes controversial views on a variety of\nsubjects, and these are reflected in his choice of subjects for writing. He has\nlittle faith in conventional medicine, believing that alternative therapy is far\nmore effective. He claims that doctors are not interested in prevention, and are\ntoo close to the interests of the major pharmaceutical companies in just\nreleasing ever more powerful drugs. He does acknowledge the benefits of nursing\nthough. In The Nation's Health, a newly-qualified doctor goes to work at an NHS\nhospital; with her training taking her through the hospital's various\ndepartments, her idealistic aspirations come under threat.\n\nHe is also not impressed by the police service. He joked that he would rather\nsee community members wearing pink uniforms working to prevent disturbances in\ntheir own areas.\n\nHe is also a very devout vegan, and when producing or directing television\nprogrammes insists that no meat at all is consumed on the sets. He says he has\nno problem with the act of eating flesh in itself, but it is the attitude that\nbecause one species is stronger or more sophisticated than another it has the\nright to kill it which he is strongly against. Therefore if an animal died of\nnatural causes and someone wanted to eat it he would have no problem with that.\n\nHaving no political allegiance to either left or right wings, he once\nconsidered starting his own party on his passionate issues, but realized that\ngetting over 600 strong candidates who completely agreed with all his views\nwould be too tough.\n\nRecent TV series created by Newman include [[Judge John Deed]] and [[New Street\nLaw]]. He is currently working on a follow-up to [[Law & Order (UK TV\nseries)|Law and Order]], and a series of single plays for the BBC.\n\nNewman's first book, Sir, You Bastard was a bestseller on publication in 1970.\nOther books he has written include You Nice Bastard, Billy, The List, The Men\nWith The Guns, Charlie and Joanna, Three Professional Ladies, Circle of Poison,\nLaw and Order, The Nation's Health, and his 2009 novel Crime and Punishment.\n\nTogether with screenwriter and novelist Matthew Hall he owns and runs the\nproduction company One Eyed Dog Ltd.\n","linknr":122,"url":"G.F._Newman","recorded":1375074650,"links":["/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/G._F._Newman","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=G.F._Newman&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/England","/wiki/Television_producer","/wiki/British_people","/wiki/Crime_fiction","#cite_note-Hattenstone_Guardian-1","/wiki/England","/wiki/Television_producer","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/Law_and_Order_(UK_miniseries)","/w/index.php?title=The_Nation%27s_Health_(UK_miniseries)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Vegan","/wiki/Judge_John_Deed","/wiki/New_Street_Law","/wiki/Law_%26_Order_(UK_TV_series)","/wiki/Matthew_Hall_(writer)","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Law_%26_Order_(UK_TV_series)","/wiki/Screen_One","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Pilot_.282001.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_1_.282001.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_2_.282002.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_3_.282003.E2.80.932004.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_4_.282005.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_5_.282006.29","/wiki/List_of_Judge_John_Deed_episodes#Series_6_.282007.29","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-Hattenstone_Guardian_1-0","http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,,416148,00.html","/wiki/The_Guardian","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit&section=3","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628094/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.gfnewman.com","http://www.one-eyed-dog.co.uk","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/79338286","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&oldid=560835052","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1946_births","/wiki/Category:British_novelists","/wiki/Category:British_television_producers","/wiki/Category:British_television_writers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_August_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=G.+F.+Newman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=G.+F.+Newman","/wiki/G._F._Newman","/wiki/Talk:G._F._Newman","#","/wiki/G._F._Newman","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/G._F._Newman","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/G._F._Newman","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&oldid=560835052","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5512232","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=G._F._Newman&id=560835052","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=G.+F.+Newman","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=G.+F.+Newman&oldid=560835052&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=G._F._Newman&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5512232#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafo
