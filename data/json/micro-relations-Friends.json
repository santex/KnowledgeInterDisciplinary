The series revolves around a group of friends in Manhattan. The\nseries was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with\nWarner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Crane, Kauffman\nand Kevin S. Bright, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe in\nNovember/December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had\npreviously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the\nseries to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a second\ntitle change to Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends and\npremiered on NBC's coveted timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner\nBros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience. The\nseries finale (the 236th episode), airing on May 6, 2004, was watched by\n51.1 million American viewers, making it the fourth\nmost watched series finale in television history and the most watched episode of the decade.\n\nFriends received positive reviews throughout its run, becoming one of the most\npopular sitcoms of all time. The series won many awards and was nominated for 63\nPrimetime Emmy Awards. The series, an instant hit from its debut, was also very\nsuccessful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final\nprimetime ratings. Many critics now regard it as one of the finest shows in\ntelevision history, including TV Guide, which ranked it No. 21 on their list of\nthe 50 greatest TV shows of all time. In 1997, the episode \"The\nOne with the Prom Video\" was ranked No. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes\nof All-Time. The series made a large cultural impact, which continues\ntoday. The Central Perk coffee house that was featured prominently in the series\nhas inspired various imitations throughout the world. The series continues in\nsyndication worldwide. All ten seasons are available in standard definition on\nDVD and in high definition on Blu-ray. The spin-off series [[Joey (TV\nseries)|Joey]] was created to follow up with the series after the finale.\n","linknr":1771,"url":"Friends","recorded":1362481231,"links":104,"instances":["producer","tv_channel","season_10","new_zealand","the_rembrandts_song","ireland","australian_tv_channel","channel","tv_producer","friends","website","friends","uk_and_ireland"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Friends|","1994 American television series debuts","2004 American television series endings","1990s American comedy television series","2000s American comedy television series","American television sitcoms","BAFTA winners (television series)","English-language television series","NBC network shows","Nielsen ratings winners","Television series by Warner Bros.
