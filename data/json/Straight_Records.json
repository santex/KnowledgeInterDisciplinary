{"cursor":"4174","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Straight Records' was a record label formed in 1969 to distribute productions\nand discoveries of Frank Zappa and his business partner/manager Herb Cohen.\nStraight was formed at the same time as a companion label, Bizarre Records.\nStraight and Bizarre were manufactured and distributed in the U.S. by the Warner\nBros. Records family of labels, which also included Reprise Records. Straight\nRecords recordings were distributed in the U.K. by CBS Records.\n\nFrank Zappa himself chose most of the artists for the Straight label. His\noriginal intention was to release albums by avant-garde artists on Bizarre, and\nrecordings by more mainstream artists on Straight. However the original concept\nfailed to work out as expected due to issues with record distribution and artist\nmanagement. Frank Zappa, The Mothers of Invention, Wild Man Fischer, and Lenny\nBruce certainly fit in at Bizarre, but all others ended up on Straight. This led\nto some very unusual albums on the Straight label especially those by Captain\nBeefheart, Alice Cooper and The GTOs.\n\nZappa was also responsible for The Persuasions' first LP [[Acapella (Persuasions\nalbum)|Acappella]]. Over the phone he heard The Persuasions singing live in a\nJersey City, N.J. record shop. Due to his passion for doo-wop Zappa immediately\nflew the vocal group to Los Angeles to record. Other notable Straight artists\nincluded Tim Buckley, and the duo of Judy Henske & Jerry Yester. These musicians\ncame to the label through an association with manager Herb Cohen.\n\nThe first issue of [[Love It to Death]] by Alice Cooper was on Straight.\nHowever, by the time the album became a success it had already been re-issued on\nWarner Bros. Starting in 1972 this and other Straight recordings were re-issued\nby either Reprise or Warner Bros. By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight distribution\nagreement with Warner ended. Under a new agreement starting that year Zappa and\nCohen's business ventures with Warner were merged and renamed to create DiscReet\nRecords. The Zappa/Cohen business partnership ended acrimoniously with\nlitigation from both sides in 1976. In the settlement, reached a few years\nlater, Zappa retained ownership of his work and Herb Cohen assumed ownership of\nmost of the non-Zappa material from Bizarre, Straight and DiscReet.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989 Straight recordings by Captain Beefheart, Alice Cooper, Tim\nBuckley, The GTOs, The Persuasions, and Lord Buckley were briefly re-issued on\nCD and cassette by the Enigma Retro label. Zappa died at age 53 in 1993. Cohen\ndied at age 73 in 2010. Unsubstantiated rumors have been made that since the\nearly 1990s the ownership of some Straight Records recordings has become\nunclear. This may have prevented further re-issues of some Straight Records\nmaterial. By the late 2000s, however, number of these recordings (such as Tim\nBuckley's Blue Afternoon and Starsailor, and Captain Beefheart's Lick My Decals\nOff Baby) have since been reissued on 180-gram vinyl and have been made\navailable for sale on the iTunes Store. They have not, however, been reissued on\nCD. Whilst it has not been officially stated, it is believed that the clause\npreventing these albums' re-release only covered CD releases and not other\nformats. However, tracks from them have been licensed for and appeared on CD\ncompilations in recent years.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Straight_Records","recorded":1374863028,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/1969_in_music","/wiki/Frank_Zappa","/wiki/Herb_Cohen","/wiki/Bizarre_Records","/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records","/wiki/Reprise_Records","/wiki/Frank_Zappa","/wiki/The_Mothers_of_Invention","/wiki/Wild_Man_Fischer","/wiki/Lenny_Bruce","/wiki/Captain_Beefheart","/wiki/Alice_Cooper","/wiki/The_GTOs","/wiki/The_Persuasions","/w/index.php?title=Acapella_(Persuasions_album)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Doo-wop","/wiki/Tim_Buckley","/wiki/Judy_Henske","/wiki/Jerry_Yester","/wiki/Love_It_to_Death","/wiki/Alice_Cooper","/wiki/DiscReet_Records","/wiki/Captain_Beefheart","/wiki/Alice_Cooper","/wiki/Tim_Buckley","/wiki/The_GTOs","/wiki/The_Persuasions","/wiki/Lord_Buckley","/wiki/Enigma_Records","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Captain_Beefheart","/wiki/Alice_Cooper","/wiki/Tim_Buckley","/wiki/Jeff_Simmons_(musician)","/wiki/Lord_Buckley","/wiki/Judy_Henske","/wiki/Jerry_Yester","/wiki/The_GTOs","/wiki/The_Persuasions","/wiki/Rosebud_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_record_labels","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit&section=3","http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/labels.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&oldid=559404187","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Record_labels_established_in_1969","/wiki/Category:Frank_Zappa","/wiki/Category:Rock_record_labels","/wiki/Category:Defunct_record_labels_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Straight+Records&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Straight+Records","/wiki/Straight_Records","/wiki/Talk:Straight_Records","#","/wiki/Straight_Records","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Straight_Records","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Straight_Records","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&oldid=559404187","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Straight_Records&id=559404187","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Straight+Records","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Straight+Records&oldid=559404187&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Straight_Records&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1712125#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Records","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=
