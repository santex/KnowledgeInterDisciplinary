To plan an emergent curriculum\nrequires observation, documentation, creative brainstorming, flexibility and\npatience. Rather than starting with a lesson plan which requires a âhookâ to get\nthe children interested, emergent curriculum starts with the childrenâs\ninterests. This is not to say that the teacher has no input, in fact teachers\nmay well have a general topic they think is important for children to study and\nthey may purposely include certain materials or experiences related to it as\njumping off points. Elizabeth Jones points out:  We are the stage\ndirectors; curriculum is teacherâs responsibility, not childrenâs. People who\nhear the words emergent curriculum may wrongly assume that everything simply\nemerges from the children. The childrenâs ideas are an important source of\ncurriculum but only one of many possible sources that reflect the complex\necology of their lives. (Jones p. 5) \n\nThis process requires a great deal of flexibility and creativity on the part of\nthe teacher. Carolyn Edwards notes: âThe teachers honestly do not know where the\ngroup will end up. Although this openness adds a dimension of difficulty to\ntheir work, it also makes it more exciting.â (Edwards p 159)\n\nOnce teachers see an interest âemergingâ they brainstorm ways to study the topic\nin depth. Webbing is often used because of its playful and flexible nature. A\nweb doesnât show everything that will be learned, it shows many things that\ncould be learned. However it is important to use the webbing as a tool to open\nthe teacher to possibilities not a âplan.â Teachers brainstorm many\npossibilities for study sparked from the particular interest, not as a plan but\nmore as a âroad mapâ as one teacher put it: To get a plan, we chose an idea and\nbrainstormed ways that children could play it â hands-on activities we could\nprovide. Putting all the activities on a web gives you a road map full of\npossible journeys. (Jones p. 129)\n\nAn idea for a curriculum topic may be sparked by anything or come from anywhere.\nFor instance, a teacher may overhear a group of students having a discussion\nabout bugs that leads to the class sitting down and coming up with a web topic\nthat explores all the possible directions the class could go in their quest to\nlearn all they can about the topic of bugs. Ideas may also be sparked by\noffering experiences such as taking a walk through the neighborhood, visiting\nlocal businesses, or reading books.\n\n\"Reggio Emilia\" schools are one variety of school that use emergent curriculum.\n\nAnother emergent curriculum in the education of 3, 4, and 5-year-olds is helping\nthem make the connection between symbols and objects. Put up pictures on the\nshelves where toys and games go so the children can match the picture to the\nobject. Draw outlines of blocks on the block shelf so that the children will\nunderstand where to replace them when they are done playing (Gonzalez-Mena,\n2011). Try using all kinds of symbols in the classroom. Make tags with houses on\nthem for the children to wear when they are playing in the kitchen area. Teach\nuniversal symbols, such as the slashed circle, to represent off-limit areas; or\ndraw boy and girl figures on the bathroom doors. Eventually add words alongside\nthe symbols so that the children can make verbal associations as well (Gonzalez-\nMena, 2011).\n\n'Sources'\n\n*Booth, Cleta. âThe Fiber Project: One Teacherâs Adventure Toward Emergent\nCurriculumâ.
