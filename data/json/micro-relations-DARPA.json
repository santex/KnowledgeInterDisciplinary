DARPA has been responsible for funding the\ndevelopment of many technologies which have had a major effect on the world,\nincluding computer networking, as well as NLS, which was both the first\nhypertext system, and an important precursor to the contemporary ubiquitous\ngraphical user interface.\n\nDARPA began as the 'Advanced Research Projects Agency' ('ARPA') created in 1958\nby president Dwight D. Eisenhower for the purpose of forming and executing\nresearch and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and\nscience and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science & Technology,\n(2008).Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [http://www.eisenhowermemorial-\n.org/onepage/IKE%20&%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20(v2).pdf Source]. The\nadministration was responding to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957, and\nARPA's mission was to ensure U.S. military technology be more sophisticated than\nthat of the nation's potential enemies. From DARPA's own introduction, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-\nbin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA433949 \"50 years of Bridging the\nGap\"]  DARPAâs original mission, established in 1958, was to\nprevent technological surprise like the launch of Sputnik, which signaled that\nthe Soviets had beaten the U.S. into space. The mission statement has evolved\nover time. Today, DARPAâs mission is still to prevent technological surprise to\nthe US, but also to create technological surprise for our enemies. \n\nARPA, was renamed to \"DARPA\" (for Defense) in March 1972, then renamed \"ARPA\"\nagain in February 1993, and then renamed \"DARPA\" again in March 1996.\n\nDARPA is independent from other more conventional military research and\ndevelopment and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management.\nDARPA has around 240 personnel (about 140 technical) directly managing a $3.2\nbillion budget. These figures are \"on average\" since DARPA focuses on short-term\n(two to four-year) projects run by small, purpose-built teams.\n","linknr":771,"url":"DARPA","recorded":1362267794,"links":70,"instances":["darpa","company","darpa","darpa","us_military","darpa","computer_system","missile","darpa","darpa","darpa","mobile_shooter_detection_system","scientist","darpa","flying_car","darpa","computer_scientist"],"pdf":["http://www.eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20&%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20(v2).pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080802030708/http://www.darpa.mil/body/news/2008/hasc3-13-08.pdf","https://www.afcea.org/smallbusiness/files/Presentations/CommitteeMeetings/PRESENTATION_Using%20the%20SBIR%20Program_RBrooke_SNichols_MZammit_March2009/PRESENTATION_DARPA_SBIR_Presentation_SusanNichols_March2009.pdf","http://www.darpa.mil/news/2011/MindsEyeNewsRelease.pdf","http://www.darpa.mil/news/2011/MindsEyeNewsRelease.pdf"],"categories":["United
