He arrived in 1911, with the support of the Illinois Baptist State\nAssociation, and began in Zefat, where he baptized his first convert. He later\nfounded a church in Nazareth. The Southern Baptist Convention sent missionaries\nin 1923. A congregation was established in Jerusalem in 1925, and another in\nHaifa in 1936. The Association itself was established in the early 1960s.\n\nIn 2001, the Association of Baptist Churches established a \"twinning\" agreement\nwith the Baptist Union of Great Britain, which is promoted by the organizations\nas \"a means to support each other in prayer, developing ministry, mutual benefit\nfrom the experience of the other, fellowship and encouragement.\n\nThe churches of the ABC are conservative in their theology. They oppose the\npractice of women pastors. Due to their circumstances, individual churches often\nemphasize their positions on the Old and New Covenants. The Jerusalem Church,\nhaving suffered the original body adopting charismatic practices, emphasize\ntheir stand on spiritual gifts. Premillennialism is the predominant\neschatological belief, though some are adopting Amillennialism.\n\nIn 2004, the ABCI had 19 congregations with about 2000 members. The\ncongregations are ethnically and linguistically diverse, with 13 Arabic-\nspeaking, two Hebrew-speaking, two Spanish, one Filipino, and one Russian. The\nmajority of Baptist believers live in Galilee. Chairman of ABC board is Mr. Fuad\nHaddad. Treasurer from Association is Bader Mansour, the owner and general\nmanager from Nazareth Data Quest a technology provider corporation.In June\n2006,the ABC elected a new chairman:Mr. Monther Naum,a nutrition engineer from\nShefa-Amr.\n\nA \"K-12\" school (founded 1949), which is housed near the Evangelical Baptist\nChurch at Nazareth, is related to the organization. The [http://www.nbs.org.il\nNazareth Baptist School] was rated lately as the 7th school nationally in the\npercentage of excellent students in the matriculation exam. The general director\nof the school is Botrus Mansour, and the principal is Dr. Ousama Moalem. The\nleading Baptist congregation is the Local Baptist Church (LBC) in Nazareth. The\nAssociation of Baptist Churches is a member of the European Baptist Federation\nand the Baptist World Alliance.\n\nIn addition to the churches of the ABCI, there were two churches in Israel\naffiliated with the American Baptist Association (one each in Jerusalem and\nRamallah) and one Reformed Baptist church near Tel Aviv. Christians make up\nabout 2% of the religious affiliation in Israel, and Baptists are only a small\npart of that. Yet, the Association of Baptist Churches in Israel is the\nlargest individual evangelical body in Israel. The majority religion is Jewish\n- about 80%.\n\nIn 2006, ABC initiated the establishment of the Nazareth Centre for Christian\nStudies and asked Dr. James Bryson Arthur from Scotland to lead\nit. This was later renamed Nazareth Evangelical Theological Seminary\n(NETS) and presently offers BTh, BDiv, MTh, and MA degrees. A majority of\nIsrael's Baptists live in the Galilee.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel","recorded":1375059301,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Baptist","/wiki/Baptists","/wiki/File:Baptism_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Baptism_logo.jpg/100px-Baptism_logo.jpg","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Protestantism","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Anabaptist","/wiki/Baptist_beliefs","/wiki/Priesthood_of_all_believers","/wiki/Soul_competency","/wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state","/wiki/Sola_scriptura","/wiki/Congregationalist_polity","/wiki/Baptist_ordinance","/wiki/Baptist_offices","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_confessions","/wiki/List_of_Baptists","/wiki/John_Smyth_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/Thomas_Helwys","/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)","/wiki/John_Clarke_(Baptist_minister)","/wiki/John_Bunyan","/wiki/Shubal_Stearns","/wiki/Andrew_Fuller","/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon","/wiki/D._N._Jackson","/wiki/James_Robinson_Graves","/wiki/William_Bullein_Johnson","/wiki/William_Carey_(missionary)","/wiki/Luther_Rice","/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.","/wiki/Billy_Graham","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_denominations","/wiki/List_of_Baptist_colleges_and_universities","/wiki/Portal:Baptist","/wiki/Template:Baptist","/wiki/Template_talk:Baptist","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baptist&action=edit","/wiki/Baptist","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Edward_Said","#cite_note-1","/wiki/George_Truett","/wiki/Dallas,_Texas","/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine","/wiki/Nazareth","/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention","/wiki/Jerusalem","/wiki/Haifa","/wiki/Baptist_Union_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/New_Covenant","/wiki/Premillennialism","/wiki/Millennialism","http://www.nbs.org.il","/wiki/European_Baptist_Federation","/wiki/Baptist_World_Alliance","/wiki/American_Baptist_Association","/wiki/Reformed_Baptist","/wiki/Tel_Aviv","/wiki/Jew","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Scotland","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Nazareth_Evangelical_Theological_Seminary_(NETS)","/wiki/Galilee","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Susan_Slyomovics&action=edit&redlink=1","http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/framework_the_journal_of_cinema_and_media/v050/50.1-2.slyomovics.html%20Edward%20Said's%20Nazareth","#cite_ref-2","http://ojs.globalmissiology.org/index.php/english/article/view/69/203","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit&section=2","http://nazarethseminary.org/datadir/en-events/ev90/files/Dwight%20Baker%20Israel%20Baptist%20Jubilee.pdf","http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31206926","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit&section=3","http://www.baptist.org.il/","http://www.centralba.org.uk/Twinning/","http://www.jerusalembaptistchurch.org/","http://www.lbc-nazareth.org/","http://www.nbs.org.il/","http://www.nazarethseminary.org/","http://nazsem.blogspot.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&oldid=555259687","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Christianity_in_Israel","/wiki/Category:Baptist_denominations_in_Asia","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_the_1960s","/w/index.php?title=Category:Protestantism_in_Israel&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Category:Protestantism_in_Asia","/wiki/Category:Nazareth","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Association+of+Baptist+Churches+in+Israel&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Association+of+Baptist+Churches+in+Israel","/wiki/Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel","/wiki/Talk:Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel","#","/wiki/Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Association_of_Baptist_Churches_in_Israel&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/
