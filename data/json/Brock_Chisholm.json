He was a strong advocate of religious tolerance\nand often commented that man's worst enemy was not disease, which he felt was\ncurable as long as men worked together, but man himself.\n\nChisholm was born in Oakville, Ontario, to a family with deep ties to the\nregion. Under Sir Isaac Brock, after whom Chisholm was named, his great-\ngrandfather fought against the Americans during the War of 1812. His great-\ngrandfather's brother was also Oakville's founder.\n\nAs an 18-year-old at the start of the First World War, Chisholm joined the\nCanadian Expeditionary Force, serving in the 15th Battalion, CEF as a cook,\nsniper, machine gunner and scout. His leadership and heroism were twice\nrewarded: with a Military Cross for his efforts in a battle outside of Lens,\nFrance; and the Bar. He rose to the rank of captain, was injured once and\nreturned home in 1917.\n\nAfter the war, Chisholm pursued his lifelong passion of medicine, earning his\nM.D. from the University of Toronto by 1924 before interning in England, where\nhe specialized in psychiatry. After six years in general practice in his native\nOakville, he attended Yale University where he specialized in the mental health\nof children. During this time, Chisholm developed his strong view that children\nshould be raised in an \"as intellectually free environment\" as possible,\nindependent of the prejudices and biases â political, moral and religious â of\ntheir parents.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Chisholm rapidly rose in stature within\nthe Canadian military and government. He joined the war effort as a psychiatrist\ndealing with psychological aspects of soldier training, before rising to the\nrank of Director General of the Medical Services, the highest position within\nthe medical ranks of the Canadian Army. He was the first psychiatrist to head\nthe medical ranks of any army in the world. In 1944, the Canadian Government\ncreated the position of Deputy Minister of Health. Chisholm was first the person\nto occupy the post and held it until 1946.\n\nThat same year, Chisholm took his views to the international scene, becoming the\nExecutive Secretary of the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization,\nbased in Geneva, Switzerland. He was one of 16 international experts consulted\nin drafting the agency's first constitution. The WHO became a permanent UN\nfixture in April 1948, and Chisholm became the agency's first Director-General\non a 46â2 vote. Chisholm was now in the unique position of being able to brings\nhis views on the importance of international mental and physical health to the\nworld. Refusing re-election, he occupied the post until 1953, during which time\nthe WHO dealt successfully with a cholera epidemic in Egypt, malaria outbreaks\nin Greece and Sardinia, and introduced shortwave epidemic-warning services for\nships at sea.\n\nChisholm was a controversial public speaker who nevertheless had great\nconviction, and drew much cynicism within the Canadian public for comments in\nthe mid-1940s that children should not be encouraged to believe in Santa Claus.\nCalls for his resignation as Deputy Minister of Health were quelled by his\nappointment as Executive Secretary of the WHO, but his public perception as\n\"Canada's most famously articulate angry man\" lingered.\n\nWhile Chisholm was Director of the UN from 1948â53, he was quoted as saying\n\"To achieve world government, it is necessary to remove from the minds of men\ntheir individualism, loyalty to family traditions, national patriotism, and\nreligious dogmas.\"\n\nChisholm was an Honorary President of the World Federalists of Canada, President\nof the World Federation of Mental Health (1957â1958) and an Honorary Fellow of a\nnumber of prestigious medical associations. In 1959, the American Humanist\nAssociation named him Humanist of the Year. He received numerous honorary\ndegrees, and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967.\n\nChisholm married Grace McLean Ryrie on 21 June 1924, and had two children,\nCatherine Anne and Brock Ryrie. He died on 4 February 1971, in Veterans'\nHospital, Victoria, British Columbia, after a series of strokes. He was a\nUnitarian.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Brock_Chisholm","recorded":1374539416,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/World_Health_Organization#Directors-General_of_WHO","/wiki/Marcolino_Gomes_Candau","/wiki/Canadian","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Military_Cross","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Medical_practitioner","/wiki/World_Health_Organization","/wiki/Religious_tolerance","/wiki/Oakville,_Ontario","/wiki/Ontario","/wiki/Isaac_Black","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/War_of_1812","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Canadian_Expeditionary_Force","/wiki/15th_Battalion,_CEF","/wiki/Cook_(profession)","/wiki/Sniper","/wiki/Machine_gun","/wiki/Reconnaissance","/wiki/Military_Cross","/wiki/Lens,_France","/wiki/France","/wiki/Captain_(land)","/wiki/Medicine","/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine","/wiki/University_of_Toronto","/wiki/England","/wiki/Psychiatry","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Psychiatrist","/wiki/Canadian_Army","/w/index.php?title=Deputy_Minister_of_Health&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/World_Health_Organization","/wiki/Geneva,_Switzerland","/wiki/Switzerland","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/Cholera","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Malaria","/wiki/Greece","/wiki/Sardinia","/wiki/Santa_Claus","/w/index.php?title=World_Federalists_of_Canada&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/World_Federation_of_Mental_Health","/wiki/American_Humanist_Association","/wiki/Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Unitarianism","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brock_Chisholm","http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/chisholm.html","http://collections.ic.gc.ca/heirloom_series/volume6/296-297.htm","http://www.who.int/archives/who50/en/directors.htm","/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada","http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&TypeID=orc&id=1885","/wiki/Marcolino_Gomes_Candau","/wiki/Template:WWISniper","/wiki/Template_talk:WWISniper","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WWISniper&action=edit","/wiki/Sniper","/wiki/Billy_Sing","/wiki/Hesketh_Hesketh-Prichard","/wiki/Henry_Norwest","/wiki/Grey_Owl","/wiki/Johnson_Paudash","/wiki/Francis_Pegahmagabow","/wiki/Joseph_Gregory","/wiki/Ottavio_Bottecchia","/wiki/John_Shiwak","/wiki/Richard_Travis","/wiki/Herman_Davis","/wiki/Template:WWIISniper","/wiki/Template:VietnamSniper","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/12226429","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&oldid=561479856","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Military_snipers","/wiki/Category:Canadian_physicians","/wiki/Category:Canadian_military_personnel_of_World_War_I","/wiki/Category:University_of_Toronto_alumni","/wiki/Category:Canadian_agnostics","/wiki/Category:Companions_of_the_Order_of_Canada","/wiki/Category:1896_births","/wiki/Category:1971_deaths","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Military_Cross_and_Bar","/wiki/Category:People_from_Oakville,_Ontario","/wiki/Category:Canadian_Expeditionary_Force_officers","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brock+Chisholm&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brock+Chisholm","/wiki/Brock_Chisholm","/wiki/Talk:Brock_Chisholm","#","/wiki/Brock_Chisholm","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brock_Chisholm&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/
