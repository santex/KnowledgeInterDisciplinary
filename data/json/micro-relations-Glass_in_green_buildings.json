Glass, a wholly recyclable material, supplies unrestricted\noccasions for architects as well as designers for the innovative applications in\nbuildings. Glass plays a noteworthy role in accomplishing greater indoor\nenvironmental quality and energy efficiency and in so doing fulfills numerous\ncriteria for green buildings.\n\nThe intent of a green building design is to curtail the demand on non-renewable\nresources, amplify utilization efficiency of these resources when in use, and\naugment the reuse, recycling, and consumption of renewable resources.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Glass_in_green_buildings","recorded":1362481704,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.fosg.in/images/pdf/CCPS-Guildelines-for-Use-of-Glass-In-Buildings.pdf","http://www.dowell.com.au/technicalbrochure/pdf/02457_DowellTechBro_17-19.pdf","http://www.pilkington.com/resources/brimpactsafetypdf.pdf","http://nswgga.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Australian-Standards-for-Glass-in-Buildings.pdf","http://www.aisglass.com/wind_loads/ais-59.pdf"],"categories":["Glass architecture","Sustainable building"],"headings":["Green architecture and glass","Double glazed glass","Solar control glass","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Green_design","Glass","Green_building","Green_architecture","Insulated_glazing","Fenestration"]}
