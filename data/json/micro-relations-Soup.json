Hot soups are additionally characterized\nby boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are\nextracted, forming a broth.\n\nTraditionally, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick\nsoups. The established French classifications of clear soups are [[bouillon\n(broth)|bouillon]] and [[consommÃ©]]. Thick soups are classified depending upon\nthe type of thickening agent used: [[purÃ©e]]s are vegetable soups thickened with\nstarch; [[Bisque (food)|bisque]]s are made from purÃ©ed shellfish or vegetables\nthickened with [[cream]]; cream soups may be thickened with bÃ©chamel sauce; and\n[[veloutÃ© sauce|veloutÃ©s]] are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other\ningredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include rice, lentils,\nflour, and grains; many popular soups also include carrots and potatoes.\n\nSoups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear\ndistinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid than\nstews. {{cite web\n  | url =
