      "text" : "\n fitting from the Staffordshire hoard, which was declared to be treasure in\n September 2009]]\n\n\n'Treasure trove' is an amount of money or coin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion\nfound hidden underground or in places such as cellars or attics, where the\ntreasure seems old enough for it to be presumed that the true owner is dead and\nthe heirs undiscoverable. The legal definition of what constitutes treasure\ntrove and its treatment under law vary considerably from country to country, and\nfrom era to era.\n\nThe term is also often used metaphorically. Collections of articles published as\na book are often titled Treasure Trove, as in A Treasure Trove of Science. This\nwas especially fashionable for titles of children's books in the early- and mid-\n20th century.\n",
