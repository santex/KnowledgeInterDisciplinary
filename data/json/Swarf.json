{"cursor":"10691","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Swarf', also known as 'turnings', 'chips', or 'filings', are shavings and\nchippings of metal â the debris or waste resulting from metalworking operations\nincluding milling and grinding. It can usually be recycled, and this is the\npreferred method of disposal due to the environmental concerns regarding\npotential contamination with cutting fluid or tramp oil. The ideal way to remove\nthese liquids is by the use of a centrifuge which will separate the fluids from\nthe metal, allowing both to be reclaimed and prepared for further treatment.\n\nThe terms \"swarf\" and \"chips\" are also used to describe the waste shavings,\nsawdust, and cuttings from woodworking operations, as well as waste in\nconstructed piping, such as welding metal or slag waste that is produced and\ntrapped within the pipe during its assembly, and sometimes in masonry. \"The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the\nchips were carted off a million years ago.\" âIshmael, in [[Moby-Dick]], by\nHerman Melville.\n\nDefinition: Swarf (in glass fabrication) (noun) Glass particles, a byproduct of\ncutting, breaking, drilling, or grinding glass in the course of glass\nfabrication. Synonyms: sludge, slag, fines, mud, crud.\n\nGeneral description: Swarf glass particles are a dusty byproduct from cutting,\nbreaking, drilling, or grinding glass in the course of glass fabrication. They\nare often transported away from the Hot Zone (where tool and work-piece meet) by\nmeans of a pressurized water spray and through a pipeline with a water flow rate\nsufficient to carry the dense Swarf particles to a Solids Removal System, which\nis intended to separate solids from Production Water. âCleanâ recycled\nProduction Water is typically recycled back to the Hot Zone reiteratively.\n\nThese dense (~2.6g/cmâ), hard (~5.5HM) particles have a high propensity to bond\nto other Swarf (cohesively) and to other things (adhesively) such as fabrication\ntools, pipes and even fabricated glass surfaces. While quite small (most\ntypically ranging from ~ 106 - 53 microns), Swarf particles are an expensive\nnuisance that affect competitive performance as they are often the root cause\nfor: â¢ Diminished tool life caused by Unintended Friction â¢ Equipment failure\nand energy waste from pipe and water port obstructions and clogging â¢ Poor\nperformance as equipment becomes compromised and out of original spec due to\nSwarf buildup â¢ Quality defects: Water Spot Etching (affects clarity and\naesthetics), shiners, etc. Optimal Particle Removal Rate of Swarf throughout the\nrecycled Production Water system is the key to good Swarf management, which also\noften includes the following: â¢ a quality solids removal system capable of\nsupporting production capacity â¢ treatment with a coolant additive that\nsufficiently disarms the propensity for Swarf particles to bond, and promotes\noptimal Particle Removal Rate to reduce water pipe obstructions, Water Spot\nEtching, Unintended Friction, etc. â¢ unobstructed pipes, nozzles, and water\nports to provide water flow sufficient to carry Swarf particles away from the\nHot Zone and to the solids removal system effectively â¢ a relevant flocculant to\nencourage particles to behave in a manner that supports the solids removal\nsystem Definitions - other terms used: Hot Zone: where the glass fabrication\ntool and the work-piece meet (in the context of cutting, breaking, drilling,\ngrinding). Primarily two types of friction heat are produced as a byproduct of\nfabricating: Intended Friction and Unintended Friction. Intended Friction:\nfriction as a result of the fabrication tool meeting the work-piece. This\nfriction type is closely calibrated by fabricator to achieve performance and\nquality. Unintended Friction: friction caused by Swarf particles or inadequate\nwater flow rate. This type of nuisance friction creates quality problems\n(âshinersâ, etc.) and diminishes tool performance and life. Production Water:\nbeing water used in the course of glass fabrication for the sake of cooling tool\nand work-piece and helping to mechanically remove swarf particles from the Hot\nZone as quickly as possible. Quality Production Water: recycled Production Water\nâcleanedâ by the Solids Removal System, now substantially free of Swarf. Solids\nRemoval System: methods of removing solids, primarily glass swarf particles in\nthis context, from Production Water. Various types exist: decanter system,\ncentrifuge, henry, filter-press, etc. Each type may possess examples that range\nfrom crude to very sophisticated, and may employ both mechanical and/or chemical\nmethods. Coolant Additive (for Production Water): a soluble or semi-soluble\nliquid or powder additive diluted in Production Water whose function is to\nencourage Particle Removal Rate superior to Production Water itself. Generally,\ncoolant additives do not provide boil protection above water itself, but are\ndesigned to cool by supporting better Particle Removal Rate. Particle Removal\nRate: the rate at which glass Swarf particles are removed from the Hot Zone (in\nthis context), which is the key function of Coolant Additive, as it helps\neliminate Unintended Friction caused by Swarf particles. Flocculant/Coagulant\nAdditives: soluble or semi-soluble liquid or powder additive diluted in\nProduction Water to promote Swarf solids removal, typically by helping particles\nto fall out of suspension (most commonly used by Solids Removal Systems) or\nbecome highly suspended (for Solids Removal Systems using a form of solids\nskimming technique). Water Spot Etching: often a serious quality defect caused\nby mineral or Swarf precipitate, from Production Water, bound to the surface of\na fabricated work-piece.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Swarf","recorded":1364127118,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Swarf_(band)","/wiki/Swarfega","/wiki/File:SwarfSamples.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/SwarfSamples.jpg/300px-SwarfSamples.jpg","/wiki/File:SwarfSamples.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Metalworking","/wiki/Recycling","/wiki/Environmentalism","/wiki/Cutting_fluid","/wiki/Tramp_oil","/wiki/Centrifuge","/wiki/Masonry","#cite_note-MelvilleChips-1","#Cutting_hazards_and_safety_precautions","#Cuts.2C_splinters.2C_punctures.2C_airborne_chips","#Chip_breaking","#Machine_cleaning_and_chip_handling","#Recycling","#Requirements","#References","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Laceration","/wiki/Brass","/wiki/Bronze","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/splinter","/wiki/Machinist","/wiki/Machinist","/wiki/Cutting_fluid","/wiki/Threading_(manufacturing)#Thread_forming_and_rolling","/wiki/Threading_(manufacturing)#Thread_cutting","/wiki/Cutting_tool_(machining)","/wiki/Safety_glasses","/wiki/Face_shield","/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Recycling","/wiki/Landfill","/wiki/Incineration","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Material_handling_equipment","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-MelvilleChips_1-0","/wiki/Moby-Dick","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swarf&oldid=540804911","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Metalworking_terminology","/wiki/Category:Machining","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Swarf&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Swarf","/wiki/Swarf","/wiki/Talk:Swarf","#","/wiki/Swarf","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Swarf","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Swarf","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&oldid=540804911","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Swarf&id=540804911","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Swarf","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Swarf&oldid=540804911&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Swarf&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B4_(%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%A9_%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9)","//az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonqar","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encenall","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kovov%C3%A1_t%C5%99%C3%ADska","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallspan","//et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laast","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viruta","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeau","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truciolo","//kk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B0%D2%A3%D2%9B%D0%B0","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi%C3%B3r_(technika)","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%B0","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%BA%D0%B0","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwi
