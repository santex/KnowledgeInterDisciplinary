{"cursor":"14516","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s in an aqueous solution.]] In cell biology, a 'vesicle' is a small bubble\nwithin a cell, and thus a type of organelle. Enclosed by lipid bilayer, vesicles\ncan form naturally, for example, during endocytosis. Alternatively, they may be\nprepared artificially, when they are called liposomes. If there is only one\nphospholipid bilayer, they are called unilamellar vesicles; otherwise they are\ncalled multilamellar. The membrane enclosing the vesicle is similar to that of\nthe plasma membrane, and vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release\ntheir contents outside of the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles\nwithin the cell.\n\nVesicles perform a variety of functions. Because it is separated from the\ncytosol, the inside of the vesicle can be made to be different from the\ncytosolic environment. For this reason, vesicles are a basic tool used by the\ncell for organizing cellular substances. Vesicles are involved in metabolism,\ntransport, buoyancy control, and enzyme storage. They can also act as\nchemical reaction chambers. image of lipid vesicles.]]\n","linknr":409,"url":"Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)","recorded":1362898642,"links":57,"instances":["biochemistry","cell_biology","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/odorizzilab/katzmann2002.pdf","http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/odorizzilab/katzmann2002.pdf"],"categories":["Organelles","Membrane biology"],"headings":["Types of vesicles","Vesicle formation and transport","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Liposome_scheme-en.svg/250px-Liposome_scheme-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Sarfus.LipidVesicles.jpg/250px-Sarfus.LipidVesicles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Hemozoin_in_food_vacuole.jpg/250px-Hemozoin_in_food_vacuole.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Animal_Cell.svg/350px-Animal_Cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["tissue","biology"],["rab","g-protein"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["suspension","chemistry"],["bleb","cell_biology"]],"members":["receptor","bleb","rab","tissue","suspension"],"related":["Aqueous","Cell_biology","Organelle","Lipid_bilayer","Endocytosis","Liposome","Phospholipid_bilayer","Plasma_membrane","Organelles","Metabolism","Enzyme","Vacuoles","Plant_cells","Osmoregulation","Plant_nutrition","Contractile_vacuole","Protists","Osmotic_pressure","Lysosome","Endocytosis","Phagocytosis","Endoplasmic_Reticulum","Golgi_Apparatus","Ribosomes","Rough_endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_Apparatus","Lysosomes","Peroxisomes","Secretory_vesicles","Synaptic_vesicle","Presynaptic_terminal","Neurons","Neurotransmitter","Axon","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Endocrine_system","Hormones","Islets_of_Langerhans","Pancreas","Tissue_(biology)","Cell_wall","Plant_cell","Protist","Fungi","Bacteria","Archaea","Extracellular_matrix","Animal_cell","Archaea","Bacteria","Plankton","Extracellular_matrix","Electron_microscopy","Biomineralisation","Bone","Cartilage","Dentin","Calcification","Apoptosis","Phosphatidylserine","Annexins","Endosome","Protein_targeting","Clathrin","COPI","COPII","Golgi_apparatus","Plasma_membrane","Endosome","Clathrin","G_protein","ADP_ribosylation_factor","SNARE","Rab_(G-protein)","Kiss-and-run_fusion","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Downregulation","Ubiquitin","Endosome","Lysosome","Lysosome","Cytosol","Suspension_(chemistry)","Plasmalemma","Tonoplast","Valinomycin","Patch_clamp","Biochemistry","Sonication","Bleb_(cell_biology)","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Golgi_apparatus","Micelle","Membrane_nanotube","Endocytosis","Synaptic_vesicle","Membrane_contact_site","Spitzenk√∂rper","DODAB"]}
