{"cursor":"4803","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, a 'suffix' (also sometimes called a 'postfix' or 'ending') is an\naffix which is placed after the stem of a word. Common examples are case\nendings, which indicate the grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and verb\nendings, which form the conjugation of verbs. Particularly in the study of\nSemitic languages, a suffix is called an 'afformative', as they can alter the\nform of the words to which they are fixed. In Indo-European studies, a\ndistinction is made between suffixes and endings (see Proto-Indo-European root).\nA word-final segment that is somewhere between a free morpheme and a bound\nmorpheme is known as a 'suffixoid' Kremer, Marion. 1997.

(e.g., English\n-like or German -freundlich 'friendly').\n\nSuffixes can carry grammatical information (inflectional suffixes) or lexical\ninformation (derivational suffixes). An inflectional suffix is sometimes called\na 'desinence'. [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/desinence The Free Online\nDictionary]\n\nSome examples in European languages:\n\n:Girl's', where the suffix -s marks the plural. :He make's', where suffix -s\nmarks the third person singular present tense. :It clos'ed', where the suffix\n-ed marks the past tense. :De beau'x' jours, where the suffix -x marks the\nplural. :Elle est passablement joli'e', where the suffix -e marks the feminine\nform of the adjective.\n\nMany synthetic languagesâCzech, German, Finnish, Latin, Hungarian, Russian,\nTurkish, etc.âuse a large number of endings.\n\nSuffixes used in English frequently have Greek, French, or Latin origins.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Suffix","recorded":1362684695,"links":65,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linguistic morphology","Lexical units","Suffixes|","English morphemes"],"headings":["Inflectional suffixes","Derivational suffixes","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stem","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["derivation","linguistics"],["marker","linguistics"]],"members":["marker","derivation","stem","root"],"related":["Linguistics","Affix","Stem_(linguistics)","Grammatical_case","Grammatical_conjugation","Semitic_languages","Indo-European_studies","Proto-Indo-European_root","Inflection","Derivation_(linguistics)","Plural","Grammatical_person","Grammatical_number","Present_tense","Past_tense","Plural","Feminine","Synthetic_language","Czech_language","German_language","Finnish_language","Latin","Hungarian_language","Russian_language","Turkish_language","Greek_language","French_language","Latin","Syntactic_category","Root_(linguistics)","Progressive_aspect","Past_participle","Comparative","Superlative","Adjective","Adverb","Affix","Inflection","Derivation_(linguistics)","Lexeme","Marker_(linguistics)","Morpheme","Pejorative_suffix","Prefix","Prefix_morpheme"]}
