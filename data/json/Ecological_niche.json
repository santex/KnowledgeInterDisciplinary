{"cursor":"9911","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s create ecological niches with their unusual environment]]\n\nIn ecology, a 'niche' ( CanE , or ) is a\nterm describing the way of life of a species. Each species is thought to have a\nseparate, unique niche. The ecological niche describes how an organism or\npopulation responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (e.g., by\ngrowing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens\nare scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (e.g., limiting access\nto resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a\nconsumer of prey).\n\nThe majority of species exist in a standard ecological niche. A premier example\nof a non-standard niche filling species is the flightless, ground-dwelling kiwi\nbird of New Zealand, which exists on worms, and other ground creatures, and\nlives its life in a mammal niche. Island biogeography can help explain island\nspecies and associated unfilled niches.\n","linknr":614,"url":"Ecological_niche","recorded":1362483474,"links":72,"instances":["biology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Hutchinson1957.pdf","http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Hutchinson1957.pdf"],"categories":["Ecology","Habitat (ecology) terminology","Landscape ecology"],"headings":["Grinnellian niche","Eltonian niche","Hutchinsonian niche","Parameters","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg/220px-Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/20120623_Sqwiki_the_Squirrel_at_Wiknic.JPG/220px-20120623_Sqwiki_the_Squirrel_at_Wiknic.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Biology_organism_collage.png/100px-Biology_organism_collage.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["habitat","ecology"],["resource","biology"]],"members":["resource","habitat"],"related":["Ecology","Canadian_English","Kiwi","Island_biogeography","Middle_French","Joseph_Grinnell","California_Thrasher","Chaparral","Greater_Antilles","Convergent_evolution","Adaptive_radiation","Ecomorph","Charles_Sutherland_Elton","United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","Ecologist","Badger","Public_park","G._Evelyn_Hutchinson","Adaptation","Realized_niche_width","Paleontologist","George_Gaylord_Simpson","Vacant_niches","Equus_ferus_ferus","Konik","Non-indigenous_species","Habitat","Invasive_species","Environmental_niche_modelling","Biological_life_cycle","Habitat_(ecology)","Food_chain","Competitive_exclusion_principle","Realized_niche_width","Fitness_landscape","Niche_differentiation","Overpopulation_in_wild_animals","Resource_(biology)","Unified_neutral_theory_of_biodiversity"]}
