{"cursor":"25137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n bacteria under magnification]] 'Sanitation' is the hygienic means of promoting\n health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes as well\n as the treatment and proper disposal of sewage wastewater. Hazards can be\n either physical, microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease.\n Wastes that can cause health problems include human and animal feces, solid\n wastes, domestic wastewater (sewage, sullage, greywater), industrial wastes and\n agricultural wastes. Hygienic means of prevention can be by using engineering\n solutions (e.g. sewerage and wastewater treatment), simple technologies (e.g.\n latrines, septic tanks), or even by personal hygiene practices (e.g. simple\n handwashing with soap).\n\nThe World Health Organization states that:\n\n\nThe term \"sanitation\" is applied to a wide range of subjects such as: *Improved\nsanitation - refers to the management of human faeces at the household level.\nThis terminology is the indicator used to describe the target of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goal on sanitation, by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for\nWater Supply and Sanitation. *On-site sanitation - the collection and treatment\nof waste is done where it is deposited. Examples are the use of pit latrines,\nseptic tanks, and Imhoff tanks. *Food sanitation - refers to the hygienic\nmeasures for ensuring food safety. *Environmental sanitation - the control of\nenvironmental factors that form links in disease transmission. Subsets of this\ncategory are solid waste management, water and wastewater treatment, industrial\nwaste treatment and noise and pollution control. *Ecological sanitation - an\napproach that tries to emulate nature through the recycling of nutrients and\nwater from human and animal wastes in a hygienically safe manner.\n","linknr":503,"url":"Sanitation","recorded":1362372038,"links":45,"instances":["plumbing","medicine","waste"],"pdf":["http://www.pacinst.org/reports/water_related_deaths/water_related_deaths_report.pdf","http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp2008.pdf","http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/regulations/pdf/food-e.pdf","http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/market/regulations/pdf/food-e.pdf","http://www.ids.ac.uk/download.cfm?file=IF10.pdf","http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/06sept20031800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/pdf/29cfr1910.141.pdf","http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/06sept20031800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/pdf/29cfr1910.141.pdf"],"categories":["Sanitation|","Hygiene","Public
