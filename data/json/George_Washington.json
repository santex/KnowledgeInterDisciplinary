The provisions of the British Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, implemented\nin 1752, altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar\nwith the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes\nresulted in dates being moved forward 11 days, and for those between January 1\nand March 25, an advance of one year. For a further explanation, see: Old Style\nand New Style dates.  â , 1799) was\none of the Founding Fathers of the United States, serving as the commander-in-\nchief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He also\npresided over the convention that drafted the Constitution, which replaced the\nArticles of Confederation. The Constitution established the position of\nPresident of the republic, which Washington was the first to hold.\n\nWashington was elected President as the unanimous choice of the 69 electors in\n1788, and he served two terms in office. He oversaw the creation of a strong,\nwell-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the wars raging\nin Europe, suppressed rebellion, and won acceptance among Americans of all\ntypes. His leadership style established many forms and rituals of government\nthat have been used since, such as using a cabinet system and delivering an\ninaugural address. Further, the peaceful transition from his presidency to the\npresidency of John Adams established a tradition that continues into the 21st\ncentury. Historically, Washington has been widely regarded as the \"father of his\ncountry\". Cornwell, Rupert (January 17, 2009). [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/presidents/george-washington-the-father-of-\nthe-nation-1391109.html \"George Washington: The father of the nation\"]. [[The\nIndependent]]. Retrieved 2012-07-23.\n\nWashington was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia; his wealthy\nplanter family owned tobacco plantations and slaves. After both his father and\nolder brother died when he was young, Washington became personally and\nprofessionally attached to the powerful William Fairfax, who promoted his career\nas a surveyor and soldier. Washington quickly became a senior officer in the\ncolonial forces during the first stages of the French and Indian War. Chosen by\nthe Second Continental Congress in 1775 to be commander-in-chief of the\nContinental Army in the American Revolution, Washington managed to force the\nBritish out of Boston in 1776, but was defeated and almost captured later that\nyear when he lost New York City. After crossing the Delaware River in the dead\nof winter, he defeated the British in two battles, retook New Jersey and\nrestored momentum to the Patriot cause.\n\nBecause of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured two major British armies\nat Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for his\nselection and supervision of his generals, encouragement of morale and ability\nto hold together the army, coordination with the state governors and state\nmilitia units, relations with Congress and attention to supplies, logistics, and\ntraining. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British\ngenerals with larger armies. After victory had been finalized in 1783,\nWashington resigned as Commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his\nopposition to dictatorship and his commitment to American republicanism.\n\nDissatisfied with the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, in 1787\nWashington presided over the Constitutional Convention that drafted the United\nStates Constitution. Elected unanimously as the first President of the United\nStates in 1789, he attempted to bring rival factions together to unify the\nnation. He supported Alexander Hamilton's programs to pay off all state and\nnational debt, to implement an effective tax system and to create a national\nbank (despite opposition from Thomas Jefferson).\n\nWashington proclaimed the United States neutral in the wars raging in Europe\nafter 1793. He avoided war with Great Britain and guaranteed a decade of peace\nand profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense\nopposition from the Jeffersonians. Although never officially joining the\nFederalist Party, he supported its programs. Washington's \"Farewell Address\" was\nan influential primer on republican virtue and a warning against partisanship,\nsectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars. He retired from the presidency in\n1797 and returned to his home, Mount Vernon, and his domestic life where he\nmanaged a variety of enterprises. He freed all his slaves by his final will.\n\nWashington had a vision of a great and powerful nation that would be built on\nrepublican lines using federal power. He sought to use the national government\nto preserve liberty, improve infrastructure, open the western lands, promote\ncommerce, found a permanent capital, reduce regional tensions and promote a\nspirit of American nationalism. At his death, Washington was hailed\nas \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his\ncountrymen\".\n\nThe Federalists made him the symbol of their party but for many years, the\nJeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the\nWashington Monument. As the leader of the first successful revolution against a\ncolonial empire in world history, Washington became an international icon for\nliberation and nationalism, especially in France and Latin America.\nHe is consistently ranked among the top three presidents of the United States,\naccording to polls of both scholars and the general public.\n","linknr":2302,"url":"George_Washington","recorded":1362565145,"links":226,"instances":["british_coin","united_states_coin","circulatory","united_states","united_states","politician","plantation","soldiers","artist","sculptor","ecclesiastical","chef","new_york","united_states","painter","new_york","valet","painter","state","new_style_act_1750","houdon","united_states","1783","physicist","armed_forces","financier"],"pdf":["http://www.mountvernon.org/sites/mountvernon.org/files/Dpogue.pdf","http://www.mountvernon.org/sites/mountvernon.org/files/Dpogue.pdf","http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedfiles/historic/haq/haqspringsummer03.pdf","http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedfiles/historic/haq/haqspringsummer03.pdf","http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/George%20Washington-God's%20Man%20for%20America-article.pdf","http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/George%20Washington-God's%20Man%20for%20America-article.pdf","http://www.mountvernon.org/sites/mountvernon.org/files/Breen-White%20Distillery.pdf","http://www.mountvernon.org/sites/mountvernon.org/files/Breen-White%20Distillery.pdf","http://www.aw22.org/documents/Anecdote5_Washington.pdf","http://www.aw22.org/documents/Anecdote5_Washington.pdf"],"categories":["1732
