MODY is\noften referred to as \"'monogenic diabetes'\" to distinguish it from the more\ncommon types of diabetes (especially type 1 and type 2), which involve more\ncomplex combinations of causes involving multiple genes (i.e., \"polygenic\") and\nenvironmental factors. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms. \"Maturity\nonset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare autosomal dominant form of type 2\nDM affecting young people with a positive family history.\" This page has\npreviosuly claimed that MODY is equivalent to type 1 DM, however the Oxford\nHandbook of Clinical Medicine states the above. MODY should not be\nconfused with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) — a form of type\n1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.\n","linknr":698,"url":"Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_young","recorded":1362482120,"links":21,"instances":["nutrition","diabetes"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diabetes"],"headings":["History of the concept and treatment of MODY","Signs, symptoms and differential diagnosis","Pathophysiology","Genetics","Management","Incidence","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["honeymoon_period","diabetes"],["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["diet","honeymoon_period"],"related":["Genetic_disorder","Diabetes_mellitus","I.e.","Insulin","Type_1_diabetes_mellitus","Type_2_diabetes_mellitus","Oxford_Handbook_of_Clinical_Medicine","Hyperglycemia","Diabetic_ketosis","Diabetic_ketoacidosis","Mitochondrial_diabetes","Mutant_insulin","Sulfonylurea","Elliott_P._Joslin","Tolbutamide","Hyperglycemia","Medical_screening","Glucose_tolerance_test","Pregnancy","Gestational_diabetes","Oral_hypoglycemic_agent","Sulfonylurea","Autoimmunity","Thyroiditis","Honeymoon_period_(diabetes)","Metabolic_syndrome","Hypertension","Hyperlipidemia","Polycystic_ovary_syndrome","Insulin_resistance","Kidney","Neonatal_diabetes","Type_1_diabetes_mellitus","Gene","Pancreas","Beta_cell","Mutation","Transcription_factor","Gene","Glucokinase","Amino_acid","Autosomal_dominant","Penetrance","OMIM","MODY_1","HNF4A","MODY_2","Glucokinase","Glucose","MODY_3","HNF1A","Homeobox","Sulfonylurea","MODY_4","IPF1","Homeobox","Homozygote","Heterozygote","MODY_5","Kidney","HNF1B","MODY_6","Neurogenic_differentiation_1","MODY_7","KLF11","OMIM","MODY_8","Bile_salt_dependent_lipase","OMIM","MODY_9","PAX4","MODY_10","Insulin","MODY_11","BLK","Permanent_neonatal_diabetes_mellitus","KCNJ11","ABCC8","Neonatal_diabetes","ABCC8","KCNJ11","Sulfonylurea","Transient_neonatal_diabetes_mellitus","ABCC8","Sulfonylurea","Neonatal_diabetes_mellitus","Pancreatic_agenesis","Microvascular_complications_of_diabetes","Diet_(nutrition)","Exercise","Oral_hypoglycemic_agent","Insulin_resistance","Metformin","Thiazolidinedione"]}
