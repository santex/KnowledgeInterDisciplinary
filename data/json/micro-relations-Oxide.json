Metal oxides typically contain an anion of oxygen in the\noxidation state of â2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the\nresult of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon\ncombustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon\ndioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating.\nFor example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of Al 2O 3\n(called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion.

ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.\nDifferent oxides of the same element are distinguished by Roman numerals\ndenoting their oxidation number, e.g. iron(II) oxide versus iron(III) oxide.\n","linknr":733,"url":"Oxide","recorded":1362581543,"links":73,"instances":["masonry","chemistry","fuel","chemistry","molecule"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxides|*","Anions"],"headings":["Formation","Structure","Reactivity","Nomenclature
