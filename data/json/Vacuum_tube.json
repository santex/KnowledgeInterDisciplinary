{"cursor":"99357","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn electronics, a 'vacuum tube', 'electron tube' (in North America),\n'[[Thermionic emission|thermionic]] valve', 'tube', or 'valve' is a device\ncontrolling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container. The\ncontainer is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shape. The\nsimplest vacuum tube, the diode, is essentially an incandescent light bulb with\nan extra electrode inside. When the bulb's filament is heated white-hot,\nelectrons are boiled off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulb. If the\nextra electrode (also called a \"plate\" or \"anode\") is made more positive than\nthe hot filament, a direct current flows through the vacuum to the anode (a\ndemonstration of the Edison effect). As the current only flows in one direction,\nit makes it possible to convert from alternating current applied to the filament\nto direct current.\n\nThe introduction of a third electrode, a grid between the filament and the\nplate, also yields another function. If a signal is applied to the grid, it\nmodulates the current flowing from the filament to the plate. Thus,\nit allows the device to act as an electronic amplifier.\n\nVacuum tubes are thus used for rectification, amplification, switching, or\nsimilar processing or creation of electrical signals.\n\nThe vast majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a\nvacuum inside, and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a\nhot filament or hot cathode. Some exceptions to this are dealt with in the\nsection about gas-filled tubes below.\n\nVacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology, which\ndrove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting, television,\nradar, sound reinforcement, sound recording and reproduction, large telephone\nnetworks, analog and digital computers, and industrial process control. Although\nsome applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the spark\ngap transmitter or mechanical computers, it was the invention of the vacuum tube\nwith three electrodes (called a [[triode]]) and its capability of electronic\namplification that made these technologies widespread and practical.\n\nIn most applications, solid-state devices such as transistors and semiconductor\ndevices have replaced tubes. Solid-state devices last longer and are smaller,\nmore efficient, more reliable, and cheaper than tubes. Tubes can be fragile,\nsometimes generate significant unwanted heat, and can take many secondsâmany\nminutes in critical applicationsâafter powering on to warm to a temperature\nwhere they perform within operational tolerance. However, tubes still find uses\nwhere solid-state devices have not been developed, are impractical, or where a\ntube has superior performance, as with some devices in professional audio and\nhigh-power radio transmitters. Tubes are still produced for such applications.\n\nTubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the\nelectromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions Broad,\nWilliam J. \"Nuclear Pulse (I): Awakening to the Chaos Factor\", Science. 29 May\n1981 212: 1009â1012 and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar\nflares.
