{"cursor":"2921","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'research proposal' is a document written by a researcher that provides a\ndetailed description of the proposed program. It is like an outline of the\nentire research process that gives a reader a summary of the information\ndiscussed in a project.\n\nResearch proposals are written for various reasons, such as budget request for\nthe research they describe, certification requirements for research (as from an\ninstitutional review board committee if the experiment is to be done on human\nbeings or animals protected by animal rights laws), as a task in tertiary\neducation (e.g., before performing research for a dissertation), or as a\ncondition for employment at a research institution (which usually requires sponsor-\napproved research proposals).\n\nThe 'phrasing of research proposals' has many similarities to that of scientific\narticles. Research proposals are written in future tense and have different\npoints of emphasis. Like scientific articles, research proposals have sections\ndescribing the research background, significance, methods, and references. The\nmethod section of research proposals is far more detailed than those of\nscientific articles, allowing profound understanding of the price and risks of\nthe study and the plans for reducing them. Instead of a section describing the\nresults, research proposals have a section describing the hypotheses or the\nexpected results. A typical research proposal includes an extensive but focused\nliterature review. A research proposal may also include preliminary results.\n\nIn contrast to scientific articles, research proposals usually contain the\ncurriculum vitaes of the researchers. The curriculum vitaes are required for\nproving that the personnel asking to conduct the research are capable of doing\nso. For example, a research proposal for a study including injections would be\nexpected to name at least one researcher qualified to inject human beings.\nSimilarly, a research proposal in biology is not likely to receive funding\nwhen the entire staff consists of mathematicians only. In some academic\ninstitutes, a detailed resume of the thesis mentor is required on the research\nproposal in order to show that the mentor can help the student with the\nsubject of the thesis.\n\nResearch sponsors publish calls for research proposals, specifying the topics\ninto which they fund research and their detailed format requirements. Those\nsponsors may be governmental, nonprofit or business research foundations.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Research_proposal","recorded":1363187225,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Human_beings","/wiki/Animal","/wiki/Animal_rights","/wiki/Tertiary_education","/wiki/Dissertation","/wiki/Employment","/wiki/Sponsor_(commercial)","/wiki/Scientific_articles","/wiki/Research_methods","/wiki/References","/wiki/Literature_review","/wiki/Curriculum_vitae","/wiki/Injection_(medicine)","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Nonprofit","/wiki/Business","/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit_organization)","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=edit&section=1","http://www2.smumn.edu/deptpages/~tcwritingcenter/Forms_of_Writing/ResearchProposal.htm","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&oldid=543597179","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Research","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Research+proposal&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Research+proposal","/wiki/Research_proposal","/wiki/Talk:Research_proposal","#","/wiki/Research_proposal","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Research_proposal","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Research_proposal","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&oldid=543597179","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Research_proposal&id=543597179","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Research+proposal","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Research+proposal&oldid=543597179&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Research_proposal&printable=yes","//cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynnig_ymchwil","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expos%C3%A9_(Wissenschaft)","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%A2%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%A8","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Research
