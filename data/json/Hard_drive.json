An HDD retains its data\neven when powered off. Data is read in a random-access manner, meaning\nindividual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than\njust sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid (\"hard\") rapidly\nrotating discs (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm\nto read and write data to the surfaces.\n\nIntroduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs became the dominant\nsecondary storage device for general purpose computers by the early 1960s.\nContinuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of\nservers and PCs. More than 200 companies have produced HDD units, though most\ncurrent units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital.\nWorldwide revenues for HDDs shipments are expected to reach $38 billion in 2012,\nup about 19% from $32 billion in 2011.\n\n The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance.\nCapacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of : a 1-\nterabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of gigabytes (GB; where 1 gigabyte = bytes).\nTypically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user due to use by\nthe file system and the computer operating system, and possibly inbuilt\nredundancy for error correction and recovery. Performance is specified by the\ntime to move the heads to a file (average access time) plus the time it takes\nfor the file to move under its head (average latency, a function of the\nphysical rotational speed in revolutions per minute) and the speed at which the\nfile is transmitted (data rate).\n\nThe two most common s for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch in desktop computers and 2.5-\ninch in laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such\nas SATA (Serial ATA), USB or SAS (Serial attached SCSI) cables.\n\n, the primary competing technology for secondary storage is flash memory in the\nform of solid-state drives (SSDs). HDDs are expected to remain the dominant\nmedium for secondary storage due to predicted continuing advantages in recording\ncapacity and price per unit of storage, {{cite web\n | url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/08/02/no-solid-state-drives-are-\n | not-going-to-kill-off-hard-drives/ title = No, Solid-State Drives Are Not\n | Going To Kill Off Hard Drives date = August 2, 2012 publisher = Forbes.com\n | accessdate = November 17, 2012\n}} {{cite web\n | url = http://thessdguy.com/for-the-lack-of-a-fab/#more-538 title = For the\n | Lack of a Fab... last = Handy first = James date = July 31, 2012 publisher =\n | Objective Analysis accessdate = November 25, 2012\n}} but solid state drives are replacing rotating hard drives especially in\nportable electronics where speed, physical size, and durability are more\nimportant considerations than price and capacity.
