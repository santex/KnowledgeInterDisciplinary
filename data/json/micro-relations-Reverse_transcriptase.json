RT is\nneeded for the replication of retroviruses (e.g. HIV), and RT inhibitors are\nwidely used as antiretroviral drugs. RT activity is also associated with the\nreplication of chromosome ends (telomerase) and some mobile genetic elements\n(retrotransposons).\n\nRetroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities-- (a) RNA-dependent\nDNA polymerase, (b) ribonuclease H, and (c) DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. These\nactivities are used by the retrovirus to convert single-stranded genomic RNA\ninto double-stranded cDNA which can integrate into the host genome, potentially\ngenerating a long-term infection that can be very difficult to eradicate. The\nsame sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to\nDNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR), or genome analysis.\n\nWell studied reverse transcriptases include:\n* HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ()\n* M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus\n* AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus\n* Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic\n  chromosomes\n","linknr":641,"url":"Reverse_transcriptase","recorded":1362374410,"links":57,"instances":["molecular_biology","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://www.promega.com/pnotes/71/7807_22/7807_22_core.pdf"],"categories":["Genetics","EC 2.7.7","Molecular biology","Viral enzymes","Telomeres"],"headings":["History","Function in viruses","In eukaryotes","In prokaryotes","Structure","Replication fidelity","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Reverse_Transcriptase_1HMV.png/220px-Reverse_Transcriptase_1HMV.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Reverse_transcription.svg/300px-Reverse_transcription.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Zidovudine.svg/200px-Zidovudine.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["primer","molecular_biology#primer_removal"],["primer","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["proofreading","biology"]],"members":["primer","proofreading","sense"],"related":["HIV","Enzyme","Complementary_DNA","RNA","Retrovirus","HIV","Management_of_HIV/AIDS","Telomerase","Retrotransposons","RNase_H","Molecular_cloning","RNA_sequencing","Polymerase_chain_reaction","DNA_microarray","HIV","Murine_leukemia_virus","Alpharetrovirus","Telomerase","Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase","Telomere","Eukaryotic","Chromosomes","Howard_Temin","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison","Rous_sarcoma_virus","David_Baltimore","MIT","Murine_leukemia_virus","Rous_sarcoma_virus","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Renato_Dulbecco","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Howard_Temin","David_Baltimore","Enzyme","Reverse-transcribing_virus","RNA_virus","Retrovirus","Genome","DNA_virus","Hepadnavirus","DNA_polymerase_δ","Resistance_to_antiviral_drugs","Retroviruses","SsRNA-RT","Positive_sense","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","HIV","HTLV","Cytosol","TRNA","Complementary_DNA","RNAse_H","Integrase","Primer_(molecular_biology)","Nucleotides","DNA_polymerase","Ribonuclease","DNA-dependent_DNA_polymerase","Sense_(molecular_biology)","Eukaryotic","Retrotransposon","Telomerase","RNA","DNA_replication","Retron_msr_RNA","Multicopy_single-stranded_DNA","DNA_polymerase","RNase_H","DNA_polymerase","Proofreading_(biology)","Mutation","Promega","Transcript_fusion","Exon_shuffling","Antisense","HIV","HIV","Reverse_transcriptase_inhibitor","Zidovudine","Lamivudine","Tenofovir","Nevirapine","Polymerase_chain_reaction","RNA","Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction","Polymerase_chain_reaction","DNA","Polymerase_chain_reaction","CDNA_library","MRNA","Enzymes","Insulin","Intron","CDNA_library","DNA_polymerase","MsDNA","Reverse_transcribing_virus","RNA_polymerase","Telomerase","Retrotransposon_marker"]}
