{"cursor":"1844","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ]]\n\n\n\nIn image editing, a 'curve' is a remapping of image tonality, specified as a\nfunction from input level to output level, used as a way to emphasize colours or\nother elements in a picture. [http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-curves.html\nThe gimp manual] [http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/photoshop/article-\ns/phscs2at_learncurves_02.html Adobe web site on curves in Photoshop]\n\nCurves can usually be applied to all channels together in an image, or to each\nchannel individually.\n\nApplying a curve to all channels typically changes the brightness in part of the\nspectrum. The software user may for example make light parts of a picture\nlighter and dark parts darker to increase contrast.\n\nApplying a curve to individual channels can be used to stress a colour. This is\nparticularly efficient in the Lab colour space due to the separation of\nluminance and chromaticity, but it can also be used in RGB, CMYK or\nwhatever other colour models the software supports.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Curve_(tonality)","recorded":1362552580,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ledet.com/margulis/Makeready/MA21-Defanging.pdf"],"categories":["Digital photography","Image processing"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Curves_none_applied.png/300px-Curves_none_applied.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Curves_red_applied.png/300px-Curves_red_applied.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Image_editing","Lab_color_space","Luminance","Chromaticity","RGB_color_model","CMYK_color_model","Color_model","Blend_modes","Hurterâ€“Driffield_curve","Tone_reproduction_curve","Dan_Margulis"]}
