In popular usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as\n\"'shells'\". Examples of exoskeleton animals include insects such as grasshoppers\nand cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of the\nvarious groups of shelled mollusks, including those of snails, clams, tusk\nshells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons.\n\nMineralized exoskeletons first appeared in the fossil record about , and their\nevolution is considered by some to have played a role in the subsequent Cambrian\nexplosion of animals.\n\nSome animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an\nexoskeleton.\n","linknr":385,"url":"Exoskeleton","recorded":1362557208,"links":56,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://www.cosmonova.org/download/18.4e32c81078a8d9249800021554/Bengtson2004ESF.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/63/1/53.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/63/1/53.pdf","http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Publications/Verdun.pdf","http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Publications/Verdun.pdf"],"categories":["Animal anatomy","Biomechanics","Skeletal system"],"headings":["Role of the exoskeleton","Diversity","Growth in an exoskeleton","Paleontological significance","Evolution","Artificial \"exoskeletons\"","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Dragonfly-nymph-exoskeleton.jpg/220px-Dragonfly-nymph-exoskeleton.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/BoredEncrustedShell.JPG/280px-BoredEncrustedShell.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nymph","biology"],["test","biology"],["horn","anatomy"],["mineralization","biology"]],"members":["mineralization","test","nymph","horn"],"related":["Nymph_(biology)","Skeleton","Endoskeleton","Human_skeleton","Insect","Grasshopper","Cockroach","Crustacean","Crab","Lobster","Mollusc_shell","Snail","Clam","Tusk_shell","Chiton","Nautilus","Fossil_record","Cambrian_explosion","Tortoise","Chitin","Muscle","Chitin","Tendon","Locust","Ostracoderm","Turtle","Chitin","Arthropod","Insect","Arachnid","Spider","Crustacean","Crab","Lobster","Arthropod_exoskeleton","Fungus","Bacteria","Mollusca","Mollusc_shell","Brachiopod","Polychaete","Silicon_dioxide","Diatom","Radiolarian","Foraminifera","Echinoderm","Test_(biology)","Calcification","Armadillo","Pangolin","Ankylosauria","Scute","Horn_(anatomy)","Snail","Bivalve","Mollusca","Arthropod","Ecdysis","Azadirachtin","Hard_clam","Lagerstätte","Burgess_Shale","Keratin","Mineralization_(biology)","Phylum","Ediacaran","Ediacara_biota","Cambrian","Calcium_phosphate","Calcite","Aragonite","Small_shelly_fauna","Bryozoa","Ordovician","Protein","Polysaccharide","Composite_material","Metastability","Aragonite","Gastropod","Hydrothermal_vent","Pyrite","Greigite","Animal","Human","Armor","Powered_exoskeleton","Orthotics","Orthotics","Orthotist","Prosthesis","Cosmesis","Prosthetist","Hermit_crab","St._Martin_Island_Light","Monocoque","Car","Aeroplane","Mechatronics","Powered_exoskeleton","Spiracle","Hydrostatic_skeleton","Endoskeleton"]}
