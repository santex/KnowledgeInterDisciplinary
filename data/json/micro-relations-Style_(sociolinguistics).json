In this context, social meanings can include group membership,\npersonal attributes, or beliefs. Linguistic variation is at the heart of the\nconcept of linguistic styleâwithout variation there is no basis for\ndistinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur syntactically, lexically,\nand phonologically.\n\nMany approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of\nindexicality, indexical order, stance-taking, and linguistic ideology. Note that\na style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use\ndifferent styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate\nelements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or\nsubconsciously, thereby creating a new style.\n","linknr":268,"url":"Style_(sociolinguistics)","recorded":1362480883,"links":15,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","social_science"],"pdf":["http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/notes/emotion/Bucholtz_2009_reading_notes_Schnoebelen.pdf"],"categories":["Sociolinguistics","Linguistics","Style"],"headings":["Origins","Modern approaches to style","Emergence of new styles","Style-shifting","Style matching","Case studies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Stances.png/400px-Stances.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variation","linguistics"],["interlocutor","linguistics"],["variation","linguistics"],["feature","linguistics"],["identity","social_science"],["variation","linguistics"]],"members":["feature","interlocutor","variation","identity"],"related":["Sociolinguistics","Social","Variation_(linguistics)","Syntax","Lexicon","Phonology","Indexicality","Language_ideology","William_Labov","Penelope_Eckert","Michael_Silverstein","Indexicality","Ideology","Ideology","Mary_Bucholtz","Mexican_people","Indexicality","Performativity","Interlocutor_(linguistics)","Palo_Alto_High_School","Preppy","Conformity","Social_identity_theory","Negative_concord","Northern_Cities_Shift","IPA","Indexicality","Variation_(linguistics)","Feature_(linguistics)","Identity_(social_science)","Indexicality","Variation_(linguistics)","Sociolinguistics"]}
