{"cursor":"4736","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Garry Allighan' (16 February 1895 – 1977) was a British journalist and\nLabour Party Member of Parliament (MP). His birth name was Ernest Alligan. He\nadded the 'h' into his surname because he believed that it would make it seem\nmore Irish (even though 'Alligan' is the original Irish spelling and he himself\nwas of Irish descent).\n\nA former writer for the [[Daily Mirror]], at the 1945 general election he was\nelected to Parliament for the constituency of Gravesend in Kent. In 1947 he\nwrote an article in the World's Press News alleging that members of parliament\ngave information to the newspapers about private parliamentary party meetings,\noften in return for money, publicity or free drinks. The allegation, which was\nconsidered a grave infringement of parliamentary privilege, was investigated by\nthe Committee of Privileges, who decided there was no evidence to support them.\nThe only exception was the case of Mr Allighan himself and another Labour\nmember, who were found to have sold such information to the London [[Evening\nStandard]].\n\nThe other member, Evelyn Walkden, admitted the offence and since he had paid\ntaxes on the money, was permitted to remain as an MP. Allighan was charged with\n'aggravated contempt and gross breach of privilege' and expelled from the House\nof Commons on 30 October 1947. In the debate the Leader of the House, Herbert\nMorrison, proposed six months' suspension but it was argued that this would\ndeprive his constituents of representation for too long a period. It was also\npointed out that after expulsion he was free to seek re-election if he believed\nhe had been treated unfairly and, if returned, could resume his seat, though he\nchose not to do this and immediately resigned from the Labour party. He appears\nto have been the only MP since Charles Bradlaugh in the 19th century to have\nbeen expelled from the Commons other than for a serious criminal offence or\nbankruptcy.\n\nAt the resulting Gravesend by-election, Richard Acland held the seat for Labour,\nwith a reduced majority.\n\nAfter the affair, he moved to South Africa, where he became principal of the\nPremier School of Journalism in Johannesburg. He wrote a number of well-received\nbooks on the politics of South Africa and Rhodesia. In 1961 he published the\ncontroversial Four Bonnets to Golgotha, a book about four members of the Booth\nfamily: Catherine, Florence, Evangeline Booth and Catherine Bramwell-Booth.\n\nHe died in Johannesburg in 1977.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Garry_Allighan","recorded":1375075262,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Journalist","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Daily_Mirror","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Gravesend_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Parliamentary_privilege","/wiki/Evening_Standard","/wiki/Evelyn_Walkden","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Herbert_Morrison","/wiki/Charles_Bradlaugh","/wiki/Gravesend_by-election,_1947","/wiki/Richard_Acland","/wiki/South_Africa","/wiki/Johannesburg","/wiki/Rhodesia","/wiki/Catherine_Booth","/wiki/Florence_Booth","/wiki/Evangeline_Booth","/wiki/Catherine_Bramwell-Booth","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/John_Reith","/wiki/Hendrik_Frensch_Verwoerd","/wiki/Roy_Welensky","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit&section=2","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","http://copac.ac.uk/","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit&section=3","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-garry-allighan","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Irving_James_Albery","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Gravesend_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945","/wiki/Gravesend_by-election,_1947","/wiki/Richard_Acland","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/29133047","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Bigben_small.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Bigben_small.png/25px-Bigben_small.png","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Labour-UK-MP-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&oldid=558121138","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1895_births","/wiki/Category:1977_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_MPs","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1945%E2%80%931950","/wiki/Category:Labour_MP_(UK)_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-MP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Garry+Allighan&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Garry+Allighan","/wiki/Garry_Allighan","/wiki/Talk:Garry_Allighan","#","/wiki/Garry_Allighan","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Garry_Allighan&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:
