It is usually the\nfinal stage and natural objective of male sexual stimulation, and an essential\ncomponent of natural conception. In rare cases, ejaculation occurs because of\nprostatic disease. Ejaculation may also occur spontaneously during sleep (a\nnocturnal emission or \"wet dream\"). '[[Anejaculation]]' is the condition of\nbeing unable to ejaculate.
