Aristeus (\"the\n best\") was a cult title in many places: Boeotia, Arcadia, Ceos, Sicily,\n Sardinia, Thessaly, and Macedonia; consequently a set of \"travels\" was imposed,\n connecting his epiphanies in order to account for these widespread\n manifestations. Compare the \"travels\" of Hercules in the Western\n Mediterranean.\n\nIf Aristaeus was a minor figure at Athens, he was more prominent in Boeotia,\nwhere he was \"the pastoral Apollo\" An expression credited to Hesiod in\nServius' commentary on Virgil's Georgics, I.14; cf. William J. Slater, Lexicon\nto Pindar (Berlin: de Gruyter) 1969, s.v. \"\"Nomios\". When \"pastoral Apollo\"\nappears in lines of Theocritus (Idyll XXV) and Callimachus (Ode to Apollo, 47)\nthe expression blurs the effective domaines of the two figures. and was\nlinked to the founding myth of Thebes by marriage with AutonoÃ«, daughter of\nCadmus, the founder.

Thus Pindar set into a\nmythological past a prophecy of the comparatively recent founding of Cyrene (630\nBCE). When Aristaeus was born, according to what Pindar sang, Hermes took\nhim to be raised on nectar and ambrosia and be made immortal by Gaia. The Myrtle-\nnymphs taught him useful arts and mysteries, how to curdle milk for cheese, how\nto tame the Goddess's bees and keep them in hives, and how to tame the wild\noleaster and make it bear olives. Thus he became the patron god of cattle, fruit\ntrees, hunting, husbandry and bee-keeping. He also taught humanity dairy skills\n(including cheesemaking) and the use of nets and traps in hunting.\n\nWhen he was grown, he sailed from Libya to Boeotia, where he was inducted into\nfurther mysteries in the cave of Chiron the centaur. In Boeotia, he was\nmarried to AutonoÃ« and became the father of the ill-fated Actaeon, who\ninherited the family passion for hunting, to his ruin, and of Macris, who\nnursed the child Dionysus.\n\n\"Aristaios\" (\"the best\") is an epithet rather than a name\n:''For some men to call Zeus and holy Apollo.\n:Agreus and Nomios, [[Agreus]] (\"hunter\") and [[Agreus|Nomios]] (\"shepherd\")\nare sometimes given distinct identities among thePanes, sons of Pan. and\nfor others Aristaios (Pindar)\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Aristaeus","recorded":1372152254,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","symbolism","mythology","device","mythology","mythology","greece","tactic","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Greek gods","Beekeeping","Beekeepers","Animal gods","Greek mythological hero cult","Religion in ancient Boeotia","Offspring of Apollo"],"headings":["Aristaeus in Ceos","Aristaeus and the bees","\"Aristaeus'\" as a name","Notes","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["cyrene","mythology"],["thebes","greece"],["gaia","mythology"],["bee","mythology"],["net","device"],["trap","tactic"],["pan","mythology"],["serpent","symbolism"],["arethusa","mythology"],["uss_aristaeus","arb-1"]],"members":["uss_aristaeus","cyrene","serpent","pan","net","bee","gaia","thebes","trap","arethusa"],"related":["Musée_du_Louvre","Greek_mythology","Culture_hero","Useful_arts","Bee-keeping","Nonnus","Apollo","Cyrene_(mythology)","Theophany","Hercules","Boeotia","Hesiod","Servius","Georgics","Theocritus","Callimachus","Founding_myth","Thebes_(Greece)","Autonoë","Cadmus","Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art","Pindar","Centaur","Chiron","Ancient_Libya","Cyrene,_Libya","Hermes","Nectar","Ambrosia","Gaia_(mythology)","Cheese","Bee_(mythology)","Oleaster","Olive","Cattle","Fruit","Hunting","Husbandry","Bee-keeping","Dairy","Cheese","Net_(device)","Trap_(tactic)","Boeotia","Chiron","Autonoë","Actaeon","Macris","Dionysus","Epithet","Zeus","Apollo","Pan_(mythology)","Pindar","Theophrastus","Walter_Burkert","Hesiod","Ceos","Sirius","Apollonius_of_Rhodes","Chthonic","Etesian","Icarius","Etesian","Ortheia","Vale_of_Tempe","Virgil","Georgics","Eurydice","Serpent_(symbolism)","Hecate","Arethusa_(mythology)","Bugonia","Bugonia","Archon","USS_Aristaeus_(ARB-1)"]}
