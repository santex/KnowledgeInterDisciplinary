A perfect insulator does not exist, but some\nmaterials such as glass, paper and Teflon, which have high resistivity, are very\ngood electrical insulators. A much larger class of materials, even though they\nmay have lower bulk resistivity, are still good enough to insulate electrical\nwiring and cables. Examples include rubber-like polymers and most plastics. Such\nmaterials can serve as practical and safe insulators for low to moderate\nvoltages (hundreds, or even thousands, of volts).\n\nInsulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical\nconductors without allowing current through themselves. An insulating material\nused in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation.\nThe term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating\nsupports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to\nutility poles and transmission towers.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Insulator_(electrical)","recorded":1362375281,"links":77,"instances":["physics","electricity","unit","electrical","force"],"pdf":["http://www.ucp.net/pdf/Electrical%20Catalogue.pdf","http://www.ucp.net/pdf/Electrical%20Catalogue.pdf","http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/highvoltage.pdf","http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/highvoltage.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts
