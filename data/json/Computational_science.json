In practical use, it is typically the application of computer\nsimulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and\ntheoretical computer science to problems in various scientific disciplines.\n\nThe field is different from theory and laboratory experiment which are the\ntraditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach\nis to gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models\nimplemented on computers.\n\nScientists and engineers develop computer programs, application software, that\nmodel systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input\nparameters.
