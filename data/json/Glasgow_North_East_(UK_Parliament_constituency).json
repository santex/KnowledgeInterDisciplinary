It was first contested at the 2005 general election.\nIts current Member of Parliament (MP) is Willie Bain of the Labour Party, who\nhas held the position since a by-election in 2009.\n\nFrom its creation until 2009, the constituency was represented by Michael\nMartin, previously MP for Glasgow Springburn from 1979. Martin was elected\nSpeaker of the House of Commons in October 2000, but in May 2009 he announced\nthat he would be resigning as Speaker on 21 June 2009 because of his perceived\nrole in the MPs' expenses controversy. He was the first Speaker in 300 years to\nbe forced out of office by a motion of no confidence.\nHe also resigned as an MP the following day, resulting in a by-election on 12\nNovember 2009, which was won by Bain with 59% of the vote. This position was\nconsolidated after Bain was elected as the MP for Glasgow North East in the May\n2010 UK general election.\n","linknr":373,"url":"Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1375075274,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Burgh_constituency","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:GlasgowNorthEastConstituency.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/GlasgowNorthEastConstituency.svg/120px-GlasgowNorthEastConstituency.svg.png","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland","/wiki/City_of_Glasgow","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Willie_Bain","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Glasgow_Springburn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Glasgow_Maryhill_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/European_Parliament","/wiki/Scotland_(European_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Burgh_constituency","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Willie_Bain","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Glasgow_North_East_by-election,_2009","/wiki/Michael_Martin,_Baron_Martin_of_Springburn","/wiki/Glasgow_Springburn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Disclosure_of_expenses_of_British_Members_of_Parliament","#cite_note-LotBNote-1","/wiki/Glasgow_North_East_by-election,_2009","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","#Boundaries","#Constituency_profile","#Voting_Pattern","#Members_of_Parliament","#Election_results","#2010_general_election","#2009_By-election","#2005","#Notes_and_references","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Glasgow_City_council_area","/wiki/Glasgow_Springburn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Glasgow_Maryhill_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Possilpark","/wiki/Sighthill,_Glasgow","/wiki/Red_Road_(flats)","/wiki/Springburn","/wiki/Milton,_Glasgow","/wiki/Dennistoun","/wiki/Gentrification","/wiki/Robroyston","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Glasgow_Parliamentary_Constituencies","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-rayment-3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005","/wiki/Michael_Martin,_Baron_Martin_of_Springburn","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Glasgow_North_East_by-election,_2009","/wiki/Willie_Bain","/wiki/Scottish_Labour_Party","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Willie_Bain","/wiki/Scottish_National_Party","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Ruth_Davidson","/wiki/British_National_Party","/wiki/Trade_Unionist_and_Socialist_Coalition","/wiki/Scottish_Socialist_Party","/wiki/Socialist_Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Swing_(politics)","/w/index.php?title=Glasgow_North_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Glasgow_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Glasgow_North_East_by-election,_2009","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Willie_Bain","/wiki/Scottish_National_Party","/wiki/Scottish_Conservative_Party","/wiki/Ruth_Davidson","/wiki/British_National_Party","/wiki/Solidarity_(Scotland)","/wiki/Tommy_Sheridan","/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)","/wiki/Scottish_Green_Party","/wiki/Jury_Team","/wiki/John_Smeaton_(baggage_handler)","/wiki/Scottish_Socialist_Party","/wiki/List_of_Big_Brother_2008_housemates_(UK)#Michael","/wiki/Socialist_Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Independent_(politician)","/wiki/Voter_turnout","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Swing_(
