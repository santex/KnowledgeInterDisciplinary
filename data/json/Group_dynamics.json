The study of group dynamics can be useful in\nunderstanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in\nsociety, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and\npopularity of new ideas and technologies. Group dynamics are at the\ncore of understanding racism, sexism, and other forms of social prejudice and\ndiscrimination. These applications of the field are studied in psychology,\nsociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social\nwork, business, and communication studies.\n","linknr":470,"url":"Group_dynamics","recorded":1362477174,"links":52,"instances":["psychologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group processes","Sociodynamics"],"headings":["History","Key theorists","Intragroup dynamics","Intergroup dynamics","Selected academic journals","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_mcdougall","psychologist"]],"members":["william_mcdougall"],"related":["Social_group","Psychology","Sociology","Anthropology","Political_science","Epidemiology","Social_work","Communication_studies","Social_group","Wilhelm_Wundt","Ã‰mile_Durkheim","Gustave_Le_Bon","William_McDougall_(psychologist)","Social_psychology","Kurt_Lewin","Evolutionary_psychology","Adaptation","Social_psychology","Theodor_Adorno","Group_development","Interpersonal_relationships","Psychoanalysis","Wilfred_Trotter","University_College_Hospital","Ernest_Jones","Tavistock_Institute","Forming-storming-norming-performing","Prejudices","Ideology","Counterproductive_norms","Theology","Peace","Social_group","Ingroup_bias","Optimal_distinctiveness_theory","Group_conflict","Leon_Festinger","Stanley_Schachter","Ingroup","Black_sheep","Self-esteem","Self-aware","Hazing","Fraternities_and_sororities","Social_facilitation","Ingroup_bias","Asch_conformity_experiments","Milgram_Experiment","Groupthink","My_Lai_Massacre","Abu_Ghraib_prison","Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse","Columbine_High_School_massacre","Littleton,_Colorado","Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold","Social_Identity_Theory","Ingroup_favoritism","Stereotypes","Discrimination","Muzafer_Sherif","Robbers_Cave_Experiment","Realistic_conflict_theory","Social_Dominance_Theory","Self-categorization_Theory","Gordon_Allport","Common_ingroup_identity","Robbers_Cave_Experiment","Elliot_Aronson","Jigsaw_Classroom","Brown_v._Board_of_Education","Cog's_Ladder","Collaboration","Collaborative_method","Decision_downloading","Entitativity","Facilitator","Group_behaviour","Group_narcissism","Interpersonal_relationships","Maintenance_actions","Organisation_climate","Out-group_homogeneity","Small-group_communication","Social_Tuning","Team-based_learning"]}
