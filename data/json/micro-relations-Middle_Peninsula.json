{"cursor":"2900","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n The 'Middle Peninsula' is\nthe second of three large peninsulas on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay in\nVirginia, in the United States. It lies between the Northern Neck and the\nVirginia Peninsula. This peninsula is bounded by the Rappahannock River on the\nnorth and the York River on the south. It encompasses six Virginia counties:\nEssex, Gloucester, King and Queen, King William, Mathews, and Middlesex. The\nMiddle Peninsula is known for its quiet rural life, vegetable truck-farming,\nand fishing.\n\nThere are no cities on the Middle Peninsula and little industry. Among the towns\nfound there, West Point has a pulp-and-paper mill, and the unincorporated\ncommunity of Deltaville is a popular spot for city-dwellers seeking a weekend\nboating on the bay. Tappahannock is a thriving community on the Rappahannock\nRiver, and Urbanna has a small but prosperous tourism industry.\n\nThere are two tiny land reservations, home to the Pamunkey and Mattaponi\nIndian tribes.\n\nThe primary highways on the peninsula are U.S. Route 17 (Tidewater Trail), which\nconnects Fredericksburg with the Hampton Roads area, and U.S. Route 360\n(Northumberland Highway), which connects the Northern Neck with Richmond and\nDanville. Before modern highways existed, passenger ferries and steam freighters\nlinked the entire Chesapeake Bay region.\n\nThe two southernmost counties on the Middle Peninsula, Gloucester and Mathews,\nare now considered to be part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. Gloucester\nCounty is connected to the Virginia Peninsula by the George P. Coleman Memorial\nBridge, which spans the York River. Two of the western counties, King William\nCounty and King and Queen County, are part of the Richmond Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (MSA).\n","linknr":343,"url":"Middle_Peninsula","recorded":1362677251,"links":16,"instances":["virginia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peninsulas of Virginia","Regions of Virginia","Geography of Mathews County, Virginia","Geography of Essex County, Virginia","Geography of King and Queen County, Virginia","Geography of Middlesex County, Virginia","Geography of Gloucester County, Virginia"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Map_of_Virginia_highlighting_Middle_Peninsula.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Flag_of_Virginia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Virginia.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["york_river","virginia"],["york_river","virginia"]],"members":["york_river"],"related":["Peninsula","Chesapeake_Bay","Virginia","United_States","Northern_Neck","Virginia_Peninsula","Rappahannock_River","York_River_(Virginia)","Essex_County,_Virginia","Gloucester_County,_Virginia","King_and_Queen_County,_Virginia","King_William_County,_Virginia","Mathews_County,_Virginia","Middlesex_County,_Virginia","Truck_farming","West_Point,_Virginia","Deltaville","Tappahannock","Rappahannock_River","Urbanna","Pamunkey","Mattaponi","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Tribe","U.S._Route_17","Fredericksburg,_Virginia","Hampton_Roads","U.S._Route_360","Northern_Neck","Richmond,_Virginia","Danville,_Virginia","Chesapeake_Bay","Virginia_Beach-Norfolk-Newport_News,_VA-NC_MSA","Virginia_Peninsula","George_P._Coleman_Memorial_Bridge","York_River_(Virginia)","U.S._Route_17_in_Virginia","U.S._Route_360_in_Virginia"]}
