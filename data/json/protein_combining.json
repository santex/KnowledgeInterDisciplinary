{"cursor":"5282","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Protein combining' (also 'protein complementing') is the theory that\nvegetarians, particularly vegans, must eat certain complementary foods like\nbeans and rice together in the same meal, so that plant foods with incomplete\nessential amino acid content combine to form a complete protein, meeting all\namino acid requirements for human growth and maintenance.\n\nThe theory was popularized in Frances Moore LappÃ©'s 1971 bestseller [[Diet for a\nSmall Planet]]. The American National Research Council and the American Dietetic\nAssociation (ADA) soon picked it up, cautioning vegetarians to be sure to\ncombine their proteins. Maurer, Donna. 2002. Vegetarianism: Movement or\nMoment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. ISBN 1-56639-936-X p.37\n\nLappÃ© changed her position on protein combining in the 1981 edition of [[Diet\nfor a Small Planet]], in which she wrote:\n\n:\"In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way\n:to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as\n:animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-\n:quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order\n:to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing\n:foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.\n\n:\"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency\n:in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1]\n:fruit or on [2] some tubers, such as sweet potatoes or cassava, or on [3] junk\n:food (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in\n:the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole\n:source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories,\n:they are virtually certain of getting enough protein.\" Diet for a Small\n:Planet (ISBN 0-345-32120-0), 1981, p. 162; emphasis in original\n\nLater, the ADA reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism.\nSuzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:\n\n:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling\naround and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for\nsaying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got\ninstead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and\nactually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went\nahead and made that change in the paper. [Note: The paper was approved by peer\nreview and by a delegation vote before becoming official.] And it was a couple\nof years after that that Vernon Young and Peter Pellet published their paper\nthat became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans.\nAnd it also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally\nunnecessary.
