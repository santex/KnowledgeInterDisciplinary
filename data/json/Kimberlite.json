{"cursor":"12594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n mineral map of kimberlite from South Africa]]\n\n'Kimberlite' is a type of potassic volcanic rock best known for sometimes\ncontaining diamonds. It is named after the town of Kimberley in South Africa,\nwhere the discovery of an diamond in 1871 spawned a diamond rush, eventually\ncreating the Big Hole.\n\nKimberlite occurs in the Earth's crust in vertical structures known as\nkimberlite pipes. Kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined\ndiamonds today. The consensus on kimberlites is that they are formed deep within\nthe mantle. Formation occurs at depths between , from anomalously enriched\nexotic mantle compositions, and are erupted rapidly and violently, often with\nconsiderable carbon dioxide and other volatile components. It is this depth of\nmelting and generation which makes kimberlites prone to hosting diamond\nxenocrysts.\n\nKimberlite has attracted more attention than its relative volume might\nsuggest that it deserves. This is largely because it serves as a carrier of\ndiamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the Earth's surface. Its\nprobable derivation from depths greater than any other igneous rock type, and\nthe extreme magma composition that it reflects in terms of low silica content\nand high levels of incompatible trace element enrichment, make an\nunderstanding of kimberlite petrogenesis important. In this regard, the study\nof kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition\nof the deep mantle and about melting processes occurring at or near the\ninterface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying\nconvecting asthenospheric mantle.\n","linknr":279,"url":"Kimberlite","recorded":1362375418,"links":49,"instances":["geology","geology","materials_science","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ultrapotassic rocks","Ultramafic rocks","Economic geology","Diamond","Kimberley, Northern Cape"],"headings":["Morphology and volcanology","Petrology","Geochemistry","Economic importance","Related rock types","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Kimberlite_picture.jpg/220px-Kimberlite_picture.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Kimberlite_crosssection_QEMSCAN.png/220px-Kimberlite_crosssection_QEMSCAN.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crust","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["morphology","materials_science"],["dike","geology"]],"members":["dike","mantle","morphology","crust"],"related":["Volcanic_rock","Diamond","Kimberley,_Northern_Cape","South_Africa","Big_Hole","Crust_(geology)","Volcanic_pipe","Mantle_(geology)","Carbon_dioxide","Volatiles","Xenocryst","Peridotite","Mantle_(geology)","Xenolith","Igneous_rock","Magma","Silica","Incompatible_element","Trace_element","Petrogenesis","Craton","Lithosphere","Asthenosphere","Hypabyssal","Morphology_(materials_science)","Volcanic_pipe","Volcanism","Earth's_mantle","Diatreme","Maar","Jurassic","Dike_(geology)","Pennsylvania","Monongahela_River","Fayette_County,_Pennsylvania","Greene_County,_Pennsylvania","Indiana_County,_Pennsylvania","Ultramafic","Forsteritic","Olivine","Ilmenite","Chromium_pyrope","Chromium_diopside","Phlogopite","Enstatite","Chromite","Pyrope","Olivine","Pyrope","Diopside","Ilmenite","Spinel","Ultrapotassic_igneous_rocks","Peralkaline_igneous_rocks","Phlogopite","Chromite","Magnetite","Perovskite","Apatite","Monazite","Hollandite","Rutile","Ilmenite","Richterite","Pyroxene","Pyrope","Alluvium","Ultramafic","Ultrapotassic","Rare_earth_element","Diamonds","Alluvial","Eluvial","Placer_deposit","Kimberley,_South_Africa","South_Africa","Diamond","Weathering","Limonite","Serpentinite","Udachnaya_pipe","Lamproite","Lamprophyre","Nepheline_syenite","Ultrapotassic_igneous_rocks","Kalsititic_rocks"]}
