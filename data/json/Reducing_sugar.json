The aldehyde functional group\nallows the sugar to act as a reducing agent, for example in the Tollens' test\nor Benedict's test, or the Maillard reaction, important in the browning of many\nfood. The cyclic hemiacetal forms of aldoses can open to reveal an aldehyde and\ncertain ketoses can undergo tautomerization to become aldoses. However,\nacetals, including those found polysaccharide linkages, cannot easily become a\nfree aldehyde.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Reducing_sugar","recorded":1362560320,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbohydrate chemistry","Biomolecules","Carbohydrates"],"headings":["Chemistry","Examples","Detection","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Glucose_chain_structure.svg/220px-Glucose_chain_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Maltose_Gleichgewicht.svg/660px-Maltose_Gleichgewicht.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["derivative","chemistry"],["copper(i_oxide"]],"members":["derivative"],"related":["Sugar","Aldehyde","Isomerism","Reducing_agent","Tollens'_reagent","Benedict's_reagent","Maillard_reaction","Hemiacetal","Aldose","Ketose","Tautomerization","Acetal","Open-chain","Monosaccharide","Aldoses","Ketoses","Redox_reaction","Ketone","Tautomerism","Fructose","Glucose","Glyceraldehyde","Galactose","Disaccharide","Lactose","Maltose","Sucrose","Trehalose","Anomeric_carbon","Polymer","Starch","Derivative_(chemistry)","Corn_syrup","Maltodextrin","Dextrin","Macromolecule","Hydrolyse","Dextrose_equivalent","Benedict's_reagent","Fehling's_solution","Copper","Copper(I)_oxide","3,5-Dinitrosalicylic_acid","Spectrophotometric","Hydrochloric_acid","Molisch's_test"]}
