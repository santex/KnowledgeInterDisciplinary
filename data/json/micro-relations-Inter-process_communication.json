{"cursor":"6694","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"IPC}}\n\nIn computing, 'inter-process communication' ('IPC') is a set of methods for the\nexchange of data among multiple threads in one or more processes. Processes may\nbe running on one or more computers connected by a network. IPC methods are\ndivided into methods for message passing, synchronization, shared memory, and\nremote procedure calls (RPC). The method of IPC used may vary based on the\nbandwidth and latency of communication between the threads, and the type of data\nbeing communicated.\n\nThere are several reasons for providing an environment that allows process\ncooperation: *Information session *Computational speedup *Modularity\n*Convenience *Privilege separation\n\nIPC may also be referred to as inter-thread communication and inter-application\ncommunication.\n\nThe combination of IPC with the address space concept is the foundation for\naddress space independence/isolation.
