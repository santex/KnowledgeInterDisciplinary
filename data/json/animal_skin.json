Other animal coverings such as\nthe arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and\nchemical composition. The adjective 'cutaneous' means \"of the skin\" (from Latin\ncutis, skin). In mammals, the skin is the largest organ of the integumentary\nsystem made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the\nunderlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.<ref name=\"Hcare\">[http://skin-care.health-cares.net/oily-skin-\ncare.php \"Skin care\" (analysis), Health-Cares.net, 2007]</ref> Skin of a\ndifferent nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds.<ref>Alibardi L.\n(2003).

The skin interfaces with the environment\nand is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin\nplays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens<ref\nname=\"Proksch\">Proksch E, Brandner JM, Jensen JM. (2008).The skin: an\nindispensable barrier.

(2003).\n[http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v121/n2/pdf/5601872a.pdf Barrier function of\nthe skin: \"la raison d'être\" of the epidermis]. J Invest Dermatol. 121(2):231-\n41. PMID 12880413</ref> Its other functions are insulation, temperature\nregulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged\nskin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and\ndepigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an\norganism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the\neyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, and is one of the\nfirst areas to show signs of aging such as \"crows feet\" and wrinkles. The skin\non the palms and the soles of the feet is 4&nbsp;mm thick and the thickest skin\nin the body.\n\nFur is dense hair. Primarily, fur augments the insulation the skin provides\nbut can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. On\nsome animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create\nleather. Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for\nprotection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β-keratins.\nAmphibian skin is not a strong barrier to passage of chemicals and is often\nsubject to osmosis and diffusive forces. For example, a frog sitting in an\nanesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses\nthrough its skin.\n",
