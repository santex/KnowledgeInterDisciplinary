This is fundamental for the leechesâ alimentary habit of\nhematophagy, since it keeps the blood flowing after the initial phlebotomy\nperformed by the worm on the hostâs skin.\n","linknr":363,"url":"hirudin","recorded":1362572751,"links":26,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Direct thrombin inhibitors","Peptides"],"headings":["Structure","Biological activity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Hirudin_in_complex_with_thrombin.png/250px-Hirudin_in_complex_with_thrombin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/PDB_1dwc_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1dwc_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turn","biochemistry"]],"members":["turn"],"related":["Peptide","Salivary_gland","Leech","Anticoagulant","Hematophagy","Phlebotomy","Birmingham","Edinburgh","John_Berry_Haycraft","Disulfide_bonds","Protein_complex","Amino_acid_residue","Thrombin","Nitrogen","Atom","Hydrogen_bond","Serine","Catalytic","Electrostatic","Anion","Exosite","Helical","Turn_(biochemistry)","Hydrophobic","Protein_isoform","Recombinant_DNA","Blood_coagulation","Fibrinogen","Fibrin","Serine_protease","Thrombin","Prothrombin","Blood_clot","Enzyme_inhibitor","Thrombin","Antithrombin_III","Thrombin","Thrombus","Thrombolysis","Blood_diseases","Skin","Hematoma","Varicose_vein","Heparin","Serum_protein","Protein_complex","Recombinant_DNA","Biotechnology","Lepirudin","Direct_thrombin_inhibitor","Hirudotherapy","Discovery_and_Development_of_Direct_Thrombin_Inhibitors"]}
