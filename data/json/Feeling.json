The word was first used in\nthe English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either\nexperience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences, other\nthan the physical sensation of touch, such as \"a feeling of\nwarmth\". [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/feeling\nfeeling - Dictionary definition and pronunciation - Yahoo! Education ] (1910)]]\n\nIn psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective\nexperience of emotion. VandenBos, Gary (2006) APA Dictionary of Psychology.\nWashington, DC: American Psychological Association Phenomenology and\nheterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for\nknowledge of feelings. Many schools of psychotherapy depend on the therapist\nachieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which\nmethodologies exist. Some theories of interpersonal relationships also have a\nrole for shared feelings or understanding of another person's feelings.\n\nPerception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal\nreaction among receivers (see emotions), but varies depending on one's tendency\nto handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past\nexperiences, and any number of other factors. Feelings are also known as a state\nof consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Feeling","recorded":1362666625,"links":50,"instances":["knowledge","psychology","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Feeling|","Qualia"],"headings":["Gut feeling","See also","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Sensitiva_%28Miquel_Blay%2C_MRABASF_E-76%29_01.jpg/260px-Sensitiva_%28Miquel_Blay%2C_MRABASF_E-76%29_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phenomenology","psychology"],["intuition","knowledge"],["affect","psychology"],["intuition","knowledge"],["sensation","psychology"]],"members":["intuition","sensation","affect","phenomenology"],"related":["Nominalization","English_language","Touch","Emotion","Conscious","Subjectivity","Experience","Emotion","Phenomenology_(psychology)","Heterophenomenology","Psychotherapy","Interpersonal_relationship","Perception","Emotion","Gut_feeling","Intuition_(knowledge)","Rationality","Truthiness","Affect_(psychology)","Affective","Emotion","Feeling_rules","Intuition_(knowledge)","Psychological_Types","Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator","Qualia","Sensation_(psychology)","Touch","VedanƒÅ"]}
