{"cursor":"17012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Social proof', also known as 'informational social influence', is a\npsychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt\nto reflect correct behavior for a given situation. This effect is prominent in\nambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate\nmode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that surrounding people\npossess more knowledge about the situation.\n\nThe effects of social influence can be seen in the tendency of large groups to\nconform to choices which may be either correct or mistaken, a phenomenon\nsometimes referred to as herd behavior. Although social proof reflects a\nrational motive to take into account the information possessed by others, formal\nanalysis shows that it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single\nchoice, so that decisions of even large groups of individuals may be grounded in\nvery little information (see information cascades).\n\nSocial proof is a type of conformity. When a person is in a situation where they\nare unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for cues\nconcerning the correct behavior. When \"we conform because we believe that\nother's interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and\nwill help us choose an appropriate course of action,\" Aronson, E., Wilson,\nT.D., & Akert, A.M. (2005). Social Psychology (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ:\nPrentice Hall. it is informational social influence. This is contrasted\nwith normative social influence wherein a person conforms to be liked or\naccepted by others.\n\nSocial proof often leads not just to public compliance (conforming to the\nbehavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct) but\nprivate acceptance (conforming out of a genuine belief that others are\ncorrect). Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more\nimportant and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable.\n","linknr":248,"url":"Social_validation","recorded":1362579618,"links":22,"instances":["psychology","sociodynamics","psychology","sociology","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conformity","Human behavior","Social psychology"],"headings":["Mechanisms","Research","Examples","Modifiers","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conformity","psychology"],["compliance","psychology"],["framing_effect","psychology"],["critical_mass","sociodynamics"],["tipping_point","sociology"]],"members":["compliance","critical_mass","framing_effect","tipping_point","conformity"],"related":["Psychology","Herd_behavior","Information_cascades","Conformity_(psychology)","Normative_Social_Influence","Compliance_(psychology)","Laugh_tracks","Muzafer_Sherif","Autokinetic_effect","Eyewitness_identification","Copycat_suicide","Agent-based_modeling","Peer_group","Unemployed","CEO","Halo_effect","Framing_effect_(psychology)","Consideration_set","Cognitive_dissonance","Just_world_hypothesis","Claque","Laugh_track","Bystander_effect","Critical_mass_(sociodynamics)","Crowd_psychology","Information_cascades","Tipping_point_(sociology)","Shill","The_Third_Wave","Peer_pressure","Bandwagon_effect","Social_influence","Observational_learning"]}
