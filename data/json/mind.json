The description and\ndefinition is also a part of psychology where psychologists such as Sigmund\nFreud, William James have developed influential theories about the nature of the\nhuman mind. In the late 20th and early 21st century the field of cognitive\nscience emerged and developed many varied approaches to the description of mind\nand its related phenomena. The possibility of non-human minds is also explored\nin the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with\ncybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which human mental\nphenomena can be replicated by machines.\n\nThe concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different\ncultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to\nhumans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g.\npanpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. Some of the earliest\nrecorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or\nspirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and\nnatural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato,\nAristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval\nEuropean philosophers.\n",
