{"cursor":"23170","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" butterfly, native to Central America, derives its distinctive blue coloring\n from iridescence rather than from pigmentation.]]\n\n'Biological pigments', also known simply as 'pigments' or\n'biochromes' http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/65803/biochrome\naccessed 27 July 2010 are substances produced by living organisms that\nhave a color resulting from selective color absorption. Biological pigments\ninclude 'plant pigments' and 'flower pigments'. Many biological structures, such\nas skin, eyes, fur and hair contain pigments such as melanin in specialized\ncells called chromatophores.\n\nPigment color differs from structural color in that it is the same for all\nviewing angles, whereas structural color is the result of selective reflection\nor iridescence, usually because of multilayer structures. For example, butterfly\nwings typically contain structural color, although many butterflies have cells\nthat contain pigment as well.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Biological_pigment","recorded":1362567722,"links":30,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological pigments","Warning coloration"],"headings":["Biological pigments","Pigments in plants","Pigments in animals","Uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/200px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png/220px-Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Orange_violet_pansies.jpg/220px-Orange_violet_pansies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Bougainvillea-3colors.jpg.jpg/220px-Bougainvillea-3colors.jpg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["reflection","physics"],["reflection","physics"]],"members":["absorption","reflection"],"related":["Central_America","Color","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Skin","Eye","Fur","Hair","Melanin","Chromatophores","Structural_color","Reflection_(physics)","Iridescence","Butterfly","Heme","Porphyrin","Chlorophyll","Bilirubin","Hemocyanin","Hemoglobin","Myoglobin","Luciferin","Carotenoid","Hematochrome","Carotene","Carotene","Lycopene","Rhodopsin","Xanthophyll","Canthaxanthin","Zeaxanthin","Lutein","Phytochrome","Phycobiliprotein","Conjugated_system","Enol","Parrot","Melanin","Urochrome","Flavonoids","Pansies","Photosynthesis","Chlorophyll","Pollination","Porphyrin","Carotenoid","Anthocyanin","Betalain","Light","Reflection_(physics)","Chlorin","Green","Green_algae","Kelp","Diatom","Heterokont","Tetraterpenoid","Accessory_pigment","Carotene","Carrot","Lutein","Lycopene","Tomato","Antioxidant","Solubility","Flavonoid","Pigments","PH","Petal","Betalain","Indole","Tyrosine","Caryophyllales","Cactus","Amaranth","Beet","Camouflage","Mimicry","Aposematism","Chromatophore","Signalling_theory","Sexual_selection","Cephalopod","Photopigment","Rhodopsin","Melanin","Sunburn","Ultraviolet","Heme","Albinism","Melanin","Ichthyosis_lamellaris","Melanin","Melasma","Latanoprost","Vitiligo","Melanocytes","Carotenoids","Carotenoproteins","Linckiacyanin","Astaxanthin","Tetrapyrroles","Melanin","Bioluminescence","Chemiluminescence","Chromatophores","Erythrophores","Melanophores","Xanthophores","Biochrome","Schematochromes","Scytonemin","Dye"]}
