Like a circle, which is in two\n dimensions, a sphere is the set of points which are all the same distance r\n from a given point in space. This distance r is known as the radius of the\n sphere, and the given point is known as the center of the sphere. The maximum\n straight distance through the sphere is known as the diameter. It passes\n through the center and is thus twice the radius.\n\nIn mathematics, a distinction is made between the sphere (a two-dimensional\nclosed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and the ball, a\nthree-dimensional shape which includes the interior of a sphere.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sphere","recorded":1363582877,"links":[],"instances":["mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","topology","mathematics","geography","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Differential geometry","Differential topology","Elementary geometry","Elementary shapes","Homogeneous spaces","Spheres|","Surfaces","Topology"],"headings":["Volume of a sphere","Surface area of a sphere","Equations in ℝ<sup>3</sup>","Terminology","Hemisphere","Generalization to other dimensions","Generalization to metric spaces","Topology","Spherical geometry","Eleven properties of the sphere","Cubes in relation to spheres","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["center","geometry"],["ball","mathematics"],["ball","mathematics"],["cylinder","geometry"],["locus","mathematics"],["meridian","geography"],["lune","mathematics"],["norm","mathematics"],["ball","mathematics"],["ball","mathematics#topological_balls"],["knot","mathematics"],["boundary","topology"],["point","geometry"],["line","mathematics"],["plane","mathematics"],["plane","mathematics"],["normal","geometry"],["cone","geometry"],["rotation_group_so(3"],["ball","mathematics"],["dome","mathematics"]],"members":["plane","normal","cone","lune","locus","center","cylinder","norm","knot","point","dome","boundary","ball","meridian","line"],"related":["Greek_language","Geometrical","Solid_geometry","Ball","Circle","Radius","Center_(geometry)","Diameter","Closed_surface","Embedding","Euclidean_space","Ball_(mathematics)","Volume","Ball_(mathematics)","Pi","Archimedes","Circumscribe","Cylinder_(geometry)","Cavalieri's_principle","Integral_calculus","Disk_integration","Pythagorean_theorem","Spherical_coordinates","Hypersphere","Volume_of_an_n-ball","Inscribed_figure","Surface_area","Archimedes","Circumscribe","Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection","Derivative","Area_element","Spherical_coordinates","Area_element","Integral","Analytic_geometry","Locus_(mathematics)","Trigonometric_function","Spherical_coordinates","Differential_form","Orthogonal","Albert_Einstein","Fused_quartz","Gyroscope","Gravity_Probe_B","Nanometers","Australia","Kilogram","Surface_tension","Specific_surface_area","Circle","Diameter","Ellipse","Spheroid","Antipodal_point","Great_circle","Great-circle_distance","Riemannian_circle","Equator","Meridian_(geography)","Longitude","Axis_of_rotation","Latitude","Earth","Spheroid","Geoid","Lune_(mathematics)","Real_projective_plane","Filling_area_conjecture","Riemannian_circle","Dimension","Natural_number","Circle","3-sphere","Hypersphere","Gamma_function","Metric_space","Norm_(mathematics)","Unit_sphere","Ball_(mathematics)","Euclidean_metric","Topology","Homeomorphic","Homeomorphic","Metric_space","Discrete_topology","Up_to","Homeomorphism","Knot_(mathematics)","Up_to","Homeomorphism","Spheroid","Compact_space","Topological_manifold","Boundary_(topology)","Diffeomorphic","Heine–Borel_theorem","Euclidean_plane_geometry","Point_(geometry)","Line_(mathematics)","Arc_length","Great_circle","Geodesic","Parallel_postulate","Spherical_trigonometry","Angle","Trigonometry","Similar_triangles","David_Hilbert","David_Hilbert","Stephan_Cohn-Vossen","Plane_(mathematics)","Apollonius_of_Perga","Circle","Plane_(mathematics)","Meissner_body","Normal_(geometry)","Principal_curvature","Principal_curvature","Focal_surface","Channel_surface","Cone_(geometry)","Torus","Dupin_cyclide","Geodesics","Isoperimetric_inequality","Soap_bubble","Surface_tension","Mean_curvature","Minimal_surface","Gaussian_curvature","Embedding","Pseudosphere","Euler_angles","Rotation_group_SO(3)","Surface_of_revolution","Helicoid","Cuboids","Cube","3-sphere","Affine_sphere","Alexander_horned_sphere","Ball_(mathematics)","Banach–Tarski_paradox","Cube","Cuboid","Curvature","Directional_statistics","Dome_(mathematics)","Dyson_sphere","Hoberman_sphere","Homology_sphere","Homotopy_groups_of_spheres","Homotopy_sphere","Hypersphere","Lenart_Sphere","Metric_space","Napkin_ring_problem","Pseudosphere","Riemann_sphere","Smale's_paradox","Solid_angle","Sphere_packing","Spherical_cap","Spherical_helix","Tangent_indicatrix","Spherical_sector","Spherical_segment","Spherical_shell","Spherical_wedge","Spherical_zone","Spherical_coordinates","Spherical_Earth","Zoll_surface"]}
