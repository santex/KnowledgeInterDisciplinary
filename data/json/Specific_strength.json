{"cursor":"10256","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'specific strength' is a material's strength (force per unit area at\nfailure) divided by its density. It is also known as the 'strength-to-weight\nratio' or 'strength/weight ratio'. In fiber or textile applications, tenacity is\nthe usual measure of specific strength. The SI unit for specific strength is\n(N/m 2)/(kg/m 3) or more commonly NÂ·m/kg.\n\nAnother way to describe specific strength is 'breaking length', also known as\n'self support length': the maximum length of a vertical column of the material\n(assuming a fixed cross-section) that could suspend its own weight when\nsupported only at the top. For this measurement, the definition of weight is the\nforce of gravity at the Earth's surface applying to the entire length of the\nmaterial, not diminishing with height. This usage is more common with certain\nspecialty fiber or textile applications.\n\nThe materials with the highest specific strengths are typically fibers such as\ncarbon fiber, glass fiber and various polymers, and these are frequently used to\nmake composite materials (e.g. carbon fiber-epoxy). These materials and others\nsuch as titanium, aluminium, magnesium and high strength steel alloys are widely\nused in aerospace and other applications where weight savings are worth the\nhigher material cost.\n\nNote that strength and stiffness are distinct. Both are important in design of\nefficient and safe structures.\n","linknr":249,"url":"Specific_strength","recorded":1362375125,"links":23,"instances":["unit","metallurgy","unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://www-qa.dyneema.com/en_US/public/dyneema/downloads/Comprehensive_factsheet_UHMWPE.pdf","http://www-qa.dyneema.com/en_US/public/dyneema/downloads/Comprehensive_factsheet_UHMWPE.pdf","http://www.toyobo.co.jp/seihin/kc/pbo/technical.pdf","http://www.toyobo.co.jp/seihin/kc/pbo/technical.pdf","http://www.nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf","http://www.nanocarbon.jp/english/research/image/review.pdf","http://www.isec.org/images/StrongTetherChallenge/2013/Handbook-ts2013.rev0.pdf"],"categories":["Engineering ratios","Materials science","Solid mechanics"],"headings":["Examples","Relation to velocity","The Yuri and Space Tethers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/7/0b72c80ddcc8c9e59eb17d261990c290.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["whisker","metallurgy"],["yuri","unit"],["newton","unit"],["newton","unit"],["tex","unit"]],"members":["newton","whisker","tex","yuri"],"related":["Strength_of_materials","Density","Tenacity","Weight","Gravity","Carbon_fiber","Glass_fiber","Composite_material","Carbon_fiber-reinforced_polymer","Titanium","Aluminium","Magnesium","Aerospace","Material","Megapascal","Density","Concrete","Rubber","Copper","Brass","Nylon","Oak","Polypropylene","Magnesium","Aluminium","Stainless_Steel","Titanium","Bainite","Balsa","Carbon_fiber-reinforced_polymer","Spider_silk","Silicon_carbide","Glass_Fiber","Basalt_fiber","Iron","Whisker_(metallurgy)","Vectran","Carbon_fiber","Kevlar","Dyneema","Ultra_high_molecular_weight_polyethylene","Zylon","Carbon_nanotube","Colossal_carbon_tube","International_Space_Elevator_Consortium","Yuri_(unit)","Space_tether","Newton_(unit)","Kilogram","Meter","Mega-","SI_unit","Newton_(unit)","Tex_(unit)","Gigapascal","Cubic_centimeter","Gram","Space_elevator","Specific_modulus","Space_elevator","Space_tether"]}
