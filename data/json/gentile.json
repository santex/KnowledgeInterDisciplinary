The original words Goy and\nEthnos refer to \"peoples\" or \"nations\". Latin and later English translators\nselectively used the term gentiles when the context for the base term \"peoples\"\nor \"nations\" referred to non-Israelite peoples or nations in English\ntranslations of the Bible.\n\nFollowing Christianization of the Roman Empire, the general implication of the\nword gentile became \"non-Jew\".\n",
