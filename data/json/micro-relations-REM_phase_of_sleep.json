{"cursor":"22136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Rapid eye movement sleep' ('REM sleep') is a normal stage of sleep\ncharacterized by the rapid and random movement of the eyes. REM sleep is\nclassified into two categories: tonic and phasic. It was identified\nand defined by Nathaniel Kleitman, Eugene Aserinsky, and Jon Birtwell in the\nearly 1950s. Criteria for REM sleep includes rapid eye movement, low muscle tone\nand a rapid, low-voltage EEG; these features are easily discernible in a\npolysomnogram, the sleep study typically done for patients with\nsuspected sleep disorders.\n\nREM sleep in adult humans typically occupies 20â25% of total sleep, about 90â120\nminutes of a night's sleep. REM sleep normally occurs close to\nmorning. http://kidshealth.org/kid/feeling/emotion/nightmares.html\nDuring a normal night of sleep, humans usually experience about four or five\nperiods of REM sleep; they are quite short at the beginning of the night and\nlonger toward the end. Many animals and some people tend to wake, or experience\na period of very light sleep, for a short time immediately after a bout of REM.\nThe relative amount of REM sleep varies considerably with age. A newborn baby\nspends more than 80% of total sleep time in REM. http://jama.ama-\nassn.org/cgi/content/abstract/284/7/861 During REM, the activity of the\nbrain's neurons is quite similar to that during waking hours; for this reason,\nthe REM-sleep stage may be called paradoxical sleep.\n\nREM sleep is physiologically different from the other phases of sleep, which are\ncollectively referred to as non-REM sleep (NREM sleep). Subjects' vividly\nrecalled dreams mostly occur during REM sleep.\n","linknr":603,"url":"REM_phase_of_sleep","recorded":1362373651,"links":54,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/neuromodulation/epapers/Aston-JonesetalLCsleepOrdway07.pdf","http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Faculty/Blumberg/Course_Docs/Seminar.2008/Readings/Siegel.REMSleep.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/dmalt/Public/9.10/newRun2.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/dmalt/Public/9.10/newRun2.pdf"],"categories":["Dream","Sleep physiology","Neurophysiology"],"headings":["Physiology","Theories about the function(s) of REM sleep","REM sleep in animals","Theories about the function of rapid eye movements","Discovery","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Sleep_EEG_REM.png/300px-Sleep_EEG_REM.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sleep","Human_eye","Nathaniel_Kleitman","Eugene_Aserinsky","Muscle_tone","EEG","Polysomnogram","Neuron","Non-REM_sleep","Dream","EEG","Brain_stem","Pontine_tegmentum","Neurotransmitter","Monoamine","Norepinephrine","Serotonin","Histamine","Motor_neuron","Atonia","REM_behavior_disorder","Heart_rate","Respiratory_rate","Erection","Penis","Nocturnal_penile_tumescence","Clitoris","Memories","Procedural_memory","Spatial_memory","Slow-wave_sleep","Declarative_memory","Declarative_memory","Procedural_memory","Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor","Tricyclic_antidepressants","Francis_Crick","Reverse_learning","Active_sleep","Neonate","Tonic_immobility","Monoamine","Clinical_depression","Antidepressant","Sleep-deprived","Creativity","Cholinergic","Noradrenergic","Hippocampus","Neocortex","Slow-wave_sleep","Mammals","Birds","Blindness","Fetuses","Binocular_vision","Fixation_point","Cornea","Neural_circuit","Waking_up","Central_nervous_system","Eugene_Aserinsky","Nathaniel_Kleitman","William_C._Dement","University_of_Chicago","Sleep_and_learning","Dream","Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep","Lucid_dream","Pedunculopontine_nucleus","PGO_waves","REM_rebound"]}
