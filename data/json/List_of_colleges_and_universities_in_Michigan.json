{"cursor":"76095","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n ]] There are ninety-three colleges and universities in the U.S. state of\n Michigan that are listed under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of\n Higher Education. These institutions include eight research universities,\n nineteen master's universities, and seventeen baccalaureate colleges, as well\n as thirty-one associates colleges. In addition, there are eighteen institutions\n classified as special-focus institutions, eleven labeled as\n baccalaureate/associate's colleges, and two tribal colleges which operate in\n the state. The University of Michigan system (which comprises three public\n universities) has been overseen by the Board of Regents of the University of\n Michigan since 1817.\n\nThe University of MichiganâAnn Arbor (UM) is the flagship campus of the\nUniversity of Michigan system. The oldest post-secondary institution in the\nstate, it was founded in 1817, twenty years before the Michigan Territory\nachieved statehood. East Lansing-based Michigan State\nUniversity is the state's largest public institution in terms of enrollment, as\nit had 47,825 students . With an enrollment of 11,707 students, Davenport\nUniversity of Grand Rapids is Michigan's largest private post-secondary\ninstitution, while Oak Park-based Yeshiva Gedolah of Greater Detroit is the\nstate's smallest.\n\nThe state has five medical schools, as well as five law schools which are\naccredited by the American Bar Association. The majority of\nMichigan's post-secondary institutions are accredited by the North Central\nAssociation of Colleges and Schools (NCA). Most are accredited by\nmultiple agencies, such as the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education\n(CCNE), the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), and the National\nLeague for Nursing (NLNAC).\n","linknr":1355,"url":"List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Michigan","recorded":1375057934,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Michigan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Michigan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_lists","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-featured.svg/14px-Cscr-featured.svg.png","/wiki/File:Law_School_Facade_2009.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Law_School_Facade_2009.JPG/300px-Law_School_Facade_2009.JPG","/wiki/File:Law_School_Facade_2009.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Michigan","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Doctorate-granting_Universities","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Master.27s_Colleges_and_Universities","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Baccalaureate_Colleges","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Associates_Colleges","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Special_Focus_Institutions","/wiki/Carnegie_Classification_of_Institutions_of_Higher_Education#Tribal_Colleges","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Public_university","/wiki/Board_of_Regents_of_the_University_of_Michigan","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Flagship_campus","/wiki/Michigan_Territory","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan","/wiki/Michigan_State_University","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Michigan&action=edit","/wiki/Davenport_University","/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan","/wiki/Private_university","/wiki/Oak_Park,_Michigan","/w/index.php?title=Yeshiva_Gedolah_of_Greater_Detroit&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Educational_accreditation","/wiki/American_Bar_Association","#cite_note-6","/wiki/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Commission_on_Collegiate_Nursing_Education","/wiki/National_Association_of_Schools_of_Music","/wiki/National_League_for_Nursing#Accrediting_commission","#Institutions","#Defunct_institutions","#See_also","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Michigan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/American_Association_for_Marriage_and_Family_Therapy","/wiki/American_Association_of_Nurse_Anesthetists","/wiki/American_Bar_Association","/w/index.php?title=American_Board_of_Funeral_Service_Education&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_Dietetic_Association","/wiki/American_Osteopathic_Association","/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association","/wiki/Accrediting_Council_for_Independent_Colleges_and_Schools","/wiki/Accreditation_Council_for_Pharmacy_Education","/wiki/American_Academy_for_Liberal_Education","/wiki/American_Dental_Association","/wiki/American_Occupational_Therapy_Association","/wiki/American_Optometric_Association","/wiki/American_Physical_Therapy_Association","/wiki/American_Psychological_Association","/wiki/American_Speech%E2%80%93Language%E2%80%93Hearing_Association","/wiki/Association_of_Advanced_Rabbinical_and_Talmudic_Schools","/wiki/Association_for_Biblical_Higher_Education","/wiki/Association_of_Theological_Schools_in_the_United_States_and_Canada","/wiki/Commission_on_the_Accreditation_of_Healthcare_Management_Education","/wiki/Commission_on_Collegiate_Nursing_Education","/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_English_Language_Program_Accreditation&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Commission_on_Massage_Therapy_Accreditation&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Council_on_Education_for_Public_Health","/w/index.php?title=Joint_Review_Committee_on_Education_Programs_in_Radiologic_Technology&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Liaison_Committee_on_Medical_Education","/w/index.php?title=Midwifery_Education_Accreditation_Council&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art_and_Design","/w/index.php?title=National_Association_of_Schools_of_Dance&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/National_Asso
