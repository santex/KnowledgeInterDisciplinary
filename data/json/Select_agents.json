{"cursor":"8675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Under United States law, \"Biological Select Agents or Toxins\" (BSATs) â or\nsimply 'Select Agents' for short â are bio-agents which since\n1997 Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select\nAgents, Title 42 CFR Part 72 and Appendix A; 15 April 1997 (DHHS). have\nbeen declared by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or by\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to have the \"potential to pose a\nsevere threat to public health and safety\". These bio-agents are divided into\nthree broad categories: (1) 'HHS select agents and toxins' (affecting humans);\n(2) 'USDA select agents and toxins' (affecting agriculture); and (3) 'Overlap\nselect agents and toxins' (affecting both).\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) administers the\n'Select Agent Program' (SAP), which regulates the laboratories which may\npossess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States. The SAP was\nestablished to satisfy requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the\nPublic Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,\nwhich were enacted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the\nsubsequent 2001 anthrax attacks.\n\nThe active use of BSATs in biomedical research prompts concerns about dual use.\nThe federal government has created the National Science Advisory Board for\nBiosecurity, a critical component of a set of federal initiatives to promote\nbiosecurity in life science research. This advisory board is composed of\ngovernment, education and industry experts who provide policy recommendations on\nways to minimize the possibility that knowledge and technologies emanating from\nvitally important biological research will be misused to threaten public health\nor national security.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Select_agents","recorded":1362501502,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.selectagents.gov/resources/List%20of%20Select%20Agents%20and%20Toxins_111708.pdf"],"categories":["United States Department of Health and Human Services","Toxins","Biosecurity"],"headings":["List of Select Agents","List of former Select Agents","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States_law","Bio-agent","U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","U.S._Department_of_Agriculture","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","USA_PATRIOT_Act","Public_Health_Security_and_Bioterrorism_Preparedness_Response_Act","September_11,_2001_attacks","2001_anthrax_attacks","Dual-use_technology","National_Science_Advisory_Board_for_Biosecurity","Life_science","DEPARTMENT_OF_HEALTH_AND_HUMAN_SERVICES","Government_Printing_Office","SARS-associated_coronavirus","Eastern_equine_encephalitis_virus","Tick-borne_encephalitis","Highly_Pathogenic_Avian_Influenza_H5N1_virus","1918_influenza_virus","1918_flu_pandemic","Monkeypox_virus","Variola_major_virus","Variola_minor_virus","Crimean-Congo_haemorrhagic_fever_virus","Ebola_virus","Lassa_fever_virus","Lujo_virus","Marburg_virus","Kyasanur_Forest_disease_virus","Omsk_hemorrhagic_fever_virus","Chapare_virus","Venezuelan_hemorrhagic_fever","Junin_virus","Argentine_hemorrhagic_fever","Machupo","Brazilian_hemorrhagic_fever","Abrin","Botulinum_neurotoxin","Conotoxin","Ricin","Saxitoxin","Shiga-like_toxin","Shiga_toxin","Staphylococcal_enterotoxin","Tetrodotoxin","Diacetoxyscirpenol","T-2_toxin","Hendra_virus","Nipah_virus","Rift_Valley_fever","Venezuelan_equine_encephalitis","African_horse_sickness","African_swine_fever","Avian_influenza","Swine_fever","Foot-and-mouth_disease","Rinderpest","Swine_vesicular_disease","Newcastle_disease","Citrus_variegated_chlorosis","Cercopithecine_herpesvirus_1","Eastern_Equine_encephalitis_virus","Flexal_virus","Tick-borne_encephalitis_viruses","Venezuelan_Equine_Encephalitis_virus","Akabane_virus","Bluetongue_virus","Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalitis","Camel_Pox_virus","Goat_Pox_virus","Japanese_Encephalitis_virus","Malignant_Catarrhal_Fever_virus","Menangle_virus","Sheep_Pox_virus","Vesicular_stomatitis","U.S._biological_defense_program","Biosecurity_in_the_United_States","Biological_agent"]}
