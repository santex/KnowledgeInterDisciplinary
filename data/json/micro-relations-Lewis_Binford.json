He is widely considered among the\nmost influential archaeologists of the later 20th century, and is credited with\nfundamentally changing the field with the introduction of processual archaeology\n(or the \"New Archaeology\") in the 1960s. Binford's influence was controversial, however, and most\ntheoretical work in archaeology in the late 1980s and 1990s was explicitly\nconstrued as either a reaction to or in support of the processual\nparadigm. Recent appraisals have judged that his approach owed more\nto prior work in the 1940s and 50s than suggested by Binford's strong criticism\nof his predecessors.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Lewis_Binford","recorded":1362480859,"links":30,"instances":["archaeology","postgraduate","archaeology","archaeology"],"pdf":["http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/lewis-r-binford-memoir.pdf"],"categories":["Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","American archaeologists","Prehistorians","1931 births","2011 deaths","University of North Carolina alumni","University of Michigan alumni","People from Norfolk, Virginia","Virginia Tech alumni","University of New Mexico faculty","University of Chicago faculty","Southern Methodist University faculty"],"headings":["Early life and education","New Archaeology","Ethnoarchaeology","Later career","Personal life","Influence","Awards and recognition","Works","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Binford_ca1980_by_permission_Martha_Binford-Photographer_Mirrored.jpg/220px-Binford_ca1980_by_permission_Martha_Binford-Photographer_Mirrored.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["master_of_arts","postgraduate"],["typology","archaeology"],["seriation","archaeology"],["middle-range_theory","archaeology"]],"members":["typology","master_of_arts","seriation"],"related":["Norfolk,_Virginia","Kirksville,_Missouri","American_nationality_law","Archaeology","Anthropology","University_of_Chicago","University_of_New_Mexico","Southern_Methodist_University","University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill","University_of_Michigan","Processual_archaeology","Ethnoarchaeology","Paleolithic","Leslie_White","David_L._Clarke","Colin_Renfrew","Archaeology","Archaeological_theory","Ethnoarchaeology","Paleolithic","Processual_archaeology","Paradigm","Norfolk,_Virginia","Wildlife_biologist","Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute","Okinawa","Shuri,_Okinawa","University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill","Bachelor_of_Arts","University_of_Michigan","Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","PhD","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Colony_of_Virginia","Virginia","Culture_history","Cultural_anthropology","Leslie_White","Assistant_professor","University_of_Chicago","Archaeology_of_the_Americas","Radiocarbon_dating","Archaeological_culture","Typology_(archaeology)","Relative_dating","Seriation_(archaeology)","Cultural_diffusion","Society_for_American_Archaeology","Robert_John_Braidwood","University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara","University_of_California,_Los_Angeles","University_of_New_Mexico","Processual_archaeology","Mousterian","Middle_Palaeolithic","Archaeological_industry","Ethnography","Nunamiut","Alaska","Periglacial","Hunter-gatherer","Ethnoarchaeology","Palaeolithic","Southern_Methodist_University","University_of_New_Mexico","Kirksville,_Missouri","Truman_State_University","Archaeological_theory","Ethnoarchaeology","Processual_archaeology","Hypothetico-deductive_method","Leslie_White","Culture-historical_archaeology","James_Sackett","Ian_Hodder","Post-processual_archaeology","François_Bordes","Mousterian","Nunamiut","Middle-range_theory_(archaeology)","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Society_for_American_Archaeology","Leiden_University","Asteroid"]}
