{"cursor":"4922","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in\nAmerica' is the regional ELCA judicatory of the Philadelphia metropolitan area.\nThe synod covers Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties as well as\nthe City of Philadelphia.\n\nThe synod, consisting of rostered leaders (pastors, associates in ministry,\ndeaconesses, and diaconal ministers) and approximately 172 congregations and\nmissions, is located in an area rich in German and Swedish history, with the\nlatter bringing Lutheranism (as missions of the Church of Sweden) in the 1640s\nbefore the subsequent takeover of Tinicum (present-day Chester) by the British\nand the formation of the Province of Pennsylvania under the Quaker William Penn,\nwho invited scores of people, mostly British Quakers and German Lutherans and\nAnabaptists (Amish and Mennonite), to settle the land. Its predecessor body, the\nMinisterium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States, the oldest Lutheran synod in\nAmerica, was organized in 1748 at Philadelphia by the Lutheran patriarch, Pastor\nHenry Melchior Muhlenberg of Trappe, Pennsylvania. The synod is also the home of\nLutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia (LTSP), under which the ELCA\nmaintains the main office of the seventh region, which oversees the ELCA's New\nEngland, Upstate and Metropolitan New York Synods, the Slovak Zion Synod, New\nJersey Synod, and two of the ELCA synods in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe highest legislative authority of the synod is the Synod Assembly, which\nmeets annually. The Synod Council is the board of directors of the synod and is\nits interim legislative authority between meetings of the Synod Assembly. The\nSynod Council normally meets five times every year and consists of 29 members.\nThe Bishop is elected by the Synod Assembly and may serve an unlimited number of\nsix-year terms. The other synod officers are the Vice President (who must be a\nlayperson), Secretary, and Treasurer (either a layperson or a rostered pastor),\nall of whom may serve an unlimited number of four-year terms.\n\nThe synod's current office is located on the grounds of LTSP, having been moved\nfrom its previous office in Norristown, Pennsylvania in 2008. Since the [[Called\nto Common Mission]] with the Episcopal Church, it has been in ecumenical\npartnership with the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, allowing the synod and\nthe diocese to share both pastors and staff. Symbolically, the synod gave the\ndiocese a baptismal font with the consecration of the new Philadelphia Episcopal\nCathedral located in Philadelphia's \"University City\" section (near the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and Drexel University). In 2006, the Rev. Claire\nSchenot Burkat, a Lutheran pastor who had been both on the synod's and diocese's\n\"deployed staff,\" in support of the formation of new congregations, was elected\nas the synod's fourth bishop, and the first woman to hold the title. She was\nformally installed on October 14, 2006. Her co-consecrators included ELCA\nPresiding Bishop Mark S. Hanson and the Rt. Rev. Samuel Colerman, former\nEpiscopal bishop of Connecticut and former assistant bishop of Pennsylvania\nunder the Rt. Rev. Charles Bennison.\n\nGeographically, the synod shares the same five-county area as the Roman Catholic\nArchdiocese of Philadelphia and the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The\nEastern Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, part of the\nlarger Philadelphia Episcopal Area (which includes the Peninsula Delaware\nConference), is also located within the geographic boundaries of the\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania Synod, but also includes territory located within the\nELCA's Northeastern Pennsylvania Synod, mostly the Lehigh Valley and Pocono\nMountains regions.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","recorded":1375069215,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Bucks_County,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Chester_County,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Delaware_County,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Church_of_Sweden","/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Quaker","/wiki/William_Penn","/wiki/Amish","/wiki/Mennonite","/wiki/Pennsylvania_Ministerium","/wiki/Henry_Melchior_Muhlenberg","/wiki/Trappe,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Lutheran_Theological_Seminary_at_Philadelphia","/wiki/New_England_Synod","/wiki/Upstate_New_York_Synod","/w/index.php?title=Metropolitan_New_York_Synod&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Slovak_Zion_Synod","/wiki/New_Jersey_Synod","/wiki/Norristown,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Called_to_Common_Mission","/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America","/wiki/Episcopal_Diocese_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Philadelphia_Episcopal_Cathedral","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Drexel_University","/w/index.php?title=Claire_Schenot_Burkat&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mark_S._Hanson","/wiki/Charles_Bennison","/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Philadelphia","/wiki/United_Methodist_Church","/w/index.php?title=Northeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lehigh_Valley","/wiki/Pocono_Mountains","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&oldid=539110203","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America_synods","/wiki/Category:Lutheranism_in_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Category:Religious_organizations_established_in_1988","/wiki/Category:Lutheran_districts_established_in_the_20th_century","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Southeastern+Pennsylvania+Synod&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Southeastern+Pennsylvania+Synod","/wiki/Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","/wiki/Talk:Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","#","/wiki/Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&oldid=539110203","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7569495","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&id=539110203","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Southeastern+Pennsylvania+Synod","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Southeastern+Pennsylvania+Synod&oldid=539110203&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Southeastern_Pennsylvania_Synod&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7569495#sitel
