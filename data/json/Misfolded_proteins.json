{"cursor":"33265","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Protein folding' is the process by which a protein structure assumes its\nfunctional shape or conformation. It is the physical process by which a\npolypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional\nstructure from random coil. Each protein exists as an\nunfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a\nlinear chain of amino acids. This polypeptide lacks any developed three-\ndimensional structure (the left hand side of the neighboring figure). Amino\nacids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional\nstructure, the folded protein (the right hand side of the figure), known as the\nnative state. The resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the\namino acid sequence (Anfinsen's dogma).\n\nThe correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function, although some\nparts of functional proteins may remain unfolded. {{cite book |author=Jeremy\nM.

Many allergies are caused by the folding of the\nproteins, for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein\nstructures.
