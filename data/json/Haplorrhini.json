The anthropoids are the catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes,\nincluding humans) and the platyrrhines (New World monkeys).\n\nThe omomyids are an extinct group of prosimians, believed to be more closely\nrelated to the tarsiers than to any strepsirrhines, and are considered the most\nprimitive haplorhines.\n\nHaplorhines share a number of derived features that distinguish them from the\nstrepsirrhine \"wet-nosed\" primates (whose Greek name means \"curved nose\"), the\nother suborder of primates from which they parted in evolution some\n63 million years ago. The haplorhines, including tarsiers, have all lost\nthe function of the terminal enzyme which manufactures vitamin C, while the\nstrepsirrhine prosimians, like most other orders of mammals, have retained this\nenzyme and the ability to manufacture vitamin C. The haplorhine upper\nlip, which has replaced the ancestral rhinarium found in strepsirrhines, is not\ndirectly connected to their nose or gum, allowing a large range of facial\nexpressions. Their brain to body ratio is significantly greater than the\nstrepsirrhines, and their primary sense is vision. Haplorhines have a\npostorbital plate, unlike the postorbital bar found in strepsirhines. Most\nspecies are diurnal (the exceptions being the tarsiers and the night monkeys).\n\nAll anthropoids have a single-chambered uterus; tarsiers have a bicornate uterus\nlike the strepsirrhines. Most species typically have single births, although\ntwins and triplets are common for marmosets and tamarins. Despite similar\ngestation periods, haplorhine newborns are relatively much larger than\nstrepsirrhine newborns, but have a longer dependence period on their mother.\nThis difference in size and dependence is credited to the increased complexity\nof their behavior and natural history.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Haplorrhini","recorded":1372152278,"links":[],"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Primates"],"headings":["Etymology","Classification and evolution","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["family","biology"],["taxonomy","biology"]],"members":["taxonomy","family"],"related":["Eocene","Common_squirrel_monkey","Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Primate","Reginald_Innes_Pocock","Family_(biology)","Tarsiidae","Archicebidae","Callitrichidae","Cebidae","Aotidae","Pitheciidae","Atelidae","Cercopithecidae","Hylobatidae","Hominidae","Cladistics","Prosimian","Tarsier","Simian","Catarrhines","Old_World_monkeys","Ape","New_World_monkeys","Omomyid","Tarsiers","Strepsirrhini","Rhinarium","Postorbital","Postorbital_bar","Diurnal_animal","Night_monkey","Uterus","Marmoset","Tamarin","Taxonomy_(biology)","Ancient_Greek","Rhinarium","Strepsirrhini","Tarsiiformes","Tarsiidae","Anthropoidea","New_World_monkeys","Catarrhini","Old_World_monkeys","Ape","Hominoidea","Cercopithecoidea","Strepsirrhini","Tarsiiformes","Tarsier","Simian","New_World_monkey","Callitrichidae","Cebidae","Aotidae","Pitheciidae","Atelidae","Catarrhini","Old_World_monkey","Old_World_monkey","Ape","Gibbon","Great_ape","Colin_Groves"]}
