{"cursor":"6784","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Finings' The term is a mass noun rather than a plural. are\nsubstances that are usually added at or near the completion of the processing of\nbrewing wine, beer and various nonalcoholic juice beverages. Their purpose is\nfor removal of organic compounds; to either improve clarity or adjust\nflavor/aroma. Specifically, the removed compounds may be sulfides, proteins,\npolyphenols, benzenoids, or copper ions. Unless they form a stable bottom\nsediment in the final container, the spent finings are usually discarded from\nthe beverage along with the target compounds that they capture.\n\nHistorically, various substances such as egg whites, blood, milk, fish swim\nbladder derivatives and Irish moss have been used as finings. These are still\nused by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and\nare more widely used, including isinglass, bentonite, gelatin, casein,\ncarrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolase, PVPP\n(Polyclar), kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen,\nhydrated yeast, and activated carbon.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Finings","recorded":1362675377,"links":16,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","wine","materials_science"],"pdf":["http://www.fst.vt.edu/extension/enology/downloads/bentonite01.pdf","http://www.ibd.org.uk/igbsite/business/training/files/Timscourses/tech%20summ%20January%20.pdf"],"categories":["Brewing ingredients","Oenology"],"headings":["Actions","Nutritional and vegetarian concerns","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Topping_up_the_barrel_with_finings_.jpg/220px-Topping_up_the_barrel_with_finings_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","chemistry"],["dispersion","materials_science"],["complex","chemistry"],["filter","chemistry"],["complex","chemistry"],["fermentation","wine"]],"members":["filter","complex","fermentation","dispersion"],"related":["Mass_noun","Brewing","Wine","Beer","Organic_compounds","Sulfide","Protein","Polyphenol","Aromatic_hydrocarbon","Ion","Egg_white","Blood","Milk","Swim_bladder","Chondrus_crispus","Isinglass","Bentonite","Gelatin","Casein","Carrageenan","Alginate","Diatomaceous_earth","Pectinase","Pectolase","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Colloidal_silica","Copper_sulfate","Albumen","Hydrated","Yeast","Activated_carbon","Electrostatic","Adsorbent","Ionic_bond","Enzymatic","Electrostatic","Activated_carbon","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Copper_sulfate","Pectinase","Pectolase","Proteins","Tannins","Batch_production","Continuous_production","Filter_(chemistry)","Electric_charge","Colloidal","Dispersion_(materials_science)","Complex_(chemistry)","Adsorbent","Activated_carbon","Activated_carbon","Filter_(chemistry)","Aromatic_hydrocarbon","Polyphenol","Adsorption","Protein","Chemical_affinity","Copper","Ions","Copper_sulfate","Organosulfur_compounds","Copper_sulfate","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Copper_sulfate","Chemical_bond","Sulfides","Complex_(chemistry)","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Hydrogen_bonds","Carbonyl","Polyphenol","Molecular_weight","Tannins","Gelatin","Enzymatic","Pectin","Pectinase","Polysaccharide","Pectin","Fermentation_(wine)","Antioxidant","Flavonoid","Quercetin","Gelatin","Casein","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Astringent","Quercetin","Flavan-3-ol","Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone","Polyphenol","Vegetarian","Gelatin","Casein","Albumen","Isinglass","Flocculant"]}
