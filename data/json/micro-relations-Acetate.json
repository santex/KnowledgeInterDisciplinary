Most of the approximately 5 billion\nkilograms of acetic acid produced annually in industry are used in the\nproduction of acetates, which usually take the form of polymers. In nature,\nacetate is the most common building block for biosynthesis. For example, the\nfatty acids are produced by connecting the two carbon atoms from acetate to a\ngrowing fatty acid.
