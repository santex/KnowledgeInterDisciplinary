{"cursor":"16311","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'musculoskeletal system' (also known as the 'locomotor system') is an organ\nsystem that gives animals (and humans) the ability to move using the muscular\nand skeletal systems. The musculoskeletal system provides form, support,\nstability, and movement to the body.\n\nIt is made up of the body's bones (the skeleton), muscles, cartilage,\ntendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that supports and binds\ntissues and organs together. The musculoskeletal system's primary functions\ninclude supporting the body, allowing motion, and protecting vital\norgans. The skeletal portion of the system serves as the main storage\nsystem for calcium and phosphorus and contains critical components of the\nhematopoietic system.\n\nThis system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers\nvia connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide the\nstability to a body in analogy to iron rods in concrete construction. Muscles\nkeep bones in place and also play a role in movement of the bones. To allow\nmotion, different bones are connected by joints. Cartilage prevents the bone\nends from rubbing directly on to each other. Muscles contract (bunch up) to move\nthe bone attached at the joint.\n\nThere are, however, diseases and disorders that may adversely affect the\nfunction and overall effectiveness of the system. These diseases can be\ndifficult to diagnose due to the close relation of the musculoskeletal system to\nother internal systems. The musculoskeletal system refers to the system having\nits muscles attached to an internal skeletal system and is necessary for humans\nto move to a more favorable position. Complex issues and injuries involving the\nmusculoskeletal system are usually handled by a physiatrist (specialist in\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation) or an orthopaedic surgeon.\n","linknr":491,"url":"Musculoskeletal_system","recorded":1362891939,"links":40,"instances":["kinesiology","physics","biology","anatomy","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musculoskeletal system|*"],"headings":["Subsystems","Diseases and disorders","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Human_skeleton_front_en.svg/220px-Human_skeleton_front_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Illu_muscle_tissues.jpg/220px-Illu_muscle_tissues.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Muscles_anterior_labeled.png/220px-Muscles_anterior_labeled.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Muscle_posterior_labeled.png/220px-Muscle_posterior_labeled.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Illu_synovial_joint.jpg/220px-Illu_synovial_joint.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Musculoskeletal_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/220px-Musculoskeletal_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["tissue","biology"],["lumen","anatomy"],["cell","biology"],["elasticity","physics"],["extension","kinesiology"]],"members":["extension","elasticity","tissue","organ","cell","lumen"],"related":["Organ_(anatomy)","Animal","Muscular_system","Skeletal_system","Skeleton","Muscle","Cartilage","Tendons","Ligaments","Joints","Connective_tissue","Calcium","Phosphorus","Hematopoietic_system","Bone","Muscle","Connective_tissue","Tendon","Ligament","Muscles","Joint","Cartilage","Medical_diagnosis","Skeletal_system","Humans","Physiatrist","Physical_Medicine_and_Rehabilitation","Orthopaedic_surgeon","Blood","Skeleton","Long_bones","Short_bones","Flat_bones","Irregular_bones","Sesamoid_bones","Ligaments","Tendons","Muscles","Cartilage","Axial_skeleton","Appendicular_skeleton","Tissue_(biology)","Organs","Human_brain","Human_skull","Human_lungs","Rib_cage","Long_bones","Bone_marrow","Fatty","Connective_tissue","Cavity","Fat","Blood_cell","Red_blood_cells","Liver","Erythrocyte","Platelet","Leukocyte","Calcium","Phosphorus","Mineral_balance","Minerals","Bone","Cardiac_muscle","Skeletal_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Lumen_(anatomy)","Organs","Involuntary_muscle","Striated_muscle","Microscope","Heart","Blood","Joints","Nerve","Central_nervous_system","Mammals","Muscle_contraction","Motor_neuron","Somatic_nervous_system","Depolarization","Motor_neuron","Neurotransmitter","Nerve_terminal","Cell_(biology)","Neuromuscular_junction","Chemical_synapse","Sarcolemma","Action_potential","Semipermeable_membrane","Sarcolemma","Initiation","Fibrous_connective_tissue","Periosteum","Rigid_bones","Synovial_joint","Synarthrosis","Fibrous","Synovial_joint","Synovial_Fluid","Synovial_membrane","Friction","Articular_capsule","Ligament","Fibrous","Elastic_tissue","Dislocation","Elasticity_(physics)","Extension_(kinesiology)","Flexion","Fibrous_tissue","Synovial_membrane","Joint_capsule","Synovial_fluid","Musculoskeletal_disease","Circulatory_system","Nervous_system","Integumentary_system","Endocrine_system","Metabolism","Paralysis","Paresis","Ataxia","Infectious","Toxic","Nervous_system","Pregnancy","PGP","Diagnosis","Human_pelvic_girdle","Pain"]}
