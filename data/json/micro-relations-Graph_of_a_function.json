{"cursor":"5661","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, the 'graph' of a function f is the collection of all ordered\npairs (x, f(x)). In particular, if x is a real number, graph means the graphical\nrepresentation of this collection, in the form of a line chart, a curve on a\nCartesian plane, together with Cartesian axes, etc. Graphing on a Cartesian\nplane is sometimes referred to as curve sketching. If the function input x is an\nordered pair (x 1, x 2) of real numbers, the graph is the\ncollection of all ordered triples (x 1, x 2,\nf(x 1, x 2)), and its graphical representation is a surface\n(see three dimensional graph).\n\nThe graph of a function on real numbers is identical to the graphic\nrepresentation of the function. For general functions, the graphic\nrepresentation cannot be applied and the formal definition of the graph of a\nfunction suits the need of mathematical statements, e.g., the closed graph\ntheorem in functional analysis.\n\nThe concept of the graph of a function is generalized to the graph of a\nrelation. Note that although a function is always identified with its graph,\nthey are not the same because it will happen that two functions with different\ncodomain could have the same graph. For example, the cubic polynomial mentioned\nbelow is a surjection if its codomain is the real numbers but it is not if its\ncodomain is the complex field.\n\nTo test if a graph of a curve is a function of x, use the vertical line test. To\ntest if a graph of a curve is a function of y, use the horizontal line test. If\nthe function has an inverse, the graph of the inverse can be found by reflecting\nthe graph of the original function over the line y = x .\n\nIn science, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas, graphs are tools\nused for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a\nfunction of another, typically using rectangular axes; see [[Plot (graphics)]]\nfor details.\n","linknr":285,"url":"Graph_of_a_function","recorded":1362685864,"links":52,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","fiber_bundle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Charts","Functions and mappings"],"headings":["Examples","Generalizations","Tools for plotting function graphs","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/X%5E4-4%5Ex.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/b/5dbad057040ec6eb5aa5841786e25d33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Cubicpoly.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/f/76fd49e89aaba6edc62d2df7d1e8839d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/0/460d858819bcac175ad6c8843e18f5ba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Three-dimensional_graph.png/300px-Three-dimensional_graph.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Sinx2%2Bsiny2.jmb.jpg/120px-Sinx2%2Bsiny2.jmb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/6/9a6679b482a9170b3d8ecfd1cf6d2361.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/a/efa12d58e7f318db373662b678d9b4f3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/3/2837f4627bb8ac0bd503079019c89823.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/9/af93ae12c0dbed2f2cfef1d7c3ab023a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["relation","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["section","fiber_bundle"],["critical_point","mathematics"],["epigraph","mathematics"]],"members":["epigraph","function","critical_point","relation","section"],"related":["Function_(mathematics)","Ordered_pair","Real_number","Line_chart","Curve","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Ordered_triple","Surface","Three_dimensional_graph","Closed_graph_theorem","Functional_analysis","Relation_(mathematics)","Codomain","Surjection","Real_number","Complex_number","Curve","Function_(mathematics)","Vertical_line_test","Curve","Function_(mathematics)","Horizontal_line_test","Science","Engineering","Technology","Finance","Rectangular_coordinate_system","Real_line","Trigonometric","Sine","Cosine","Sine","Cosine","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Cartesian_product","Fibre_bundle","Section_(fiber_bundle)","Graphing_calculator","Oscilloscope","Paper","Pencil","List_of_graphing_software","Asymptote","Critical_point_(mathematics)","Derivative","Epigraph_(mathematics)","Chart","Stationary_point","Slope","Solution_point","Tetraview","Vertical_translation","Y-intercept","Graph_Theory"]}
