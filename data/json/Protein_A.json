It is encoded by the spa gene\nand its regulation is controlled by DNA topology, cellular osmolarity, and a two-\ncomponent system called ArlS-ArlR. It has found use in biochemical research\nbecause of its ability to bind immunoglobulins. It is composed of five\nhomologous Ig-binding domains that fold into a three-helix bundle. Each domain\nis able to bind proteins from many mammalian species, most notably IgGs. It\nbinds the heavy chain within the Fc region of most immunoglobulins and also\nwithin the Fab region in the case of the human VH3 family. Through these\ninteractions in serum, where IgG molecules are bound in the wrong orientation\n(in relation to normal antibody function), the bacteria disrupts opsonization\nand phagocytosis.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Protein_A","recorded":1362486713,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.gelifesciences.com/aptrix/upp00919.nsf/Content/B7A1BAD977A2AF13C1257628001D1ECD/$file/11003558AA.pdf","http://www.gelifesciences.com/aptrix/upp00919.nsf/Content/17D93C2E6A580E57C1257628001CE677/$file/18114994AE.pdf"],"categories":["Proteins","Staphylococcaceae"],"headings":["Protein A antibody binding","Other antibody binding proteins","Role in pathogenesis","Research","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Protein_A_1DEE_1L6X.png/220px-Protein_A_1DEE_1L6X.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Atomic_mass_unit","MSCRAMM","Protein","Bacterium","Two-component_regulatory_system","Immunoglobulins","IgG","Fc_region","Fab_region","Antibody","Opsonization","Phagocytosis","IgM","IgA","IgE","IgD","Protein_G","Protein_A/G","Protein_L","Fluorescent_dye","Enzyme","Biotin","Colloidal_gold","Agarose","Blood_serum","Ascites","Immunoprecipitation"]}
