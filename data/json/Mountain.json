A mountain is generally steeper than\na hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces\ncan locally raise the surface of the earth by over . Mountains erode slowly\nthrough the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains\nare isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\n\nHigh elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These\ncolder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations\nhave different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and\nclimate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource\nextraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.\n\nThe highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose\nsummit is above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the\nSolar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at
