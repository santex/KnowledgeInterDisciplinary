[http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/arthritis Healthline] [http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/arthritis-\nbasics Web MD] The most common form, osteoarthritis (degenerative joint\ndisease), is a result of trauma to the joint, infection of the joint, or age.\nOther arthritis forms are rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and related\nautoimmune diseases. Septic arthritis is caused by joint infection.\n\nThe major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is joint pain. Pain is\noften a constant and may be localized to the joint affected. The pain from\narthritis is due to inflammation that occurs around the joint, damage to the\njoint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle strains caused by\nforceful movements against stiff painful joints and fatigue.\n","linknr":693,"url":"Arthritis","recorded":1362503665,"links":65,"instances":["mood","medicine","anatomy","biology","orthopaedic","dermatology","medicine","medical","medicine","injury","anatomy","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aging-associated diseases","Arthritis|","Inflammations","Rheumatology","Skeletal disorders"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Arthrite_rhumatoide.jpg/325px-Arthrite_rhumatoide.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["strain","injury"],["fatigue","medical"],["nodule","medicine"],["bursa","anatomy"],["ulcer","dermatology"],["swelling","medical"],["tenderness","medicine"],["flexibility","anatomy"],["depression","mood"],["tissue","biology"],["remission","medicine"],["brace","orthopaedic"]],"members":["depression","remission","bursa","tissue","brace","ulcer","nodule","swelling","tenderness","strain","flexibility","fatigue"],"related":["Rheumatoid_arthritis","Arthropathy","Inflammation","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Psoriatic_arthritis","Autoimmune_disorder","Septic_arthritis","Infection","Joint_pain","Inflammation","Strain_(injury)","Fatigue_(medical)","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Gout","Calcium_pyrophosphate_deposition_disease","Septic_arthritis","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Juvenile_idiopathic_arthritis","Still's_disease","Psoriasis","Psoriatic_arthritis","Reactive_arthritis","Ehlers-Danlos_Syndrome","Haemochromatosis","Hepatitis","Lyme_disease","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Crohn's_Disease","Ulcerative_Colitis","Henoch-Schönlein_purpura","Hyperimmunoglobulinemia_D_with_recurrent_fever","Sarcoidosis","TNF_receptor_associated_periodic_syndrome","Wegener's_granulomatosis","Vasculitis","Familial_Mediterranean_fever","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Rheumatic_disease","Cutaneous","Nodule_(medicine)","Vasculitis","Lesions","Lymphadenopathy","Oedema","Human_eye","Inflammation","Urethritis","Tenosynovitis","Tendon","Effusion","Bursitis","Bursa_(anatomy)","Diarrhea","Ulcer_(dermatology)","Swelling_(medical)","Joint_stiffness","Hand","Walking","Malaise","Weight_loss","Sleep","Myalgia","Tenderness_(medicine)","Weakness","Flexibility_(anatomy)","Aerobic_exercise","Disability","Absenteeism","Physician","Health_care","Cholesterol","Heart_disease","Depression_(mood)","Pain","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Osteoarthritis","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Tissue_(biology)","Cartilage","Deformity","Rash","Fever","Pain","Corticosteroid","Monoclonal_antibodies","Intravenous_therapy","Infliximab","Collagen","Vascular","Lupus_erythematosus","Photosensitivity","Baldness","Kidney","Gout","Uric_acid","Calcium_pyrophosphate_deposition_disease","Osteoarthritis","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Gouty_arthritis","Diagnosis_lag_time","Diagnosis_lag_time","Knee","Vertebral_column","Proximal_interphalangeal_joint","Metacarpophalangeal_joint","Wrist","Ankle","Knee","Great_toe","Ankle","Knee","Elbow","Radiologic","Osteophyte","Osteosclerosis","Subchondral_cyst","Anemia","Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate","C-reactive_protein","Rheumatoid_factor","Anti-citrullinated_protein_antibody","Crystal","Bouchard's_nodes","Heberden's_node","Ulnar_deviation","Swan_neck_deformity","Boutonniere_deformity","Tophus","Nephrolithiasis","Infectious_arthritis","Psoriasis","Remission_(medicine)","Physical_therapy","Brace_(orthopaedic)","Joint_replacement_surgery","Occupational_therapy","Osteoarthritis","Acetaminophen","Inflammatory_arthritis","Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs","Ibuprofen","Ethnic_group","4500_BC","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","Tennessee","Kansas","Ötzi_the_Iceman","Mummy","Italy","Austria","William_Musgrave","Blood_test","X-ray","Rheumatoid_factor","Antinuclear_factor","Extractable_nuclear_antigen","Arthritis_Care","Arthritis_Foundation","Knee_arthritis","Osteoimmunology"]}
