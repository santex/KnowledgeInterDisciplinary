{"cursor":"82370","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Food vs. fuel' is the dilemma regarding the risk of diverting farmland or\ncrops for biofuels production in detriment of the food supply on a global scale.\nThe \"food vs. fuel\" or \"food or fuel\" debate is international in scope, with\nvalid arguments on all sides of the issue. There is disagreement about how\nsignificant the issue is, what is causing it, and what can or should be done\nabout it. [http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-\npolicies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf The Impact of US\nBiofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility], By Bruce A.\nBabcock, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University,\nfor ICTSD, Issue Paper No. 35. June 2011.\n\nBiofuel production has increased in recent years. Some commodities like maize\n(corn), sugar cane or vegetable oil can be used either as food, feed, or to make\nbiofuels. For example, since 2006, a portion of land that was also formerly used\nto grow other crops in the United States is now used to grow corn for biofuels,\nand a larger share of corn is destined to ethanol production, reaching 25% in\n2007. A major debate exists on the extent to which\nbiofuels policies contributed to high agricultural prices levels and volatility.\nA recent study for the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable\nDevelopment shows that market-driven expansion of ethanol in the US increased\nmaize prices by 21 percent in 2009, in comparison with what prices would have\nbeen had ethanol production been frozen at 2004 levels.\nLester R. Brown claimed that, since converting the entire grain harvest of the\nUS would only produce 16% of its auto fuel needs, energy markets are effectively\nplaced in competition with food markets for scarce arable land, resulting in\nhigher food prices. A lot of R&D efforts are currently being put into\nthe production of second generation biofuels from non-food crops, crop residues\nand waste. See for example the Biomass Program under the US Department of\nEnergy: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/ Second generation biofuels\ncould hence potentially combine farming for food and fuel and moreover,\nelectricity could be generated simultaneously, which could be beneficial for\ndeveloping countries and rural areas in developed countries. With\nglobal demand for biofuels on the increase due to the oil price increases taking\nplace since 2003 and the desire to reduce oil dependency as well as reduce GHG\nemissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential destruction\nof natural habitats by being converted into farmland.\nEnvironmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several\nyears, but now the debate reached a\nglobal scale due to the 2007â2008 world food price crisis. On the other hand,\nseveral studies do show that biofuel production can be significantly increased\nwithout increased acreage. Therefore stating that the crisis in hand relies on\nthe food scarcity. See for example: the US (DOE and USDA) \"Billion Ton\nReport\": http://feedstockreview.ornl.gov/pdf/billion_ton_vision.pdf or an EU\n(Refuel) report http://www.refuel.eu/fileadmin/refuel/user/docs/REFUEL_D19a_fly-\ner_feedstock_potentials.pdf {{cite web\n | url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/06/opinion/edsimoes.php title= FOOD\n | AND FUEL II - Biofuels will help fight hunger\n |date= 2007-08-06 |publisher= [[International Herald Tribune]]\n | accessdate= 2008-04-15 }} [http://www.guardian.co.uk/-\n | commentisfree/2008/feb/28/alternativeenergy.biofuels Through biofuels we can\n | reap the fruits of our labours]\n\nBrazil has been considered to have the world's first sustainable biofuels\neconomy From The\nEconomist print edition and its government claims Brazil's sugar cane\nbased ethanol industry has not contributed to the 2008 food crisis.

World Bank concluded that their previous study may have\noverestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as \"the effect of biofuels\non food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of\ncommodities by financial investors (the so-called \"financialisation of\ncommodities\") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike.\" A 2008 independent study by OECD also found that the\nimpact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller.\n","linknr":1118,"url":"Food_vs._Fuel","recorded":1362500006,"links":47,"instances":["pricing_policy","fruit","1990","federal_republic","author"],"pdf":["http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10057/04-08-Ethanol.pdf","http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10057/04-08-Ethanol.pdf","http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf","http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf","http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080410052938/http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf","http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080410052938/http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf","http://feedstockreview.ornl.gov/pdf/billion_ton_vision.pdf","http://www.refuel.eu/fileadmin/refuel/user/docs/REFUEL_D19a_flyer_feedstock_potentials.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2008/07/28/000020439_20080728103002/Rendered/PDF/WP4682.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2008/07/28/000020439_20080728103002/Rendered/PDF/WP4682.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/07/21/000158349_20100721110120/Rendered/PDF/WPS5371.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/07/21/000158349_20100721110120/Rendered/PDF/WPS5371.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/62/41007840.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/62/41007840.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/28/000020439_20080728103002/Rendered/PDF/WP4682.pdf","http://www.biodiesel.org/resources/sustainability/pdfs/Food%20and%20FuelApril162008.pdf","http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf","http://www.ncga.com/news/OurView/pdf/2006/FoodANDFuel.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2008/Resources/2795087-1192112387976/WDR08_05_Focus_B.pdf","http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2008/Resources/2795087-1192112387976/WDR08_05_Focus_B.pdf","http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf","http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf","http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/1812/lecg_work_bank_critique.pdf","http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/1812/lecg_work_bank_critique.pdf","http://www.unep.fr/scp/rpanel/pdf/Assessing_Biofuels_Full_Report.pdf","http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/07/21/000158349_20100721110120/Rendered/PDF/WPS5371.pdf","http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2010/march/tradoc_145954.pdf"],"categories":["Biofuels","Peak
