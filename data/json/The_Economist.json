Retrieved 12 September 2009. \"[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/maps/ Maps].\" City of Westminster.\nRetrieved 28 August 2009. Continuous publication began under founder James\nWilson in September 1843. For historical reasons The Economist refers to itself\nas a newspaper, but each print edition appears on small glossy paper like a news\nmagazine, and its YouTube channel is called\nEconomistMagazine. [http://www.youtube.com/user/EconomistMagazine\nEconomistMagazine] â The Economist YouTube feed In 2006, its average\nweekly circulation was reported to be 1.5 million, about half of which were sold\nin the United States.\n\nThe publication belongs to The Economist Group, half of which is owned by\n'[[Pearson PLC]]' via the [[Financial Times]]. A group of independent\nshareholders, including many members of the staff and the Rothschild banking\nfamily of England, owns the rest. A board of trustees formally\nappoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission.\n\nThe Economist claims that it \"is not a chronicle of economics.\"\nRather, it aims \"to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which\npresses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\" It takes an editorial stance of classical and economic\nliberalism which is supportive of free trade, globalisation, free immigration\nand a few socially liberal causes (such as supporting legal recognition for gay\nmarriage).\n\nIt targets highly educated readers and claims an audience containing many\ninfluential executives and policy-makers. Some of The Economist\nreaders consume both elite and mass media. The newspaper's CEO described this\nrecent global change, which was first noticed in the 1990s and accelerated in\nthe beginning of the 21st century, as a \"new age of Mass\nIntelligence\".
