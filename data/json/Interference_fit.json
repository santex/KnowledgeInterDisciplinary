Typical examples of interference fits are the press fitting of shafts\ninto bearings or bearings into their housings and the attachment of watertight\nconnectors to cables. An interference fit also results when pipe fittings are\nassembled and tightened.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Interference_fit","recorded":1362567187,"links":17,"instances":["engineering","information","mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanical engineering","Metalworking terminology"],"headings":["Introducing interference between parts","Tightness of fit","Assembling","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bearing","mechanical"],["allowance","engineering"],["table","information"]],"members":["allowance","table","bearing"],"related":["Friction","Tensile_strength","Compressive_strength","Bearing_(mechanical)","Cable","Real_versus_nominal_value","Torque","Allowance_(engineering)","Table_(information)","Stainless_steel","Hydraulic","Arbor_press","Jackscrew","Rack_and_pinion","Chamfer","Heat","Shrink-fitting","Tempering","Coiled_spring_pins","Engineering_fit","Engineering_tolerance","Statistical_interference"]}
