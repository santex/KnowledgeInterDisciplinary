Early civilizations were familiar with the custom of\nspearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks.\n\nToday modern spearfishing makes use of elastic powered spearguns and slings, or\ncompressed gas pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish.\nSpecialized techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of\naquatic environments and target fish.\n\nSpearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkeling, or scuba diving\ntechniques. Spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some\ncountries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some\ncountries and jurisdictions. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no\nbait and has no by-catch.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Spearfishing","recorded":1372152291,"links":[],"instances":["wisconsin","swimming","polybius"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Underwater diving procedures","Fishing techniques and methods","Recreational fishing","Free-diving","Underwater diving"],"headings":["History","Traditional","Modern","Equipment","Management","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["the_histories","polybius"],["snorkel","swimming"],["fox_river","wisconsin"],["snorkel","swimming"]],"members":["fox_river","snorkel","the_histories"],"related":["Fishing","Speargun","Free-diving","Snorkeling","Scuba_diving","By-catch","Harpoon","Cosquer_cave","Bible","Book_of_Job","Polybius","The_Histories_(Polybius)","Harpoon","Oppian","Gladiator","Retiarius","Trident","Net_casting","Murmillo","Helmet","Copper","Harappa","Mincopie","India","Andaman_and_Nicobar","Retiarius","Secutor","Spear","Trident","Frog_gigging","Bullfrog","Carp","Speargun","Scuba_set","Mediterranean","France","Italy","Diving_mask","Swimfin","Snorkel_(swimming)","Scuba_diving","Rebreather","Italy","Italian_Navy","Decima_Flottiglia_MAS","World_War_II","Atlantic_goliath_grouper","Caribbean","Bonaire","Nassau_grouper","Belize","Black_sea_bass","California","Australia","Headlands","Reef","Kelp","Pacific","Shark","Pelagic_fish","Hawaiian_sling","Fish_Aggregating_Device","New_Zealand","Yellowtail_amberjack","Cobia","Grouper","Great_Barrier_Reef","Wahoo","Dogtooth_tuna","Trophy_hunting","Chumming","Marlin","Tuna","Trevally","Sensory_deprivation","South_Africa","Yellowfin_tuna","Australia","Spanish_Mackerel","Pacific","Dogtooth_tuna","Carp","Gar","Ameiurus","Lepomis","Crappies","Striped_bass","Catfish","Walleyes","Salmon","Fox_River_(Wisconsin)","Refraction","Blackwell_Publishing","Bowfishing","Gigging","Speargun","Polespear","Aluminum","Titanium","Fiberglass","Carbon_fiber","Hawaiian_sling","Wetsuit","Iki_jime","Epinephrine","Buoy","Iki_jime","Snorkel_(swimming)","Diving_mask","Scuba_diving","Australia","Australian_Underwater_Federation","Norway","Fish_migration","Salmon","Trout","Lobster","Mexico","United_States","Florida","Powerhead","California","Underwater_target_shooting"]}
