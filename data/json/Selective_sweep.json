{"cursor":"9866","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'selective sweep' is the reduction or elimination of variation among the\nnucleotides in neighboring DNA of a mutation as the result of recent and strong\npositive natural selection.\n\nA selective sweep can occur when a new mutation occurs that increases the\nfitness of the carrier relative to other members of the population. Natural\nselection will favour individuals that have a higher fitness and with time the\nnewly mutated variant (allele) will increase in frequency relative to other\nalleles. As its prevalence increases, neutral and nearly neutral genetic\nvariation linked to the new mutation will also become more prevalent. This\nphenomenon is called [[genetic hitchhiking]]. A strong selective sweep results\nin a region of the genome where the positively selected haplotype (the mutated\nallele and its neighbours) is essentially the only one that exists in the\npopulation, resulting in a large reduction of the total genetic variation in\nthat chromosome region.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Selective_sweep","recorded":1362483381,"links":15,"instances":["biology","human","human","human","human","human","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics","Selection","Mutation"],"headings":["Detecting selective sweeps","Relevance to Disease","Involvement in Agriculture and Domestication","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["chromosome_1","human"],["chromosome_2","human"],["chromosome_4","human"],["chromosome_8","human"],["chromosome_12","human"],["chromosome_22","human"]],"members":["fitness","chromosome_8","chromosome_2","chromosome_4","chromosome_22","chromosome_12","chromosome_1"],"related":["Genetic_variation","Nucleotide","DNA","Mutation","Natural_selection","Fitness_(biology)","Population","Haplotype","Chromosome","Linkage_disequilibrium","Genetic_recombination","Chromosome_1_(human)","Chromosome_2_(human)","Chromosome_4_(human)","Chromosome_8_(human)","Chromosome_12_(human)","Chromosome_22_(human)","Influenza","Antigenic_drift","Genetic_hitchhiking","TSHR","Photoperiod","International_HapMap_Project","Hill-Robertson_effect"]}
