{"cursor":"25646","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Proportional representation' ('PR') is a concept in voting systems used to\nelect an assembly or council. PR means that the number of seats won by a party\nor group of candidates is proportionate to the number of votes received. For\nexample, under a PR voting system, if 30% of voters support a particular party\nthen roughly 30% of seats will be won by that party. PR is an alternative to\nvoting systems based on single-member districts or on bloc voting; these non-PR\nsystems tend to produce disproportionate outcomes and to have a bias in favour\nof larger political groups. PR systems tend to produce a proliferation of\npolitical parties. There are many different forms of proportional\nrepresentation. Some are focused solely on achieving the proportional\nrepresentation of different political parties (such as list PR) while others\npermit the voter to choose between individual candidates (such as STV-PR). The\ndegree of proportionality also varies; it is determined by factors such as the\nprecise formula used to allocate seats, the number of seats in each\nconstituency or in the elected body as a whole, and the level of any minimum\nthreshold for election.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Proportional_representation","recorded":1362556018,"links":49,"instances":["politics","united_states","ireland","postal_reformer","parliament","australia","united_states"],"pdf":["http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27685/1/Review_of_Paradoxes_Afflicting_Various_Voting_Procedures_(LSERO).pdf","http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27685/1/Review_of_Paradoxes_Afflicting_Various_Voting_Procedures_(LSERO).pdf"],"categories":["Proportional
