{"cursor":"26897","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Albedo', or reflection coefficient, derived from Latin albedo \"whiteness\" (or\nreflected sunlight), in turn from albus \"white\", is the diffuse reflectivity or\nreflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation\nfrom the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a dimensionless fraction,\nit may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero\nfor no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect\nreflection of a white surface.\n\nAlbedo depends on the frequency of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it\nusually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light.\nIn general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming\nradiation. Exceptions are Lambertian surfaces, which scatter radiation in all\ndirections according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on\nthe incident distribution. In practice, a bidirectional reflectance distribution\nfunction (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a\nsurface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.\n\nThe albedo is an important concept in climatology and astronomy, as well as in\ncalculating reflectivity of surfaces in LEED sustainable rating systems for\nbuildings, computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of\nEarth, its planetary albedo, is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds,\nbut varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and\nenvironmental features.

work\n[[Photometria]].\n","linknr":601,"url":"Albedo","recorded":1362371921,"links":92,"instances":["solar","astronomy","moon","satellite","dwarf_planet","astronomy","satellite","h"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20090601063932/http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod09.pdf","http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod09.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090601063932/http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod09.pdf","http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~sgw/PAPERS/2002_Snowball.pdf","http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~sgw/PAPERS/2002_Snowball.pdf","http://www.clim-past.net/2/31/2006/cp-2-31-2006.pdf","http://www.clim-past.net/2/31/2006/cp-2-31-2006.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090920212836/http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/staff/smithrobin/IC_JClim-final.pdf","http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/staff/smithrobin/IC_JClim-final.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20090920212836/http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/fileadmin/staff/smithrobin/IC_JClim-final.pdf","http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2011/EPSC-DPS2011-137-8.pdf","http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC-DPS2011/EPSC-DPS2011-137-8.pdf","http://vih.freeshell.org/pp/01-ONW-St.Petersburg/Fresnel.pdf","http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf","http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~eardvs/papers/spracklen08c.pdf","http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~eardvs/papers/spracklen08c.pdf"],"categories":["Climate
