Typically\nresources are materials, money, services, staff, or other assets that are\ntransformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made\nunavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth,\nmeeting needs or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being.\nFrom a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the\nenvironment to satisfy human needs and wants. Miller,\nG.T., and S. Spoolman. 2011. Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections,\nand Solutions, 17th ed. Brooks-Cole, Belmont, CA. ISBN 0-538-73534-1. From\na broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of\na living organism (see biological resource). Ricklefs, R.E. 2005. The\nEconomy of Nature, 6th ed. WH Freeman, New York, NY. ISBN 0-7167-8697-4.\n\nThe concept of resources has been applied in diverse realms, including with\nrespect to economics, biology, computer science, land management, and human\nresources, and is linked to the concepts of competition, sustainability,\nconservation, and stewardship. In application within human society, commercial\nor non-commercial factors require resource allocation through resource\nmanagement.\n\nResources have three main characteristics: utility, limited availability, and\npotential for depletion or consumption. Resources have been variously\ncategorized as biotic versus abiotic, renewable versus non-renewable, and\npotential versus actual, along with more elaborate classifications.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Resources","recorded":1362566981,"links":35,"instances":["biophysical","economics","economics","economics","economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Resources|","Resource economics","Ecology"],"headings":["Economic resources","Biological resources","Economic versus biological resources","Computer resources","Land or natural resources","Labor or human resources","Capital or infrastructure","Tangible versus intangible resources","Resource use and sustainable development","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resource","biology"],["consumption","economics"],["resource","economics"],["land","economics"],["capital","economics"],["resource","biology"],["resource","computer_science"],["land","economics"],["capital","economics"],["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["environment","biophysical"],["resource","biology"],["resource","computer_science"],["resource","economics"]],"members":["environment","land","resource","good","consumption","service","capital"],"related":["Benefit","Natural_resource","Natural_environment","Resource_(biology)","Economics","Biology","Computer_science","Land_management","Human_resources","Competition","Sustainability","Conservation_movement","Stewardship","Resource_allocation","Resource_management","Utility","Scarcity","Resource_depletion","Consumption_(economics)","Biotic","Abiotic","Renewable_resource","Non-renewable_resource","Economics","Resource_(economics)","Supply_and_demand","Productivity","Goods_and_services","Classical_economics","Entrepreneurship","Land_(economics)","Labour_economics","Capital_(economics)","Natural_resources","Raw_materials","Human_resources","Wage","Infrastructure","Interest","Entrepreneur","Management","Risk","Leadership","Visionary","Biology","Ecology","Developmental_biology","Maintenance_of_an_organism","Reproduction","Resource_(biology)","Anthropocentrism","Biocentric","Ecocentric","Resource_(computer_science)","Computer","Information_management","Natural_resources","Natural_environment","Natural_resources","Sustainability","Land_(economics)","Water","Air","Minerals","Biosphere","Fish","Minerals","Petroleum","Petroleum","Wood_processing","Cost","Non-renewable_resources","Geological_period","Resource_depletion","Sustainable_yield","Ecological_footprint","Human_resources","Project_management","Economics","Capital_(economics)","Durable_good","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Depreciation","Production_process","Sustainable_development","Stewardship","Resource_distribution","Economic_inequality","Sustainable_development","Environment_(biophysical)","Environmental_degradation","Over-consumption","Resource_curse","Resource_depletion","Tragedy_of_the_commons","Economic_growth","Ethical_consumerism","Prosperity","Quality_of_life","Sustainability","Wealth","Natural_resource","Natural_resource_management","Resource-based_view","Resource_(biology)","Resource_(computer_science)","Resource_(economics)"]}
