There are 308 members as of 2011, but that will rise to 338 for the next\nelection.\nMembers are elected by simple plurality ('first-past-the-post' system) in each\nof the country's electoral districts, which are colloquially known as\n[[electoral district (Canada)|riding]]s. MPs may hold office until\nParliament is dissolved and serve for constitutionally limited terms of up to\nfive years after an election. Historically however, terms have ended before\ntheir expiry and the sitting government has typically dissolved parliament\nwithin four years of an election according to a long-standing convention.\nNotwithstanding this, an Act of Parliament now limits each term to four years.\nSeats in the House of Commons are distributed roughly in proportion to the\npopulation of each province and territory. However, some ridings are more\npopulous than others and the Canadian constitution contains some special\nprovisions regarding provincial representation; thus, there is some\ninterprovincial and regional malapportionment based on population.\n\nThe House of Commons was established in 1867, when the Constitution Act, 1867,\nformerly the BNA Act (British North America Act), created the Dominion of\nCanada, and was modelled on the British House of Commons. The lower of the two\nhouses making up the parliament, the House of Commons in practice holds far more\npower than the upper house, the Senate. Although the approval of both Houses is\nnecessary for legislation, the Senate very rarely rejects bills passed by the\nCommons (though the Senate does occasionally amend bills). Moreover, the\nGovernment of Canada is responsible solely to the House of Commons. The Prime\nMinister stays in office only as long as he or she retains the support, or\n\"confidence\", of the lower house.\n\nIt is widely thought that \"Commons\" is a shortening of the word \"commoners\".\nHowever, the term derives from the Anglo-Norman word communes, referring to the\ngeographic and collective \"communities\" of their parliamentary representatives\nand not the third estate, the commonality. A. F. Pollard, The Evolution of\nParliament (Longmans, 1920), 107â08. This distinction is made clear in the\nofficial French name of the body, Chambre des communes. Canada and the United\nKingdom remain the only countries to use the name \"House of Commons\" for a lower\nhouse of parliament.\n\nThe Canadian House of Commons chamber is located in the Centre Block of the\nParliament Buildings on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, Ontario.\n","linknr":866,"url":"Canadian_House_of_Commons","recorded":1362560002,"links":64,"instances":["heraldry","canada","canada","tv_channel","canada","vote","canada","politician","canada","politics","canada","canada","club","politics","canada"],"pdf":["http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/process/house/guide/PDFs/Guide_to_the_Canadian_HOC_v3.pdf","http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/process/house/guide/PDFs/Guide_to_the_Canadian_HOC_v3.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/G10.pdf"],"categories":["House
