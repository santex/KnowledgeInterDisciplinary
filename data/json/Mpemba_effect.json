{"cursor":"15116","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Mpemba effect', named after Tanzanian student Erasto Mpemba, is the\nassertion that warmer water can sometimes freeze faster than colder water.\nAlthough there is anecdotal support for the effect, there is no agreement on\nexactly what the effect is and under what circumstances it occurs. There have\nbeen reports of similar phenomena since ancient times, although with\ninsufficient detail for the claims to be replicated.\n\nThe phenomenon seems contrary to thermodynamics, but a number of possible\nexplanations for the effect have been proposed. Further investigations will need\nto decide on a precise definition of \"freezing\" and control a vast number of\nstarting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect.\n","linknr":331,"url":"Mpemba_effect","recorded":1362372260,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://robot-tag.com/evan/ajp-mpemba.pdf","http://robot-tag.com/evan/ajp-mpemba.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0031-9120/14/7/312/pev14i7p410.pdf","http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0031-9120/14/7/312/pev14i7p410.pdf"],"categories":["Physical paradoxes","Thermodynamics","Phase transitions"],"headings":["Historical observations","Mpemba's observations","Effect definition","Suggested explanations","Recent view of the Mpemba effect","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tanzania","Erasto_Mpemba","Water","Freezing","Thermodynamics","Aristotle","Aristotle","Early_modern","Francis_Bacon","Francis_Bacon","Latin","Ren√©_Descartes","Tanzania","Erasto_Mpemba","Tanganyika","O_levels","Iringa","Tanzania","Dar_Es_Salaam","Physics","Convection","Thermodynamics","Endothermic","Heat_transfer","CITV","Thermal_insulation","Hypothesis","Calcium_carbonate","Magnesium_carbonate","Solvation","Gas","Computational_fluid_dynamics","Royal_Society_of_Chemistry","Leidenfrost_effect","University_of_California","London_South_Bank_University"]}
