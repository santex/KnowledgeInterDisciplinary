For example, some organisms such as insects may live\nin the homes of gophers and feed on debris, fungi, roots, etc. The most widely\ndistributed types of inquiline are those found in association with the nests of\nsocial insects, especially ants and termites â a single colony may support\ndozens of different inquiline species. The distinctions between parasites,\nsocial parasites, and inquilines are subtle, and many species may fulfill the\ncriteria for more than one of these, as inquilines do exhibit many of the same\ncharacteristics of parasites. However, parasites are specifically not\ninquilines, because by definition they have a deleterious effect on the host\nspecies, while inquilines do not.\n\nExamples of the inquiline relation are known especially among the gall wasps\n([[Cynipidae]] family). In the sub-family Synerginae this mode of life\npredominates. These insects differ but little in structure from the true gall-\ninducing wasps, but they cannot produce galls and consequently deposit their\neggs within those of other species. They infest certain species of galls, such\nas those of the blackberry and some oak galls, in large numbers, and sometimes\nmore than one kind occur in a single gall. Perhaps the most remarkable feature\nof these inquilines is their frequent close resemblance to the insect that\nproduces the gall they infest.

For example, [[Wyeomyia smithii]],\n[[Metriocnemus knabi]], and [[Habrotrocha rosa]] are three invertebrates that\nmake up part of the microecosystem within the pitchers of [[Sarracenia\npurpurea]].
