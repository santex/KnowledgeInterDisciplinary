This is generally\na glucose level higher than 11.1 mmol/l\n(200 '[[Blood_sugar#Units|mg/dl]]'). Reference ranges for blood tests are\n11.1 'mmol/l', but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher\nvalues such as 250â300 mg/dl or 15â20  mmol/l. A subject with a\nconsistent range between 100 and 126 (American Diabetes Association guidelines)\nis considered hyperglycemic, while above 126 mg/dl or 7 mmol/l is generally held\nto have diabetes. Chronic levels exceeding 7 mmol/l (125 mg/dl) can\nproduce organ damage.\n\nThe origin of the term is Greek: hyper-, meaning excessive; -glyc-, meaning\nsweet; and -emia, meaning of the blood.\n","linknr":363,"url":"Hyperglycemia","recorded":1362482031,"links":40,"instances":["physical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Disorders of endocrine pancreas","Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings for blood"],"headings":["Definition","Signs and symptoms","Causes","Complications","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","physical"]],"members":["fatigue"],"related":["American_and_British_English_differences","Hypoglycemia","Glucose","Blood_plasma","Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests","Diabetes","Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests","Greek_language","Millimoles","Hypoglycemic","Blood_sugar","HbA1c","Diabetic_retinopathy","Diabetic_neuropathy","Metformin","Osmotic_diuresis","Polyphagia","Polydipsia","Polyuria","Blurred_vision","Fatigue_(physical)","Weight_loss","Wound","Dry_mouth","Skin","Erectile_dysfunction","Infection","Otitis_externa","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Stupor","Coma","Glycosuria","Osmotic_diuresis","Diabetic_Ketoacidosis","Ketoacidosis","Kussmaul_hyperventilation","Glycosuria","Diabetes_mellitus","Insulin","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Glycogen","Corticosteroids","Octreotide","Beta_blocker","Epinephrine","Thiazide","Diuretic","Niacin","Pentamidine","Protease_inhibitors","L-asparaginase","Antipsychotic","Stimulants","Amphetamine","Hypoglycemia","Zyprexa","Cymbalta","Stroke","Myocardial_infarction","Ketoacidosis","Ketosis","Insulin","Anti-diabetic_medication","Hypoglycemia","Diabetes","Prediabetes","American_Diabetes_Association","MedlinePlus"]}
