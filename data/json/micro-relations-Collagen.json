{"cursor":"57112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Collagen' () is a group of naturally occurring proteins found in animals,\nespecially in the flesh and connective tissues of vertebrates. It is\nthe main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in\nmammals, making up about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein\ncontent. Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous\ntissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea,\ncartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. The fibroblast\nis the most common cell which creates collagen.\n\nIn muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen\nconstitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the\nweight of strong, tendinous muscles. Gelatin, which is used in food\nand industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed.\n","linknr":1125,"url":"Collagen","recorded":1362481937,"links":61,"instances":["biology","biochemistry","chemistry","injury","weapon","sausage","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structural
