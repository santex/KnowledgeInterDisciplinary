The uranium-236, in turn, splits\n into fast-moving lighter elements (fission products) and releases three free\n neutrons. At the same time, one or more \"prompt gamma rays\" (not shown) are\n produced, as well.]]\n\nIn nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, 'nuclear fission' is either a nuclear\nreaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits\ninto smaller parts (lighter nuclei), often producing free neutrons and photons\n(in the form of gamma rays), and releasing a very large amount of energy, even\nby the energetic standards of radioactive decay. The two nuclei produced are\nmost often of comparable but slightly different sizes, typically with a mass\nratio of products of about 3 to 2, for common fissile\nisotopes. Most fissions are binary fissions (producing\ntwo charged fragments), but occasionally (2 to 4 times per 1000 events), three\npositively charged fragments are produced, in a ternary fission. The smallest\nof these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an\nargon nucleus.\n\nFission as encountered in the modern world is usually a deliberately produced\nman-made nuclear reaction induced by a neutron. It is less commonly encountered\nas a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay (not requiring a neutron),\noccurring especially in very high-mass-number isotopes. The unpredictable\ncomposition of the products (which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat\nchaotic manner) distinguishes fission from purely quantum-tunnelling processes\nsuch as proton emission, alpha decay and cluster decay, which give the same\nproducts each time.\n\nNuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered in 1938 by Meitner, Hahn and\nFrisch, and named by analogy with biological fission of living cells. It is an\nexothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as\nelectromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments (heating the\nbulk material where fission takes place). In order for fission to produce\nenergy, the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be greater than\nthat of the starting element. Fission is a form of nuclear transmutation because\nthe resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom.\n\nNuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and to drive the explosion of\nnuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called\nnuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit\nneutrons when they break apart. This makes possible a self-sustaining nuclear\nchain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or\nat a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the\namount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as\ngasoline, making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of\nnuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy\nelements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant\namounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. Concerns over nuclear\nwaste accumulation and over the destructive potential of nuclear weapons may\ncounterbalance the desirable qualities of fission as an energy source, and give\nrise to ongoing political debate over nuclear power.\n","linknr":1100,"url":"Nuclear_fission","recorded":1362512984,"links":112,"instances":["geology","nuclear_propulsion","nuclear","statistics","nuclear_test","singularity","biology","by_element"],"pdf":["http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/rutherford11/eng.pdf","http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/rutherford11/eng.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/22.54/resources/Chadwick.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/22.54/resources/Chadwick.pdf","http://chemistry.org.il/booklet/21/pdf/bob_weintraub.pdf","http://nuclearplanet.com/Kuroda%201956.pdf","http://nuclearplanet.com/Kuroda%201956.pdf","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v1.pdf","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v1.pdf","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v2.pdf","http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v2.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear
