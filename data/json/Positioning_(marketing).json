In the classic example of Avis claiming \"No.2, We Try\nHarder,\" the point was to say something so shocking (it was by the standards\nof the day) that it cleared space in your brain and made you forget all about\nwho was #1, rather than making some philosophical point about being \"hungry\"\nfor business.\n\nThe growth of high-tech marketing may have had much to do with the shift in\ndefinition towards competitive positioning. An important component of hi-tech\nmarketing in the age of the world wide web is positioning in major search\nengines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing, which can be accomplished through\nSearch Engine Optimization, also known as SEO. This is an especially\nimportant component when attempting to improve competitive positioning among\na younger demographic, which tends to be Web oriented in their shopping and\npurchasing habits as a result of being highly connected and involved in\nsocial media in general.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Positioning_(marketing)","recorded":1362483701,"links":27,"instances":["in_marketing","in_marketing","in_marketing","origins_of_technical_term","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Marketing"],"headings":["Definitions","Brand positioning process","Product positioning process","Positioning concepts","Measuring the positioning","Repositioning a company","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","business"],["multi_dimensional_scaling","in_marketing"],["conjoint_analysis","in_marketing"],["logit_analysis","in_marketing"],["placebo","origins_of_technical_term"]],"members":["conjoint_analysis","logit_analysis","multi_dimensional_scaling","placebo","product"],"related":["Marketing","Product_(business)","Brand","Avis_Rent_a_Car_System","World_wide_web","Search_Engine_Optimization","Jack_Trout","Target_market","Mind_share","Stock_profile","Perceptual_mapping","Statistical_survey","Multi_dimensional_scaling_(in_marketing)","Factor_analysis","Conjoint_analysis_(in_marketing)","Logit_analysis_(in_marketing)","Brand_management","Brand_community","Customer_engagement","Marketing","Marketing_management","Target_market","Product_management","Market_segment","Product_differentiation","Proximity_mapping","Marketing_plan","Sustainable_competitive_advantage","Strategic_management","Marketing_strategies","Placebo_(origins_of_technical_term)","Points-of-parity/points-of-difference","Right-time_marketing","List_of_renamed_products"]}
