April 1 is not a national\nholiday, but is widely recognized and celebrated in various countries as a day\nwhen people play practical jokes and hoaxes on each other called April\nfools.\n\nIn Italy, France and Belgium, children and adults traditionally tack paper\nfishes on each other's back as a trick and shout \"April fish!\" in their local\nlanguages (pesce d'aprile!, poisson d'avril! and aprilvis! in Italian, French\nand Flemish, respectively). Such fish feature prominently on many late 19th to\nearly 20th century French April Fools' Day postcards.\n\nThe earliest recorded association between April 1 and foolishness is an\nambiguous reference in Chaucer's [[Canterbury Tales]] (1392). Many writers\nsuggest that the restoration of January 1 by Pope Gregory XIII as New Year's Day\nof the Gregorian Calendar in the 16th century was responsible for the creation\nof the holiday, sometimes questioned for earlier references.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"April_Fools'_Day","recorded":1372154921,"links":[],"instances":["language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["April Fools' Day|","April observances","April events","Unofficial observances","Practical jokes"],"headings":["Origins","Longstanding customs","Other prank days in the world","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["scots","language"]],"members":["scots"],"related":["Copenhagen_Metro","Public_holiday","Practical_joke","Hoax","Italy","France","Belgium","Italian_language","French_language","Flemish","Geoffrey_Chaucer","Pope_Gregory_XIII","New_Year's_Day","Gregorian_Calendar","Hilaria","Encyclop√¶dia_Britannica","Feast_of_Fools","University_of_Illinois_Press","Nun's_Priest's_Tale","University_of_Maine_at_Machias","Northwestern_University_Press","Museum_of_Hoaxes","Richard_II_of_England","Anne_of_Bohemia","Valentine's_Day","Geoffrey_Chaucer","Eloy_d'Amerval","John_Aubrey","Tower_of_London","Feast_of_the_Annunciation","Edict_of_Roussillon","Iona_and_Peter_Opie","Oxford_University_Press","Scots_(language)","Iran","Persian_calendar","Nowruz","Sizdah_Bedar","Life123","Romandy","French_Canadian","Antwerp","Flanders","Latin","Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor","Ibero-America","Minorca","Vilaweb","Catalan_language","April_Fools'_Day_Request_for_Comments","List_of_practical_joke_topics","Museum_of_Hoaxes"]}
