The name has many variants, which include [[Stephan (given\nname)|Stephan]], Stevan, Stefan and Stevon.\n\nIn Middle English, the name Stephen or Stephan was pronounced as a bi-syllabic\nword — Step-hen or Step-han — much like a Scandinavian surname. Steve was\npronounced as it is in Modern English. This etymological usage began a decline\nin the mid-19th century.\n\nSteve is the common short form, while various diminutives such as Stevie and Ste\nare also used. Many family names are derived from Stephen: the most common are\nStephens/Stevens and Stephenson/Stevenson (others include Stephen, Stephan,\nStaphan, Stefan, Stevin and Stever).\n\nThe name was ranked 201 in the United States in 2009, according to the Social\nSecurity Administration.<ref name=\"ssa.gov\">[http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-\nbin/popularnames.cgi Popular Baby Names], Social Security

Kingdom, it peaked during the 1950s and 1960s as one of the top\nten male first names (ranking third in 1954) but had fallen to twentieth by 1984\nand had fallen out of the top one hundred by 2002.<ref></ref>\n\nThe female version of the name is Stephanie.\n\nFor Stephen as a surname see Stephen (surname), Stephenson and Stevenson.\n","title":"stephen","headings":["List of
