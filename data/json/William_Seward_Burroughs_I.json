{"cursor":"4726","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n ]] .]] 'William Seward Burroughs I' (January 28, 1857 â September 14, 1898) was\n an American inventor born in Rochester, New York.\n\nBurroughs was the son of a mechanic and worked with machines throughout his\nchildhood. While he was still a small boy, his parents moved to Auburn, New\nYork, where he and his brothers were educated in the public school system.\nAccording to his father's desire that his youngest son should choose a\ngentleman's vocation, William, after his graduation from high school,\nentered the Cayuga County National Bank of Auburn as a clerk, where he spent\nlong hours adding numbers.\n\nAt this time Burroughs became interested in solving the problem of creating an\nadding machine. In the bank there had been a number of earlier prototypes, but\nin inexperienced users' hands, those that existed would sometimes give\nincorrect, and at times outrageous, answers. The clerk work was not in\naccordance with Burrough's wishes, for he had a natural love and talent for\nmechanics and the boredom and monotony of clerical life weighed heavily upon\nhim. Seven years in the bank damaged his health and he was forced to resign.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1880s Burroughs was advised by a doctor to move to an\narea with a warmer climate and he moved to St. Louis, Missouri where he obtained\na job in a machine shop. These new surroundings, which appealed to him more,\nhastened the development of the idea he had already in his mind and the tools of\nhis new craft gave him the opportunity to put into tangible form the first\nconception of the adding machine. Accuracy was the foundation of his work. No\nordinary materials were good enough for his creation. His drawings were made on\nmetal plates which could not expand or shrink by the smallest fraction of an\ninch. He worked with hardened tools, sharpened to fine points, and when he\nstruck a center or drew a line, it was done under a microscope.\n\nSo, he invented a \"calculating machine\" designed to ease the monotony of\nclerical work. He was a founder of the American Arithmometer Company (1886),\nwhich later became the Burroughs Adding Machine Company (1904), then the\nBurroughs Corporation (1953) and in 1986, merged with Sperry Corporation to form\nUnisys. He was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\nHe was the grandfather of William S. Burroughs the Beat Generation writer, and\ngreat-grandfather of William S. Burroughs, Jr., who was also a writer.\n\nHe died in Citronelle, Alabama and was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St.\nLouis, Missouri.\n","linknr":125,"url":"William_Seward_Burroughs_I","recorded":1364237317,"links":["/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/William_S._Burroughs","/wiki/File:William_S._Burroughs_(1855-1898).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/William_S._Burroughs_%281855-1898%29.jpg/170px-William_S._Burroughs_%281855-1898%29.jpg","/wiki/File:William_S._Burroughs_(1855-1898).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg/170px-BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg","/wiki/File:BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Adding_machine","/wiki/File:CalculatingMachinePatentBurroughs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/CalculatingMachinePatentBurroughs.jpg/170px-CalculatingMachinePatentBurroughs.jpg","/wiki/File:CalculatingMachinePatentBurroughs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Adding_machine","/wiki/Rochester,_New_York","/wiki/Auburn,_New_York","/wiki/Cayuga_County,_New_York","/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri","/wiki/Adding_machine","/wiki/Burroughs_Corporation","/wiki/Burroughs_Corporation","/wiki/Sperry_Corporation","/wiki/Unisys","/wiki/National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/William_S._Burroughs","/wiki/Beat_Generation","/wiki/William_S._Burroughs,_Jr.","/wiki/Citronelle,_Alabama","/wiki/Bellefontaine_Cemetery","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit&section=1","http://www.google.com/patents?vid=388116","http://www.google.com/patents?vid=388117","http://www.google.com/patents?vid=388118","http://www.google.com/patents?vid=388119","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit&section=2","http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/cbi00090a.xml","http://fi.edu/case_files/burroughs/","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=2979","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&oldid=541361317","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_manufacturing_businesspeople","/wiki/Category:American_inventors","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_English_descent","/wiki/Category:People_from_Rochester,_New_York","/wiki/Category:William_S._Burroughs","/wiki/Category:National_Inventors_Hall_of_Fame_inductees","/wiki/Category:1857_births","/wiki/Category:1898_deaths","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_Bellefontaine_and_Calvary_Cemeteries","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Seward+Burroughs+I&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=William+Seward+Burroughs+I","/wiki/William_Seward_Burroughs_I","/wiki/Talk:William_Seward_Burroughs_I","#","/wiki/William_Seward_Burroughs_I","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/William_Seward_Burroughs_I","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/William_Seward_Burroughs_I","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&oldid=541361317","/w/index.php?title=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=William_Seward_Burroughs_I&id=541361317","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_c
