(4)\n Long arm.]]\n\nA 'chromosome' is an organized structure of DNA and protein found in cells. It\nis a single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes, regulatory elements and\nother nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which\nserve to package the DNA and control its functions. Chromosomal DNA encodes most\nor all of an organism's genetic information; some species also contain plasmids\nor other extrachromosomal genetic elements.\n\nChromosomes vary widely between different organisms. The DNA molecule may be\ncircular or linear, and can be composed of 100,000 to over\n3,750,000,000 nucleotides in a long chain. Typically,\neukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei) have large linear chromosomes and\nprokaryotic cells (cells without defined nuclei) have smaller circular\nchromosomes, although there are many exceptions to this rule. Also, cells may\ncontain more than one type of chromosome; for example, mitochondria in most\neukaryotes and chloroplasts in plants have their own small chromosomes.\n\nIn eukaryotes, nuclear chromosomes are packaged by proteins into a condensed\nstructure called chromatin. This allows the very long DNA molecules to fit into\nthe cell nucleus. The structure of chromosomes and chromatin varies through the\ncell cycle. Chromosomes are the essential unit for cellular division and must be\nreplicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to\nensure the genetic diversity and survival of their progeny. Chromosomes may\nexist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single\nlinear strands, whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies\n(called chromatids) joined by a centromere.\n\nCompaction of the duplicated chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis results in\nthe classic four-arm structure (pictured to the right). Chromosomal\nrecombination plays a vital role in genetic diversity. If these structures are\nmanipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and\ntranslocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe and die, or it may\nunexpectedly evade apoptosis leading to the progression of cancer.\n\nIn practice \"chromosome\" is a rather loosely defined term. In prokaryotes and\nviruses, the term genophore is more appropriate when no chromatin is present.\nHowever, a large body of work uses the term chromosome regardless of chromatin\ncontent. In prokaryotes, DNA is usually arranged as a loop, which is tightly\ncoiled in on itself, sometimes accompanied by one or more smaller, circular DNA\nmolecules called plasmids. These small circular genomes are also found in\nmitochondria and chloroplasts, reflecting their bacterial origins. The simplest\ngenophores are found in viruses: these DNA or RNA molecules are short linear or\ncircular genophores that often lack structural proteins.\n\nThe word chromosome comes from the Greek (chroma, colour) and (soma, body) due\nto their property of being very strongly stained by particular dyes.\n","linknr":905,"url":"chromosomal","recorded":1362690165,"links":101,"instances":["human","human","human","human","human","classification_of_human_beings","human","molecular_biology","human","human","human","biology","human","genetics","genetic_algorithm","human","biology","human","human","human","genetics","human","human","genetics","genetics","human","human","human","human","human","dna","human"],"pdf":["http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/holdings/Genetics/Genetics-1928-13-2-180.pdf"],"categories":["Chromosomes|","Nuclear
