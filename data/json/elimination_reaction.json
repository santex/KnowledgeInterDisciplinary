      "text" : " to cyclohexene with sulfuric acid and heat <ref>Organic Syntheses I:185\n http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV1P0183.pdf</ref>]] An 'elimination reaction'\n is a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a\n molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism.<ref></ref> The one-step\n mechanism is known as the 'E2 reaction', and the two-step mechanism is known as\n the 'E1 reaction'. The numbers do not have to do with the number of steps in\n the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and\n unimolecular respectively. In most organic elimination reactions, at least one\n hydrogen is lost to form the double bond: the unsaturation of the molecule\n increases. It is also possible that a molecule undergoes reductive elimination,\n by which the valence of an atom in the molecule decreases by two. An important\n class of elimination reactions are those involving alkyl halides, with good\n leaving groups, reacting with a Lewis base to form an alkene. Elimination may\n be considered the reverse of an addition reaction. When the substrate is\n asymmetric, regioselectivity is determined by Zaitsev's rule.\n\n",
