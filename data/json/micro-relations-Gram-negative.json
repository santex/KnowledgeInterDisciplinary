{"cursor":"16022","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'' bacteria (pink-red rods).]]\n\n'Gram-negative bacteria' are bacteria that do not retain crystal violet dye in\nthe Gram staining protocol. In a Gram stain test, a\ncounterstain (commonly safranin) is added after the crystal violet, coloring all\nGram-negative bacteria with a red or pink color. This is because of the\nexistence of an outer membrane preventing the penetration of the stain. The test\nitself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the\nstructural differences of their bacterial cell walls. Gram-positive bacteria\nwill retain the crystal violet dye when washed in a decolorizing solution.\nCompared with Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant\nagainst antibodies, because of their impenetrable wall.\n\nThe pathogenic capability of Gram-negative bacteria is often associated with\ncertain components of Gram-negative cell envelope, in particular, the\nlipopolysaccharide layer (also known as LPS or endotoxin layer). In humans, LPS triggers an innate immune response characterized by cytokine\nproduction and immune system activation. Inflammation is a common result of\ncytokine (from the Greek cyto, cell and kinesis, movement) production, which can\nalso produce host toxicity.\n","linknr":384,"url":"Gram-negative","recorded":1362500965,"links":37,"instances":["shape","protein"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gram-negative bacteria|","Staining","Bacteriology"],"headings":["Characteristics","Classification","Outer cell membrane bacterial classification","Medical treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_Gram.jpg/220px-Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_Gram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Gram_negative_cell_wall.svg/500px-Gram_negative_cell_wall.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Gram-Cell-wall.svg/220px-Gram-Cell-wall.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Gram-negative_Bacteria_-_Lab_methods_algorithm.svg/500px-Gram-negative_Bacteria_-_Lab_methods_algorithm.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["porin","protein"],["bacillus","shape"]],"members":["bacillus","porin"],"related":["Bacteria","Crystal_violet","Gram_staining","Hans_Christian_Gram","Counterstain","Safranin","Gram-positive_bacteria","Antibody","Lipopolysaccharide","Endotoxin","Innate_immune_response","Cytokine","Immune_system","Inflammation","Peptidoglycan","Gram-positive_bacteria","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Lipopolysaccharide","Lipid_A","O_antigen","Phospholipids","Porin_(protein)","Periplasmic_space","S-layer","Flagella","Teichoic_acid","Lipoteichoic_acid","Lipoprotein","Braun's_lipoprotein","Monera","Taxonomic_rank","Monophyly","Molecular_phylogenetics","Cavalier-Smith","Clade","Gram-positive","Gram-negative","Gram-positive","Gram-negative","Gram-positive_bacteria","Mycoplasmas","Periplasmic_space","Antibiotic","Deinococcus","Gram_positive","Gram-negative","Negativicutes","Fusobacteria","Synergistetes","Elusimicrobia","Firmicutes","HSP60","GroEL","Proteobacteria","Aquificae","Chlamydiae","Bacteroidetes","Chlorobi","Cyanobacteria","Fibrobacteres","Verrucomicrobia","Planctomycetes","Spirochetes","Acidobacteria","Actinobacteria","Firmicutes","Thermotogae","Chloroflexi","Proteobacteria","Enterobacteriaceae","Acetic_acid_bacteria","Cyanobacteria","Spirochaete","Green_sulfur_bacteria","Green_non-sulfur_bacteria","Coccus","Sexually_transmitted_disease","Meningitis","Bacillus_(shape)","Nosocomial_infection","Bacterial_outer_membrane","Lipopolysaccharide","Lipid","Endotoxin","Antibiotic","Detergent","Peptidoglycan","Lysozyme","Penicillin","EDTA","Ampicillin","Chloramphenicol","Streptomycin","Nalidixic_acid","Braun's_lipoprotein","Gram-indeterminate","Lower_plants"]}
