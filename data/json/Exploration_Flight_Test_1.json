Set to launch in 2014 atop a Delta IV Heavy from Space\nLaunch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the mission will be a multi-\nhour, two-orbit test of the Orion Crew Module featuring a high apogee on the\nsecond orbit and a high-energy reentry at around 20,000Â mph. This mission design is essentially equivalent to that of the\nApollo 4 mission of 1967, which validated the Apollo flight control system and\nheat shield at re-entry conditions planned for the return from lunar missions.\n\nAfter splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, crews will recover the EFT-1 Orion crew\nvehicle and outfit the capsule for an ascent abort test. The\nspacecraft will remain attached to the Delta IV's Upper Stage until reentry\nbegins and will rely on internal batteries for power rather than photovoltaic\narrays, which will not be installed. The flight is\nintended to test various Orion systems, including avionics, heat shielding and\nparachutes prior to its debut launch aboard the Space Launch System, currently\nscheduled for late 2017.\n\nEFT-1 Orion is being built by Lockheed Martin. On 22 June\n2012, the final welds of the EFT-1 Orion were completed at the Michoud Assembly\nFacility in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was then\ntransported to Kennedy Space Center's Operations and Checkout Building, which is\nwhere the remainder of the spacecraft will be completed.\n\nData gathered from the test flight will be analyzed by the Critical Design\nReview (CDR) in April, 2015. http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/eft-1-september-2014-launch-\npaced-delta-ivh/\n","linknr":320,"url":"Exploration_Flight_Test_1","recorded":1362267924,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/663703main_flighttest1_fs_051812.pdf"],"categories":["Future spaceflights","2014 in spaceflight","Orion program"],"headings":["Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Exploration_Flight_Test-1_insignia.png/201px-Exploration_Flight_Test-1_insignia.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/STS-135_patch.png/30px-STS-135_patch.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Orion_logo.png/34px-Orion_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/EFT-1_Orion_2.jpg/120px-EFT-1_Orion_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Final_wield_of_first_space_bound_Orion.jpg/120px-Final_wield_of_first_space_bound_Orion.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Rendering_of_Orion_Exploration_Flight_Test_1.jpg/120px-Rendering_of_Orion_Exploration_Flight_Test_1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/EFT-1_mission_diagram.jpg/120px-EFT-1_mission_diagram.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg/70px-NASA_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/100px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Nasa_swift_satellite.jpg/40px-Nasa_swift_satellite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["orion","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft#crew_module"]],"members":["orion"],"related":["Orion_(spacecraft)","Delta_IV_Heavy","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_37","Pacific_Ocean","STS-135","Exploration_Mission_1","Orion_(spacecraft)","Delta_IV_Heavy","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_37","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Apollo_4","Photovoltaic_array","Avionics","Heat_shield","Parachute","Space_Launch_System","Lockheed_Martin","Michoud_Assembly_Facility","New_Orleans,_Louisiana","Kennedy_Space_Center","Operations_and_Checkout_Building"]}
