{"cursor":"4843","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Jennifer J. Isler', best known as 'J. J. Isler' and also known by her maiden\nname of 'J. J. Fetter' (born December 1, 1963 in La Jolla, California) is an\nAmerican yachtswoman from San Diego, California, United States. She is a two-\ntime Olympic medalist and a world sailing champion. She was a starting helmsman\nin the 1995 Americaâs Cup races. A pioneer in the sport of womenâs sailing, she\nwas the first woman inducted into the Sailing World Hall of Fame. [http://www.sailingworld.com/racing/sw-hall-of-fame/jj-isler-\n37443.html Sailing World]\n\nShe was born into a sailing family, the youngest of three children of Jane and\nTom Fetter; he is a former commodore of the San Diego Yacht Club. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105132,00.html\nPeople, February 20, 1995] She began sailing Sabots when she was 7 years\nold. [http://www.sdhoc.com/newswire/2010-breitbard-hall-of-famer-jj-fetter-\nisler/ San Diego Hall of Champions] She learned to sail and race in the\nJuniors program at the San Diego Yacht Club, sailing mostly in Sabots. An\nintense competitor, she disliked the fact that girls and boys were viewed\ndifferently in sailing. \"The junior regattas were open to everyone, but there\nwas a winner's trophy and a 'first girls' trophy,\" she recalled recently. âI\nalways wanted just to be first, and hand that other trophy off as 'the first boy\ntrophyâ. â¦ I finished second, third and fourth in the Sabot Nationals, but never\nwon, meaning I was always getting that 'first girl' trophy, and I hated it.\" [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/22/sailor-blazed-trail-for-\nwomen/ San Diego Union Tribune, February 22, 2010] At the time, many of\nthe West Coastâs leading yacht clubs didnât even have facilities for female\nsailors. She once had to dress for a race in a yachtâs clubâs parking lot.\n\nHer horizons expanded in high school, when she started racing boats other than\nSabots, particularly 420s. She was recruited by several colleges, and chose Yale\nbecause they promised her she could compete on the varsity team, not just the\nwomenâs team. At Yale she was the first woman captain of the sailing team. She became only the third female sailor in the history of\nintercollegiate sailing to be named an All American.\n\nShe went on to win medals in the National, European, and World championships in\n1987-1988 in the womenâs 470s. She won the World Championship\nin 1991. She also won the Rolex International Womenâs Keelboat Championship in\n1986. She has been named the Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year\nfour times. [http://www.ussailing.org/awards/rolex/ Rolex Yachtswoman of the\nyear]\n\nShe won a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and a silver medal in the\n2000 Summer Olympics, skippering in the womenâs 470 class. [http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/is/jennifer-\nisler-1.html sports-reference]\n\nShe was the starting helmsman and tactician for the all-female Mighty Mary USA-\n34 team for most of the 1995 Americaâs Cup defense trial races, until she was\nreplaced by David Dellenbaugh in a controversial move.\n\nWith her then-husband Peter Isler, another champion sailor, she co-wrote the\nbook Sailing for Dummies.\n","linknr":134,"url":"J._J._Isler","recorded":1375080599,"links":["/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/La_Jolla,_California","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Sailor","/wiki/San_Diego","/wiki/California","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/1995_America%E2%80%99s_Cup","#cite_note-SW-1","/wiki/San_Diego_Yacht_Club","#cite_note-People-2","/wiki/Sabot_(dinghy)","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-UT-4","#cite_note-UT-4","/wiki/420_(dinghy)","/wiki/Yale","#cite_note-People-2","#cite_note-UT-4","/wiki/470_(dinghy)","#cite_note-UT-4","#cite_note-SW-1","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Sailing_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Sailing_at_the_2000_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/470_(dinghy)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/1995_Citizen_Cup","#cite_note-SW-1","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Isler&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-SW_1-0","#cite_ref-SW_1-1","#cite_ref-SW_1-2","http://www.sailingworld.com/racing/sw-hall-of-fame/jj-isler-37443.html","#cite_ref-People_2-0","#cite_ref-People_2-1","http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105132,00.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.sdhoc.com/newswire/2010-breitbard-hall-of-famer-jj-fetter-isler/","#cite_ref-UT_4-0","#cite_ref-UT_4-1","#cite_ref-UT_4-2","#cite_ref-UT_4-3","http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/22/sailor-blazed-trail-for-women/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.ussailing.org/awards/rolex/","#cite_ref-6","http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/is/jennifer-isler-1.html","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780471794130","http://www.sailingworld.com/article/Jennifer-JJ-Fetter-Isler","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/7549991","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&oldid=523301958","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1963_births","/wiki/Category:American_yacht_racers","/wiki/Category:Yale_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Olympic_bronze_medalists_for_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Olympic_sailors_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Olympic_silver_medalists_for_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:People_from_San_Diego,_California","/wiki/Category:Sailors_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Category:Sailors_at_the_2000_Summer_Olympics","/wiki/Category:Olympic_medalists_in_sailing","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=J.+J.+Isler&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=J.+J.+Isler","/wiki/J._J._Isler","/wiki/Talk:J._J._Isler","#","/wiki/J._J._Isler","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/J._J._Isler","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/J._J._Isler","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&oldid=523301958","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6106071","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=J._J._Isler&id=523301958","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=J.+J.+Isler","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=J.+J.+Isler&oldid=523301958&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=J._J._Isler&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6106071#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licen
