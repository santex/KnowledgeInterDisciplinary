It is the fourth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora\n(consisting of four species), and one of the smallest in the Mammalia.<ref\nname=\"r341\"></ref> Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital\ncomponents to most African and some Asian ecosystems.<ref name=\"miv\"></ref>\n\nAlthough phylogenetically close to felines and viverrids, hyenas are\nbehaviourally and morphologically similar to canines in several aspects; both\nhyenas and canines are nonarboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their\nteeth rather than claws. Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their\ncalloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable nails are adapted for running\nand making sharp turns. However, the hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating\nhabits, mating, and parental behaviour are consistent with the behaviour of\nother feliforms.<ref name=\"k274\"></ref> Although long reputed to be cowardly\nscavengers, hyenas, especially spotted hyenas, kill as much as 95% of the food\nthey eat,<ref>http://www.hyaenidae.org/the-hyaenidae/spotted-hyena-crocuta-\ncrocuta/crocuta-diet-and-foraging.html</ref> and have been known to drive off\nleopards or lionesses from their kills. Hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals,\nbut may venture from their lairs in the early-morning hours. With the exception\nof the highly social spotted hyena, hyenas are generally not gregarious animals,\nthough they may live in family groups and congregate at kills.<ref\nname=\"r343\"></ref>\n\nHyenas first arose in Eurasia during the Miocene period from viverrid-like\nancestors, and developed into two distinct branches; the lightly built dog-like\nhyenas and the robust bone-crushing hyenas. Although the dog-like hyenas thrived\n15 million years ago (with one taxon having colonised North America), they died\nout after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of\nthe dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous aardwolf survived, while the\nbone-crushing hyenas (whose extant members are the spotted, brown and striped\nhyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.<ref\nname=\"mac119\" />\n\nHyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures with\nwhich they are sympatric. Hyenas are mostly viewed with fear and contempt, as\nwell as being associated with witchcraft, as their body parts are used as\ningredients in traditional medicine. Among the beliefs held by some cultures,\nhyenas are thought to influence people’s spirits, rob graves, and steal\nlivestock and children.<ref name=\"m96\"></ref>\n",
