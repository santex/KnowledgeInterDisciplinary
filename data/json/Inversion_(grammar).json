{"cursor":"9478","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In linguistics, 'inversion' is any of several grammatical constructions where\ntwo expressions switch their canonical order of appearance, that is, they\ninvert.  The most frequent type of inversion in English is\nsubjectâauxiliary inversion, where an auxiliary verb changes places with its\nsubject; this often occurs in questions, such as Are you coming?, where the\nsubject you is switched with the auxiliary are. In many other languages â\nespecially those with freer word order than English â inversion can take place\nwith a variety of verbs (not just auxiliaries) and with other syntactic\ncategories as well.\n\nWhen a layered constituency-based analysis of sentence structure is used,\ninversion often results in the discontinuity of a constituent, although this\nwould not be the case with a flatter dependency-based analysis. In this regard\ninversion has consequences similar to those of shifting.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Inversion_(grammar)","recorded":1362553638,"links":22,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntactic entities"],"headings":["Inversion in English","Inversion in other languages","Theoretical analyses","Notes","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Inversion_trees.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["head","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["discontinuity","linguistics"],["shifting","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["copula","linguistics"],["constituent","linguistics"],["discontinuity","linguistics"],["constituent","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"]],"members":["constituent","shifting","head","discontinuity","subject","copula"],"related":["Linguistics","Head_(linguistics)","Head_(linguistics)","Subject–auxiliary_inversion","English_auxiliaries","Subject_(grammar)","Phrase_structure_grammar","Discontinuity_(linguistics)","Dependency_grammar","Shifting_(linguistics)","English_auxiliaries","Subject_(grammar)","Auxiliary_verb","Negative_inversion","Subject–verb_inversion","Copula_(linguistics)","Personal_pronoun","Subject-verb_inversion","Germanic_languages","Romance_languages","French_language","German_language","V2_word_order","German_language","Adverbial_phrase","West_Germanic_languages","Dutch_language","Free_word_order","Syntax","Transformational_grammar","Phrase_structure_grammar","Finite_verb","Verb_phrase","Constituent_(linguistics)","Discontinuity_(linguistics)","Dependency_grammar","Bare_phrase_structure","Constituent_(linguistics)","Dependency_grammar","Finite_verb","Head_(linguistics)","Phrase_structure_grammar","Verb_phrase"]}
