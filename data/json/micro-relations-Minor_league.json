{"cursor":"8823","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Minor leagues' are professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the\npremier leagues in those sports. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller,\nless elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities. This term is used in\nNorth America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports.\nThey generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.\n\nThe minor league concept is a manifestation of the franchise system used in\nNorth American sports, whereby the group of major league teams in each sport is\nfixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take\nplace with the consent of the major league owners. In England (and many other\ncountries), the football leagues have many divisions below the top-flight as\npart of the football pyramid. In other parts of the world there is usually\neither a system of annual promotion and relegation, meaning that clubs have no\nfixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per\ncountry in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Minor_league","recorded":1362553807,"links":13,"instances":["sport","2009"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Terminology used in multiple sports"],"headings":["American football","Baseball","Ice hockey","Basketball","Association football","Other sports","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Bowman_Field.JPG/220px-Bowman_Field.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["united_football_league","2009"],["scout","sport"],["international_hockey_league","1945–2001"],["international_hockey_league","2007-2010"]],"members":["scout","united_football_league","international_hockey_league"],"related":["Sports","North_America","Sports_franchising","Major_professional_sports_league","Football_pyramid","Promotion_and_relegation","American_football","National_Football_League","Association_of_Professional_Football_Leagues","Atlantic_Coast_Football_League","NFL_Europe","Arena_Football_League","Arena_football","Af2","Indoor_American_football","Canadian_Football_League","United_Football_League_(2009)","Stars_Football_League","Minor_league_baseball","National_League","Scout_(sport)","American_League","Major_League_Baseball","Ice_hockey","Ice_hockey","Junior_ice_hockey","American_Hockey_League","American_Hockey_League","ECHL","Central_Hockey_League","Southern_Professional_Hockey_League","Federal_Hockey_League","Ligue_Nord-Américaine_de_Hockey","Atlantic_Coast_Hockey_League","Southern_Professional_Hockey_League","International_Hockey_League_(1945–2001)","American_Hockey_League","International_Hockey_League_(2007-2010)","Central_Hockey_League","South_East_Hockey_League","Southern_Professional_Hockey_League","World_Hockey_Association_2","Southern_Professional_Hockey_League","West_Coast_Hockey_League","ECHL","Western_Professional_Hockey_League","Central_Hockey_League","National_Hockey_League","Farm_team","American_Hockey_League","ECHL","Junior_ice_hockey","Senior_ice_hockey","National_Basketball_Association","NBA_Development_League","Continental_Basketball_Association","Major_League_Soccer","United_States_soccer_league_system","Canadian_soccer_league_system","North_American_Soccer_League","USL_Pro","United_Soccer_Leagues","USL_Premier_Development_League","Web.com_Tour","Symetra_Tour","PGA_Tour","LPGA","NASCAR","Nationwide_Series","Camping_World_Truck_Series","Whelen_All-American_Series","Association_of_Professional_Football_Leagues","Minor_ice_hockey","Minor_league_baseball","Fuzion_Minor_League_Golf_Tour","NBA_Development_League"]}
