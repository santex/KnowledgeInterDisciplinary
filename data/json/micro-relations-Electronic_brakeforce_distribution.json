{"cursor":"4168","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Electronic brakeforce distribution' '(EBD' or 'EBFD)', 'Electronic brakeforce\nlimitation' '(EBL)' is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies\nthe amount of force applied to each of a vehicle's brakes, based on road\nconditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems,\nEBD can apply more or less braking pressure to each wheel in order to maximize\nstopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control.\nTypically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less\nbraking pressure to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause\na skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more braking pressure at the\nrear brakes during initial brake application before the effects of weight\ntransfer become apparent.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Electronic_brakeforce_distribution","recorded":1362484212,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Vehicle braking technologies","Automotive safety technologies","Mechanical power control"],"headings":["How ABS works","How EBD works","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Automobile","Brake","Force","Anti-lock_braking_system","Anti-lock_braking_system","Society_of_Automotive_Engineers","Electronic_Stability_Control","Brake_Assist","Cornering_Brake_Control","Electronic_stability_control","Automobile_safety"]}
