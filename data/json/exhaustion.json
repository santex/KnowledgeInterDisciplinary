Unlike weakness,\nfatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have physical or\nmental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of a muscle to\nmaintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense\nphysical exercise.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> Mental fatigue is a\ntransient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged\nperiods of cognitive activity.

Fatigue is considered a symptom, rather than a sign because it\nis a subjective feeling reported by the patient, rather than an objective one\nthat can be observed by others. Fatigue and ‘feelings of fatigue’ are often\nconfused.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Fatigue%20%28medical%29","headings":["Classification","Fatigue vs. sleepiness","Causes","Diagnosis","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Sleep_deprivation","3: Somnolence","3: Serotonin","2: Sleep","2: Physical_exercise","2: Directed_attention_fatigue","2: Symptom","2: Motor_neuron","2: Microsleep","2: Drug_abuse","2: Major_depressive_disorder","2: Diabetes_mellitus","1: All-nighter","1: Weakness","1: Muscle","1: Non-specific_symptom","1: Medical_sign","1: Axon","1: Action_potential","1: Neuromuscular_disease","1: Etiology","1: Electromyography","1: Musculoskeletal_system","1: Proprioception","1: Ego_depletion","1: Level_of_consciousness","1: Neurocognitive","1: Perception","1: Reticular_activating_system","1: Stimulation","1: Jet_lag","1: Recreation","1: Clinical_depression","1: Boredom","1: Disease","1: Poison","1: Mineral","1: Vitamin","1: Illness","1: Common_cold","1: Sickness_behavior","1: Immune_system","1: Infection","1: Autoimmune_disease","1: Celiac_disease","1: Multiple_sclerosis","1: Myasthenia_gravis","1: Spondyloarthropathy","1: Blood_disorders","1: Anemia","1: Hemochromatosis","1: Cancer","1: Cancer_fatigue","1: Chronic_fatigue_syndrome","1: Alcohol_abuse","1: Eating_disorders","1: Endocrine_disease","1: Hypothyroidism","1: Fibromyalgia","1: Gulf_War_Syndrome","1: Heart_disease","1: HIV","1: Irritable_Bowel_Syndrome","1: Fructose_malabsorption","1: Liver_failure","1: Infectious_diseases","1: Infectious_mononucleosis","1: Leukemia","1: Lymphoma","1: Lyme_disease","1: Neurological_disorder","1: Narcolepsy","1: Parkinson's_disease","1: Post-concussion_syndrome","1: Physical_trauma","1: Pain","1: Arthritis","1: Sleep_disorders","1: Uremia","1: Stroke","1: Medications","1: Lithium_salt","1: Ciprofloxacin","1: Beta_blocker","1: Exercise_intolerance","1: Chemotherapy","1: Radiotherapy","1: Eye_bags","1: Medical_history","1: Emotional","1: Sleep_study","1: Sleep_disorder","1: Medical_tests","1: Blood_tests","1: Anaemia","1: Urinalysis","1: Liver_disease","1: Comprehensive_metabolic_panel","1: HIV_test","1: Pregnancy_test","1: Cancer-related_fatigue","1: Combat_stress_reaction","1: Heat_illness","1: Malaise","1: Presenteeism","1: Sleep-deprived_driving","1: Gaucher's_Disease","1: Slate.com"]}
