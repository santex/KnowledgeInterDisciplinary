{"cursor":"23969","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Self-advocacy' refers to the civil rights movement for people with\ndevelopmental disabilities, also called cognitive or intellectual disabilities,\nand other disabilities. It is also an important term in the disability rights\nmovement, referring to people with disabilities taking control of their own\nlives, including being in charge of their own care in the medical system. The\nself-advocacy movement is (in basic terms) about people with disabilities\nspeaking up for themselves. It means that although a person with a disability\nmay call upon the support of others, the individual is entitled to be in control\nof their own resources and how they are directed. It is about having the right\nto make life decisions without undue influence or control by others.\n\nPeople with intellectual disabilities are often some of the most powerless\nmembers of society. They may live in large institutions or in smaller residences\nknown as group homes which are staff-directed environments where residents have\nlittle or no control over their living conditions or with whom they share their\nliving space. People with intellectual disabilities are extremely vulnerable to\nabuse due to their social and physical isolation. They are eight to ten times\nmore likely to suffer sexual abuse than the non-disabled population.\n\nThe self-advocacy movement seeks to reduce the isolation of people with\ndisabilities and give them the tools and experience to take greater control over\ntheir own lives. The self-advocacy movement for people with intellectual\ndisabilities lags far behind many other civil rights efforts, such as those\nrelated to race or physical disabilities. This is due to many factors including\nlow literacy and other communication challenges that are a barrier for people\nwith intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe self-advocacy movement for people with disabilities has its roots in the\nbroader civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s but is in many respects\nstill in its infancy. In North America the self-advocacy movement is led by a\nnational organization called Self Advocates Becoming Empowered\n([http://sabeusa.org SABE]) and supported by a relatively small number of\norganizations, such as [http://self-advocacy.org ACT] in the United States and\nLiveWorkPlay in Canada and internationally through the People First\norganization.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Self-advocacy","recorded":1374860666,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#PUBLISHER","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Encyclopedic_style","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Civil_rights","/wiki/Developmental_disability","/wiki/Disability","/wiki/Disability_rights_movement","/wiki/Group_home","/wiki/Sexual_abuse","http://sabeusa.org","http://self-advocacy.org","/wiki/LiveWorkPlay","#Medical_and_psychiatric_patient_self-advocacy","#Opposition_to_self-advocacy","#The_role_of_the_internet_in_contributing_to_self-advocacy","#How_the_patient-doctor_relationship_affects_self-agency","#Whether_public_intellectuals_can_help_promote_self-agency","#List_of_attributes_of_public_intellectuals_and_how_these_may_help_promote_self-advocacy","#Why_public_intellectuals_may_not_be_able_to_promote_self-advocacy","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Medical","/wiki/Psychiatric","/wiki/Palliative_care","/wiki/Home_care","/wiki/Health_insurance","/w/index.php?title=Patient_Bill_of_Rights&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-Henwood-2","#cite_note-Henwood-2","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-Alexandra-3","#cite_note-Alexandra-3","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","/wiki/Bioethics","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","/wiki/Expert","/wiki/Disease_mongering","/wiki/Pharmaceutical_companies","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","#cite_note-Geraghty-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-Henwood_2-0","#cite_ref-Henwood_2-1","#cite_ref-Alexandra_3-0","#cite_ref-Alexandra_3-1","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-0","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-1","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-2","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-3","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-4","#cite_ref-Geraghty_4-5","#cite_ref-5","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit&section=9","http://www.sabeusa.org","http://www.theriotrocks.org","http://www.sanys.org","http://liveworkplay.ca/self-advocacy","http://www.peoplefirstofcanada.ca","http://www.missouripeoplefirst.org","http://www.liftup.org.uk","http://www.skillnetgroup.co.uk/self_advocacy/self_advocacy.php","http://www.bereal.com.au","http://www.advocacywiki.org","http://www.nrc-pad.org","http://www.disability.gi/","http://www.autisticadvocacy.org","http://dianaandkathy.com/","http://www.cafety.org","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&oldid=556677967","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Disability","/wiki/Category:Disability_rights","/wiki/Category:Psychiatric_patients","/wiki/Category:Medical_sociology","/wiki/Category:Mental_health_activists","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_style_editing_from_January_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_style_editing","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_April_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Self-advocacy&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Self-advocacy","/wiki/Self-advocacy","/wiki/Talk:Self-advocacy","#","/wiki/Self-advocacy","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Self-advocacy&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/s
