In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the 'resident mission',\nnamely the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city\nof another country. As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in\nwhich it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or\nmore other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.
