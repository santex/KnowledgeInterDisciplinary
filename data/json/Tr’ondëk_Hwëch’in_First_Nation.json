{"cursor":"4414","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'TrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin' (; formerly the 'Dawson Indian Band') is a First\nNations located in the central Yukon, Canada. Its main population centre is\nDawson City, Yukon.\n\nMany of todayâs TrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin, or people of the river, are descendants of\nthe HÃ¤n-speaking people who have lived along the Yukon River for thousands of\nyears. They traveled extensively throughout their traditional territory\nharvesting salmon from the Yukon River and caribou from the Fortymile and\nPorcupine Herds. Moose, small game, and a variety of plants and berries provided\nadditional food sources. Other raw materials needed to make tools, clothing and\nshelter were procured from this diverse and rich environment. The HÃ¤n traded\nwith neighboring First Nations people and maintained interrelations through\nfamily connections and frequent gatherings.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, European fur traders and missionaries established a\npresence in the territory. Contact with the newcomers presented new challenges\nand opportunities for the HÃ¤n. Trade increased and new goods and economic\npractices were introduced. The HÃ¤n used a combination of traditional and newly\nintroduced skills, goods and materials to maintain their survival and assist the\nnewcomers.\n\nIn the 1880s gold was discovered in the ChâÃ«dÃ¤h DÃ«k, or Fortymile River, area\nâ a site used by the HÃ¤n as a caribou interception point and grayling fishing\nspot. In 1896 more gold was discovered near Tr'ochÃ«k, at the confluence of the\nYukon and Klondike Rivers. The Klondike River hosted abundant salmon stocks\nand the HÃ¤n had an encampment at Tr'ochÃ«k that was used seasonally for\nhundreds of years. The ensuing rush brought thousands of people to Tr'ochÃ«k\nand surrounding areas.\n\nRecognizing the influences that the newcomers would have on his people, HÃ¤n\nleader Chief Isaac, worked with the Government of Canada and the Anglican Church\nto move his people from Tr'ochÃ«k to Moosehide â downriver at . Chief Isaac was\nrespected among his own people and newcomers alike. While he welcomed the\nstampeders, \"he never failed to remind them that they prospered at the expense\nof the original inhabitants by driving away their game and taking over their\nland.\" Chief Isaac envisioned the impact that new lifestyles would have on HÃ¤n\ntraditional culture. In response he entrusted many songs and dances to First\nNations people living in Alaska.\n\nDuring the years following the Klondike Gold Rush, the HÃ¤n worked to find a\nbalance between their traditional lifestyle and the ways of the newcomers.\n\nYukon First Nations set the Land Claims process in motion during the 1970s.\nTrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin began negotiating their individual Land Claim in 1991. The\nTrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin Final Agreement was signed on July 16, 1998 and came into\neffect on September 15, 1998.\n\nThe government is growing and evolving to support citizens in ensuring a strong\nand healthy future while maintaining connections to traditional knowledge and\nthe land. Promoting the HÃ¤n language, learning traditional skills from the\nElders, and investing in youth have all strengthened TrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin\ndevelopment. This respect for their heritage and dedication to the future is\nreflected in a variety of ways. The biennial Moosehide Gatherings, the\nestablishment of DÃ¤nojÃ  Zho Cultural Centre, the designation of TrâochÃ«k\nNational Historic site, and the return of the traditional songs, which were once\nentrusted to Alaskan First Nations people, all reflect TrâondÃ«k HwÃ«châin\ninvestment in their future and pride in their rich heritage.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Tr’ondëk_Hwëch’in_First_Nation","recorded":1375055769,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Help:IPA","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/First_Nations","/wiki/Yukon","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Dawson_City,_Yukon","/wiki/H%C3%A4n_language","/wiki/Yukon_River","/wiki/Salmon","/wiki/Reindeer","/wiki/Moose","/wiki/Han_(North_American_people)","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Fur_trader","/wiki/Missionary","/wiki/Fortymile_River","/wiki/Grayling_(genus)","/wiki/Tr%27och%C3%ABk","/wiki/Klondike_River","/wiki/Government_of_Canada","/wiki/Anglican_Church_of_Canada","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&params=64_05_40_N_139_26_12_W_scale:5000","/wiki/Alaska","/wiki/Klondike_Gold_Rush","/wiki/Aboriginal_land_claim","/wiki/Alaska_Natives","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=edit&section=1","http://www.trondek.ca/","http://sdiprod2.inac.gc.ca/fnprofiles/FNProfiles_DETAILS.asp?BAND_NUMBER=494","http://www.chiefisaac.com/","/wiki/Template:First_Nations_in_the_Yukon","/wiki/Template_talk:First_Nations_in_the_Yukon","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:First_Nations_in_the_Yukon&action=edit","/wiki/First_Nations","/wiki/Yukon","/wiki/Gwich%E2%80%99in","/wiki/Kaska_people","/wiki/H%C3%A4n_language","/wiki/Northern_Tutchone","/wiki/Southern_Tutchone","/wiki/Tagish","/wiki/Tlingit_people","/wiki/Upper_Tanana_language","/wiki/Carcross/Tagish_First_Nation","/wiki/Champagne_and_Aishihik_First_Nations","/wiki/First_Nation_of_Nacho_Nyak_Dun","/wiki/Kluane_First_Nation","/wiki/Kwanlin_D%C3%BCn_First_Nation","/wiki/Liard_River_First_Nation","/wiki/Little_Salmon/Carmacks_First_Nation","/wiki/Ross_River_Dena_Council","/wiki/Selkirk_First_Nation","/wiki/Ta%27an_Kwach%27an_Council","/wiki/Teslin_Tlingit_Council","/wiki/Vuntut_Gwitchin_First_Nation","/wiki/White_River_First_Nation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tr’ondëk_Hwëch’in_First_Nation&oldid=539365979","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:First_Nations_in_Yukon","/wiki/Category:First_Nation_governments_in_Yukon","/wiki/Category:Dawson_City","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_November_2010","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk+Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in+First+Nation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk+Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in+First+Nation","/wiki/Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation","/wiki/Talk:Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation","#","/wiki/Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&oldid=539365979","/w/index.php?title=Tr%E2%80%99ond%C3%ABk_Hw%C3%ABch%E2%80%99in_First_Nation&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1468698","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite
