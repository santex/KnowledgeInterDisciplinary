unions|","Labour relations"],"text":"\n\n\n\nA 'trade union' (British English—'amalgamation' is also used), 'labour union'\n(Canadian English) or 'labor union' (American English) is an organization of\nworkers who have banded together to achieve common goals such as protecting the\nintegrity of its trade, achieving higher pay, increasing the number of\nemployees an employer hires, and better working conditions. The trade union,\nthrough its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (\nmembers) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with\nemployers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is\n\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\".<ref name=\"webb\">\nch. I</ref> This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint\nprocedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits,\nworkplace safety and policies.\n\nUnions may organize a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism<ref\nname=\"Poole, M. 1986\">Poole, M., 1986. Industrial Relations: Origins and\nPatterns of National Diversity. London UK: Routledge.</ref>), a cross-section of\nworkers from various trades (general unionism<ref name=\"Ibid\">ibid.</ref>), or\nattempt to organize all workers within a particular industry (industrial\nunionism<ref name=\"Ibid\" />). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding\non the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-\nmember workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the\ngovernance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels\nof government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their\nnegotiations and functioning.\n\nOriginating in Europe, trade unions became popular in many countries during the\nIndustrial Revolution, when the lack of skill necessary to perform most jobs\nshifted employment bargaining power almost completely to the employers' side,\ncausing many workers to be mistreated and underpaid. Trade unions may be\ncomposed of individual workers, professionals, past workers, students,\napprentices and/or the unemployed.\n","title":"trade%20union","headings":["History","Prevalence","Europe","United States","Mexico","Colombia","India","Japan","Australia","Structure and politics","Shop types","Diversity of international unions","International unionisation","Criticisms","Union publications","Film","See also","References","Further reading","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: International_Trade_Union_Confederation","3: Collective_bargaining","3: Craft_unionism","3: General_union","3: Industrial_unionism","3: Sweden","3: Norway","3: Australia","3: Canada","3: Denmark","3: Switzerland","3: UK","3: USA","2: Economist","2: Union_busting","2: Germany","2: AFL-CIO","2: Change_to_Win_Federation","2: ILO","2: Japan","2: RENGO","2: Labour_movement","2: Belgium","2: Netherlands","2: Strike_action","2: Laissez-faire","2: Labour_council","1: British_English","1: Canadian_English","1: American_English","1: Working_conditions","1: Labour_and_employment_law","1: Employment","1: Wage","1: Occupational_safety_and_health","1: Europe","1: Industrial_Revolution","1: Bargaining_power","1: Workers","1: Professionals","1: Retiree","1: Students","1: Apprentices","1: Unemployed","1: Lawrence,_Massachusetts","1: Industrial_revolution","1: Catholic_Church","1: Pope_Leo_XIII","1: Magna_Carta","1: Guild","1: Instructional_capital","1: Apprenticeship","1: Artisan","1: Journeyman","1: Master_craftsman","1: Livery_company","1: Ordinance_of_Labourers","1: Kingdom_of_England","1: Sidney_Webb","1: Beatrice_Webb","1: Benefit_society","1: Freemasonry","1: Independent_Order_of_Odd_Fellows","1: Friendly_Society","1: Fraternal_organisation","1: Adam_Smith","1: Political_power","1: Tolpuddle_Martyrs","1: Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights","1: Human_rights_abuse","1: Discrimination","1: Scandinavian","1: Ireland","1: New_Model_Union","1: United_Kingdom","1: Winter_of_Discontent","1: Margaret_Thatcher","1: United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979","1: James_Callaghan","1: Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_German_states","1: Economy_of_Germany","1: German_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions","1: Public_sector","1: Joseph_Stiglitz","1: CEO","1: Economic_inequality","1: Mechanicsâ_Union_Trade_Association","1: Abraham_Lincoln","1: Knights_of_Labor","1: Uriah_Stephens","1: Chinese_Exclusion_Act","1: Samuel_Gompers","1: Neo-liberalism","1: Washington_Consensus","1: Mexican_Miracle","1: National_Union_of_Workers","1: Dan_La_Botz","1: National_Education_Workers'_Union","1: Paramilitarism_in_Colombia","1: Duke_University_Press","1: India","1: International_Workers'_Day#Japan","1: Labour_unions","1: Meiji_period","1: Industrialization","1: Anti-union","1: Occupation_of_Japan","1: Zenroren","1: Zenrokyo","1: ACTU","1: Australian_Labor_Party","1: Child_labour","1: Worker_safety","1: Standard_of_living","1: United_Farm_Workers","1: Delano,_California","1: Finland","1: South_Korea","1: Local_union","1: List_of_federations_of_trade_unions","1: International","1: Juristic_person","1: Employment_contract","1: Industrial_action","1: SINALTRAINAL","1: Social_Movement_Unionism","1: Political_party","1: Oxford","1: Service_model","1: Organising_model","1: Union_organizer","1: Solidarity&nbsp;â_The_Union_for_British_Workers","1: British_National_Party","1: Election","1: Australian_Centre_for_Industrial_Relations_Research_and_Training","1: Hiring_hall","1: Rand_formula","1: California","1: Free_riders","1: Right-to-work_law","1: Taft-Hartley_Act","1: Co-determination","1: Verein_Deutscher_Ingenieure","1: Left-wing","1: Socialist","1: Social_democrat","1: International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters","1: Ronald_Reagan","1: Privatisation","1: Conservative_Trade_Unionists","1: Republic_of_Korea","1: Korean_New_Year","1: Brussels","1: World_Federation_of_Trade_Unions","1: Global_union_federation","1: Union_Network_International","1: International_Transport_Workers_Federation","1: International_Federation_of_Journalists","1: Comparative_advantage","1: Milton_Friedman","1: Capitalism","1: LabourStart","1: Global_Unions","1: Workers_Independent_News","1: Ken_Loach","1: Cleaner","1: Danny_DeVito","1: Sturla_Gunnarsson","1: General_Motors","1: Martin_Ritt","1: Crystal_Lee_Sutton","1: 1998_Australian_waterfront_dispute","1: Eight-hour_day","1: Labor_Management_Reporting_and_Disclosure_Act","1: List_of_trade_unions","1: New_Unionism","1: Directly_Affiliated_Local_Union","1: National_trade_union_center","1: Labor_federation_competition_in_the_United_States","1: International_Labor_Rights_Forum","1: International_Workers_Association","1: London","1: Her_Majesty's_Stationery_Office"]}
