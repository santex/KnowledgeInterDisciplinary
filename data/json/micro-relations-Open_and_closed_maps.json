{"cursor":"6471","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn topology, an 'open map' is a function between two topological spaces which\nmaps open sets to open sets. That is, a function f : X â Y is open if\nfor any open set U in X, the image f(U) is open in Y. Likewise, a 'closed map'\nis a function which maps closed sets to closed sets. (The concept of a closed\nmap should not be confused with that of a closed operator.)\n\nNeither open nor closed maps are required to be continuous. Although their\ndefinitions seem more natural, open and closed maps are much less important than\ncontinuous maps. Recall that, by definition, a function f : X â Y is continuous\nif the preimage of every open set of Y is open in X. (Equivalently, if the\npreimage of every closed set of Y is closed in X).\n","linknr":157,"url":"Open_and_closed_maps","recorded":1362552421,"links":18,"instances":["topology","mathematics","complex_analysis","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","topology","topology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["General topology","Continuous mappings","Lemmas"],"headings":["Examples","Properties","Open and closed mapping theorems","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["image","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["continuous_function","topology"],["interval","mathematics"],["neighborhood","topology"],["base","topology"],["closure","topology#closure_operator"],["product","topology"],["injection","mathematics"],["open_mapping_theorem","functional_analysis"],["open_mapping_theorem","complex_analysis"]],"members":["base","function","open_mapping_theorem","closure","interval","image","continuous_function","injection","product","neighborhood"],"related":["Topology","Function_(mathematics)","Topological_space","Open_set","Image_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Closed_set","Closed_operator","Continuous_function_(topology)","Preimage","Homeomorphism","Bijective","If_and_only_if","Discrete_topology","Floor_function","Real_number","Integer","Connected_space","Product_topology","Fiber_bundle","Covering_map","Tube_lemma","Unit_circle","Angle","Interval_(mathematics)","Compact_space","Codomain","If_and_only_if","Neighborhood_(topology)","Base_(topology)","Function_composition","Product_(topology)","Surjection","Quotient_map","Injection_(mathematics)","Topological_embedding","Bijection","Homeomorphism","Sufficient_condition","Necessary_condition","Compact_space","Hausdorff_space","Proper_map","Locally_compact_space","Functional_analysis","Open_mapping_theorem_(functional_analysis)","Linear_operator","Banach_space","Complex_analysis","Open_mapping_theorem_(complex_analysis)","Holomorphic_function","Connected_space","Complex_plane","Invariance_of_domain","Manifold","Quasi-open_map","Proper_map"]}
