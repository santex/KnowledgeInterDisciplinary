It was invented around 1844 by the Dutch\npharmacist Petrus Jacobus Kipp and widely used in chemical laboratories and for\ndemonstrations in schools into the second half of the 20th century.\n\nIt later fell out of use, at least in laboratories, because most gases then\nbecame available in small gas cylinders. These industrial gases are much purer\nand drier than those initially obtained from a Kipp apparatus without further\nprocessing.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Kipp's_apparatus","recorded":1362579667,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory equipment"],"headings":["Design and operation","Examples for prepared gases and their educts","For further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Kipp_apparatus.jpg/220px-Kipp_apparatus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_sulfide"]],"members":[],"related":["Gas","Petrus_Jacobus_Kipp","Laboratories","Gas_cylinder","Glass","Polyethylene","Hydrogen","Zinc","Hydrochloric_acid","Carbon_dioxide","Marble","Calcium_carbonate","Hydrogen_sulfide","Iron(II)_sulfide","Acetylene","Calcium_carbide","Water","Chlorine","Potassium_permanganate","Manganese_dioxide"]}
