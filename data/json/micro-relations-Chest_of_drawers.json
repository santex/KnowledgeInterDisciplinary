{"cursor":"5517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'chest of drawers', also called (especially in North American English) a\n'dresser' or a 'bureau', is a piece of furniture that has multiple parallel,\nhorizontal drawers stacked one above another.\n\nA [[chifforobe]] (from chiffonier + wardrobe) is a combination of a wardrobe and\na chest of drawers. A dresser is a piece of furniture that is usually waist\nhigh, has drawers and normally room for a mirror so that a person could \"dress\"\nin front of it. It should not be confused with a chest of drawers.\n\nChests of drawers have traditionally been made and used for storing clothing,\nespecially underwear, socks, and other items not normally hung in or otherwise\nstored in a closet. They are usually placed in a bedroom for this purpose, but\ncan actually be used to store anything that will fit inside and can be placed\nanywhere in a house or another place. Various personal sundry items are also\noften stored in a chest of drawers. It has a long history as one of the stand-\nbys of a carpenter's workshop. A typical chest is approximately rectangular in\noverall shape and often has short legs at the bottom corners for placement on\nthe floor.\n\nChests of drawers often come in 5-, 6-, and 7-drawer varieties, with either a\nsingle or a double top drawer. The chest illustrated at right would be described\nas a '5 over 2 chest-on-chest', the latter term deriving from the fact that at\none time it would have been made as 2 separable pieces. They are commonly made\nof wood, similar to many other kinds of furniture, but of course can be made of\nother materials. The inside of the drawers can be accessed by pulling them out\nat the front side. It is often placed so that the back side faces a wall since\naccess to the back is not necessary. The lateral sides are also usually made\nsuch that they can be placed against a wall or in a corner. Although they can be\nplain in appearance, chests of drawers can also be made with a fancy or\nornamental appearance, including finishes and various external color tones.\nTraditionally, drawers would slide out on smooth wood rails. Most modern\ncabinets use roll-out shelf sliders, made of metal, with rollers.\n\nMost chests of drawers fall into one of two types: those which are about waist-\nhigh or bench-high and those (usually with more drawers) which are about shoulder-\nhigh. Both types typically have a flat surface on top. Waist-high chests often\nhave a mirror placed vertically on top, which is often bought with the piece.\nWhile a user is getting dressed or otherwise preparing their grooming, he or she\ncan look at themselves in the mirror to check their appearance. Some users may\nkeep lamps for lighting on top of either kind of dresser, and decorative items\nor photos are sometimes added for appearance.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Chest_of_drawers","recorded":1364036991,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:ChestOfDrawers.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/ChestOfDrawers.jpg/220px-ChestOfDrawers.jpg","/wiki/File:ChestOfDrawers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/North_American_English","/wiki/Furniture","/wiki/Drawer_(furniture)","/wiki/Chifforobe","/wiki/Clothing","/wiki/Underwear","/wiki/Closet","/wiki/Bedroom","/wiki/Carpentry","/wiki/Wood","/wiki/Roll-out_shelf","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Mirror","/wiki/Lamp_(fixture)","#History","#Styles","#Contemporary_forms","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:19th_century_chest.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/19th_century_chest.JPG/220px-19th_century_chest.JPG","/wiki/File:19th_century_chest.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Medieval","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Oak","/wiki/England","/wiki/France","/wiki/Walnut","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Tejo_Remy-Chest-of-Drawers-XS.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/76/Tejo_Remy-Chest-of-Drawers-XS.jpg/220px-Tejo_Remy-Chest-of-Drawers-XS.jpg","/wiki/File:Tejo_Remy-Chest-of-Drawers-XS.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Chifforobe","/wiki/Commode","/wiki/Chiffonier","/wiki/Dresser_(furniture)","/wiki/Highboy","/wiki/Lowboy","/wiki/Nightstand","/wiki/Tansu","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A7585&page_number=1&template_id=1&sort_order=1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&oldid=526286824","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Furniture","/wiki/Category:Cabinets","/wiki/Category:Clothing_containers","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_January_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_January_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chest+of+drawers&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chest+of+drawers","/wiki/Chest_of_drawers","/wiki/Talk:Chest_of_drawers","#","/wiki/Chest_of_drawers","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chest_of_drawers","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chest_of_drawers","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&oldid=526286824","/w/index.php?title=Chest_of_drawers&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chest_of_drawers&id=526286824","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chest+of+drawers","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chest+of+drawers&oldid=52
