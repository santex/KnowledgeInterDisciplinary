It implements the majority of the\nstandard, is ACID-compliant, is fully transactional (including all\nDDL statements), has extensible data types, operators, index methods,\nfunctions, aggregates, procedural languages, and has a large number of\nextensions written by third parties.\n\nThe vast majority of Linux distributions have PostgreSQL available in supplied\npackages.

edition.\n","linknr":905,"url":"PostgreSQL","recorded":1362891313,"links":68,"instances":["sql","programming_language","operating_system","database","computing","sql","programming_language","protocol","database","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","javascript_engine","sql","programming_language","sql","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M85-95.pdf","http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M85-95.pdf","http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M87-13.pdf","http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M87-13.pdf","http://drkp.net/drkp/papers/ssi-vldb12.pdf","http://drkp.net/drkp/papers/ssi-vldb12.pdf","http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/attachments/135_PGCon%202009%20-%20Aster%20v6.pdf","http://www.pgcon.org/2009/schedule/attachments/135_PGCon%202009%20-%20Aster%20v6.pdf","http://www.asterdata.com/resources/assets/cs_Aster_Data_4.0_MySpace.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20101114141918/http://asterdata.com/resources/assets/cs_Aster_Data_4.0_MySpace.pdf","http://www.asterdata.com/resources/assets/cs_Aster_Data_4.0_MySpace.pdf","http://www.postgresql.org/files/about/casestudies/wcgcasestudyonpostgresqlv1.2.pdf","http://www.postgresql.org/files/about/casestudies/wcgcasestudyonpostgresqlv1.2.pdf"],"categories":["PostgreSQL|","Linux
