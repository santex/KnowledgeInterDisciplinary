It is most commonly experienced as the agent\nthat gives weight to objects with mass and causes them to fall to the\nground when dropped.\n\nGravitation is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature, along with\nelectromagnetism, and the nuclear strong force and weak force. Gravitation is\nthe only of these interactions that affects any matter.<ref>\"Matter\" in the\nbroad sense, including radiation (massless particles).</ref> In modern physics,\nthe phenomenon of gravitation is most accurately described by the general theory\nof relativity by Einstein, in which the phenomenon itself is a consequence of\nthe curvature of spacetime governing the motion of inertial objects. The simpler\nNewton's law of universal gravitation postulates the gravity force proportional\nto masses of interacting bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance between them. It provides an accurate approximation for most physical\nsituations including calculations as critical as spacecraft trajectory.\n\nFrom a cosmological perspective, gravitation causes dispersed matter to\ncoalesce, and coalesced matter to remain intact, thus accounting for the\nexistence of planets, stars, galaxies and most of the macroscopic objects in the\nuniverse. It is responsible for keeping the Earth and the other planets in their\norbits around the Sun; for keeping the Moon in its orbit around the Earth; for\nthe formation of tides; for natural convection, by which fluid flow occurs under\nthe influence of a density gradient and gravity; for heating the interiors of\nforming stars and planets to very high temperatures; and for various other\nphenomena observed on Earth and throughout the universe.\n","title":"Gravitation","headings":["History of gravitational theory","Specifics","Anomalies and discrepancies","Alternative theories","See also","Notes","Footnotes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Mass","3: Spacetime","3: General_relativity","2: Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation","2: Universe","2: Orbit","2: Sun","2: Equivalence_principle","2: Black_hole","2: Quasar","2: Quantum_field_theory","2: Standard_gravity","2: Dark_matter","2: Modified_Newtonian_dynamics","2: Gravity_assist","1: Astronaut","1: David_Scott","1: Megabyte","1: Ogg","1: Theora","1: Natural_phenomenon","1: Physical_body","1: Weight","1: Free_fall","1: Fundamental_interaction","1: Electromagnetism","1: Strong_interaction","1: Weak_interaction","1: Matter","1: Radiation","1: Physics","1: General_theory_of_relativity","1: Einstein","1: Force","1: Inversely_proportional","1: Distance","1: Orbital_mechanics","1: Planet","1: Star","1: Galaxies","1: Moon","1: Tide","1: Convection","1: Density_gradient","1: Galileo_Galilei","1: Apocryphal","1: Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa","1: Inclined_plane","1: Aristotle","1: Galileo","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Inverse-square_law","1: Ismaël_Bullialdus","1: Neptune","1: Uranus","1: John_Couch_Adams","1: Urbain_Le_Verrier","1: Johann_Gottfried_Galle","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Theory_of_relativity","1: Loránd_Eötvös","1: Coordinate_system","1: Regular_grid","1: Curvature","1: Newtonian_physics","1: Field_equation","1: Einstein_field_equations","1: Simultaneous_equations","1: Nonlinear_system","1: Differential_equation","1: Schwarzschild_solution","1: Circular_symmetry","1: Rotation","1: Gravitational_singularity","1: Schwarzschild_radius","1: Reissner–Nordström_metric","1: Geometrized","1: Event_horizon","1: Kerr_metric","1: Kerr–Newman_metric","1: Physical_cosmology","1: Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker_metric","1: Tests_of_general_relativity","1: Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury","1: Pound–Rebka_experiment","1: Hafele–Keating_experiment","1: GPS#Relativity","1: Arthur_Stanley_Eddington","1: Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919","1: Gravitational_lens","1: Time_delay_of_light","1: Irwin_I._Shapiro","1: Gravitational_radiation","1: Pulsar","1: Alexander_Friedmann","1: Cosmological_constant","1: Georges_Lemaître","1: Edwin_Hubble","1: Frame_dragging","1: Gravity_Probe_B","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: Fundamental_forces","1: Virtual_particle","1: Photon","1: Classical_limit","1: Planck_length","1: Quantum_gravity","1: Newton's_3rd_law","1: Newtons","1: Contact_force","1: Potential_energy","1: Galactic_Center","1: Galaxy","1: Supercluster","1: Solar_System","1: PSR_B1913+16","1: Neutron_star","1: LIGO","1: Earth_tide","1: Chinese_Science_Bulletin","1: Galaxy_rotation_curve","1: Galaxy_groups_and_clusters","1: Metric_expansion_of_space","1: Dark_energy","1: Astronomical_unit#Developments","1: Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","1: Lyman-alpha_forest","1: Aristotelian_theory_of_gravity","1: Le_Sage's_theory_of_gravitation","1: Georges-Louis_Le_Sage","1: Ritz's_Equation","1: Nordström's_theory_of_gravitation","1: Whitehead's_theory_of_gravitation","1: Brans–Dicke_theory","1: Induced_gravity","1: Andrei_Sakharov","1: Mordehai_Milgrom","1: Newton's_Second_Law","1: Self-creation_cosmology","1: Nonsymmetric_gravitational_theory","1: Tensor–vector–scalar_gravity","1: Jacob_Bekenstein","1: Gravity_as_an_entropic_force","1: Superfluid_vacuum_theory","1: Collective_excitation","1: Superfluid","1: Anti-gravity","1: Artificial_gravity","1: Birkeland_current","1: Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann_equations","1: Escape_velocity","1: Gravity_well","1: G-force","1: Acceleration","1: Gauge_gravitation_theory","1: Gauss's_law_for_gravity","1: Gravitational_binding_energy","1: Gravity_gradiometry","1: Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment","1: Gravity_Research_Foundation","1: Jovian-Plutonian_gravitational_effect","1: Kepler's_third_law","1: Lagrangian_point","1: Mixmaster_dynamics","1: N-body_problem","1: Newton's_laws_of_motion","1: Pioneer_anomaly","1: Scalar_theories_of_gravitation","1: Speed_of_gravity","1: Standard_gravitational_parameter","1: Weightlessness","1: Max_Born"]}
