In the Italian language and Portuguese the majority of the words\nare like this.\n\nIn medieval Latin lyric poetry, a paroxytonic line or half-line is one where the\npenultimate syllable is stressed, as in the second half of the verse \"Estuans\nintrinsecus || ira vehementi.\"\n\nRelated terms are proparoxytone (stress on the last one but two) and oxytone\n(accented on the last one).\n",
