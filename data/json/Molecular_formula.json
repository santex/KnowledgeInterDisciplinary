This is 'not' a chemical formula. Examples of chemical formulas for butane are\n  the empirical formula C 2H 5, the molecular formula\n  C 4H 10 , and the condensed (or semi-structural) formula\n  CH 3CH 2CH 2CH 3]]\n\nA 'chemical formula' is a way of expressing information about the proportions of\natoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of\nchemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as\nparentheses, dashes, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (â) signs. These are\nlimited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts\nand superscripts. A chemical formula contains no words.\n\nThe simplest types of such formulas are called [[empirical formula]]s, which use\nonly letters and numbers indicating atomic proportional ratios (the numerical\nproportions of atoms of one type to those of other types). Molecular formulas\nindicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular\nsubstance, and are thus sometimes the same as empirical formulas (for molecules\nthat only have one atom of a particular type), and at other times require larger\nnumbers than do empirical formulas. An example of the difference is the\nempirical formula for glucose, which is CH 2O, while its molecular\nformula requires all numbers to be increased by a factor of six, giving\nC 6H 12 O6 .\n\nSometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a condensed\nformula (or condensed molecular formula, occasionally called a \"semi-structural\nformula\"), which conveys additional information about the particular ways in\nwhich the atoms are chemically bonded together, either in covalent bonds, ionic\nbonds, or various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant\nbonding is easy to show in one dimension. An example is the condensed\nmolecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH 3-CH 2-\nOH or CH 3CH 2OH. However, even a condensed chemical formula\nis necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships\nbetween atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different\nsubstituents.\n\nSince a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element\nsymbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which\nis a graphical representation of the spacial relationship between atoms in\nchemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and\nchemical formulas, at right). For reasons of structural complexity, there is no\ncondensed chemical formula (or semi-structural formula) that specifies glucose\n(and there exist many different molecules, for example fructose and mannose,\nhave the same molecular formula C 6H 12 O6 as\nglucose). Linear equivalent chemical names exist that can and do specify any\ncomplex structural formula, but these names must use many terms (words), rather\nthan the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that\ndefine a chemical formula.\n\nChemical formulas may be used in chemical equations to describe chemical\nreactions and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic\ncompounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulas do not have the full\npower of structural formulas to show chemical relationships between atoms, they\nare sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electical\ncharges in chemical reactions, thus balancing chemical equations so that these\nequations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and\nconservation of electric charge.\n","linknr":286,"url":"Molecular_formula","recorded":1362482210,"links":73,"instances":["graph_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical nomenclature","Chemical formulas","Notation"],"headings":["Overview","Simple empirical formulas","Condensed formulas in organic chemistry implying molecular geometry and structural formulas","Chemical names in answer to limitations of chemical formulas","Polymers in condensed formulas","Ions in condensed formulas","Isotopes","Trapped atoms","Non-stoichiometric chemical formulas","General forms for organic compounds","Hill System","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Butan_Lewis.svg/150px-Butan_Lewis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Isobutane-numbered-2D.png/150px-Isobutane-numbered-2D.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Butan_Lewis.svg/150px-Butan_Lewis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Endohedral_fullerene.png/180px-Endohedral_fullerene.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["connectivity","graph_theory"]],"members":["connectivity"],"related":["Chemical_formula","Aluminum_sulfate","Atom","Chemical_compound","Chemical_element","Chemical_bond","Covalent_bond","Ionic_bond","Structural_formula","Fructose","Mannose","C6H12O6","Chemical_equation","Chemical_reaction","Chemical_element","Chemical_symbol","Ethanol","Boron_carbide","Molecule","Glucose","Dimethyl_ether","Organic_compound","Ionic_compound","Polyatomic_ion","Dichlorine_hexoxide","Chemical_nomenclature","Acetic_acid","Chemistry","Empirical_formula","Ionic_compounds","Isomer","Elemental_analysis","Analytical_chemistry","Hexane","Carbon","Hydrogen","Hydrogen_peroxide","Formaldehyde","Acetic_acid","Connectivity_(graph_theory)","Isomers","Structural_formula","Molecular_geometry","Chemical_bond","Isomer","Ethane","Ethylene","Double_bond","Triple_bond","Functional_group","Parenthesis","Isobutane","Methyl_group","Butane","Chemical_nomenclature","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry_2005","International_Chemical_Identifier","Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system","Polymer","Hydrocarbon","Ion","Polyatomic_ion","Hydronium","Sulfate","Caesium_dodecaborate","Ammine","Isotope","Nuclear_chemistry","Stable_isotope","Superscript","Atomic_number","Nuclear_reactions","At_sign","Buckminsterfullerene","Fullerene","Endohedral_fullerene","ASCII","Integer","Non-stoichiometric_compound","Decimal_fraction","Homologous_series","Alcohols","Carbon","Atom","Molecule","Hydrogen","Chemical_element","Alphabetical_order","Empirical_formula","Structural_formula","Dictionary_of_chemical_formulas","Element_symbol","Nuclear_notation","Periodic_table","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry"]}
