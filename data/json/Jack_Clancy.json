He also played in college for the University of\nMichigan Wolverines from 1963 to 1966.\n\nAt Michigan, Clancy started as a quarterback, switched to halfback, returned\npunts and kickoffs, and became a star as an end. In two seasons as an end\n(1965â1966), Clancy rewrote the Michigan receiving record book. At the time of\nhis graduation, he held the school records for most receptions and receiving\nyards in a career, season and game. His 1966 total of 197 receiving yards\nagainst Oregon State remained Michigan's single-game receiving record until\nNovember 6, 2010. He was named an All-American and also set the Big Ten\nConference record for most receptions in a single season of conference play.\nThough most of his records have since been broken, Clancy continues to rank\namong the leading receivers in Michigan history.\n\nClancy was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the American Football League (AFL).\nIn 1967, quarterback Bob Griese and Clancy were both rookies for the Dolphins.\nClancy caught 67 passes that year, setting an AFL rookie record. He was third in\nthe AFL in receptions in 1967 and eighth in receiving yards. He was named to the\n1967 AFL All-star game. After a sensational rookie season, Clancy suffered a\nserious knee injury in a 1968 exhibition game and missed the entire season.\nWhile making a comeback in 1969, Clancy suffered an injury to his other knee.\nTraded to the Green Bay Packers in 1970, Clancy was unable to return to his\nprior form after the knee injuries. He made only 16 receptions in 14 games and\nwas released by the Packers before the start of the 1971 season.\n","linknr":479,"url":"Jack_Clancy","recorded":1375056727,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Jack_Clancy.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Jack_Clancy.JPG/190px-Jack_Clancy.JPG","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Humboldt,_Iowa","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1966_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Miami_Dolphins","/wiki/1967_AFL_season","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/1970_NFL_season","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/All-star","/wiki/Rookie","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/All-American","/wiki/1966_College_Football_All-America_Team","/wiki/MVP","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Touchdown","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=CLANCJAC01","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Miami_Dolphins","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)","/wiki/Punt_returner","/wiki/Kickoff_returner","/wiki/End_(American_football)","/wiki/Lists_of_Michigan_Wolverines_football_receiving_leaders","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Yard","/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football","/wiki/College_Football_All-America_Team","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","/wiki/Lists_of_Michigan_Wolverines_football_receiving_leaders","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Bob_Griese","/wiki/Forward_pass","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","#College","#1963_season","#1964_season","#1965_season","#1966_season","#Records","#Michigan_single-season_reception_yardage","#Michigan_single-game_reception_yardage","#Professional_career","#Miami_Dolphins","#Green_Bay_Packers","#Career_statistics","#College_2","#Professional","#100-yard_games","#See_also","#Notes","#Further_reading","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Humboldt,_Iowa","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-Muscatine-2","/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin","/w/index.php?title=St._Mary_of_Redford_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan","/wiki/Freshman","/wiki/Quarterback","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)","/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)","/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)","/wiki/Total_offense","/wiki/Kickoff_return","/wiki/Rush_(American_football)","/wiki/Punt_return","#cite_note-Archive-4","/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-Halfback-6","#cite_note-JCBentley-7","#cite_note-Halfback-6","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Jim_Detwiler","#cite_note-Combo-10","#cite_note-Vidmer-11","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/End_(American_football)","/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Season_(sports)","#cite_note-Archive-4","#cite_note-Combo-10","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers_football","/wiki/Touchdown","/wiki/Wally_Gabler","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Associated_Press","/wiki/Bennie_Oosterbaan","/wiki/Lowell_Perry","/wiki/Ron_Kramer","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Captain_(sports)","#cite_note-Muscatine-2","#cite_note-15","/wiki/United_Press_International","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan","/wiki/Quarterback","/wiki/Cornerback","/wiki/Safety_(American_football_position)","/wiki/Rick_Volk","/wiki/Forward_pass","#cite_note-Combo-10","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football","/wiki/Forward_pass","#cite_note-Combo-10","/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","#cite_note-20","/wiki/1966_College_Football_All-America_Team","/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=Jack_Clancy&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Lists_of_Michigan_Wolverines_football_receiving_leaders","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","#cite_note-JCBentley-7","/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football","/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_football","/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats_foot
