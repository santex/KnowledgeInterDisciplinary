HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of\nmechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid\nmechanics, and heat transfer. Refrigeration is sometimes added to the field's\nabbreviation as HVAC&R or HVACR, or ventilating is dropped as in HACR (such as\nthe designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers).\n\nHVAC is important in the design of medium to large industrial and office\nbuildings such as skyscrapers and in marine environments such as aquariums,\nwhere safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to\ntemperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.\n\n on the downdraught system, by impulsion, or the 'plenum' principle, applied to\n schoolrooms (1899)]] Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning is based on\n inventions and discoveries made by Nikolay Lvov, Michael Faraday, Willis\n Carrier, Reuben Trane, James Joule, William Rankine, Sadi Carnot, and many\n others.\n\nThe invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the\nindustrial revolution, and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and\nsystem control are constantly introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.\nThe three central functions of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning are\ninterrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable\nindoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance\ncosts. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, reduce air infiltration, and\nmaintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and\nremoval from spaces is known as room air distribution. Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion, Rock and Zhu, ASHRAE,\nInc., New York, USA, 2002\n\nThe starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating\ndepends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However\nbefore taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air\nrequirements for each area in detail, as pressurization is an important\nconsideration.\n\nIn modern buildings the design, installation, and control systems of these\nfunctions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small\nbuildings, contractors normally capacity engineer and select HVAC systems and\nequipment. For larger buildings, building services designers and engineers, such\nas mechanical, architectural, or building services engineers analyze, design,\nand specify the HVAC systems, and specialty mechanical contractors fabricate and\ncommission them. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the\ninstallations are normally required for all sizes of buildings.\n\nThe HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and\nmaintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales,\nand in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by\nthe manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations\nsuch as HARDI, ASHRAE, SMACNA, ACCA, Uniform Mechanical Code, International\nMechanical Code, and AMCA have been established to support the industry and\nencourage high standards and achievement.\n","linknr":727,"url":"HVAC","recorded":1362485499,"links":52,"instances":["mechanical","hvac","architecture","industrial_exhaust","heating","systems_architecture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heating,
