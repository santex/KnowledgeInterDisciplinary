Rationality. (1999). The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy.\nPg. 772. It is a normative concept of reasoning in the sense that rational\npeople should derive conclusions in a consistent way given the information at\ndisposal. It refers to the conformity of one's beliefs with one's reasons to\nbelieve, or with one's actions with one's reasons for action. However, the term\n\"rationality\" tends to be used differently in different disciplines, including\nspecialized discussions of economics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary\nbiology and political science. A 'rational' decision is one that is not just\nreasoned, but is also optimal for achieving a goal or solving a problem.\n\nDetermining optimality for rational behavior requires a quantifiable formulation\nof the problem, and the making of several key assumptions. When the goal or\nproblem involves making a decision, rationality factors in how much information\nis available (e.g. complete or incomplete knowledge). Collectively, the\nformulation and background assumptions are the model within which rationality\napplies. Illustrating the relativity of rationality: if one accepts a model in\nwhich benefiting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior\nthat is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a\nmodel in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is\ndeemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also\nspecifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed\nand formulated.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Rationality","recorded":1362485205,"links":39,"instances":["linguistics","making_excuses","argument","game_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/philosophie/files/wspohn45.pdf","http://www.benasque.org/2009emotion/papers/EmotionalTheoryofRationality_img.pdf"],"categories":["Autonomy","Concepts in epistemology","Philosophical logic","Philosophy of mind","Reasoning|","Underlying principles of microeconomic behavior","Philosophy of psychology"],"headings":["Theories of rationality","Quality of rationality","Theoretical and practical rationality","Examples of Rationality Applied to Different Fields","See also","References","External links and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png/32px-Nicolas_P._Rougier%27s_rendering_of_the_human_brain.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reason","argument"],["reason","argument"],["coherence","linguistics"],["imputation","game_theory"],["rationalization","making_excuses"]],"members":["coherence","rationalization","reason","imputation"],"related":["Philosophy","Optimal","Reason_(argument)","Reason_(argument)","Economics","Sociology","Psychology","Evolutionary_biology","Political_science","Knowledge","Max_Weber","Instrumental_rationality","Jürgen_Habermas","Feminist","Psychology_of_reasoning","Philip_Johnson-Laird","Ruth_M.J._Byrne","Conjunction_fallacy","Wason_selection_task","Base_rate_fallacy","Gerd_Gigerenzer","Bounded_rationality","Richard_Brandt","Psychotherapy","A.C._Grayling","Cognitive_science","Neuroscience","Amygdala","Kant","Jesús_Mosterín","Bayes_estimator","Organization","Bounded_rationality","Rational_choice_theory","Logically_consistent","Artificial_intelligence","Psychology_of_reasoning","Bounded_rationality","Coherence_(linguistics)","Counter-intuitive","Evolution","Flipism","Homo_economicus","Imputation_(game_theory)","Intelligence","Irrationality","Laws_of_thought","Perfect_rationality","Principle_of_rationality","Rational_choice_theory","Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy","Rational_pricing","Rationalism","Rationalization_(making_excuses)","Satisficing","Superrationality","Lucy_Suchman","Cristina_Bicchieri","Cristina_Bicchieri"]}
