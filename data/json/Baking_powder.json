Baking powder works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter\nor dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to\nexpand and thus leavening the mixture. It is used instead of yeast for end-\nproducts where fermentation flavors would be undesirable or where the\nbatter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few\nminutes. Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through\nthe acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical\nleavening are called quick breads.\n\nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of an alkaline component\n(typically sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda), one or more acid\nsalts (such as tartaric acid), and an inert starch (cornstarch in most cases,\nthough potato starch may also be used). Baking soda is the source of the carbon\ndioxide, and the acid-base reaction can be generically represented\nas\n\n:NaHCO 3 + H + â Na + + CO 2 +\nH 2O\n\nThe inert starch serves several functions in baking powder. Primarily it is used\nto absorb moisture, and thus prolong shelf life by keeping the powder's alkaline\nand acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely. A dry\npowder also flows and mixes more easily. Finally, the added bulk allows for more\naccurate measurements.\n\nThe acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting.\nA fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature,\nand a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven. Baking powders\nthat contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double acting; those that\ncontain only one acid are single acting. By providing a second rise in the oven,\ndouble-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by\nrendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, and this is\nthe type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders\nwork in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. http://books.google.com/books?id=b-\niwjIb2RxwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=baking+science&hl=en&ei=gPOVTYfhFOzZiAKyjqGdC-\nQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=sifting&f-\n=false Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and\nmonocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature\nacid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate and\nsodium acid pyrophosphate.\n","linknr":312,"url":"Baking_powder","recorded":1362580835,"links":55,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Leavening agents","Baking powder|"],"headings":["History","Use","Substituting in recipes","Usage of aluminium compounds","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Backpulver.jpg/300px-Backpulver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Leavening_agent","Alkali","Acid","Carbon_dioxide","Leavening_agent","Yeast","Quick_bread","Sodium_bicarbonate","Acid_salt","Tartaric_acid","Cornstarch","Potato_starch","Cream_of_tartar","Monocalcium_phosphate","Sodium_aluminium_sulfate","Sodium_aluminum_phosphate","Sodium_acid_pyrophosphate","Vinegar","Alfred_Bird","August_Oetker","Eben_Norton_Horsford","Justus_von_Liebig","Count_Rumford","National_Historic_Chemical_Landmarks","Teaspoon","Leavening","Buttermilk","Lemon_juice","Yogurt","Citrus","Honey","Baking_soda","Deprotonation","Baking_soda","Vinegar","Buttermilk","Yogurt","Calumet_Baking_Powder_Company","Clabber_Girl","Baking_soda"]}
