Examples include the\n mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of\n water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.\n\nAt any given time a dynamical system has a [[State (controls)|state]] given by a\nset of real numbers (a vector) that can be represented by a point in an\nappropriate [[state space]] (a geometrical manifold). Small changes in the state\nof the system create small changes in the numbers. The evolution rule of the\ndynamical system is a fixed rule that describes what future states follow from\nthe current state. The rule is deterministic; in other words, for a given time\ninterval only one future state follows from the current state.\n","title":"Dynamical%20system","headings":["Overview","Basic definitions","Linear dynamical systems","Local dynamics","Bifurcation theory","Ergodic systems","Examples of dynamical systems","Multidimensional generalization","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Statistical_mechanics","3: Logistic_map","3: Horseshoe_map","3: List_of_chaotic_maps","2: Manifold","2: Bifurcation_theory","2: Anosov_diffeomorphism","2: Chaos_theory","2: Double_pendulum","2: Arnold's_cat_map","2: Baker's_map","2: Dynamical_billiards","2: Dynamical_outer_billiards","2: Hénon_map","2: Lorenz_attractor","2: Circle_map","2: Sigma-algebra","1: Configuration_space","1: Mathematical_model","1: Real_numbers","1: Vector_space","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Differential_equation","1: Recurrence_relation","1: Time_scale_calculus","1: Computer","1: Lyapunov_stability","1: Structural_stability","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Linear_dynamical_system","1: Poincaré–Bendixson_theorem","1: Turbulence","1: Ergodic_theory","1: Henri_Poincaré","1: Tangent_space","1: Ordinary_differential_equation","1: Banach_space","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Complex_quadratic_polynomial","1: Dyadic_transformation","1: Tent_map","1: Piecewise_linear_function","1: Rössler_map","1: Kaplan-Yorke_map","1: Swinging_Atwood's_machine","1: Quadratic_Map_Simulation_System","1: Bouncing_ball_dynamics","1: Matrix_exponential","1: Eigenvalue","1: Eigenvector","1: Discrete-time_dynamical_system","1: Affine_transformation","1: Poincaré_section","1: Poincaré_map","1: Hartman–Grobman_theorem","1: Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser_theorem","1: Vector_field","1: Phase_space","1: Torus","1: Eigenvalues","1: Ruelle&ndash;Takens_scenario","1: Strange_attractor","1: Bifurcation_diagram","1: Period-doubling_bifurcation","1: Hamiltonian_mechanics","1: Poincaré_recurrence_theorem","1: Zermelo","1: Boltzmann","1: Ergodic_hypothesis","1: Bernard_Koopman","1: Functional_analysis","1: Transfer_operator","1: Statistical_mechanics#Canonical_ensemble","1: SRB_measure","1: Mathematics","1: Attractor","1: Meteorology","1: Diffeomorphism","1: Measure_space","1: Measurable_function","1: Iterated_function","1: Irrational_rotation","1: Rossler_map","1: Multidimensional_systems","1: Image_processing","1: Behavioral_modeling","1: Cognitive_model#Dynamical_Systems","1: Dynamical_systems_theory","1: Feedback_passivation","1: Infinite_compositions_of_analytic_functions","1: List_of_dynamical_system_topics","1: Oscillation","1: People_in_systems_and_control","1: Sharkovskii's_theorem","1: System_dynamics","1: Systems_theory","1: Scholarpedia","1: ETH","1: Gerald_Teschl"]}
