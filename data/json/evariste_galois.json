While still in his teens, he was able to determine a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals,\nthereby solving a long-standing problem. His work laid the foundations for\nGalois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the\nsubfield of Galois connections. He was the first to use the word \"group\" () as a\ntechnical term in mathematics to represent a group of [[permutation]]s. A\nradical Republican during the monarchy of Louis Philippe in France, he died from\nwounds suffered in a duel under questionable circumstances<ref>Stewart, J., et\nal. Algebra and Trigonometry. p. 334.</ref> at the age of twenty.\n",
