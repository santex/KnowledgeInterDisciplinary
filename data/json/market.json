While\nparties may exchange goods and services by barter, most markets rely on sellers\noffering their goods or services (including labor) in exchange for money from\nbuyers. It can be said that a market is the process by which the prices of goods\nand services are established.\n\nFor a market to be competitive, there must be more than a single buyer or\nseller. It has been suggested that two people may trade, but it takes at least\nthree persons to have a market, so that there is competition in at least one of\nits two sides.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sullivan\n  | first = arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors = Steven M.\n  | Sheffrin title = Economics: Principles in action publisher = Pearson\n  | Prentice Hall year = 2003 location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n  | pages = 28 url = http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&PMDb-\n  | SiteId=2781&PMDbSolutionId=6724&PMDbCategoryId=&PMDbProgramId=12881&level=4\n  | doi = id = isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref>\nHowever, competitive markets, as understood in formal economic theory, rely on\nmuch larger numbers of both buyers and sellers. A market with single seller and\nmultiple buyers is a monopoly. A market with a single buyer and multiple sellers\nis a monopsony. These are the extremes of imperfect competition.\n\nMarkets vary in form, scale (volume and geographic reach), location, and\ntypes of participants, as well as the types of goods and services traded.\nExamples include:\n* Physical retail markets, such as local farmers' markets (which are usually\n  held in town squares or parking lots on an ongoing or occasional basis),\n  shopping centers, market restaurants, and shopping malls\n* (Non-physical) internet markets (see electronic commerce)\n* Ad hoc auction markets\n* Markets for intermediate goods used in production of other goods and services\n* Labor markets\n* International currency and commodity markets\n* Stock markets, for the exchange of shares in corporations\n* Artificial markets created by regulation to exchange rights for derivatives\n  that have been designed to ameliorate externalities, such as pollution permits\n  (see carbon trading)\n* Illegal markets such as the market for illicit drugs, arms or pirated products\n\nIn mainstream economics, the concept of a 'market' is any structure that allows\nbuyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The\nexchange of goods or services for money is a transaction.<!-- a transaction\nwould occur if the \"exchange\" occurred with any consideration, whether\ngoods/services (barter), or money, or merely social goodwill capital. It need\nnot be only a monetary exchange to be called a transaction. --> Market\nparticipants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its\nprice. This influence is a major study of economics and has given rise to\nseveral theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and\ndemand. There are two roles in markets, buyers and sellers. <!--The definition\nimplies that at least three actors are needed for a market to exist; at least\none actor, on the one side of the market, who is aware of at least two actors on\nthe other side whose offers can be evaluated in relation to each other.--> The\nmarket facilitates trade and enables the distribution and allocation of\nresources in a society. Markets allow any tradable item to be evaluated and\npriced. A market emerges more or less spontaneously or may be constructed\ndeliberately by human interaction in order to enable the exchange of rights (cf.\nownership) of services and goods.\n","title":"market","headings":["Types of markets","Organization of markets","Mechanisms of markets","Study of markets","Size parameters","See also","Notes","References","Sources","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Stock_market","3: Marketplace","2: System","2: Money","2: Monopoly","2: Monopsony","2: Farmers'_market","2: Auction","2: Commodity_market","2: Price","2: Perfect_competition","1: Institution","1: Social_relation","1: Infrastructure","1: Barter","1: Imperfect_competition","1: Shopping_center","1: Shopping_mall","1: Electronic_commerce","1: Intermediate_good","1: Foreign_exchange_market","1: Corporation","1: Carbon_trading","1: Illegal_drug_trade","1: Arms_trafficking","1: Copyright_infringement","1: Mainstream_economics","1: Information_economy","1: Financial_transaction","1: Economic","1: Economic_models","1: Supply_and_demand","1: Buyer","1: Seller","1: Trade","1: Allocation_of_resources","1: Emergence","1: Spontaneous_order","1: Ownership","1: Liquid_asset","1: Bond_market","1: NYSE","1: American_Stock_Exchange","1: NASDAQ","1: Futures_market","1: Currency_market","1: Money_market","1: Prediction_market","1: Private_electronic_market","1: Black_market","1: EBay","1: Laissez-faire","1: Free_market","1: Tax","1: Subsidy","1: Minimum_wage","1: Price_ceiling","1: Market_failure","1: Structure","1: Exogeny","1: Referee","1: Regulation_of_sport","1: Consumer","1: Workforce","1: Democracy","1: Italy","1: Fernand_Braudel","1: Karl_Polanyi","1: Economic_history","1: Sociology","1: C._B._Macpherson","1: David_Ricardo","1: James_Mill","1: William_Stanley_Jevons","1: Walras","1: Neoliberalism","1: Structural_adjustment","1: Georg_Lukács","1: Pierre_Bourdieu","1: Regulation_school","1: Worker_cooperative","1: J._K._Gibson-Graham","1: Economic_sociology","1: Michel_Callon","1: Michel_Foucault","1: Actor-network_theory","1: Local_Exchange_Trading_Systems","1: Niklas_Luhmann","1: Market_value","1: United_Nations","1: Agricultural_marketing","1: Financial_market","1: Grocery_store","1: Knowledge_market","1: Market_economy","1: Market_Information_Systems","1: Market_microstructure","1: Market_square","1: Market_town","1: Media_market","1: Mercado_Central","1: Street_market","1: Supermarket","1: Wholesale_marketing","1: Shopper_marketing","1: Historical_Social_Research"]}
