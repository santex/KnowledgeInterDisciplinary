{"cursor":"7913","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]] is an American science fiction television\nseries created by Joss Whedon which premiered on Fox on February 13, 2009 in the\nUnited States. It ran for two seasons before its cancellation, ending\nits run January 29, 2010. The series comprised a\ntotal of 27 produced episodes, with two unaired episodes â the original unaired\npilot episode, \"Echo\" and the season one coda, \"Epitaph One\", which was aired\ninternationally. Both episodes were made available on the season one DVD and Blu-\nray releases.\n\nThe series focuses around Echo (Eliza Dushku), a member of a group of people\nknown as \"dolls.\" The dolls have had their personalities wiped clean so that\nthey can be imprinted with any number of new personas, becoming \"actives\".\nActives are given skills including memory, muscle memory, and language for\ndifferent assignments, which are called \"engagements\". They are then hired out\nfor particular jobs, crimes, fantasies, and occasional good deeds by the\nextremely wealthy. On missions, Actives are monitored internally (and remotely)\nby Handlers. In between tasks, they are mind-wiped into a childlike state\nreferred to as the Tabula rasa (blank slate), and live in a futuristic\ndormitory/laboratory set up as a spa, complete with five-star cuisine, exercise\nequipment, pools, games, relaxation techniques and tai chi classes, and\nprofessional massages. The hidden facility is called the Dollhouse, run by\nAdelle DeWitt (Olivia Williams) and located in Los Angeles as part of an\ninternational network of similar facilities. The story follows Echo, who begins,\nin her mind-wiped state, to become self-aware.\n\nDuring its two-season run, Dollhouse explores the issues of the morality and\nphilosophy behind its technology, as well as showcasing the disastrous\nconsequences of what could happen if the ability to wipe away a person's entire\nbeing could be put in the wrong hands. Switching between action/adventure,\ncomedy, science fiction, drama, and conspiracy thriller, Dollhouse showcased\nEcho's ability to move into personhood within the tabula rasa state. During the\nfirst season the Dollhouse faces the insane rogue Active Alpha, and during the\nsecond season Echo faces down the Rossum Corporationâthe force behind the\nDollhouse.\n\nDollhouse also features an ensemble cast of the people in the Los Angeles\nDollhouse, including Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Penikett), a discredited FBI agent who\nfalls in love with Echo and finds himself entangled in the Dollhouse conspiracy\nin his attempts to free her, Victor (Enver Gjokaj) and Sierra (Dichen Lachman),\ntwo dolls who also \"wake up\" within their wiped state and fall in love with each\nother, and the people behind the DollhouseâAdelle DeWitt (Olivia Williams);\nTopher Brink (Fran Kranz), the genius programmer behind the Dollhouse; Dr.\nClaire Saunders (Amy Acker), the scarred and haunted doctor of the Dollhouse who\nhas secrets of her own; and Boyd Langton (Harry Lennix), Echo's handler and an\nex-cop who struggles with the morality of the Dollhouse.\n","linknr":310,"url":"List_of_Dollhouse_episodes","recorded":1375069023,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Dollhouse_(TV_series)","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Joss_Whedon","/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-canceled-2","/wiki/Epitaph_One","/wiki/Echo_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Eliza_Dushku","/wiki/Personas","/wiki/Memory","/wiki/Muscle_memory","/wiki/Language","/wiki/Tabula_rasa","/wiki/Tabula_rasa","/wiki/Dormitory","/wiki/Laboratory","/wiki/Olivia_Williams","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Tahmoh_Penikett","/wiki/Victor_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Enver_Gjokaj","/wiki/Sierra_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Dichen_Lachman","/wiki/Olivia_Williams","/wiki/Fran_Kranz","/wiki/Amy_Acker","/wiki/Harry_Lennix","#Series_overview","#Episode_list","#Season_1_.282009.29","#Season_2_.282009.E2.80.9310.29","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/DVD","/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc","/wiki/Season_premiere","/wiki/Season_finale","/wiki/Region_1","/wiki/Region_2","/wiki/Region_4","#Season_1_.282009.29","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#Season_2_.282009.E2.80.9310.29","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Dollhouse_(season_1)","/wiki/Joss_Whedon","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Steven_S._DeKnight","#cite_note-11","/wiki/David_Solomon_(TV_producer)","/wiki/Maurissa_Tancharoen","/wiki/Jed_Whedon","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Rod_Hardy","/wiki/Sarah_Fain","/wiki/Elizabeth_Craft","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Allan_Kroeker","/wiki/Tim_Minear","#cite_note-14","/wiki/David_Straiton","#cite_note-15","/wiki/James_A._Contner","#cite_note-16","/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Enr%C3%ADquez_Alcal%C3%A1","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Andrew_Chambliss","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Elodie_Keene","/wiki/Jane_Espenson","#cite_note-19","/wiki/Dwight_H._Little","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","/wiki/Epitaph_One","#cite_note-22","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Dollhouse_(season_2)","/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-canceled-2","/wiki/Vows_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Joss_Whedon","#cite_note-24","/wiki/Instinct_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Marita_Grabiak","#cite_note-25","/wiki/Belle_Chose_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/David_Solomon_(TV_producer)","/wiki/Tim_Minear","#cite_note-26","/wiki/Belonging_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Jonathan_Frakes","/wiki/Maurissa_Tancharoen","/wiki/Jed_Whedon","#cite_note-27","/wiki/The_Public_Eye_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Andrew_Chambliss","#cite_note-dec4-28","/wiki/The_Left_Hand_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Wendey_Stanzler","#cite_note-dec4-28","/wiki/Meet_Jane_Doe","/wiki/Dwight_H._Little","#cite_note-dec11-29","/wiki/A_Love_Supreme_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/David_Straiton","#cite_note-dec11-29","/wiki/Stop-Loss_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Enr%C3%ADquez_Alcal%C3%A1","#cite_note-dec18-30","/wiki/The_Attic_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/John_Cassaday","#cite_note-dec18-30","/wiki/Getting_Closer_(Dollhouse)","#cite_note-31","/wiki/The_Hollow_Men_(Dollhouse)","/wiki/Terrence_O%27Hara","#cite_note-32","/wiki/Epitaph_Two:_Return","#cite_note-33","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Dollhouse_episodes&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://tv.ign.com/articles/927/927844p1.html","#cite_ref-canceled_2-0","#cite_ref-canceled_2-1","http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/fox-cancels-dollhouse-52555","#cite_ref-3","http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b3956_best_news_ever_joss_whedon_spills.html","/wiki/E!","#cite_ref-4","http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0024FAR66/","#cite_ref-5","http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001QXDLHY/","#cite_ref-6","http://www.ezydvd.com.au/blu-ray/dollhouse-joss-whedons-complete-season-1/dp/6118259","#cite_ref-7","http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dollhouse-Season-2/14080","#cite_ref-8","http://www.bva.org.uk/node/1418284","#cite_ref-9","http://www.ezydvd.com.au/blu-ray/dollhouse-season-2/dp/6139444","#cite_ref-10","http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/02/14/friday-ratings-how-did-dollhouse-and-terminator/12837","#cite_ref-1
