Banach was one of the founders of modern\nfunctional analysis and one of the original members of the Lwów School of\nMathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, Théorie des opérations linéaires\n(Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of\nfunctional analysis.\n\nBorn in Kraków, Banach enrolled in \"Henryk Sienkiewicz Gymnasium\" and worked on\nmathematics problems with his friend Witold Wiłkosz. After graduating in 1910,\nBanach and Wiłkosz moved to Lwów. However, Banach returned to Kraków during\nWorld War I and during this time, he met and befriended Hugo Steinhaus. After\nBanach solved mathematical problems which Steinhaus considered difficult, he and\nSteinhaus published their first joint work. Along with several other\nmathematicians, Banach formed a society for mathematicians in 1919. In 1920,\nBanach was given an assistantship in Jagiellonian University after Poland\nregained independence. He soon became a professor at Lwów Polytechnic and a\nmember of the Polish Academy of Learning during this period. Later Banach\norganized the \"Lwów School of Mathematics\". He began writing \"Théorie des\nopérations linéaires\" around 1929.\n\nOn the outbreak of World War II, Lwòw was taken over by the Soviet Union. As a\ncorresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, he promised to learn\nUkrainian. In 1941, when Germany took over the city, Banach, his colleagues, and\nhis sons worked as lice feeders at the Typhus Research Institute. When the\nSoviets recaptured Lwów, Banach reestablished the University. However, because\nthe Soviets were removing Poles from annexed formerly Polish territories, Banach\nprepared to return to Krakòw. He died in August 1945 after being diagnosed with\nlung cancer seven months earlier.\n\nSome of the notable mathematical concepts named after Banach include Banach\nspaces, Banach algebras, the Banach–Tarski paradox, the Hahn–Banach theorem, the\nBanach–Steinhaus theorem, the Banach-Mazur game, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and\nthe Banach fixed-point theorem.\n","title":"Stefan%20Banach","headings":["Life","Contributions","Quotes","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6: Soviet_Union","5: KrakÃ³w","4: Hugo_Steinhaus","4: LwÃ³w","4: Jagiellonian_University","3: Lviv","3: Lviv_University","3: BanachâTarski_paradox","3: BanachâSteinhaus_theorem","3: Functional_analysis","3: Polish_Academy_of_Learning","2: Stanislaw_Ulam","2: LwÃ³w_School_of_Mathematics","2: World_War_I","2: Academy_of_Sciences_of_Ukraine","2: Feeder_of_lice","2: Banach_algebra","2: HahnâBanach_theorem","2: BanachâAlaoglu_theorem","2: Banach_fixed-point_theorem","2: Poland","1: Grand_Duchy_of_KrakÃ³w","1: Austria-Hungary","1: Ukrainian_SSR","1: Mathematics","1: Lviv_Polytechnic","1: StanisÅaw_Mazur","1: National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_Ukraine","1: Mathematician","1: World_War_II","1: Mathematical","1: Concept","1: Banach_space","1: Banach-Mazur_game","1: AustriaâHungary","1: Podhale","1: Austro-Hungarian_Army","1: Marriage","1: Humanities","1: LwÃ³w_Polytechnic","1: Imperial_Russian_Army","1: Tutor","1: Lebesgue_integration","1: Otto_Nikodym","1: WÅadysÅaw_ÅlebodziÅski","1: Leon_Chwistek","1: Jan_KroÄ","1: WÅodzimierz_StoÅ¼ek","1: Polish_Mathematical_Society","1: Second_Polish_Republic","1: Doctorate","1: Antoni_Åomnicki","1: Scottish_CafÃ©","1: Linear_space","1: Metric_space","1: Nazi_Germany","1: Corresponding_member","1: Operation_Barbarossa","1: Rudolf_Weigl","1: Typhus","1: Nazi_concentration_camps","1: Red_Army","1: LvovâSandomierz_Offensive","1: Lychakiv_Cemetery","1: Complete_metric_space","1: Normed_vector_space","1: Eponym","1: Banach_spaces","1: Frigyes_Riesz","1: Norbert_Wiener","1: Charles_Ãmile_Picard","1: BanachâSchauder_theorem","1: PoincarÃ©âBirkhoff_theorem","1: Cauchy_space","1: BanachâStone_theorem","1: 16856_Banach","1: Banach_manifold","1: Amenable_Banach_algebra","1: Banach_bundle","1: Banach_function_algebra","1: Banach_limit","1: Banach's_matchbox_problem","1: Banach_measure","1: Closed_range_theorem","1: Ukraine"]}
