      "text" : "\n\n\n\n'Bacon' is a cured meat prepared from a pig. It is first cured using large\nquantities of salt, either in a brine or in a dry packing; the result is 'fresh\nbacon' (also known as 'green bacon'). Fresh bacon may then be further dried for\nweeks or months in cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried\nbacon is typically cooked before eating. Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is\nsome smoked bacon, but may be cooked further before eating.\n\nBacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat. It is usually made from\nside and back cuts of pork,<ref>http://www.thepauperedchef.com/2010/04/a-guide-to-bacon-styles-and-\nhow-to-make-proper-british-rashers.html</ref> except in the United States, where\nit is almost always prepared from pork belly (typically referred to as\n\"streaky\", \"fatty\", or \"American style\" outside of the US and Canada). The side\ncut has more meat and less fat than the belly. Bacon may be prepared from either\nof two distinct back cuts: fatback, which is almost pure fat, and pork loin,\nwhich is very lean. Bacon-cured pork loin is known as back bacon.\n\n\nBacon may be eaten smoked, boiled, fried, baked, or grilled, or used as a minor\ningredient to flavour dishes. Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts,\nespecially game, e.g. venison, pheasant. The word is derived from the Old High\nGerman bacho, meaning \"buttock\", \"ham\" or \"side of bacon\", and cognate with the\nOld French bacon.<ref></ref>\n\nIn continental Europe, this part of the pig is usually not smoked like bacon is\nin the United States; it is used primarily in cubes (lardons) as a cooking\ningredient, valued both as a source of fat and for its flavour. In Italy, this\nis called pancetta and is usually cooked in small cubes or served uncooked and\nthinly sliced as part of an antipasto.\n\nMeat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also\nbe cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred\nto as \"bacon\".<ref></ref> Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish\nand Muslim populations.<ref> </ref> The USDA defines bacon as \"the cured belly\nof a swine carcass\"; other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified\n(e.g., \"smoked pork loin bacon\"). For safety, bacon may be treated to prevent\ntrichinosis,<ref name=\"fsis\">{{cite\nweb|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=USDA Food Safety and Inspection\nService: Glossary B|work=|publisher=Food Safety and Inspection Service|date=|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Help/glossary-\nB/index.asp|format=|accessdate=2009-05-05\n| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090503200749/http://www.fsis.usda.go-\n| v/help/glossary-B/index.asp| archivedate= 3 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=\n| no}}</ref> caused by [[Trichinella]], a parasitic roundworm which can be\n| destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking.<ref></ref>\n\nBacon is distinguished from salt pork and ham by differences in the brine (or\ndry packing). Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium\nnitrite, and occasionally sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate (saltpeter);\nsodium ascorbate or erythorbate are added to accelerate curing and stabilise\ncolour. Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple are used for some products. If\nused, sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce\nspattering when the bacon is pan fried. Today, a brine for ham, but not bacon,\nincludes a large amount of sugar. Historically, \"ham\" and \"bacon\" referred to\ndifferent cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in\nthe same barrel.\n",
