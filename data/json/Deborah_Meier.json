{"cursor":"9662","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Deborah Meier' (born April 6, 1931) is an American educator often considered\nthe founder of the modern small schools movement. After\nspending several years as a kindergarten teacher in Chicago, Philadelphia and\nthen New York City, in 1974 Meier became the founder and director of the\nalternative Central Park East school, which embraced progressive ideals in the\ntradition of John Dewey in an effort to provide better education for children in\nEast Harlem, within the New York City public school system.\n\nMeier then served as founding principal for two other small public elementary\nschools, Central Park East II and River East, both in East Harlem. In 1984, with\nthe assistance and support of Ted Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools, Meier\nfounded the Central Park East Secondary School. The success of these schools has\nbeen documented in David Bensman's Central Park East and its Graduates: Learning\nby Heart (2000), and in Frederick Wiseman's documentary film, \"High School II\"\n(1994), among many other publications. During this time, and after, Meier helped\nto establish a network of small schools in New York City based on progressive\nprinciples. Among the many boards on which she has served was the founding board\nof the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. In 1987\nMeier received a MacArthur Fellowship, the first teacher or principal so\nhonored.\n\nIn 1996 Meier moved to Boston where she became the founding principal of a small\nK-8 pilot school, Mission Hill School, within the Boston Public Schools\nsystem. She is currently on the faculty of New York University's\nSteinhardt School of Education, as senior scholar and adjunct professor, as well\nas board member and Director of New Ventures at Mission Hill, director and\nadvisor to Forum for Democracy and Education, and on the Executive Board of The\nCoalition of Essential Schools.\n\nMeier documented her story and experiences at Central Park East Secondary School\nin The Power of their Ideas: Lessons for America from a Small School in Harlem\n(1995) ISBN 0-8070-3111-9. Her other books include, Will Standards Save Public\nEducation? (2000); [[In Schools We Trust]]: Creating Communities of Learning in\nan Era of Testing and Standardization (2002); with Ted and Nancy Sizer, Keeping\nSchool: Letters to Families from Principals of Two Small Schools (2004); and co-\nedited with George Wood, Many Children Left Behind (2004), all published by\nBeacon Press. She co-authored the book Playing for Keeps: Life and Learning on a\nPublic School Playground (2010) with Beth Taylor and Brenda Engel, published by\nTeachers College Press. She serves on the editorial boards of [[The Nation]],\nEducational Policy, Harvard Education Letter, and [[Dissent (magazine)|Dissent]]\nmagazine, to which she has contributed many articles, including her essay in the\n50th anniversary issue of Dissent, \"On Unions and Education\", in which she\nemphasizes the importance of union collaboration to her success in leading\npublic schools in New York and Boston. Meier regularly speaks and writes on the\nconnections between small schools, democratic education, education for\ndemocracy, progressive education, and public schooling.\n\nMeier received her bachelors and masters degrees from the University of Chicago\n(but spent two years at Antioch College before this). She has\nreceived honorary degrees from a large number of universities, including Brown\nUniversity, Clark University, Dartmouth\nCollege, Harvard University, Lesley University,\nYale University, and York University.\n\nShe has participated in a \"blog debate\" with Steinhardt School colleague Diane\nRavitch, among others, on the website of Education Week since February 26,\n2007.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Deborah_Meier","recorded":1374779925,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Meier&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Meier&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Small_schools_movement","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Central_Park_East","/wiki/John_Dewey","/wiki/East_Harlem","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Ted_Sizer","/wiki/Coalition_of_Essential_Schools","/wiki/National_Board_for_Professional_Teaching_Standards","#cite_note-4","/wiki/MacArthur_Fellowship","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Mission_Hill_School","/wiki/Boston_Public_Schools","#cite_note-7","/wiki/New_York_University","/wiki/Steinhardt_School_of_Education","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0807031119","/wiki/In_Schools_We_Trust","/wiki/The_Nation","/wiki/Dissent_(magazine)","/wiki/Democratic_education","/wiki/University_of_Chicago","/wiki/Antioch_College","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Brown_University","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Clark_University","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Dartmouth_College","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Harvard_University","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Lesley_University","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Yale_University","#cite_note-14","/wiki/York_University","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Diane_Ravitch","/wiki/Education_Week","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Meier&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/9677.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-klonsky-phd/deborah-meier-small-schools_b_859362.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.amazon.com/Central-Park-East-Its-Graduates/dp/0807739928/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1368749473&sr=1-1&keywords=central+park+east+and+its+graduates","#cite_ref-4","http://fedora.dlib.indiana.edu:8080/iudl-dissem/pdf?fullItemId=/lilly/meier/VAB8339-18409","#cite_ref-5","http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/16/us/macarthur-awards-of-150000-to-375000-go-to-outstandingly-talented-32.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/1030/ddeb.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Education-Practice-Mission-Practitioner/dp/0807753807/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1367680873&sr=1-1&keywords=matthew+knoester","#cite_ref-8","http://www.nae.edu/Programs/TechLit1/K12stds/WorkshoponStandardsforK-12EngineeringEducation/15122.aspx","#cite_ref-9","http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/1996-97/96-060d.html","#cite_ref-10","http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LndQs5mfqJYJ:fedora.dlib.indiana.edu:8080/iudl-dissem/pdf%3FfullItemId%3D/lilly/meier/VAB8339-22016+%22honorary+degree%22+%22deborah+meier%22+%22clark+university%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us","#cite_ref-11","http://thedartmouth.com/1996/06/09/news/college","#cite_ref-12","http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?doc.view=entire_text&docId=InU-Li-VAB8339","#cite_ref-13","http://www.lesley.edu/commencement/honorary-degree/","#cite_ref-14","http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?doc.view=entire_text&docId=InU-Li-VAB8339","#cite_ref-15","http://www.yorku.ca/univsec/senate/committees/hondeg/recipients.html","#cite_ref-16","http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/","/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Meier&action=edit&section=2","http://www.deborahmeier.com","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/54429624","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deborah_Meier&oldid=563745361","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1931_births","/wiki/Category:American_bloggers","/wiki/Category:American_education_writers","/wiki/Category:American_educators","/wiki/Category:American_schoolteachers","/wiki/Category:Antioch_College_alumni","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:MacArthur_Fellows","/wiki/Category:New_York_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:People_from_Boston,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Category:People_from_Manhattan","/wiki/Category:Democratic_education","/wiki/Category:Progressive_education","/wiki/Category:Philosophers_of_education","/wiki/Category:Educationists","/wiki/Category:American_non-fiction_writers","/wiki/Category:University_of_Chicago_alumni","/wiki/Category:Pedagogy","/wiki/Category:E
