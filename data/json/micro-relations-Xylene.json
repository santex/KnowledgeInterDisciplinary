The three isomeric\nxylenes each have a molecular formula of C 8H 10 , though the\nmore informative semi-structural formula\nC 6H 4(CH 3) 2 is also used commonly.\nThe xylenes are major petrochemicals, produced by catalytic reforming and also\nby coal carbonisation in the manufacture of coke fuel. Representing about 0.5â1%\nof crude oil (depending on the source), xylenes are found in small quantities in\ngasoline and airplane fuels. Xylenes are mainly produced as part of the BTX\naromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes) extracted from the product of catalytic\nreforming known as \"reformate\". The mixture is a slightly greasy, colourless\nliquid commonly encountered as a solvent. It was named in 1851, having been\ndiscovered as a constituent of wood tar. Several million tons are produced\nannually. Fabri, JÃ¶rg, Graeser, Ulrich, and Simo, Thomas A.,\nXylenes, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH,\nWeinheim. . In 2011, a global consortium began construction of one of the\nworldâs largest xylene plants in Singapore.
