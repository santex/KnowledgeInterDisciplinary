During the missile's development in the late stages of\nthe war, it was plagued by organisational problems and was cancelled before\nbecoming operational.\n\nAs early as 1943 it was becoming clear that Messerschmitt's super-interceptor,\nthe Me 163, would be difficult to use in combat. After flying to the\n25,000 ft altitude of the US bombers, it had only a few minutes to track\nthem down before running out of fuel. Even if it did manage to find the\nbombers, it had the equally prickly problem of lacking a weapon that could be\naimed effectively while closing on the target at some 400 mph difference\nin speeds.\n\nDr Wurster of Messerschmitt suggested the answer in the form of Flak Rakete 1 in\n1943. Instead of tracking down the planes, the rocket would fly just in front of\nthe target and then detonate a gigantic 500 kg warhead. With no human pilot\non board, and thus no need to limit takeoff acceleration, the rocket could use\nsolid fuel boosters for added thrust, reducing the amount of fuel needed for the\nrest of the climb. The result, even with this heavy warhead, was that a much\nsmaller airframe was needed to carry the required fuel - so small that the\ndesign could be portable and launched from a modified 88 mm gun mounting.\n\nThe design made as much use of wood as possible, due to the need to conserve\nother \"strategic\" materials in the rapidly deteriorating war situation. For the\nsame reasons a new type of Walter rocket was envisioned, a modification of the\nengine in the Me 163 that would burn coal-gas (benzine) instead of the hydrogen\nperoxide used in other Walter designs (although a small amount of peroxide was\nused to drive the fuel pumps).\n\nThe missile would be guided primarily under radio control from the ground. The\noperator would fly the missile into the vicinity of the bombers, then cut the\nengine and let it glide. This presented a real problem in the Enzian. Other\nGerman missiles were high-speed designs that could be flown directly at their\ntarget along the line of sight, easy enough to do even from the ground. The\nEnzian would instead be approaching its target from somewhere in front, which is\nconsiderably harder for the operator. Many experiments with radio and wire-\nguided missiles had demonstrated real problems with last-minute terminal\nguidance corrections.\n\nThe initial plans for solving this problem were rather advanced. The large\nairframe left plenty of room in the nose, which they intended to fill with a self-\ncontained radar unit called Elsass. In the short term it was planned to use some\nsort of proximity fuze while flying the missile through the bomber stream. The\nwarhead, of which several were studied, was to have a nominal lethal radius of\n45 metres.\n\nSeveral studies on the basic design were carried out, resulting in the FR-1\nthrough FR-5. The FR-5 was considered to be a reasonable starting point, so\ndevelopment commenced on the newly-named Enzian E.1 (and its engine) in\nSeptember 1943. By May 1944 60 airframes were complete, awaiting their engines.\nIn order to gain flight test data they were fitted with RATO units instead.\n\nA series of 38 flight tests commenced with generally favourable results, but the\nengine still lagged. Finally Dr. Konrad, designing the engine for the\nRheintochter missile, was asked to modify his design for the Enzian. After\nstudy, it appeared this was a much better (and cheaper) solution anyway, and\nafter January 1945 there were no plans to use the Walter design. The resulting\nE-4 version with the Konrad engine was considered the production version.\n\nA new design of the proximity fuze known as Madrid then gained favour, and it is\nfor this reason the Enzian remains famous. However the system was never actually\ndeveloped beyond a test-bench mockup.\n\nOn January 17, 1945, all ongoing projects were cancelled by the Luftwaffe in\norder to concentrate all possible efforts on only two designs, the Messerschmitt\nMe 262 and the Heinkel He 162. Although this was the official story, many in the\nNazi and Luftwaffe hierarchy had their own pet projects continue. The Enzian was\njudged further from completion than Henschel's Schmetterling missile, so it was\ncancelled. Messerschmitt engineers continued some low-level work on the project,\nhoping it would be re-funded, but by March it was clear the order would not be\nrescinded (although it had been for other designs) and all efforts ended.\n\nOnly two Enzian missiles are known to have survived the war. One is on display\nat the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford and the other is in storage at\nthe Australian War Memorial after being displayed for many years at the Royal\nAustralian Air Force Museum.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Enzian","recorded":1372158335,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Enzian_Rakete.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Enzian_Rakete.JPG/300px-Enzian_Rakete.JPG","/wiki/File:Enzian_Rakete.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Enzian_anti-aircraft_missile_at_the_Treloar_Technology_Centre_in_September_2012.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Enzian_anti-aircraft_missile_at_the_Treloar_Technology_Centre_in_September_2012.JPG/300px-Enzian_anti-aircraft_missile_at_the_Treloar_Technology_Centre_in_September_2012.JPG","/wiki/File:Enzian_anti-aircraft_missile_at_the_Treloar_Technology_Centre_in_September_2012.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:RAF_Museum_Cosford_-_DSC08609.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/RAF_Museum_Cosford_-_DSC08609.JPG/300px-RAF_Museum_Cosford_-_DSC08609.JPG","/wiki/File:RAF_Museum_Cosford_-_DSC08609.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Genus","/wiki/Gentian","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile","/wiki/Anti-aircraft","/wiki/Infrared","/wiki/Messerschmitt","/wiki/Interceptor_aircraft","/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_163","/wiki/Detonation","/wiki/88_mm_gun","/wiki/Hellmuth_Walter","/wiki/Benzine","/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide","/wiki/Radio_control","/wiki/Proximity_fuze","/wiki/RATO","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","/wiki/Rheintochter","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Luftwaffe","/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262","/wiki/Heinkel_He_162","/wiki/Nazism","/wiki/Henschel","/wiki/Henschel_Hs_117","/wiki/Royal_Air_Force_Museum_Cosford","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial","/wiki/RAAF_Museum","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_guided_missiles_of_Germany","/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder","/wiki/List_of_missiles","/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://rafmuseum-1.titaninternet.co.uk/cosford/collections/missiles/missile_info.cfm?missile_id=4","#cite_ref-2","http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL33903/","/w/index.php?title=Enzian&action=edit&section=3","http://www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/LRG/enzian.html","/wiki/Template:Aviation_lists","/wiki/Template_talk:Aviation_lists","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Aviation_lists&action=edit","/wiki/Aviation","/wiki/List_of_aircraft","/wiki/List_of_aircraft_manufacturers","/wiki/List_of_aircraft_engines","/wiki/List_of_aircraft_engine_manufacturers","/wiki/List_of_gliders","/wiki/List_of_airlines","/wiki/List_of_defunct_airlines","/wiki/List_of_airports","/wiki/List_of_civil_aviation_authorities","/wiki/List_of_aerospace_museums","/wiki/Aircraft_registration#List_of_countries.2Fregions_and_their_registration_prefixes_and_patterns","/wiki/List_of_rotorcraft","/wiki/List_of_rotorcraft_manufacturers_by_country","/wiki/Timeline_of_aviation","/wiki/List_of_air_forces","/wiki/List_of_aircraft_weapons","/wiki/List_of_experimental_aircraft","/wiki/List_of_missiles","/wiki/List_of_unmanned_aerial_vehicles","/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft","/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_by_location","/wiki/List_of_fatalities_from_aviation_accidents","/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll#Aviation","/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_general_aviation","/wiki/Lists_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_military_aircraft","/wiki/Flight_airspeed_record","/wiki/Flight_altitude_record","/wiki/Flight_distance_record","/wiki/Flight_endurance_record","/wiki/List_of_firsts_in_aviation","/wiki/List_of_large_aircraft","/wiki/List_of_most_produced_aircraft","/wiki/List_of_most_produced_roto
