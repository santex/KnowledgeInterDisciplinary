{"cursor":"44268","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nIn economics, a 'model' is a theoretical construct that represents economic by a\nset of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between\nthem. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate\ncomplex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques.\nFrequently, economic models posit structural parameters. Structural parameters\nare underlying parameters in a model or class of models. Moffatt, Mike.\n(2008) About.com\n[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural\nParameters] Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19,\n2008. A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change\nto create various properties. Methodological uses of models include\ninvestigation, theorizing, fitting theories to the world. â¢ Mary S.
