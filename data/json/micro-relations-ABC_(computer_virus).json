ABC\nactivates on the 13th day of every month.\n\nUpon infection, ABC becomes memory-resident at the top of system memory but\nbelow the 640K DOS boundary and hooks interrupts 16 and 1C. The copy of\ncommand.com pointed to by the COMSPEC environment variable may also be\naltered. ABC infects/alters COM and EXE files as they are executed.\n\nAfter infection, total system memory, as measured by the DOS CHKDSK program,\nwill not be altered, but available free memory will have decreased by\napproximately 8,960 bytes. Altered, but not infected, COM or EXE files will have\n4 to 30 bytes added to their length. Infected EXE files (COM files are never\ninfected) have a file length increase of 2,952 to 2,972 bytes, and ABC is\nlocated at the end of the infected EXE. An altered/infected file's date and time\nin the DOS disk directory listing may have been updated to the current system\ndate and time when the file was altered/infected.\n\nNo text strings are visible within the viral code in infected EXE files, but the\nfollowing text strings are encrypted within the initial copy of the ABC virus:\n\n:ABC_FFEA :Minsk 8.01.92 :ABC\n\nABC causes keystrokes on the compromised machine to be repeated. It seems double-\nletter combinations trigger this behavior, e.g. \"book\" becomes \"\". System hangs\nmay also occur when some programs are executed, a likely side effect of ABC-\ninduced corruption.\n\nThe ABC virus is not to be confused with the ABC keylogger trojan, written in\n2004 by Jan ten Hove.\n","linknr":97,"url":"ABC_(computer_virus)","recorded":1362581103,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["DOS file viruses"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Virus","DOS","COM_file","EXE","USSR","Computer_virus","EXE","COM_file","EXE","Friday_the_13th","K","Hooking","Interrupt","Command.com","COMSPEC","Environment_variable","CHKDSK","Byte"]}
