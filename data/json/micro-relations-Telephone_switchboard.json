{"cursor":"10672","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'switchboard' (also called a 'manual exchange') was a device used to connect a\ngroup of telephones manually to one another or to an outside connection, within\nand between telephone exchanges or private branch exchanges (PBXs). The user was\ntypically known as an operator. Public manual exchanges disappeared during the\nlast half of the 20th century, leaving a few PBXs working in offices and hotels\nas 'manual branch exchange's.\n\nThe electromechanical automatic telephone exchange, invented by Almon Strowger\nin 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges.\nManual PBXs have also for the most part been replaced by more sophisticated\ndevices or even personal computers, which give the operator access to an\nabundance of features. In modern businesses, a PBX often has an attendant\nconsole for the operator, or an auto-attendant avoiding the operator entirely.\n","linknr":554,"url":"Telephone_switchboard","recorded":1362565612,"links":34,"instances":["electricity","audio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History of telecommunications","Telephone exchanges"],"headings":["Operation","History","Virtual switchboard","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/JT_Switchboard_770x540.jpg/200px-JT_Switchboard_770x540.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Offutt_Air_Force_Base_operator.jpg/220px-Offutt_Air_Force_Base_operator.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/TexasRichardson_telephoneExchangeOperator.jpg/200px-TexasRichardson_telephoneExchangeOperator.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Photograph_of_Women_Working_at_a_Bell_System_Telephone_Switchboard_%283660047829%29.jpg/220px-Photograph_of_Women_Working_at_a_Bell_System_Telephone_Switchboard_%283660047829%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phone_connector","audio"],["battery","electricity"]],"members":["battery","phone_connector"],"related":["Telephone","Telephone_exchange","Private_branch_exchange","Switchboard_operator","Hotel","Electromechanical","Automatic_telephone_exchange","Almon_Strowger","Business","Attendant_console","Auto-attendant","Strategic_Air_Command","Offutt_Air_Force_Base","Nebraska","Subscriber","Cord_circuit","Payphone","Phone_connector_(audio)","Tip_and_ring","Busy_signal","On-hook","Off-hook","Telegraphy","New_England_Telephone_and_Telegraph","Battery_(electricity)","Lexington,_Massachusetts","Kellogg_Switchboard_&_Supply_Company","Panel_switch","Direct_dial","Long_distance_calling","Multi-frequency","Reorder_tone","Traffic_Service_Position_System","Interactive_voice_response"]}
