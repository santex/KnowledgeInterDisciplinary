{"cursor":"5348","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, a 'coefficient' is a multiplicative factor in some term of an\nexpression (or of a series); it is usually a number, but in any case does not\ninvolve any variables of the expression. For instance in\n: 7x^2-3xy+1.5+y\nthe first two terms respectively have the coefficients 7 and â3. The third term\n1.5 is a constant. The final term does not have any explicitly written\ncoefficient, but is considered to have coefficient 1, since multiplying by that\nfactor would not change the term. Often coefficients are numbers as in this\nexample, although they could be parameters of the problem, as a, b, and c in\n: ax^2+bx+c\nwhen it is understood that these are not considered as variables. Thus a\npolynomial in one variable x can be written as\n: a_k x^k + \\dotsb + a_1 x^1 + a_0\nfor some integer k , where a_k, \\dotsc, a_1, a_0 are\ncoefficients; to allow this kind of expression in all cases one must allow\nintroducing terms with 0 as coefficient. For the largest i with\na_i \\ne 0 (if any), a_i is called the 'leading\ncoefficient' of the polynomial. So for example the leading coefficient of the\npolynomial\n\n: \\, 4x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2\n\nis 4.\n\nSpecific coefficients arise in mathematical identities, such as the binomial\ntheorem which involves binomial coefficients; these particular coefficients are\ntabulated in Pascal's triangle.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Coefficient","recorded":1362374629,"links":47,"instances":["mathematics","linear_algebra","mathematics","mathematics","geometric","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polynomials","Mathematical terminology","Algebra"],"headings":["Linear algebra","Examples of physical coefficients","Chemistry","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/2/6/22628236ddb2a675235d6ff84a8eec43.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/7/5b7bc9adb96a6ee1dc17b024f1ddab74.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/5/a45af437e8c5915d7f8751145e16877f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce4b16b22b58894aa86c421e8759df3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/6/1/d613427491c7392bfd01aa39961f9c77.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/e/dced6f1777486ca8591547464225da7a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/8/d/d8dd7d0f3eb7145ca41c711457b7eb8f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/3/243acabaa562789781f6a0af82e73c42.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/4/f944bd996c27602109a536225f801561.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/6/b669545c091ce9a8edcd97d98971277e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/3/9e3669d19b675bd57058fd4664205d2a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/d/12d88bd2e1b9c62bdae58cbdc9eeb9c2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/b/12b95c2a1616298670343ed918b4f362.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/5/46503b85bced74233ae033e06f99ca48.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/6/4f645cef778354b6fc6e9a9fa63ed844.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/9/a8970556f82155430c09c99db24d4261.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["term","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["series","mathematics"],["variable","mathematics"],["constant","mathematics"],["vector","geometric"],["basis","linear_algebra"]],"members":["variable","basis","expression","constant","vector","series","term"],"related":["Mathematics","Term_(mathematics)","Expression_(mathematics)","Series_(mathematics)","Variable_(mathematics)","Polynomial","Binomial_theorem","Binomial_coefficient","Pascal's_triangle","Linear_algebra","Constant_(mathematics)","Coordinates","Vector_(geometric)","Vector_space","Basis_(linear_algebra)","Thermodynamics","Chemistry","Aerodynamics","Aerodynamics","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_tunnelling","Chemical_equation","Molecule","Stoichiometry","Degree_of_a_polynomial","Monic_polynomial","Mathematics_Association_of_America"]}
