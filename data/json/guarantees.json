'agreement' having a lawful object entered into voluntarily\nby two or more parties, each of whom intends to create one or more legal\nobligations between them. The 'elements' of a contract are \"offer\" and\n\"acceptance\" by \"competent persons\" having legal capacity who exchange\n\"consideration\" to create \"mutuality of obligation.\"<ref>http://contracts.uslegal.com/elements-of-a-\ncontract/</ref>\n\nProof of some or all of these elements may be done in writing, though contracts\nmay be made entirely orally or by conduct. The remedy for breach of contract can\nbe \"damages\" in the form of compensation of money or specific performance\nenforced through an injunction. Both of these remedies award the party at loss\nthe \"benefit of the bargain\" or expectation damages, which are greater than mere\nreliance damages, as in promissory estoppel. The parties may be natural persons\nor juristic persons. A contract is a legally enforceable promise or undertaking\nthat something will or will not occur. The word promise can be used as a legal\nsynonym for contract,<ref>http://legal-\ndictionary.thefreedictionary.com/promise</ref> although care is required as a\npromise may not have the full standing of a contract, as when it is an agreement\nwithout consideration.\n\nContract law varies greatly from one jurisdiction to another, including\ndifferences in common law compared to civil law, the impact of received law,\nparticularly from England in common law countries, and of law codified in\nregional legislation. Regarding Australian Contract Law for example, there are\n40 relevant acts which impact on the interpretation of contract at the\nCommonwealth (Federal / national) level, and an additional 26 acts at the level\nof the state of NSW. In addition there are 6 international instruments or\nconventions which are applicable for international dealings, such as the United\nNations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of\nGoods.<ref>Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 Contract Law,\nThird Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne</ref>\n","title":"Contract","headings":["History","Elements","Formation","Performance","Contractual terms","Setting aside the contract","Remedies for breach of contract","Contract theory","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Unjust_enrichment","4: Warranty","3: Common_law","3: Tort","3: Restitution","3: Breach_of_contract","3: Invitation_to_treat","2: Specific_performance","2: Estoppel#Promissory_estoppel","2: Consideration","2: Law_of_obligations","2: United_States","2: Gentlemen's_agreement","2: Uniform_Commercial_Code","2: Reasonable_person","2: Negotiation","2: Quasi-contract","2: Quantum_meruit","2: Public_policy","2: Lord_Denning","2: Voidable","2: Contractual_Term","2: Standard_form_contract","2: Force_majeure","2: Tort_of_deceit","2: Statute","2: Sale_of_Goods_Act_1979","2: Australia","1: Injunction","1: Expectation_damages","1: Reliance_damages","1: Legal_personality","1: Reception_statute","1: United_Nations_Convention_on_Contracts_for_the_International_Sale_of_Goods","1: Latin","1: Pact","1: Hans_Wehberg","1: The_American_Journal_of_International_Law","1: Assumpsit","1: Freedom_of_contract","1: United_Kingdom","1: Law_of_the_United_States","1: French_Civil_Code","1: Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964","1: Lochner_era","1: Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","1: Due_Process_Clause","1: Contract_Clause","1: Intention_to_be_legally_bound","1: Commercial_law","1: Construction_law","1: Software_license","1: Employment_contract","1: Insurance_policy","1: Deed","1: Professional_service","1: Wholesale","1: Meeting_of_the_minds","1: Mirror_image_rule","1: Unilateral","1: Promise","1: Commerce","1: Condition_precedent","1: Implied_contract","1: Implied_in_fact_contract","1: Patient","1: Implied_in_law_contract","1: Court","1: Legislation","1: Central_London_Property_Trust_Ltd._v._High_Trees_House_Ltd.","1: Accord_and_satisfaction","1: Duress#In_contract_law","1: Undue_influence","1: Unconscionability","1: Misrepresentation","1: Frustration_of_purpose","1: Statute_of_Frauds","1: Statute_of_frauds","1: Law_of_Property_Act_1925","1: Implied-in-fact_contract","1: Implied-in-law_contract","1: Victorian_era","1: Smoke_ball","1: Influenza","1: Pound_sterling","1: Legally_binding","1: Offer_and_Acceptance","1: Gimmick","1: Court_of_appeal","1: Reasonable_man","1: Executory_contract","1: Substantial_performance","1: Fry_v._Barnes","1: Contract_price","1: Commercial_contracts","1: Common_practice","1: Severability_clause","1: Objective_test","1: Contractual_term","1: Lawsuit","1: One_size_fits_all","1: Consumer_protection","1: Conditions_precedent","1: Theatre","1: Misrepresentation_Act_1967","1: Puffery","1: Privy_Council","1: Implied_covenant_of_good_faith_and_fair_dealing","1: Israel","1: India","1: Country","1: Supply_of_Goods_and_Services_Act_1982","1: Unenforceable","1: Public_procurement","1: Rescission","1: Smith_v._Hughes","1: Black's_Law_Dictionary","1: Legal_burden_of_proof","1: Natural_person","1: Artificial_person","1: Canada","1: Employment","1: Plausible_deniability","1: National_security","1: Minimum_wage","1: Workman's_compensation","1: Damages","1: The_Crown","1: Petition_of_right","1: Home_Secretary","1: Attorney-General","1: Crown_Proceedings_Act_1947","1: UCC","1: Anticipatory_breach","1: Hadley_v._Baxendale","1: 13th_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","1: Unclean_hands","1: Arbitration","1: Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority","1: NYSE","1: Fraud","1: Uniform_Arbitration_Act","1: England_and_Wales","1: Interim_injunction","1: Legal_realism","1: Critical_legal_studies","1: Marxist","1: Relational_contract","1: Ian_Roderick_Macneil","1: Lon_L._Fuller","1: Transaction_cost","1: Efficient_breach","1: Contract_of_sale","1: Contract_awarding","1: Design_by_contract","1: Document_automation","1: Estoppel","1: Ethical_implications_in_contracts","1: Good_faith","1: Indenture","1: Information_asymmetry","1: Memorandum_of_understanding","1: Option_contract","1: Perfect_tender_rule","1: Principal–agent_problem","1: Judicial_remedy","1: Social_contract","1: Stipulation","1: Tortious_interference","1: Voidable_contract","1: Letters_of_assist","1: Australian_contract_law","1: English_contract_law","1: German_contract_law","1: Indian_contract_law","1: United_States_contract_law","1: South_African_contract_law"]}
