Artificial intelligence is the simulation of intelligence\nin machines.\n\nWithin the discipline of psychology, various approaches to human intelligence\nhave been adopted. The psychometric approach is especially familiar to the\ngeneral public, as well as being the most researched and by far the most widely\nused in practical settings.<ref name=APA1995> Article in Wikipedia: </ref>\n",
