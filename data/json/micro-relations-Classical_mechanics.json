{"cursor":"41882","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physics, 'classical mechanics' is one of the two major sub-fields of\nmechanics, which is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the\nmotion of bodies under the action of a system of forces. The study of the motion\nof bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and\nlargest subjects in science, engineering and technology.\n\nClassical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from\nprojectiles to parts of machinery, as well as astronomical objects, such as\nspacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. Besides this, many specializations\nwithin the subject deal with gases, liquids, solids, and other specific sub-\ntopics. Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results as long as the\ndomain of study is restricted to large objects and the speeds involved do not\napproach the speed of light. When the objects being dealt with become\nsufficiently small, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field\nof mechanics, quantum mechanics, which reconciles the macroscopic laws of\nphysics with the atomic nature of matter and handles the waveâparticle duality\nof atoms and molecules. In the case of high velocity objects approaching the\nspeed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by special relativity. General\nrelativity unifies special relativity with Newton's law of universal\ngravitation, allowing physicists to handle gravitation at a deeper level.\n\nThe term classical mechanics was coined in the early 20th century to describe\nthe system of physics begun by Isaac Newton and many contemporary 17th century\nnatural philosophers, building upon the earlier astronomical theories of\nJohannes Kepler, which in turn were based on the precise observations of Tycho\nBrahe and the studies of terrestrial projectile motion of Galileo. Since these\naspects of physics were developed long before the emergence of quantum physics\nand relativity, some sources exclude Einstein's theory of relativity from this\ncategory. However, a number of modern sources do include relativistic mechanics,\nwhich in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and\nmost accurate form. The notion of \"classical\" may be somewhat\nconfusing, insofar as this term usually refers to the era of classical antiquity\nin European history. While many discoveries within the mathematics of that\nperiod remain in full force today, and of the greatest use, much of the science\nthat emerged then has since been superseded by more accurate models. This in no\nway detracts from the science of that time, though as most of modern physics is\nbuilt directly upon the important developments, especially within technology,\nwhich took place in antiquity and during the Middle Ages in Europe and\nelsewhere. However, the emergence of classical mechanics was a decisive stage in\nthe development of science, in the modern sense of the term. What characterizes\nit, above all, is its insistence on mathematics (rather than speculation), and\nits reliance on experiment (rather than observation). With classical mechanics\nit was established how to formulate quantitative predictions in theory, and how\nto test them by carefully designed measurement. The emerging globally\ncooperative endeavor increasingly provided for much closer scrutiny and testing,\nboth of theory and experiment. This was, and remains, a key factor in\nestablishing certain knowledge, and in bringing it to the service of society.\nHistory shows how closely the health and wealth of a society depends on\nnurturing this investigative and critical approach. \n\nThe initial stage in the development of classical mechanics is often referred to\nas Newtonian mechanics, and is associated with the physical concepts employed by\nand the mathematical methods invented by Newton himself, in parallel with\nLeibniz, and others. This is further described in the following sections. Later,\nmore abstract and general methods were developed, leading to reformulations of\nclassical mechanics known as Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.\nThese advances were largely made in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they extend\nsubstantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of analytical\nmechanics. Ultimately, the mathematics developed for these were central to the\ncreation of quantum mechanics.\n","linknr":743,"url":"Classical_mechanics","recorded":1362477371,"links":111,"instances":["physics","transistor","philosopher","fictitious","special_relativity","device","physics","physics","physics","physics","mechanical","physics_and_chemistry","geometric"],"pdf":["http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Physics/8-01Physics-IFall2003/B4144452-A6DE-464D-A0FA-D4D057AA9222/0/binder1.pdf","http://doc.cern.ch//archive/electronic/other/ext/ext-2004-126.pdf","http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/ugrad/494/bookr03D.pdf"],"categories":["Classical
