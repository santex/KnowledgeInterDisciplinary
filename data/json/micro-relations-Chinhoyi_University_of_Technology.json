The town of Chinhoyi is\nin Mashonaland West about 120 km from Harare towards Lake Kariba and the Zambian\nborder. [http://www.cut.ac.zw/ABOUTCUT/aboutcut.html About us CUT]\n\nThe Chinhoyi University of Technology has grown out of the Chinhoyi Technical\nTeachersâ College that was founded in 1991. The first-degree programmes were\noffered in 1999 under the control of the University of Zimbabwe. Soon\nafterwards, in 2001, the institution gained full university status.\n\nToday, the university provides undergraduate courses in the fields of\nagriculture, engineering, and business sciences. Technical teacher education,\nand creative art and design, are offered through the universityâs single\ninstitute, the Institute of Lifelong Learning. With nearly 3 000 students and an\nacademic staff of 163, the university describes itself as âa small but highly\nselective institutionâ.\n\nA Strategic Management postgraduate masters programme was introduced in 2005,\nand âcontinues to flourishâ, a claim that warrants respect when the records show\nthat 62 masters degrees were conferred in 2008, alongside the nearly 700\nundergraduate degrees. In addition, a new school is being planned, the School of\nHospitality and Tourism, which as part of its academic programme will run a\nhotel existing on the experimental farm as a commercial venture. The university\nis there to serve a great purpose to the whole\nnation.
