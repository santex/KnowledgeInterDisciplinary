Later, rooms were partitioned from it, so that today the hall of\na house is the space inside the front door through which the rooms are\nreached....\n\nThis: Catholic high school]] *Deriving from the above, a hall is often the term\nused to designate a British or Irish country house such as a hall house, or\nspecifically a Wealden hall house, and manor houses. *In later medieval Europe,\nthe main room of a castle or manor house was the great hall. *Where the hall\ninside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a 'passage',\n'corridor', or 'hallway'. *In a medieval building, the hall was where the fire\nwas kept. With time, its functions as dormitory, kitchen, parlour and so on were\ndivided off to separate rooms or, in the case of the kitchen, a separate\nbuilding. *The Hall and parlor house was found in England and was a fundamental,\nhistorical floor plan in parts of the United States from 1620 to\n1860.<ref>Foster, Gerald L.. American houses: a field guide to the architecture\nof the home. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2004. 90. ISBN 0618387994</ref>\n\nOn the same principle: *Many buildings at colleges and universities are formally\ntitled \"_______ Hall\", typically being named after the person who endowed it,\nfor example, King's Hall, Cambridge. Others, such as Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford,\ncommemorate respected people. Between these in age, Nassau Hall at Princeton\nUniversity began as the single building of the then college. In medieval origin,\nthese were the halls in which the members of the university lived together\nduring term time. In many cases, some aspect of this community remains. *At\ncolleges in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Hall is the dining hall\nfor students, with High Table at one end for fellows. Typically, at \"Formal\nHall\", gowns are worn for dinner during the evening, whereas for \"informal Hall\"\nthey are not. *Many Livery Companies (e.g., in the City of London) have a Hall\nor guildhall that is their headquarters and meeting place.\n\nIn general a large and important place such as mentioned above and a\nhall of fame.\n\nSimilarly: *A hall is also a building consisting largely of a principal room,\nthat is rented out for meetings and social affairs. It may be privately or government-\nowned, such as a function hall owned by one company used for weddings and\ncotillions (organized and run by the same company on a contractual basis) or a\ncommunity hall available for rent to anyone. *In religious architecture, as in\nIslamic architecture, the prayer hall is a large room dedicated to the practice\nof the worship.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=S7iJpekO1G8C&pg=PA477&dq=-\nreligious+architecture+prayer+hall&hl=fr&ei=mn5eTbCvIMedOqnd7bUN&sa=X&oi=book_r-\nesult&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=religious%20architecture%2-\n0prayer%20hall&f=false Stanford Anderson and Colin St. John Wilson, The Oxford\ncompanion to architecture, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, page\n477]</ref> (example : the prayer hall of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in\nTunisia). A hall church is a church with nave and side aisles of approximately\nequal height.<ref>Sturgis, Russell. Sturgis' illustrated dictionary of\narchitecture and building: an unabridged reprint of the 1901-2 edition. VOl. II.\nMineola, N.Y.: Dover, 1989. 346-347</ref>\n\nFollowing a line of similar development: *In office buildings and larger\nbuildings (theatres, cinemas etc.), the entrance hall is generally known as the\nfoyer (the French for fireplace). The atrium, a name sometimes used in public\nbuildings for the entrance hall, was the central courtyard of a Roman house.\n\n\n\n<!-- Commented out - needs to be tied into this article if included:\n\n-->\n","title":"hall","headings":["Types","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Tunisia","2: Manor_house","2: Great_hall","1: Jodhpur","1: India","1: Kairouan","1: Building","1: Mississauga","1: Ontario","1: Canada","1: Architecture","1: Iron_Age","1: Mead_hall","1: Catholic_school","1: High_school","1: Country_house","1: Hall_house","1: Wealden_hall_house","1: Medieval","1: Castle","1: Dormitory","1: Kitchen","1: Parlour","1: Hall_and_parlor_house","1: University","1: Financial_endowment","1: King's_Hall,_Cambridge","1: Lady_Margaret_Hall,_Oxford","1: Nassau_Hall","1: Princeton_University","1: College","1: Community","1: University_of_Oxford","1: University_of_Cambridge","1: High_Table","1: Formal_Hall","1: Academic_regalia","1: Livery_Company","1: City_of_London","1: Guildhall","1: Hall_of_fame","1: Mosque_of_Uqba","1: Hall_church","1: Office","1: Theatre","1: Movie_theater","1: Foyer","1: Moot_hall","1: Convention_center","1: City_hall","1: Exhibition_hall","1: Dining_hall","1: Meeting_hall","1: Prayer_hall","1: Sanctuary","1: Library","1: Waiting_room","1: Concourse","1: Great_room","1: Corridor"]}
