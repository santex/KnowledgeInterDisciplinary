Gundry\n - 1996 \"The other is 'deliberate violation of God's known will\"</ref> Sin can\n also be viewed as anything that violates the ideal relationship between an\n individual and God. Sin has been defined as \"to miss the mark\"<ref>Augustine\n eventually (after the Pelagian controversy) defined sin as a hardened heart, a\n loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of\n inordinate self-love (see Augustine On Grace and Free Will in Nicene and Post-\n Nicene Fathers, trans. P.Holmes, vol.5, 30-31 [14-15]).</ref>\n\nSome crimes are regarded as sins and some sins are regarded as greater than\nothers. In this nuanced concept of sin, sins fall in a spectrum from minor\nerrors to deadly misdeeds. Catholicism regards the least corrupt sins as venial\nsins—which are part of human living and carry immediate consequences on earth,\nand, if unrepented for, more painful purgation, assuming the person is destined\nto heaven, as it is written in the formation letter \"Purgatory\", \"most of the\nearly Fathers of the Church speak of a cleansing fire, though we cannot tell\nwhether this means actual or spiritual fire.\"\n<ref>http://www.opusangelorum.org/formation/purgatory.html</ref> Conversely,\nsins of great evil are mortal sins—which bring the consequence of eternal\nmaximal separation from God, the state more so than place, called hell.\n\nSins of careless living are considered destructive and lead to greater sins\naccording to the Seven Deadly Sins. Another concept of sin deals with things\nthat exist on Earth but not in Heaven. Food, for example, while a necessary good\nfor the (health of the ) body, is not of (eternal) transcendental living and\ntherefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin.<ref>Hanegraaff, Hank. \"The\nBible Answer Book\" pg. 18-21. ISBN 0-8499-9544-2</ref>\n\nSin has also been categorized as an inevitable act that was passed down from\ngeneration to generation by the common ancestor, Adam. Like a disease, sin was\nsaid to poison the heart of every human thereafter. A controversial belief is\nthat every man is completely full of sin and can't help to think and act on it,\nbut only disguise it. <!--Removed redundant paragraph, duplicated below-->\n","title":"sin","headings":["History of the term","Religions","See also","Notes and references","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Adam_and_Eve","3: Mortal_sin","3: Heaven","2: Eternity","2: Original_sin","2: Venial_sin","1: Fresco","1: Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil","1: Abrahamic_religions","1: Divine_law","1: Augustine_of_Hippo","1: Pelagianism","1: Crimes","1: Vanity","1: Catholicism","1: Venial_sins","1: Hell","1: Seven_Deadly_Sins","1: Bahá'í_Faith","1: Buddhism","1: Buddhist_ethics","1: Consequentialist","1: Western_Christianity","1: God_in_Christianity","1: Christ","1: Substitutionary_atonement","1: Eastern_Christianity","1: Book_of_Genesis","1: Garden_of_Eden","1: Catholic_Encyclopedia","1: Temporal","1: Eternal_sin","1: Matthew_12","1: Catholic_Church","1: Purgatory","1: Leviticus","1: John_the_Baptist","1: Jordan_River","1: Book_of_Hebrews","1: Book_of_Romans","1: Hinduism","1: Sanskrit","1: Karma","1: Dharma","1: Muslims","1: Allah","1: Islam","1: Qur'an","1: Evil","1: Prophets_of_Islam","1: Absolve","1: Blame","1: Iblis","1: Polytheism","1: Judaism","1: 613_commandments","1: Yetzer_harah","1: Asceticism","1: Fall_of_Man","1: Hamartia","1: Hedonism","1: Internal_sin","1: Morality","1: Religious_law","1: Sin-offering","1: Taboo","1: Total_depravity","1: Actual_sin"]}
