{"cursor":"82939","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Doctor of Philosophy', abbreviated as 'Ph.D.', 'PhD', 'D.Phil.', or 'DPhil' in\nEnglish-speaking countries and originally as 'Dr.Philos.' (for the Latin\nphilosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae), is in many countries a postgraduate\nacademic degree awarded by universities. The academic level known as a Doctorate\nof philosophy varies considerably according to the country, institution, and\ntime period, from entry-level research degrees to higher doctorates. A person\nwho attains a doctorate of philosophy may often be referred to as a doctor.\nDPhil in full academic dress.]]\n\nIn the context of academic degrees, the term \"philosophy\" does not refer\nsolely to the field of philosophy, but is used in a broader sense in\naccordance with its original Greek meaning, which is \"love of wisdom\". In most\nof Europe, all fields other than theology, law and medicine were traditionally\nknown as philosophy, and in Germany the basic faculty of (liberal) arts was\nknown as the faculty of philosophy. The doctorate of philosophy as it exists\ntoday thus originated as a doctorate in the liberal arts at the Humboldt\nUniversity of Berlin, becoming common in large parts of the world in the 20th\ncentury. In many countries, the doctorate of philosophy is still\nawarded only in the liberal arts, which is known as \"philosophy\" in\ncontinental Europe.\n","linknr":940,"url":"Doctor_of_Philosophy","recorded":1362511685,"links":89,"instances":["degree","academic_document","education","danish_and_norwegian_degree","university","doktorah","postgraduate","title","russia","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.gfme.org/global_guide/pdf/13-18%20Argentina.pdf","http://www.gfme.org/global_guide/pdf/13-18%20Argentina.pdf","http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001915/191585e.pdf","http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/24_245.pdf","http://www.hrk-bologna.de/de/download/dateien/HRK_Abkommen_Russland.pdf","http://www.vak.org.ua/docs/diploma/supplement.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/education/external-relation-programmes/doc/doctoral/ukraine_en.pdf","http://www.nbuv.gov.ua/portal/soc_gum/Uks/2012_21/40LuchukO.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/pdf/women_national_report_hungary.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/education/external-relation-programmes/doc/doctoral/russia_en.pdf","http://download.sns.it/SNSguida_eng.pdf","http://www.sns.it/scuola/istituzionale/regolamentointerno/download/statuto_sns.pdf","http://www.sssup.it/UploadDocs/7768_Legge_istitutiva_SSSA.pdf","http://www.istruzione.it/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/8efd760c-b779-4716-9566-2338ddff59e1/07_allegato_4_equipollenze_perfezionamenti_e_dottorati.pdf","http://guidalaureebiennali.miur.it/pdf/2008/05_Universita.pdf","http://www.cfa.au.dk/fileadmin/site_files/filer_forskningsanalyse/dokumenter/Notater/Notat_2006_3.pdf","http://www.upm.es/laupm/organos_gobierno/normativa/NormativaDoctorado0203.pdf","http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/images/pg_grants_fees_200809.pdf","http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/Images/res_grant_linked_studentships_tcm6-12550.pdf","http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/Images/res_grant_linked_studentships_tcm6-12550.pdf"],"categories":["Doctoral
