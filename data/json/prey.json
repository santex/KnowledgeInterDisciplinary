ISBN 0-86542-845-X, ISBN 0-632-03801-2, ISBN 0-632-04393-\n8.</ref> Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but\nthe act of predation often results in the death of its prey and the eventual\nabsorption of the prey's tissue through\nconsumption.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/search?query=predation Encyclopædia\nBritannica: \"predation\"]</ref> Other categories of consumption are herbivory\n(eating parts of plants), mycophagy (eating parts of fungi) and detritivory, the\nconsumption of dead organic material (detritus). All these consumption\ncategories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems.<ref>Getz, W.\n(2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to\nconsumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, .</ref> It can often be difficult\nto separate various types of feeding behaviors.<ref name=\"Ecology\" /> For\nexample, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs\non it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live or on its\ndecaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however\nis the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand,\ndetritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead\nindividuals and have no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s).\n\nSelective pressures imposed on one another often leads to an evolutionary arms\nrace between prey and predator, resulting in various antipredator adaptations.\nWays of classifying predation surveyed here include grouping by trophic level\nor diet, by specialization, and by the nature of the predator's interaction\nwith prey.\n",
