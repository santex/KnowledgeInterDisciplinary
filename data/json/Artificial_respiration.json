Assistance takes many forms,\nbut generally entails providing air for a person who is not breathing or is not\nmaking sufficient respiratory effort on their own (although it must\nbe used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation to achieve the internal respiration).\n\nPulmonary anton ventilation (and hence external parts of respiration) is\nachieved through manual insufflation of the lungs either by the rescuer blowing\ninto the patient's lungs, or by using a mechanical device to do so. This method\nof insufflation has been proved more effective than methods which involve\nmechanical manipulation of the patient's chest or arms, such as the Silvester\nmethod. It is also known as 'Expired Air Resuscitation' (EAR),\n'Expired Air Ventilation' (EAV), 'mouth-to-mouth resuscitation', 'rescue\nbreathing' or colloquially the 'kiss of life'.\n\nArtificial respiration is a part of most protocols for performing\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) making it an essential\nskill for first aid. In some situations, artificial respiration is also\nperformed separately, for instance in near-drowning and opiate overdoses. The\nperformance of artificial respiration in its own is now limited in most\nprotocols to health professionals, whereas lay first aiders are advised to\nundertake full CPR in any case where the patient is not breathing sufficiently.\n\nMechanical ventilation involves the use of a mechanical ventilator to move air\nin and out of the lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on his or her\nown, for example during surgery with general anesthesia or when an individual is\nin a coma.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Artificial_respiration","recorded":1362555671,"links":39,"instances":["physiology","lake","physician"],"pdf":["http://www.ambulance.nsw.gov.au/docs/firstaid/080430cpr.pdf","http://www.health.qld.gov.au/phs/Documents/shpu/12413.pdf"],"categories":["First aid"],"headings":["History","Insufflations","Efficiency of mouth to patient insufflation","Oxygen","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Insulfation2.jpg/220px-Insulfation2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/CPR_mask_2.jpg/220px-CPR_mask_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/CPR-oxygen-defibrillator.jpg/220px-CPR-oxygen-defibrillator.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"],["william_hawes","physician"],["serpentine","lake"],["serpentine","lake"]],"members":["respiration","serpentine","william_hawes"],"related":["Respiration_(physiology)","Breath","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","First_aid","Drowning","Opiate","Health_professional","Mechanical_ventilation","Mechanical_ventilator","Surgery","General_anesthesia","Coma","William_Hawes_(physician)","Artificial_respiration","Thomas_Cogan","Amsterdam","Saint_Paul's_Cathedral","Royal_Humane_Society","Hyde_Park,_London","Serpentine_(lake)","George_III_of_Great_Britain","Serpentine_(lake)","London","Asphyxia","Blast_furnace","Sewer_gas","Airway_management","Maxillofacial","Bag_valve_mask","Autoclave","Tracheal_intubation","Vertebrate_trachea","Nasopharynx","Oropharynx","Cricothyrotomy","Cricothyroid_membrane","Tracheostomy","Cricothyrotomy","Pharynx","Gaseous_exchange","Carbon_dioxide","Hemoglobin","Mechanical_ventilation","Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation","Medical_emergency","Edward_Albert_Sharpey-Schafer"]}
