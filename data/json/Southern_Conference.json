Member institutions are located\nin the states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and\nTennessee. The Southern Conference ranks as the fourth oldest major college\nathletic conference in the United States. Only the Big\nTen (1896), Missouri Valley (1907) and Southwestern Athletic (1920) conferences\nare older.\n\nThe Southern Conference is considered one of the stronger football conferences\nin the Football Championship Subdivision, and is considered a mid-major\nconference in basketball. It has also garnered considerable national attention\nfrom its recent success in these sports: in particular, three-time Division I\nNCAA Football champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, who stunned the fifth-\nranked Michigan Wolverines 34â32 on September 1, 2007; and from the\nDavidson Wildcats, who reached the Elite Eight in the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I\nBasketball Tournament by upsetting power programs Gonzaga (a mid-major school\nwhich became a power program in the 2000s), Georgetown and Wisconsin.\nThe SoCon also frequently sees multiple teams selected to participate in the\nNCAA Division I Baseball Championship.\n","linknr":676,"url":"Southern_Conference","recorded":1362582744,"links":47,"instances":["georgia_southern","wofford_college","elon_university","sport","davidson_college","elon_university","basketball"],"pdf":["http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2011NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValues319.pdf","http://www1.appstate.edu/dept/irp/FB/11-12/SI/S8demographics.pdf","http://www.utc.edu/Administration/PlanningEvaluationAndInstitutionalResearch/documents/FACTSUMMARY2011.xlsx.pdf","http://www.wcu.edu/WebFiles/PDFs/12-month_Enrollment.pdf","http://www3.citadel.edu/instresearch/fall_11_profile.pdf","http://giving.cofc.edu/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_FA4F20A0DBD9DA4D799C68A9AF1BD84EB8030200/filename/11282011FoundationFinalAuditRpt.pdf","http://www3.davidson.edu/cms/documents/OfficesServices/OfficeofthePresident/InstResearch/OFFPR_IR_FF1112_Fall_enrollment.pdf","http://www.siue.edu/factbook/pdf/FbCurrent.pdf"],"categories":["Southern
