{"cursor":"25357","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (1849â1928)]] The 'Rule of Saint Benedict' (Regula Benedicti) is a book of\n precepts written by St. Benedict of Nursia (c.480â547) for monks living\n communally under the authority of an abbot. Since about the 7th century it has\n also been adopted by communities of women. During the 1500 years of its\n existence, it has become the leading guide in Western Christianity for monastic\n living in community.\n\nThe spirit of St. Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the\nBenedictine Confederation: pax (\"peace\") and the traditional [[ora et\nlabora]] (\"pray and work\").\n\nCompared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual\nzeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground it has been\nwidely popular. Benedict's concerns were the needs of monks in a community\nenvironment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the\nrelational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support\nand strengthen the individual's ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is\nrequired for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.\n\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict has been used by Benedictines for fifteen centuries,\nand thus St. Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western\nmonasticism. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to\nfound a [[religious order]] in the modern sense and it was not until the later\nMiddle Ages that mention was made of an \"Order of Saint Benedict\". His Rule is\nwritten as a guide for individual, autonomous communities, and to this day all\nBenedictine Houses (and the Congregations in which they have grouped themselves)\nremain self-governing. Advantages seen in retaining this unique Benedictine\nemphasis on autonomy include cultivating models of tightly bonded communities\nand contemplative lifestyles. Perceived disadvantages comprise geographical\nisolation from important activities in adjacent communities. Other perceived\nlosses include inefficiency and lack of mobility in the service of others, and\ninsufficient appeal to potential members. These different emphases emerged\nwithin the framework of the Rule in the course of history and are to some extent\npresent within the Benedictine Confederation and The Cistercian Orders of the\nCommon and the Ancient Observance.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Rule_of_St._Benedict","recorded":1362670005,"links":35,"instances":["worship","doorkeeper","religion","virtue","religion","christian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Order of Saint Benedict","Benedictine spirituality","Organisation of Catholic religious orders","Asceticism","History of Catholic monasticism","Monastic rules"],"headings":["Origins","Overview of the Rule","Secular significance","Outline of the Benedictine life","Reforms","Popular legend","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Heiligenkreuz.St._Benedict.jpg/250px-Heiligenkreuz.St._Benedict.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/MS._Hatton_48_fol._6v-7r.jpg/220px-MS._Hatton_48_fol._6v-7r.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/St._Benedict_delivering_his_rule_to_the_monks_of_his_order.jpg/220px-St._Benedict_delivering_his_rule_to_the_monks_of_his_order.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/JR_Herbert_Laborare.jpg/220px-JR_Herbert_Laborare.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["divinization","christian"],["dean","religion"],["oratory","worship"],["charity","virtue"],["provost","religion"],["porter","doorkeeper"]],"members":["oratory","porter","provost","charity","dean","divinization"],"related":["Precept","Benedict_of_Nursia","Monk","Abbot","Benedictine_Confederation","Ascetic","Divinization_(Christian)","Benedictine","Western_monasticism","Order_of_Saint_Benedict","Eastern_Roman_Empire","Benedict_of_Nursia","Egypt","Saint_Anthony_the_Great","Ascetic","Saint_Pachomius","Palestine","Judea","Syria","North_Africa","Basil_of_Caesarea","Orthodox_Church","Rome","Subiaco,_Italy","Monte_Cassino","Rule_of_St_Augustine","Saint_John_Cassian","Rule_of_the_Master","Vow_of_obedience","Christ_the_King","Passion_of_Christ","Monk","Cenobite","Anchorite","Hermit","Sarabaites","Gyrovagues","Canonical_hours","Psalm","Divine_grace","Dean_(religion)","Contumacy","Excommunication","Corporal_punishment","Sign_language","Ancient_Roman_units_of_measurement","Compline","Lent","Oratory_(worship)","Hospitality","Novitiate","Charity_(virtue)","Provost_(religion)","Prior","Porter_(doorkeeper)","Charlemagne","Medieval_Europe","Democracy","Manual_labor","John_Rogers_Herbert","Trappist","Mount_St._Bernard_Abbey","Family","Abbot","Abbess","Prayer","Camaldolese","Cistercian","Trappist","Sylvestrines","Legend","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Blackletter","Urban_legend","Rule_of_Saint_Augustine","Rule_of_the_Master","Carmelite_Rule_of_St._Albert","Latin_Rule","Richard_Southern","Henry_Mayr-Harting","Christopher_Derrick"]}
