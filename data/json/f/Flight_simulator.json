This includes the equations that\ngovern how aircraft fly, how they react to applications of their controls and\nother aircraft systems, and how they react to external environmental factors\nsuch as air density, turbulence, cloud, precipitation, etc. Flight simulation is\nused for a variety of reasons, including flight training (mainly of pilots), the\ndesign and development of the aircraft itself, and research into aircraft\ncharacteristics and control handling qualities.\n\nDepending on their purpose, flight simulations employ various types of hardware,\nmodeling detail and realism. They can range from PC laptop-based models of\naircraft systems to simple replica cockpits for familiarisation purposes to more\ncomplex cockpit simulations with some working controls and systems to highly\ndetailed cockpit replications with all controls and aircraft systems and wide-\nfield outside-world visual systems, all mounted on six degrees-of-freedom (DOF)\nmotion platforms which move in response to pilot control movements and external\naerodynamic factors.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Flight_simulator","recorded":1362540588,"links":57,"instances":["engineering","manufacturer"],"pdf":["http://files.asme.org/asmeorg/Communities/History/Landmarks/5585.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/pdf/88787main_Black_Magic.pdf"],"categories":["Flight
