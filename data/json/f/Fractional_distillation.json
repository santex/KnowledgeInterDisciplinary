{"cursor":"15145","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fractional distillation' is the separation of a mixture into its component\nparts, or fractions, such as in separating chemical compounds by their boiling\npoint by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the\ncompound will vaporize. It is a special type of distillation. Generally the\ncomponent parts boil at less than 25 Â°C from each other under a pressure of\none atmosphere (atm). If the difference in boiling points is greater than\n25 Â°C, a simple distillation is used.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Fractional_distillation","recorded":1362481465,"links":44,"instances":["chemistry","heat_transfer","chemistry","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Distillation","Unit operations","Industrial processes"],"headings":["Laboratory setup","Industrial distillation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg/300px-Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Colonne_distillazione.jpg/250px-Colonne_distillazione.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Continuous_Binary_Fractional_Distillation.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Crude_Oil_Distillation.png/225px-Crude_Oil_Distillation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Tray_Distillation_Tower.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Simple_distillation_apparatus.svg/75px-Simple_distillation_apparatus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atmosphere","unit"],["condenser","heat_transfer"],["condenser","heat_transfer"],["volatility","chemistry"],["cracking","chemistry"]],"members":["volatility","condenser","cracking","atmosphere"],"related":["Mixture","Parts","Fractions","Chemical_compound","Boiling_point","Temperature","Distillation","Atmosphere","Atmosphere_(unit)","Boiling_points","Laboratory_glassware","Bunsen_burner","Round-bottomed_flask","Condenser_(heat_transfer)","Fractionating_column","Conical_flask","Fractionating_column","Hot_plate","Round-bottom_flask","Fractionating_column","Thermometer","Condenser_(heat_transfer)","Liebig_condenser","Graham_condenser","Allihn_condenser","Boiling_chip","Laboratory_glassware","Ground_glass_joint","Quickfit_apparatus","Water","Ethanol","Azeotrope","Volatility_(chemistry)","Boiling_chip","Condensation","Theoretical_tray","Reflux","Gas","Thermometer","Silvering","Liebig_condenser","Water_jacket","Graham_condenser","Allihn_condenser","Flasks","Perkin_triangle","Perkin_triangle","Air-sensitive","Vacuum_distillation","Boiling_chip","Oil_refinery","Petrochemical","Chemical_plant","Natural_gas_processing","Air_separation","Continuous_distillation","Steady_state","Boiling_points","Oil_refinery","Crude_oil","Hydrocarbons","Carbon_atom","Molecular_weight","Alkane","Viscosity","Combustion","Reflux","Theoretical_plate","Fractionating_column","Boiling_point","Cracking_(chemistry)","Liquid_oxygen","Liquid_nitrogen","Argon","Chlorosilane","Silicon","Semiconductor","Raschig_ring","Structured_packing","Mass_transfer","Vapor_liquid_equilibrium","Theoretical_plate","McCabe-Thiele_method","Fenske_equation","Simulation","Equilibrium_stage","Relative_volatility","Boiling_point","Azeotropic_distillation","Batch_distillation","Extractive_distillation","Fractionating_column","Freeze_distillation","Raschig_ring","Steam_distillation"]}
