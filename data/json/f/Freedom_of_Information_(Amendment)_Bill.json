{"cursor":"5465","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill' was a private members bill\nintroduced to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 2007 which failed to\nbecome law. Conservative Member of Parliament David Maclean introduced the bill\nto ensure that MPs correspondence is exempt from freedom of information laws\nsuch as the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Maclean said of his Bill:\n\n\n\nAlthough the government claimed it was neutral on the issue, private members\nbills rarely pass without government support, leading to claims the executive\ntacitly supported moves to water down freedom of information legislation.\nMembers of the backbench committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party had emailed\ncolleagues in support of the bill. The email said:\n\n\n\nThe proposed changes complemented Government proposals to change the way freedom\nof information requests are costed. Critics of the changes claimed the intention\nwas to keep embarrassing information secret, rather than to save\nmoney.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6179617.stm]\n\nThe bill was withdrawn after its first reading in the House of Lords. [http://www.epolitix.com/legislation/legislation-details/newsarticle/freedom-\nof-information-amendment-bill-failed-bill-200607-session/] It seemed to have\nfailed for lack of a sponsor in the House of Lords\n[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jun/14/uk.pressandpublishing] and due\nto the action of Jack Straw.\n[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jun/14/freedomofinformation.uk1]\n\nA
