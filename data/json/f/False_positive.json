A 'type II error' (or 'error\nof the second kind') is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. A type I error is a false positive. Usually a type I error\nleads one to conclude that a thing or relationship exists when really it\ndoesn't, for example, that a patient has a disease being tested for when really\nthe patient does not have the disease, or that a medical treatment cures a\ndisease when really it doesn't. A type II error is a false negative. Examples of\ntype II errors would be a blood test failing to detect the disease it was\ndesigned to detect, in a patient who really has the disease; or a clinical trial\nof a medical treatment failing to show that the treatment works when really it\ndoes. When comparing two means, concluding the means were\ndifferent when in reality they were not different would be a Type I error;\nconcluding the means were not different when in reality they were different\nwould be a Type II error.\n\nAll statistical hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II\nerrors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect the\ndisease in some proportion of people who don't have it, and will fail to detect\nthe disease in some proportion of people who do have it. A test's probability of\nmaking a type I error is denoted by Î±. A test's probability of making a type II\nerror is denoted by Î².\n\nThese terms are also used in a more general way by social scientists and others\nto refer to flaws in reasoning.
