{"cursor":"5518","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Flamsteed designations' for stars are similar to Bayer designations, except\nthat they use numbers instead of Greek letters. Each star is assigned a number\nand the Latin genitive of the constellation it lies in (see List of\nconstellations for a list of constellations and the genitive forms of their\nnames). Flamsteed designation contained 2554 stars.\n\nThe numbers were originally assigned in order of increasing right ascension\nwithin each constellation, but due to the effects of precession they are now\nslightly out of order in some places. This method of designating stars first\nappeared in a preliminary version of John Flamsteed's [[Historia Coelestis\nBritannica]] which was published by Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton in 1712\nwithout Flamsteed's approval. {{cite web\n | url = http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/ | title = Naming\n | Astronomical Objects publisher = International Astronomical Union (IAU)\n | accessdate = 2009-01-30 }} {{cite web url =\n | http://seds.org/~spider/spider/Misc/naming.html | title = Naming Stars\n | publisher = Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS)\n | accessdate = 2009-01-30 }} The final version of Flamsteed's catalogue\n | published in 1725 after his death omitted any number designations altogether.\n\nThe designations gained popularity throughout the eighteenth century, and are\nnow commonly used when no Bayer designation exists; however, where a Bayer\ndesignation does exist for a star it is used almost exclusively and the\nFlamsteed designation is almost never used. Examples of well-known stars which\nare usually referred to by their Flamsteed numbers include 51 Pegasi, and 61\nCygni. Flamsteed designations do, however, tend to trump the Bayer designation\nif the latter contains an extra attached number, so \"55 Cancri\" is more common\nthan \"Rho-1 Cancri\".\n\nThere are examples of stars bearing Flamsteed designations for constellations\nin which they do not lie, just as there are for Bayer designations, because of\nthe compromises that had to be made when the modern constellation boundaries\nwere drawn up.\n\nFlamsteed's catalogue covered only the stars visible from Great Britain, and\ntherefore stars of the far southern constellations have no Flamsteed numbers.\nSome stars, such as the nearby star 82 Eridani, were named in a major southern-\nhemisphere catalog called Uranometria Argentina, by Benjamin Gould, and are not\ntrue Flamsteed numbers, and should properly contain a G, as in 82 G. Eridani.\nApart from a handful of cases, these designations are not currently in use.\n\nSome entries in Flamsteed's catalog are errors: for instance, Flamsteed observed\nUranus in 1690 but did not recognize it as a planet and entered it into his\ncatalog as a star called \"34 Tauri\".\n","linknr":187,"url":"Flamsteed_designation","recorded":1374962686,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Star","/wiki/Bayer_designation","/wiki/Genitive","/wiki/Constellation","/wiki/List_of_constellations","/wiki/Right_ascension","/wiki/Precession","/wiki/John_Flamsteed","/w/index.php?title=Historia_Coelestis_Britannica&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Edmond_Halley","/wiki/Isaac_Newton","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/51_Pegasi","/wiki/61_Cygni","/wiki/55_Cancri","/wiki/Great_Britain","/wiki/82_Eridani","/wiki/Benjamin_Gould","/wiki/82_G._Eridani","/wiki/Uranus","/wiki/Planet","#List_of_constellations_utilizing_Flamsteed_star_designations","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Andromeda","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Aquarius","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Aquila","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Aries","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Auriga","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Bo%C3%B6tes","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Camelopardalis","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cancer","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Canes_Venatici","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Canis_Major","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Canis_Minor","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Capricornus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cassiopeia","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cepheus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cetus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Coma_Berenices","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Corona_Borealis","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Corvus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Crater","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Cygnus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Delphinus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Draco","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Equuleus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Eridanus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Gemini","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Hercules","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Hydra","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Lacerta","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Leo","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Leo_Minor","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Lepus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Libra","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Lynx","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Lyra","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Monoceros","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Ophiuchus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Orion","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Pegasus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Perseus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Pisces","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Piscis_Austrinus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Sagitta","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Sagittarius","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Scorpius","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Serpens","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Sextans","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Taurus","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Triangulum","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Ursa_Major","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Ursa_Minor","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Virgo","/wiki/List_of_stars_in_Vulpecula","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Star_designation","/wiki/Category:Flamsteed_objects","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/","/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union","#cite_ref-2","http://seds.org/~spider/spider/Misc/naming.html","/wiki/Students_for_the_Exploration_and_Development_of_Space","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit&section=4","http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/flamsteed.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&oldid=545894298","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Astronomical_catalogues","/wiki/Category:Flamsteed_objects","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flamsteed+designation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flamsteed+designation","/wiki/Flamsteed_designation","/wiki/Talk:Flamsteed_designation","#","/wiki/Flamsteed_designation","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flamsteed_designation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/
