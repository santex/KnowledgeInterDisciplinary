{"cursor":"14517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn relational database theory, a 'functional dependency' is a '[[Relational\ndatabase#Constraints|constraint]]' between two sets of attributes in a relation\nfrom a database.\n\nGiven a relation R, a set of attributes X in R is said to 'functionally\ndetermine' another set of attributes Y, also in R, (written X â Y) if, and only\nif, each X value is associated with precisely one Y value; R is then said to\nsatisfy the functional dependency X â Y. Equivalently, the projection\n\\pi_{X,Y}R is a function, i.e. Y is a function of X. In simple words, if\nthe values for the X attributes are known (say they are x), then the values for\nthe Y attributes corresponding to x can be determined by looking them up in any\ntuple of R containing x. Customarily X is called the determinant set and Y the\ndependent set. A functional dependency FD: X â Y is called trivial if Y is a\nsubset of X.\n\nThe determination of functional dependencies is an important part of designing\ndatabases in the relational model, and in database normalization and\ndenormalization. A simple application of functional dependencies is 'Heathâs\ntheorem'; it says that a relation R over an attribute set U and satisfying a\nfunctional dependency X â Y can be safely split in two relations having the lossless-\njoin decomposition property, namely into \\pi_{XY}(R)\\bowtie\\pi_{XZ}(R) =\nR where Z = U â XY are the rest of the attributes. (Unions of attribute\nsets are customarily denoted by mere juxtapositions in database theory.) An\nimportant notion in this context is a candidate key, defined as a minimal set of\nattributes that functionally determine all of the attributes in a relation. The\nfunctional dependencies, along with the attribute domains, are selected so as to\ngenerate constraints that would exclude as much data inappropriate to the user\ndomain from the system as possible.\n\nA notion of logical implication is defined for functional dependencies in the\nfollowing way: a set of functional dependencies \\Sigma logically\nimplies another set of dependencies \\Gamma , if any relation R\nsatisfying all dependencies from \\Sigma also satisfies all\ndependencies from \\Gamma ; this is usually written \\Sigma\n\\models \\Gamma . The notion of logical implication for functional\ndependencies admits a sound and complete finite axiomatization, known as\n'Armstrong's axioms'.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Functional_dependency","recorded":1362543949,"links":25,"instances":["mathematics","database","relational_algebra","algorithm","logic"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/papers/ttcs87.pdf","http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/fagin/mip86.pdf","http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/fagin/mip86.pdf"],"categories":["Data modeling","Database constraints","Database theory"],"headings":["Examples","Properties  and axiomatization of functional dependencies","Applications to normalization","Irreducible function depending set","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/7/4e7e777c3f4399048dc2b7902e1544ed.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/c/7/9c7a6f1971a6c4544c46161f156f91df.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/6/4/a643a0ef5974b64678111d03125054fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/2/162d4c413f99ae2763b1ced17ed1a14b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/6/4/a643a0ef5974b64678111d03125054fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/6/2/162d4c413f99ae2763b1ced17ed1a14b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/2/8c21300e377dadde113f51ac10b9e99b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/e/0deb786e601727bdfd46b778baa70056.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/5/6f5ddd5a42c9b52d0af4e7e19d3e3b58.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/0/880042835781eb5ce26234dad0331417.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/9/f/49f0e9523e6d03f6d4b1b81e28525a85.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/a/32a4641ecdece7095c61eec7a48ad494.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/9/9d9e5df757c436fecfd5c79dea0b235a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/2/c6202fca8f019797eab79524b6a2c911.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/8/43853f8e9dd50b6ee9845e103aee1cf8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/8/43853f8e9dd50b6ee9845e103aee1cf8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/2/c6202fca8f019797eab79524b6a2c911.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["relation","database"],["projection","relational_algebra"],["function","mathematics"],["schema","logic"],["chase","algorithm"]],"members":["function","relation","projection","chase","schema"],"related":["Relational_database","Relation_(database)","Projection_(relational_algebra)","Function_(mathematics)","Subset","Relational_model","Database_normalization","Denormalization","Lossless-join_decomposition","Set_union","Candidate_key","Attribute_domain","User_domain","Logical_implication","Soundness","Completeness","Axiomatization","Vehicle_identification_number","Candidate_key","Transitive_relation","Superkey","Armstrong's_axioms","Axiom","Inference_rules","Soundness","Completeness","Schema_(logic)","Logical_equivalence","Iff","Canonical_cover","Lossless-join_decomposition","Lookup_table","OLTP","OLAP","Foreign_key","Inclusion_dependency","Database_schema","Classification_of_dependencies","Equality-generating_dependencies","Tuple-generating_dependencies","Database_normalization","Third_normal_form","Chase_(algorithm)","Inclusion_dependency","Join_dependency","Multivalued_dependency","Database_normalization","First_normal_form","University_of_Maryland_Baltimore_County","PostScript","Simon_Fraser_University"]}
