{"cursor":"13112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn oceanic biogeochemistry, the 'f-ratio' is the fraction of total primary\nproduction fuelled by nitrate (as opposed to that fuelled by other nitrogen\ncompounds such as ammonium). This fraction is significant because it is assumed\nto be directly related to the sinking (export) flux of organic marine snow from\nthe surface ocean by the biological pump. The ratio was originally defined by\nRichard Eppley and Bruce Peterson in one of the first papers estimating global\noceanic production.\n","linknr":652,"url":"F-ratio","recorded":1362482281,"links":24,"instances":["mathematics","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf","http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_12/issue_2/0196.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Biological oceanography","Chemical oceanography","Geochemistry","Nitrogen","Oceanography","Systems ecology","Biogeochemistry"],"headings":["Overview","\"New\" and \"regenerated\" production","Assumptions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/F_ratio_diagram.gif/256px-F_ratio_diagram.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/F_ratio_diagram_2.gif/256px-F_ratio_diagram_2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["proxy","statistics"],["function","mathematics"]],"members":["function","proxy"],"related":["Ocean","Biogeochemistry","Primary_production","Nitrate","Nitrogen","Chemical_compound","Ammonium","Export_production","Organic_compound","Marine_snow","Photic_zone","Biological_pump","Gravity","Organism","Carbon","Aphotic_zone","Earth","Carbon_cycle","Solubility_pump","Sediment_trap","Water_column","Proxy_(statistics)","Nitrite","Urea","Autotroph","Phytoplankton","Amino_acid","Protein","Grazing","Plankton","Food_chain","Metabolism","Oxidation","Nitrification","Bacteria","Light","Function_(mathematics)","Primary_production","Aphotic_zone","Turbulence","Upwelling","Dynamic_equilibrium","Eukaryotic","Diatom","Oligotroph","Prokaryotic","Short_circuit","Ecosystem_model","Oligotroph","Subtropical_gyre","Bermuda_Atlantic_Time-series_Study","Biological_pump","Nitrification","Primary_production"]}
