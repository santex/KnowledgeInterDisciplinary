{"cursor":"9794","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Free Application for Federal Student Aid' (known as the 'FAFSA') is a form\nthat can be prepared annually by current and prospective college students\n(undergraduate and graduate) in the United States to determine their eligibility\nfor student financial aid (including the Pell Grant, Federal student loans and\nFederal Work-Study). [http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ FAFSA â Free Application for\nFederal Student Aid]\n\nDespite its name, the application is not for a single federal program, being\nrather the gateway of consideration for: #the nine federal student-aid programs #the 605 state aid programs\n#most of the institutional aid available The U.S. Department of Education begins\naccepting the application beginning January 1 of each year for the upcoming\nacademic year. Each application period is 18 months; most federal, state, and\ninstitutional aid is provided on a first come, first served basis. There are six\n(6) states â Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and\nVermont that award state grants on a first-come, first-served basis until the\nmoney runs out. [http://aboutfafsa.com/fafsa-deadline/ About FAFSA]\nStudents are advised to submit a FAFSA as early as possible for consideration\nfor maximum financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Education advises students to utilize the IRS Data Retrieval\nTool (DRT), which is made available on the FAFSA. This tool will retrieve most\nof the student's tax information, excluding wages, directly from the IRS and\nautomatically input the information on his or her application. The DRT may be\nused for both students and parents alike.\n\nApplicants who have completed a FAFSA in previous years may submit a renewal\nFAFSA. Any information that has changed must be updated annually. The FAFSA\nconsists of numerous questions (at least 130 for the 2010â2011 academic year)\nregarding a student's (and his or her family's) assets, income, and dependency.\nThese are entered into a formula that determines the Expected Family\nContribution (EFC). A number of factors are used in determining the EFC\nincluding the household size, income, number of students from household in\ncollege and assets (not including retirement and 401(k) funds). This information\nis required because of the expectation that parents will contribute to their\nchild's education, whether that is true or not.\n\nThe FAFSA does not have questions related to student or family race, ethnicity,\nsexual orientation, disability, or religion.\n\nA Student Aid Report (SAR), which is a summary of the FAFSA responses, is\nforwarded to the student. The student should review the SAR carefully for errors\nand make any corrections. An electronic version of the SAR (called an ISIR) is\nmade available to the colleges/universities the student selects on the FAFSA.\nThe ISIR is also sent to state agencies that award need-based aid.\n\nSome colleges also require the CSS Profile to be filled out as early as the same\ndeadline as an early admissions or early decision application deadline. The CSS\nis a fee-based product of the College Board and usually concerns funds disbursed\nby a college rather than federal funds.\n","linknr":155,"url":"FAFSA","recorded":1374860303,"links":["/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education","/wiki/Cost_of_attendance","/wiki/Federal_Direct_Student_Loan_Program","/wiki/Federal_Family_Education_Loan_Program","/wiki/Federal_Perkins_Loan","/wiki/Stafford_Loan","/wiki/PLUS_Loan","/wiki/Federal_student_loan_consolidation","/wiki/Private_student_loan_(United_States)","/wiki/College","/wiki/Undergraduate","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Student_financial_aid","/wiki/Pell_Grant","/wiki/Federal_Direct_Student_Loan_Program","/wiki/Federal_Work-Study_Program","#cite_note-1","/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Education","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Expected_Family_Contribution","/wiki/401(k)","/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","/wiki/Ethnicity","/wiki/Religion","/wiki/CSS_Profile","/wiki/College_Board","#Eligibility","#Types_of_financial_aid","#Filing_options","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Stafford_Loan","/wiki/Selective_Service_System","/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Student_Aid_and_Fiscal_Responsibility_Act","/wiki/Post-9/11_Veterans_Educational_Assistance_Act_of_2008","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Federal_Student_Aid","/wiki/Pell_Grant","/wiki/Stafford_Loan","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Federal_Perkins_Loan","/wiki/Title_IV","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Federal_Work-Study_Program","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=3","http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/%7Cwww.fafsa.gov","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Guidance_counselor","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Transfer_admissions_in_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/","#cite_ref-2","http://aboutfafsa.com/fafsa-deadline/","#cite_ref-3","http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1314/help/registerForSelectiveService.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm","/wiki/Micronesia","/wiki/Marshall_Islands","/wiki/Palau","#cite_ref-5","http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized","#cite_ref-6","http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/interest-rates","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","http://www.fastweb.com/financial-aid/articles/3179-are-there-any-fees-for-filing-the-fafsa","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit&section=6","http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/","http://www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov/","http://ifap.ed.gov/efcformulaguide/attachments/111609EFCFormulaGuide20102011.pdf","http://studentaid.ed.gov/students/attachments/siteresources/Funding_Education_Beyond_HS_2011-12.pdf","/wiki/PDF","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&oldid=563824523","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Student_financial_aid","/wiki/Category:Education_finance_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:University_and_college_admissions","/wiki/Category:United_States_government_forms","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FAFSA&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FAFSA","/wiki/FAFSA","/wiki/Talk:FAFSA","#","/wiki/FAFSA","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/FAFSA","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/FAFSA","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&oldid=563824523","/w/index.php?title=FAFSA&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5424324","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=FAFSA&
