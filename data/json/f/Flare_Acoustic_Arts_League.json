Flare (band) â were an experimental pop\nband http://books.google.com/books?id=s2QEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=flar-\ne+beghtol&source=bl&ots=ZMzf4wAada&sig=LCSTh1DQzhAiGa6YMo5SiNOYYM0&hl=en&ei=Lbb-\nLTPSOAsH7lwfit_iWBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CEgQ6AEw-\nCQ#v=onepage&q=flare%20beghtol&f=false formed by guitarist Damian Costilla\nand singer LD Beghtol in New York in 1996 who made intense, darkly romantic,\natmospheric songs deeply influenced by their love of The Smiths, The Magnetic\nFields (with whom beghtol sometimes collaborated), Love, various 4AD bands and\nThe Velvet Underground. Flare soon became a small chamber ensemble, augmenting\nCostilla's guitar work with other intrumentalists for recording/live shows.\nCostilla left Flare shortly after the release of their debut CD, Bottom (Tamper\nEvident, 1997). Beghtol continued to record and perform under the Flare moniker\nuntil 2001, when he renamed the band Flare Acoustic Arts League.\n\nBeghtol http://www.erasingclouds.com/wk1906ld.html then became Flare's\nprincipal songwriter/musical director, and expanded its dreamy minimalism to\nvastly orchestral arrangements that pitted horns and strings, heavily treated\nguitars and noise loops against florid melodies and esoteric subject matter. http://fluxionesque.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-\nflare.html The band's swansong, an ersatz \"double EP\" entitled Big\nTop/Encore, which included originals and covers of the swirling Psychedelic Furs\nsong \"Yes I Do\" and \"Morgantown\" by the enigmatic Brooklynite Dorsey among its\n10 tracks, was released by Affairs of the Heart in August 2011 in various\ndigital and vinyl formats. Flare formally ceased trading in 2012 after the\nbandâs firstâand onlyâtour of Germany and Austria.\n\n File:Newflare.jpg|LD & Damian, circa 1997 \n","linknr":116,"url":"Flare_Acoustic_Arts_League","recorded":1362674455,"links":13,"instances":["company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical groups established in 1996","American pop music groups"],"headings":["Selected discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Flareinvite.jpg/220px-Flareinvite.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Newflare.jpg/120px-Newflare.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["affairs_of_the_heart","company"]],"members":["affairs_of_the_heart"],"related":["Bushwick","Orchpop","Chamber_Punk","Experimental_Pop","Psychedelic","Tamper_Evident","Mother_West","Le_Grand_Magistery","Affairs_of_the_Heart_(company)","Moth_wranglers","The_Magnetic_Fields","LD_&_the_New_Criticism","LD_Beghtol","Damian_Costilla","LD_Beghtol","The_Smiths","The_Magnetic_Fields","Love","4AD","The_Velvet_Underground","Psychedelic_Furs","Dorsey"]}
