{"cursor":"24311","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The use of 'wine tasting descriptors' allows the taster to qualitatively relate\nthe aromas and flavors that they experience and can be used in assessing the\noverall quality of wine. Wine writers, like Karen MacNeil author of The Wine\nBible, differentiate wine tasters from casual enthusiasts; tasters attempt to\ngive an objective description of the wine's taste (often taking a systematic\napproach to tasting), casual enthusiasts appreciate wine but pause their\nexamination sooner than tasters. The primary source of a person's ability to\ntaste wine is derived from their olfactory senses. A taster's own personal\nexperiences play a significant role in conceptualizing what they are tasting and\nattaching a description to that perception. The individual nature of tasting\nmeans that descriptors may be perceived differently among various tasters. K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 98–110 Workman\nPublishing 2001 ISBN 1-56305-434-5\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of wine tasting descriptors and a common\nmeaning of the terms. These terms and usage are from Karen MacNeil's 2001\nedition of The Wine Bible unless otherwise noted.\n","linknr":527,"url":"Fresh_(wine)","recorded":1362675677,"links":10,"instances":["wine","wine","wine","grape","optics","wine","wine","wine","wine","genus","wine","wine","wine","food","wine","wine","wine","wine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Wine tasting","Wine-related lists"],"headings":["A&ndash;C","D&ndash;H","I&ndash;P","R&ndash;Z","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tannins","wine"],["extract","wine"],["tannins","wine"],["champagne","wine"],["aged","wine"],["fermentation","wine"],["faults","wine"],["acidity","wine"],["young_age","wine"],["extract","wine"],["body","wine"],["unripe_fruit","wine"],["opacity","optics"],["muscat","grape"],["oak","wine"],["faulty","wine"],["nut","food"],["piper","genus"],["oak","wine"],["phenolic_compounds","wine"],["tannins","wine"],["age","wine"]],"members":["young_age","aged","age","muscat","opacity","body","champagne","phenolic_compounds","unripe_fruit","piper","tannins","faults","faulty","nut","extract","oak","acidity","fermentation"],"related":["Aroma_of_wine","Flavor","Wine","Karen_MacNeil","Wine_tasting","Olfactory","Tannins_(wine)","Acidity","Extract_(wine)","Palate","Aged_wines","Tannins_(wine)","Acacia","Acid","Sweetness_in_wine","Alcohol","Champagne_(wine)","Malolactic_fermentation","Butter","Black_currant","Aged_(wine)","Gouda","Butyric_acid","Fermentation_(wine)","Ester","Ethyl_butyrate","Chocolate","Cabernet_Sauvignon","Pinot_noir","Tobacco","Citrus","Typicity","Faults_(wine)","Cloves","Eugenol","Acidity_(wine)","Coconut","Cork_taint","Mousse","Potassium_bitartrate","Wine_bottle","Soil","Forest","Mushrooms","Geosmin","Skin_contact","Young_age_(wine)","Chardonnay","Pinot_noir","Viscosity","Swallowing","Sparkling_wine","Extract_(wine)","Varietal","Body_(wine)","Grape","Fruit_preserves","Muscat_family","Lawn","Lemon_grass","Unripe_fruit_(wine)","Varietal","Opacity_(optics)","Glycerol","Lemon","Ultraviolet","Peach","Muscat_(grape)","Riesling","Linalool","Monbazillac_AOC","Botrytized","Carbonation","Chew","Mineral","Slate","Schist","Silex","Musk","Muscat_grape","Aroma","Oak_(wine)","Vanilla","Spices","Nutmeg","Cream","Aging_wine","Oxidation","Faulty_(wine)","Sherry","Nut_(food)","Biscuit","Butter","Spice","Mouthfeel","Taste","Piper_(genus)","Black_peppercorn","Syrah","Grenache","White_pepper","Gruner_Veltliner","Petrol","Kerosene","Mineral_oil","Riesling","Plum","Carbonic_gas","Sparkling_wine","Vinho_Verde","Rosé","Sherry","Oxidized","Acetaldehyde","Smoke","Tobacco","Oak_(wine)","Spices","Black_pepper","Cinnamon","Phenolic_compounds_(wine)","Tannins_(wine)","Tar","Mouthfeel","Palate","Age_(wine)","Typicity","Varietal","Aging_barrel","Vanilla","Vegetation","Fruit","Floral","Bread_dough","Biscuit","Vintage","Citrus","Aroma_wheel","Aroma_of_wine"]}
