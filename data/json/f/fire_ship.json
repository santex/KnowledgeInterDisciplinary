Painting by Willem van de Velde the\nYounger]]\n\nA 'fire ship', used in the days of wooden rowed or sailing ships, was a ship\nfilled with combustibles, deliberately set on fire and steered (or, where\npossible, allowed to drift) into an enemy fleet, in order to destroy ships, or\nto create panic and make the enemy break formation.<ref>[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/Theses/pdf-files/Coggeshall-\nMA1997.pdf The Fireship and its Role in the Royal Navy] by James Coggeshall.\nMaster's Thesis, Texas A&M University, 1997</ref> Ships used as fire ships were\nusually old and worn out or purpose-built inexpensive vessels. An explosion ship\nor [[Hellburners|hellburner]] was a variation on the fire ship, intended to\ncause damage by blowing up in proximity to enemy ships. Fireships were famously\nused to great effect by the English against the Spanish Armada during the Battle\nof Gravelines.<ref>[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/Theses/pdf-files/Coggeshall-\nMA1997.pdf The Fireship and its Role in the Royal Navy] by James Coggeshall.\nMaster's Thesis, Texas A&M University, 1997, pp. 7-11</ref>\n",
