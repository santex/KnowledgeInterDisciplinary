Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and\nbrings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground.\nFunk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing\nit from R&B and soul songs, which are centered on chord progressions.\n\nLike much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove\nwith rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ,\nand drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section\nof several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays\nrhythmic \"hits\".\n\nMany of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul\nextensively. Funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip\nhop, house music, and drum and bass. It is also the main influence of go-go, a\nsubgenre associated with funk.\n","linknr":861,"url":"Funk_Music","recorded":1362560468,"links":84,"instances":["music","band","band","i_feel_like_being_a_sex_machine","music","guitar","music","rhythm","genre","australian_band","band","musician","song","band","rhythm","jennifer_lopez_song","funk_musician","popular_music","music","band","singer","musician","music","band","song","beyoncé_knowles_song","band","album","music","musician","band","song","band","band","song","music","falettinme_be_mice_elf_agin","band","jazz_performance_style","musician","album","band","musician","writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Funk|","African-American
