He was the son of Lutheran\ntheologian Franz Boll (1805â1875).\n\nBoll studied medicine in Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin, and in 1870 worked at\nthe physiological institute of Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818â1896) in Berlin.\nLater he became a professor at the University of Genoa, and from 1873 to 1879\nwas a professor of physiology in Rome. He died in Rome on 19 December 1879 at\nthe age of 30.\n\nFranz Christian Boll is remembered for the discovery of rhodopsin, when he\nnoticed that the light-sensitive pigment in the rods of the retina had a\ntendency to fade in the presence of illumination. He published his findings in\nan article titled Sull'anatomia e fistologia della retina. On 12 November 1876,\nhe reported his discovery to the Berlin Academy.\n\nHis name is associated with the eponymous \"Boll cells\", being described as basal\ncells located in the lacrimal gland. As a student of Max Schultze (1825â1874) at\nBonn, he was the author of a significant histological treatise on dental pulp\ncalled Untersuchungen Ã¼ber die Zahnpulpa.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Franz_Christian_Boll","recorded":1362567721,"links":20,"instances":["historian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1849 births","1879 deaths","People from Neubrandenburg","German physiologists","German histologists","People from Mecklenburg-Strelitz","University of Genoa faculty"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Franz_Christian_Boll.JPG/220px-Franz_Christian_Boll.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/30px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Esclapius_stick.svg/8px-Esclapius_stick.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["franz_boll","historian"]],"members":["franz_boll"],"related":["Neubrandenburg","Physiologist","Histologist","Lutheran","Theologian","Franz_Boll_(historian)","Bonn","Heidelberg","Berlin","Emil_du_Bois-Reymond","University_of_Genoa","Rome","Rhodopsin","Pigment","Rod_cell","Retina","Basal_cell","Lacrimal_gland","Max_Schultze","Dental_pulp"]}
