{"cursor":"18318","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nNuclear fission splits a heavy nucleus such as uranium or plutonium into two\nlighter nuclei, which are called fission products. 'Yield' refers to the\nfraction of a fission product produced per fission.\n\nYield can be broken down by: #Individual isotope #Chemical element spanning\nseveral isotopes of different mass number but same atomic number. #Nuclei of a\ngiven mass number regardless of atomic number. Known as \"chain yield\" because it\nrepresents a decay chain of beta decay.\n\nIsotope and element yields will change as the fission products undergo beta\ndecay, while chain yields do not change after completion of neutron emission by\na few neutron-rich initial fission products (delayed neutrons), with halflife\nmeasured in seconds.\n\nA few isotopes can be produced directly by fission, but not by beta decay\nbecause the would-be precursor with atomic number one greater is stable and does\nnot decay. Chain yields do not account for these \"shadowed\" isotopes; however,\nthey have very low yields (less than a millionth as much as common fission\nproducts) because they are far less neutron-rich than the original heavy nuclei.\n\nYield is usually stated as percentage per fission, so that the total yield\npercentages sum to 200%. Less often, it is stated as percentage of all fission\nproducts, so that the percentages sum to 100%. Ternary fission, about 0.2% to\n0.4% of fissions, also produces a third light nucleus such as helium-4 (90%) or\ntritium (7%).\n","linknr":376,"url":"Fission_product_yield","recorded":1362669632,"links":16,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear chemistry"],"headings":["Mass vs. yield curve","Ordered by yield (thermal neutron fission of U-235)","Ordered by mass number","Ordered by halflife","Ordered by thermal neutron neutron absorption cross section","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Fission_yield_volatile.png/450px-Fission_yield_volatile.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/ThermalFissionYield.svg/450px-ThermalFissionYield.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Fission_yield.png/450px-Fission_yield.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Ndslivechart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Nuclear_fission","Uranium","Plutonium","Fission_products","Isotope","Chemical_element","Mass_number","Atomic_number","Mass_number","Atomic_number","Decay_chain","Beta_decay","Neutron_emission","Delayed_neutron","Halflife","Percentage","Ternary_fission","Helium-4","Tritium","Nuclear_fission","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Kr-85","Rubidium","Sr-90","Zirconium","Ru-106","Palladium","Sb-125","Tellurium","Cs-137","Barium","Ce-144","Neodymium","Sm-151","Europium","Eu-155","Gadolinium","Mass","Mole_(unit)","Fission_products","Atomic_number","Zirconium","Palladium","Xenon","Neodymium","Uranium","Proton","Neutron","Neutron_energy","Fissile","Pu-239","Uranium-235","Thermal_neutron","Actinides","Radioactive","Halflife","Iodine-131","Fission_product","Neutron_poison","Thermal_neutron","Uranium-235","Nuclear_power","Xenon-135","Promethium-147","Samarium-149","Samarium-151","Europium-155","Plutonium","Pu-238","Pu-239","Pu-240","Pu-241","Pu-242","Minor_actinides","Np-237","Am-241","Americium","Curium","Californium","Reprocessed_uranium","Uranium-236","Tritium","Activation_products","Caesium-133","Neutron_capture","Caesium-134","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Cs-135","Iodine-135","Beta_decay","Xenon-135","Neutron_poison","Neutron_capture","Cs-135","Zr-93","Mo-99","Tc-99m","Cs-137","Tc-99","Nuclear_transmutation","Strontium-90","Iodine-131","Promethium-147","Samarium-149","Neutron_poison","Iodine-129","Nuclear_transmutation","Samarium-151","Neutron_poison","Ruthenium-106","Krypton-85","Palladium-107","Selenium-79","Europium-155","Beta_decay","Gadolinium-155","Neutron_poison","Antimony-125","Tin-126","Gadolinium-157","Neutron_poison","Cadmium-113m","Neutron_poison","Pu-239","Uranium-235","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Kr-85","Rubidium","Sr-90","Zirconium","Ru-106","Palladium","Sb-125","Tellurium","Cs-137","Barium","Ce-144","Neodymium","Sm-151","Europium","Eu-155","Gadolinium","Selenium-79","Krypton-85","Strontium-90","Zirconium-93","Technetium-99","Ruthenium-106","Palladium-107","Cadmium-113m","Antimony-125","Tin-126","Iodine-129","Iodine-131","Caesium-133","Neutron_capture","Caesium-134","Iodine-135","Beta_decay","Xenon-135","Beta_decay","Caesium-135","Caesium-137","Promethium-147","Samarium-149","Samarium-151","Europium-155","Beta_decay","Gadolinium-155","Gadolinium-157","Iodine-131","Spent_nuclear_fuel","Ruthenium-106","Cesium-133","Neutron_capture","Cesium-134","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Promethium-147","Antimony-125","Europium-155","Beta_decay","Gadolinium-155","Neutron_poison","Neutron_capture","Krypton-85","Nuclear_reprocessing","Cadmium-113m","Neutron_capture","Strontium-90","Cs-137","Samarium-151","Neutron_capture","Tc-99","Nuclear_transmutation","Tin-126","Selenium-79","Zr-93","Cs-135","Palladium-107","Iodine-129","Nuclear_transmutation","Samarium-149","Neutron_poison","Gadolinium-157","Neutron_poison","Iodine-135","Beta_decay","Xenon-135","Neutron_poison","Neutron_capture","Cs-135","Gadolinium-157","Neutron_poison","Samarium-149","Neutron_poison","Cadmium-113m","Samarium-151","Europium-155","Beta_decay","Gadolinium-155","Neutron_poison","Promethium-147","Iodine-131","Caesium-133","Neutron_capture","Caesium-134","Neutron_capture","Beta_decay","Tc-99","Nuclear_transmutation","Iodine-129","Nuclear_transmutation","Zr-93","Palladium-107","Krypton-85","Strontium-90","Ruthenium-106","Cs-137","Antimony-125","Tin-126","Selenium-79"]}
