{"cursor":"40922","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn finance, a 'futures contract' (more colloquially, 'futures') is a\nstandardized contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified asset of\nstandardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today (the futures\nprice or strike price) with delivery and payment occurring at a specified\nfuture date, the delivery date. The contracts are negotiated at a futures\nexchange, which acts as an intermediary between the two parties. The party\nagreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future, the \"buyer\" of the\ncontract, is said to be \"long\", and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the\nfuture, the \"seller\" of the contract, is said to be \"short\". The terminology\nreflects the expectations of the partiesâthe buyer hopes or expects that the\nasset price is going to increase, while the seller hopes or expects that it\nwill decrease in near future.\n\nIn many cases, the underlying asset to a futures contract may not be traditional\ncommodities at all â that is, for financial futures the underlying item can be\nany financial instrument (also including currency, bonds, and stocks); they can\nbe also based on intangible assets or referenced items, such as stock indexes\nand interest rates.\n\nWhile the futures contract specifies a trade taking place in the future, the\npurpose of the futures exchange institution is to act as intermediary and\nminimize the risk of default by either party. Thus the exchange requires both\nparties to put up an initial amount of cash, the margin. Additionally, since the\nfutures price will generally change daily, the difference in the prior agreed-\nupon price and the daily futures price is settled daily also (variation margin).\nThe exchange will draw money out of one party's margin account and put it into\nthe other's so that each party has the appropriate daily loss or profit. If the\nmargin account goes below a certain value, then a margin call is made and the\naccount owner must replenish the margin account. This process is known as\nmarking to market. Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the\nspecified price on the contract but the spot value (since any gain or loss has\nalready been previously settled by marking to market).\n\nA closely related contract is a forward contract. A forward is like a futures in\nthat it specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified\nfuture date. However, a forward is not traded on an exchange and thus does not\nhave the interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract\nstandardized, as on the exchange.\n\nUnlike an option, both parties of a futures contract must fulfill the contract\non the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying asset to the buyer, or,\nif it is a cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the\nfutures trader who sustained a loss to the one who made a profit. To exit the\ncommitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can\nclose out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another\nfutures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in\nfutures prices is then a profit or loss.\n","linknr":571,"url":"Futures_contract","recorded":1362564795,"links":60,"instances":["finance","finance","finance","probability_theory","finance","finance","finance","finance","penalty","finance","finance","finance","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.nfa.futures.org/nfa-investor-information/publication-library/opportunity-and-risk-entire.pdf","http://www.cmegroup.com/resources-for/files/G66_Options_on_Fut2001.pdf","http://www.cmegroup.com/resources-for/files/G66_Options_on_Fut2001.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
