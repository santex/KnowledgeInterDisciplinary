Launched\non May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on\nFacebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.\n\nThird party companies provide application metrics, and several blogs have sprung\nup in response to the clamor for Facebook applications. On July 4, 2007, Altura\nVentures announced the \"Altura 1 Facebook Investment Fund,\" becoming the world's\nfirst Facebook-only venture capital firm.\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of\napplications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications,\nfollowing criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who\nhad installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly viral, yet\nuseless applications. Tech blog Valleywag has\ncriticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \"cornucopia of\nuselessness.\" {{cite web\n  | title = Can a Facebook app possibly be useful? publisher = Valleywag.com\n  | date = 2005-09-26 url = http://valleywag.com/tech/facebook/can-a-facebook-app-possibly-be-useful-\n  | 303819.php accessdate = 2007-10-16 }} Others have called for limiting\n  | third-party applications so the Facebook user experience is not\n  | degraded.\n\nPrimarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly\nbeen employed by numerous Facebook application developers. Stanford University\neven offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W:\n\"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\".\nNumerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked\namongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million\nusers in a month.\n","linknr":358,"url":"Facebook_Platform","recorded":1362579011,"links":14,"instances":["electronic","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Facebook","2007 introductions","Federated identity"],"headings":["History","High-level Platform components","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["(lil_green_patch"],["spam","electronic"],["server","computing"]],"members":["spam","server"],"related":["Software","Social_networking_service","Facebook","Third-party_software_component","Application_software","API","Facebook","Blog","Valleywag","User_experience","Stanford_University","Software_framework","Software_developer","Application_software","Facebook_features","Markup_language","Social_Network_Games","(Lil)_Green_Patch","Chess","Facebook_f8","Spam_(electronic)","Xbox_360","Nintendo_DSi","Like_Button","Social_graph","Software_developer","Application_software","Specification","Server_(computing)","Application_programming_interface","HCalendar","HCard","Mobile_website","WURFL","Facebook_statistics","Facebook_features"]}
