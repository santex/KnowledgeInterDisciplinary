{"cursor":"3723","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn England and Wales, a 'foundation school' is a state-funded school in which\nthe governing body has greater freedom in the running of the school than in\ncommunity schools. Foundation schools were set up under the School Standards and\nFramework Act 1998 to replace grant-maintained schools, which were funded\ndirectly by central government. Grant-maintained schools that had previously\nbeen voluntary controlled or county schools (but not voluntary aided) usually\nbecame foundation schools.\n\nFoundation schools are a kind of \"maintained school\", meaning that they are\nfunded by central government via the Local Education Authority, and do not\ncharge fees to students. As with voluntary controlled schools, all capital and\nrunning costs are met by the government. As with voluntary aided schools, the\ngoverning body employs the staff and has responsibility for admissions to the\nschool, subject to rules imposed by central government. Pupils follow the\nNational Curriculum. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.governornet.co.uk/cropArticle.cfm?topicAreaId=1&contentId=548\n| title = Categories of Schools - Overview publisher = Department for Children,\n| Schools and Families work = Governornet date = 2003-09-05\n}} {{cite web\n| title = The Composition of Schools in England publisher = Department for\n| Children, Schools and Families month = June | year = 2008 url = http://www.dc-\n| sf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SBU/b000796/TheCompositionOfSchoolsInEnglandFinal.pdf\n}} [http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/n6w/index/family_parent/education/t-\nypes_of_school.htm Types of School], Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nSome foundation schools, also called 'trust schools', have a foundation or\ntrust that owns the land and buildings. Otherwise the land and buildings are\nowned by the governing body. The foundation usually appoints about a quarter\nof the school governors, as in voluntary controlled schools, but in some cases\nit appoints the majority of governors, as in voluntary aided\nschools. {{cite web\n| title = Trust School Proposals publisher = Department for Children, Schools\n| and Families date = 18 July 2008 url = http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/schoolorg/data/-\n| guidance_Documents/Trust%20School%20Proposals%202008-07-18.doc\n}}\n\nWithin the maintained sector in England, approximately 2% of primary schools and\n15% of secondary schools are foundation schools. Almost all of these are non-\nfaith schools. {{cite web\n| title = Pupil Characteristics and Class Sizes in Maintained Schools in\n| England: January 2008 (Provisional) publisher = Department for

have foundation status. {{cite news\n| title = High school bids for independence work = BBC News | date = 7 August\n| 2009 url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/8189532.stm\n|
