      "text" : "A 'fomite' is any object or substance capable of carrying infectious organisms,\nsuch as germs or parasites, and hence transferring them from one individual to\nanother. Skin cells, hair, clothing, and bedding are common hospital sources of\ncontamination.\n\nFomites are associated particularly with hospital acquired infections (HAI), as\nthey are possible routes to pass pathogens between patients. Stethoscopes and\nneckties are two such fomites associated with health care providers. Basic\nhospital equipment, such as IV drip tubes, catheters, and life support equipment\ncan also be carriers, when the pathogens form biofilms on the surfaces. Careful\nsterilization of such objects prevents cross-infection.\n\nResearchers have discovered that smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g. door knobs)\ntransmit bacteria and viruses better than porous materials (e.g. paper\nmoney).<ref>{{Cite journal\n| volume = 60 issue = 10 last = Abad first = F X coauthors = R M Pintó, A.
