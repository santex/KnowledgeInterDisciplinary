Making use of techniques\nlike procedural textures, a soundtrack composed using their own efficient, MIDI-\nbased software synthesizer V2 (controlled through a sequencer called Logic\nAudio, which is currently owned by Apple under the name Logic Pro) and a\nmodified version of UPX executable compressor, \".the .product\" is an\n11-minute 3-D show featuring complex scenes of computer generated imagery.\n\nTheir work has won numerous awards. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called\n\"'.theprodukkt'\" released a 96kB first-person shooter game named \".kkrieger\",\nand an earlier version of the tool they currently use to produce some of their\ndemos, named \".werkkzeug\", or \"Tool\".\n\nFarbrausch is known for giving all of their releases a \"product code\", in the\nformat \"fr-0#\". The numbers do not specify the order of release — the\nmembers have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the\nproject, not when they finish it. They give \"minus\" numbers to their non-\nserious releases.\n\nSince then they have periodically released ever-improving compositions such as\n\"fr-019: Poem to a Horse\", \"fr-030: Candytron\" or \"fr-025: The.Popular.Demo\".\nThe.Popular.Demo and debris. are among the most highly favored demos on the\ncomprehensive demoscene index, Pouet. The.Popular.Demo is also the recipient of\nthe \"Public Choice Award\" from the 2003 scene.org awards, and debris. won the\n2007 scene.org award for best direction.\n\nIn 2009, Farbrausch, again under the name .theprodukkt, released .detuned, an\ninteractive demo for the PlayStation 3.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Farbrausch","recorded":1362476882,"links":26,"instances":["demo_group","demo_party","demo_party","demo_party","demo_party"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Demogroups"],"headings":["Members","Notable demo releases and awards","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Crystal_kchart.png/25px-Crystal_kchart.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["evoke","demo_party"],["the_party","demo_party"],["breakpoint","demo_party"],["assembly","demo_party"],["haujobb","demo_group"]],"members":["haujobb","breakpoint","the_party","evoke","assembly"],"related":["Germany","Demogroup","Demoscene","64k_intro","Procedural_textures","Software_synthesizer","Logic_Audio","UPX","3D_computer_graphics","Computer_generated_imagery",".kkrieger","Demomaker",".werkkzeug","Pouët",".detuned","PlayStation_3","Evoke_(demo_party)","The_Party_(demo_party)","Scoopex","Mekka_&_Symposium","Game_Boy_Advance","Scene.org_Awards","SIGGRAPH","Breakpoint_(demo_party)","The_Ultimate_Meeting","Assembly_(demo_party)","Haujobb_(demo_group)","Mfx","Pouët"]}
