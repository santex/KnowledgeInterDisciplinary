{"cursor":"6395","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Fusion proteins' or 'chimeric proteins' are proteins created through the\njoining of two or more genes which originally coded for separate proteins.\nTranslation of this [[fusion gene]] results in a single polypeptide with\nfunctional properties derived from each of the original proteins. Recombinant\nfusion proteins are created artificially by recombinant DNA technology for use\nin biological research or therapeutics. Chimeric mutant proteins occur naturally\nwhen a complex mutation, such as a chromosomal translocation, tandem\nduplication, or retrotransposition creates a novel coding sequence containing\nparts of the coding sequences from two different genes. Naturally occurring\nfusion proteins are commonly found in cancer cells, where they may function as\noncoproteins. The bcr-abl fusion protein is a well-known example of an oncogenic\nfusion protein, and is considered to be the primary oncogenic driver of chronic\nmyelogenous leukemia.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Fusion_protein","recorded":1362484486,"links":18,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineered proteins"],"headings":["Functions","Recombinant technology","Natural occurrence","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Chimeric_and_humanized_antibodies.svg/200px-Chimeric_and_humanized_antibodies.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["splicing","translation","transcription","cell"],"related":["Gene","Polypeptide","Recombinant_DNA_technology","Therapeutics","Mutation","Chromosomal_translocation","Oncoprotein","Bcr-abl_fusion_protein","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Protein_domains","Regulation_of_gene_expression","Chimeric_gene","Protein","Genetic_engineering","Codon","CDNA","Reading_frame","Ligase","PCR","Protein_expression","Cell_(biology)","Protein_purification","GST-tag","FLAG-tag","His-tag","Affinity_chromatography","Toxin","Antibodies","Drug_development","Drug","Monoclonal_antibodies","Antigen","Immune_reaction","Genetic_engineering","Constant_domain","Immunogenicity","Antibody_nomenclature","International_Nonproprietary_Name","Abciximab","Daclizumab","List_of_monoclonal_antibodies","Etanercept","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor","Immunoglobulin_G","Fragment_crystallizable_region","Chromosomal_translocation","Exon","Transcription_(genetics)","Splicing_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Cancer","Oncogene","Gag-onc_fusion_protein","Bcr-abl_fusion_protein","Tpr-met_fusion_protein","VDJ_recombination","Genetic_engineering","Protein_engineering"]}
