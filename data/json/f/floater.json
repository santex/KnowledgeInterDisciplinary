The common type\nof floater, which is present in most people’s eyes, is due to degenerative\nchanges of the vitreous humour. The perception of floaters is known as\nmyodesopsia,<ref>From Greek [http://www.zeno.org/Pape-1880/A/μυιώδης μυιώδης]\n\"fly-like\" (Myiodes was also the name of a fly-deterring deity) and ὄψις\n\"sight.\"</ref> or less commonly as myodaeopsia, myiodeopsia, myiodesopsia.<ref\nname=\"Cline\"/> They are also called Muscae volitantes (Latin: \"flying flies\"),\nor mouches volantes (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the\nshadows they cast on the retina<ref name=pamphlet>American Academy of\nOphthalmology. \"Floaters and Flashes: A Closer Look\" (pamphlet) San Francisco:\nAAO, 2006. ISBN 1-56055-371-5</ref> or refraction of the light that passes\nthrough them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one’s\nvisual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which\nfloat slowly before the observer’s eyes.<ref name=facts/> Since these objects\nexist within the eye itself, they are not optical illusions but are entoptic\nphenomena.\n",
