See note 64 on page 331 in\n\"The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom\" by Graham\nFarmelo from the surname of Enrico Fermi) is any particle characterized by\nFermiâDirac statistics and following the Pauli exclusion principle; fermions\ninclude all quarks and leptons, as well as any composite particle made of an odd\nnumber of these, such as all baryons and many atoms and nuclei. Fermions\ncontrast with bosons which obey BoseâEinstein statistics.\n\nA fermion can be an elementary particle, such as the electron; or it can be a\ncomposite particle, such as the proton. The spin-statistics theorem holds that,\nin any reasonable relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin\nare bosons, while particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n\nIn contrast to bosons, only one fermion can occupy a particular quantum state at\nany given time. If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability\ndistribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must\nbe different. Fermions are usually associated with matter, whereas bosons are\ngenerally force carrier particles; although in the current state of particle\nphysics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear.\n\nComposite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are key building blocks of\nmatter. Weakly interacting fermions can also display bosonic behavior under\nextreme conditions, such as in superconductivity.\n","linknr":424,"url":"Fermions","recorded":1362892168,"links":84,"instances":["physics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Particle physics","Quantum field theory","Subatomic particles","Fermions|*","Concepts in physics"],"headings":["Elementary fermions","Composite fermions","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg/250px-CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"],["chirality","physics"]],"members":["spin","chirality"],"related":["Particle_physics","Paul_Dirac","Enrico_Fermi","Subatomic_particle","Fermi–Dirac_statistics","Pauli_exclusion_principle","Quark","Lepton","Composite_particle","Even_and_odd","Baryon","Atom","Atomic_nucleus","Boson","Bose–Einstein_statistics","Elementary_particle","Electron","Composite_particle","Proton","Spin-statistics_theorem","Theory_of_relativity","Quantum_field_theory","Integer","Spin_(physics)","Bosons","Half-integer","Quantum_state","Matter","Force_carrier","Neutron","Superconductivity","Standard_Model","Quark","Lepton","Antiparticle","Hadron","Carbon-13","Helium-3","Superfluid","Phonon","Cooper_pair","Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect","Composite_fermions","Soliton","Tony_Skyrme","Skyrmion","Nonlinear_sigma_model","Pion","1/N_expansion","AdS/QCD","Quantum_chromodynamics","Topological_soliton","Magnetic_monopole","Dirac_quantization_condition","Dyon","Anyon","Chirality_(physics)","Fermionic_condensate","Fermionic_field","Identical_particles","Kogut–Susskind_fermion","Majorana_fermion","Parastatistics","Boson"]}
