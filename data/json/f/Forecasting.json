{"cursor":"18442","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Forecasting' is the process of making statements about events whose actual\noutcomes (typically) have not yet been observed. A commonplace example might be\nestimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date.\nPrediction is a similar, but more general term. Both might refer to formal\nstatistical methods employing time series, cross-sectional or longitudinal data,\nor alternatively to less formal judgemental methods. Usage can differ between\nareas of application: for example, in hydrology, the terms \"forecast\" and\n\"forecasting\" are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific\nfuture times, while the term \"prediction\" is used for more general estimates,\nsuch as the number of times floods will occur over a long period.\n\nRisk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction; it is generally\nconsidered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to\nforecasts. In any case, the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to\nbe as accurate as possible.\n\nAlthough quantitative analysis can be very precise, it is not always\nappropriate. Some experts in the field of forecasting have advised against the\nuse of mean square error to compare forecasting methods.\n","linknr":323,"url":"Forecasting","recorded":1362484784,"links":37,"instances":["future_studies"],"pdf":["http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/FAQ.pdf","http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/FAQ.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/armstrong-errormeasures-empirical.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/armstrong-errormeasures-empirical.pdf","http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/FAQ.pdf","http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/FAQ.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Value%20of%20expertise.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Value%20of%20expertise.pdf","http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Escalation%20Bias.pdf","http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Escalation%20Bias.pdf","http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Monetary%20Incentives.pdf","http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Monetary%20Incentives.pdf","http://www.nickbostrom.com/views/superintelligence.pdf","http://www.robjhyndman.com/papers/mase.pdf"],"categories":["Data analysis","Statistical forecasting","Time series analysis","Supply chain management terms","Supply chain analytics"],"headings":["Categories of forecasting methods","Forecasting accuracy","Applications of forecasting","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/1/eb1c0613be7d214b0720b7b9506f42b2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/3/d330bd25a42cd72fd56c5704b868082d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/a/65a710fd8a91cb8dd0e4a861f3fc383e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/6/9a6de639f4c16c8bdfae152f945a08f2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/d/8dd2c089f6f21faeb73160ae7a5bfe66.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/7/547dfdc6c81dd186409aec2225ac8691.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/9/a793db708028288237ef61d1bf94e2cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/f/5af7684bd4b77a4a8131ea7c01ab8659.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/0/2/a02cc8ec19525ec881d234dd01694f55.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["foresight","future_studies"]],"members":["foresight"],"related":["Approximation","Prediction","Time_series","Cross-sectional_data","Longitudinal_study","Hydrology","Future","Risk","Uncertainty","Delphi_method","Market_research","Moving_average","Exponential_smoothing","Time_series","Moving_average","Weighted_moving_average","Kalman_filtering","Exponential_smoothing","Autoregressive_moving_average_model","Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average","Box-Jenkins","Extrapolation","Linear_prediction","Trend_estimation","Growth_curve","Regression_analysis","Parametric","Non-parametric","ARMAX","Probability","Composite_forecasts","Delphi_method","Forecast_by_analogy","Scenario_building","Statistical_survey","Technology_forecasting","Artificial_neural_networks","Group_method_of_data_handling","Support_vector_machine","Data_mining","Machine_Learning","Pattern_Recognition","Simulation","Prediction_market","Probabilistic_forecasting","Ensemble_forecasting","Mean_absolute_error","Mean_Absolute_Percentage_Error","Mean_squared_error","Mean_squared_prediction_error","Forecast_skill","Calculating_demand_forecast_accuracy","Calculating_demand_forecast_accuracy","Consensus_forecasts","Forecast_error","Predictability","Prediction_interval","Confidence_interval","Reference_class_forecasting","Egain_Forecasting","Customer_Demand_Planning","Planning","Supply_chain_management","Economic_forecasting","Earthquake_prediction","Egain_Forecasting","Land_use_forecasting","PECOTA","Political_Forecasting","Product_forecasting","Sales_Forecasting","Technology_forecasting","Telecommunications_forecasting","Transport_planning","Transportation_forecasting","Weather_forecasting","Flood_forecasting","Meteorology","Edward_Lorenz","Chaos_theory","Fluid_dynamics","Technological_singularity","Superintelligence","Ray_Kurzweil","Vernor_Vinge","Collaborative_planning,_forecasting,_and_replenishment","Forecasting_bias","Foresight_(future_studies)","Futures_studies","Futurology","Optimism_bias","Planning","Strategic_foresight","Technology_forecasting","Wind_power_forecasting","Earthquake_prediction","Weather_forecasting","Time_Series","Armstrong,_J._Scott","English_language","English_language","English_language","English_language","Hyndman,_Rob_J.","English_language","English_language","English_language","Peter_Turchin"]}
