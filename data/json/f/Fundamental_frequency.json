In terms of a\n superposition of sinusoids (e.g. Fourier series), the fundamental frequency is\n the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum. In some contexts, the fundamental\n is usually abbreviated as 'f 0' (or 'FF'), indicating the lowest\n frequency counting from zero. In other\n contexts, it is more common to abbreviate it as 'f 1', the first har-\n monic. [http://openlearn.open.-\n ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=397877&section=5.13.2] (The second\n harmonic is then f 2 = 2âf 1, etc. In this context, the\n zeroth harmonic would be 0 Hz.)\n\nAll sinusoidal and many non-sinusoidal waveforms are periodic, which is to say\nthey repeat exactly over time. A single period is thus the smallest repeating\nunit of a signal, and one period describes the signal completely. We can show\na waveform is periodic by finding some period T for which the following\nequation is true:\n: x(t) = x(t + n \\cdot T)\\text{ for all }n \\in \\mathbb{N} \n\nWhere x(t) is the function of the waveform.\n\nThis means that for multiples of some period T the value of the signal is always\nthe same. The least possible value of T for which this is true is called the\nfundamental period and the fundamental frequency (f 0) is:\n: f_0 = \\frac{1}{T}\n\nWhere f 0 is the fundamental frequency and T is the\nfundamental period.\n\nThe fundamental frequency of a sound wave in a tube with a single 'CLOSED' end\ncan be found using the following equation:\n: f_0 = \\frac{v}{4L} \n\nL can be found using the following equation:\n: L = \\frac{\\lambda}{4} \n\nÎ» (lambda) can be found using the following equation:\n: \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f_0} \n\nThe fundamental frequency of a sound wave in a tube with either 'BOTH' ends\n'OPEN' or 'CLOSED' can be found using the following equation:\n: f_0 = \\frac{v}{2L} \n\nL can be found using the following equation:\n: L = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \n\nThe wavelength, which is the distance in the medium between the beginning and\nend of a cycle, is found using the following equation:\n: \\lambda = \\frac{v}{f_0} \n\nWhere:\n\n:f 0 = fundamental frequency :L = length of the tube :v = wave\nvelocity of the sound wave\n:Î» = wavelength\n\nAt 20 Â°C (68 Â°F) the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s (1129 ft/s).\nThis speed is temperature dependent and does increase at a rate of 0.6 m/s\nfor each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1 ft/s for every\nincrease of 1 Â°F).\n\nThe velocity of a sound wave at different temperatures:- *v = 343.2 m/s at\n20 Â°C *v = 331.3 m/s at 0 Â°C\n","linknr":210,"url":"Fundamental_frequency","recorded":1362666705,"links":37,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e101/lectures/Fundamental_Frequency.pdf","http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e101/lectures/Fundamental_Frequency.pdf","https://nchsdduncanapphysics.wikispaces.com/file/view/Standing+Waves+in+a+Tube+II.pdf","https://nchsdduncanapphysics.wikispaces.com/file/view/Standing+Waves+in+a+Tube+II.pdf","http://physics.kennesaw.edu/P11_standwaves3.pdf","http://physics.kennesaw.edu/P11_standwaves3.pdf","http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys1240/phys1240_fa05/notes/lect24_Tu11_22_4up.pdf","http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys1240/phys1240_fa05/notes/lect24_Tu11_22_4up.pdf"],"categories":["Musical tuning","Acoustics","Fourier analysis"],"headings":["Mechanical systems","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg/250px-Harmonic_partials_on_strings.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/6/af69e7c1ba66cfb9fb419a21940f0341.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/6/f26422db29eca70d860c4f253d4069e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/e/cde907d84f4b04c64c985089fae032c2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/1/1/b11e0686b837cc4e8f6b4fdc4e0af959.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/a/33a68b2ddbecc9d0074895ae3c3ed2fd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/f/fafbab1520dfb3a3fcc41f814f455030.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/e/b/8eb4fe6219cac371993ba566327f096a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/a/33a68b2ddbecc9d0074895ae3c3ed2fd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/1/6/d167c8c07ba78866cf1bcc61529cca7c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/c/73cb6f0121da6b745df4141181907357.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Spectrogram_showing_shared_partials.png/80px-Spectrogram_showing_shared_partials.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Standing_wave","Overtone","Periodic_signal","Waveform","Sine_wave","Fourier_series","Zero-based_numbering","Harmonic","Lambda","Speed_of_sound","Stiffness","Missing_fundamental","Natural_frequency","Oscillation","Hertz","Electronic_tuner","Scale_of_harmonics","Pitch_detection_algorithm"]}
