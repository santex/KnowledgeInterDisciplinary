As with most physical traits, there is a wide range of normality of\nfemale body shapes.\n\nHuman beings and cultures have perennially focused attention on the female body\nas a source of aesthetic pleasure, sexual attraction, fertility, and\nreproduction. There are, and have been, wide differences on what should be\nconsidered an ideal or preferred body shape, both for attractiveness and for\nhealth reasons. These have varied among cultures simultaneously.\n\nWomen's bodies occur in a range of shapes. Female figures are typically narrower\nat the waist than at the bust and hips. The bust, waist, and hips are called\ninflection points, and the ratios of their circumferences are used to define\nbasic body shapes.\n","linknr":521,"url":"Female_body_shape","recorded":1362552601,"links":25,"instances":["blaas","ethics","breasts"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501491_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501491_eng.pdf","http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ehbe-lab/acrobatfiles/preferred%20waist.pdf","http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Ehbe-lab/acrobatfiles/preferred%20waist.pdf","http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hbe-lab/acrobatfiles/profilewhr.pdf","http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hbe-lab/acrobatfiles/profilewhr.pdf"],"categories":["Body shape","Human body","Physical attractiveness","Portrayals of women|Body shape","Feminism and health"],"headings":["Impact of estrogens","Fat distribution","Muscles","Changes to body shape","Measurements","Female shapes","\"Dimensions\"","Social and health issues","Bodies as identity","Alteration of body shape","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Detail_from_The_Birth_of_Venus_by_William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281879%29.jpg/220px-Detail_from_The_Birth_of_Venus_by_William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281879%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Vintage_photo_nude_woman_2.jpg/220px-Vintage_photo_nude_woman_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ingres%2C_The_source.jpg/167px-Ingres%2C_The_source.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Eugene_de_Blaas_In_the_water.jpg/183px-Eugene_de_Blaas_In_the_water.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Bodyshapes.svg/300px-Bodyshapes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Rubens_Venus_at_a_Mirror_c1615.jpg/220px-Rubens_Venus_at_a_Mirror_c1615.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Peter_Paul_Rubens_034.jpg/220px-Peter_Paul_Rubens_034.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ideal","ethics"],["ptosis","breasts"],["in_the_water","blaas"]],"members":["in_the_water","ideal","ptosis"],"related":["William-Adolphe_Bouguereau","Aesthetic","Sexual_attraction","Fertility","Reproduction","Ideal_(ethics)","Waist","Breast","Hip","Inflection_point","Circumference","Estrogens","Man","Woman","Secondary_sexual_characteristic","Breasts","Hip","Puberty","Organ_hypertrophy","Hormone","Prolactin","Breastfeeding","Menopause","Metabolism","Muscle","Buttocks","Thigh","Hip","Thyroid","Basal_metabolic_rate","Hormones","Menopause","Abdomen","Body_fat_percentage","Subcutaneous_fat","Metabolism","Abdomen","Testosterone","Anabolic_steroid","Muscle","Biceps","Triceps","Quadriceps","Aging_process","Sex_hormone","Estrogen","Body_fat","Puberty","Waistâ€“hip_ratio","Estrogen","Buttocks","Hips","Thighs","Menopause","Ovaries","Abdomen","Ptosis_(breasts)","Cooper's_ligaments","Sports_bra","Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres","In_the_Water_(Blaas)","Eugene_de_Blaas","Circumference","BWH","Inframammary_fold","Breast","Brassiere_measurement","Iliac_crest","Abdomen","Costal_margin","Body_fat","North_Carolina_State_University","Circumference","Imperial_units","Brassiere_measurements","Body_mass_index","Association_of_Model_Agents","Peter_Paul_Rubens","Waist-hip_ratio","Rubens","Diabetes","Hip","Marilyn_Monroe","Sophia_Loren","Venus_de_Milo","Body_mass_index","Brigham_Young_University","Dieting","Falsies","Breast_prostheses","Brassiere","Breast","Breast_implant","Breast_reduction","Corset","Victorian_era","Foundation_garment","Tightlacing","Liposuction","Liposculpture","Hip_and_buttock_padding","Buttock_augmentation","Body_proportions","Feminist_perspectives_on_eating_disorders","Glossary_of_shapes_with_metaphorical_names","Human_variability","Body_shape","List_of_artists_focused_on_the_female_form","Physical_attractiveness","Sexual_attraction","Sex_differences_in_humans"]}
