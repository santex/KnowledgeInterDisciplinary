Susan Haack, Deviant\nlogic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press,\n1996. This generally means the concept is vague, lacking a fixed, precise\nmeaning, without however being meaningless altogether. It has a meaning, or\nmultiple meanings (it has different semantic associations). But these can become\nclearer only through further elaboration and specification, including a closer\ndefinition of the context in which they are used. Fuzzy concepts \"lack clarity\nand are difficult to test or operationalize\". Ann Markusen, \"Fuzzy Concepts,\nScanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in\nCritical Regional Studies.\" In: Regional Studies, Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003,\npp. 701-717.\n\nIn logic, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as concepts which in their\napplication, or formally speaking, are neither completely true or completely\nfalse, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require\nfurther elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their\napplicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).\n\nIn mathematics and statistics, a 'fuzzy variable' (such as \"the temperature\",\n\"hot\" or \"cold\") is a value which could lie in a probable range defined by\nquantitative limits or parameters, and can be usefully described with imprecise\ncategories (such as \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\").\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, the gradations of applicable meaning of a\nfuzzy concept are described in terms of quantitative relationships defined by\nlogical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called \"degree-theoretic\nsemantics\" by logicians and philosophers, Roy T. Cook, A dictionary of\nphilosophical logic. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84. but the more\nusual term is fuzzy logic or many-valued logic. The basic idea is, that a real\nnumber is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from\n0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that\nthe statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0\nrepresent that the statements are \"partly true\", to a given, quantifiable\nextent. This makes its possible to analyze a distribution of statements for\ntheir truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions,\nand model how processes operate.\n\nFuzzy reasoning (i.e. reasoning with graded concepts) has many practical\nuses.

Pardalos &\nGeorge Baourakis, Fuzzy Sets in Management, Economics and Marketing.\nSingapore; World Scientific Publishing Co. 2001. It is nowadays widely\nused in the programming of vehicle and transport electronics, household\nappliances, video games, language filters, robotics, and various kinds of\nelectronic equipment used for pattern recognition, surveying and monitoring\n(such as radars). Fuzzy reasoning is also used in artificial intelligence and\nvirtual intelligence research.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Fuzzy_concept","recorded":1362574785,"links":17,"instances":["philosophy","sociology","language_use","mathematics","computer_science","science","social_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.logik.ch/daten/jaskowski.pdf","http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf","http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf","http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf","http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf","http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf"],"categories":["Dialectic","Psychometrics"],"headings":["Origins and etymology","Uncertainty","Language","Psychology","Applications","Analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/07/Operationalization_of_Free_and_Fair_Judiciary.png/400px-Operationalization_of_Free_and_Fair_Judiciary.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["range","mathematics"],["reflexivity","social_theory"],["context","language_use"],["lifestyle","sociology"],["phenomenology","philosophy"],["identity","philosophy"],["phenomenology","science"],["referential_transparency","computer_science"],["reflexivity","social_theory"]],"members":["identity","lifestyle","context","range","referential_transparency","phenomenology","reflexivity"],"related":["Concept","Susan_Haack","Logic","Mathematics","Statistics","Range_(mathematics)","Parameters","Computer_science","Fuzzy_logic","Many-valued_logic","Artificial_intelligence","Virtual_Intelligence","Plato","Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel","Karl_Marx","Friedrich_Engels","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Jan_Łukasiewicz","Alfred_Tarski","Stanisław_Jaśkowski","Susan_Haack","Stanisław_Jaśkowski","Donald_Knuth","Lotfi_A._Zadeh","Lotfi_A._Zadeh","Fuzzy_set","Fuzzy_logic","George_Lakoff","George_Lakoff","Charles_Ragin","Charles_Ragin","Randall_Collins","Jonathan_H._Turner","Loïc_Wacquant","Pierre_Bourdieu","Loïc_Wacquant","Reflexivity_(social_theory)","Uncertainty","God","Dictionary","Thesaurus","Encyclopedia","Message","Symbols","Context_(language_use)","Set_theory","Binary_logic","Paradox","Learning","Understanding","Psychotherapy","Religion","Exact","Rigorous","Analogy","Telescope","Camera","Microscope","Psychophysics","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Test_method","Flux","Complexity","Politics","Political_power","Translation","Information_services","Legal_system","Statistical","Hypnotherapy","Biology","Fuzzy_complex","Theology","Spirtuality","Supernatural","Meteorology","Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Expletive_attributive","Ambiguity","Vagueness","Contradiction","Pragmatic","Mathematical_logic","Programming","Philosophy","Linguistics","Fuzzy_logic","Computer_programming","Taxonomy","Critical_thought","Boolean_logic","Logical_operators","Algorithm","Parameters","Defuzzification","Fuzzy_set","Alternative_set_theory","Defuzzification","Detection_theory","Dialectic","European_Society_for_Fuzzy_Logic_and_Technology","Fuzzy_subalgebra","Fuzzy_logic","Fuzzy_mathematics","George_Klir","Fuzzy_mathematics","Fuzzy_measure_theory","Fuzzy_set_operations","Identity_(Philosophy)","Interval_finite_element","Jakobson's_functions_of_language","Linear_partial_information","Many-valued_logic","Multiset","Neuro-fuzzy","Non-well-founded_set_theory","Opaque_context","Phenomenology_(science)","Precision","Referential_transparency_(computer_science)","Reflexivity_(social_theory)","Post-normal_science","Rough_fuzzy_hybridization","Rough_set","Semiset","Sørensen_similarity_index","Synchronicity","Type-2_Fuzzy_Sets_and_Systems","Uncertainty"]}
