Black numbers correspond to groups of formations and white numbers correspond\n  to formations (click on picture for more information).]]\n\nA 'formation' or 'geological formation' is the fundamental unit of\nlithostratigraphy. A formation consists of a certain number of rock strata that\nhave a comparable lithology, facies or other similar properties. Formations are\nnot defined on the thickness of the rock strata they consist of and the\nthickness of different formations can therefore vary widely.\n\nThe concept of formally defined layers or strata is central to the geologic\ndiscipline of stratigraphy. A formation can be divided into members and are\nthemselves grouped together in groups.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Formation_(stratigraphy)","recorded":1362375012,"links":36,"instances":["stratigraphy","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geologic formations|","Geology terminology","Stratigraphy"],"headings":["Usefulness of formations","Defining lithostratigraphic formations","Other uses of the term","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Grand_Canyon_geologic_column.jpg/220px-Grand_Canyon_geologic_column.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/SEUtahStrat.JPG/300px-SEUtahStrat.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","stratigraphy"],["group","stratigraphy"],["transgression","geology"]],"members":["group","transgression"],"related":["Group_(stratigraphy)","Lithostratigraphy","Stratum","Lithology","Sedimentary_facies","Stratigraphy","Group_(stratigraphy)","Geologist","Outcrop","Stratum","Geologic_time","Law_of_superposition","Geological_time_scale","Sedimentary_depositional_environment","Fossil","Proterozoic","Geologic_unit","Sedimentary_rock","Metamorphic_rocks","Volcanic","Jurassic","Colorado_Plateau","Utah","Stratigraphy","Capitol_Reef_National_Park","Canyonlands_National_Park","Navajo_Sandstone","Kayenta_Formation","Wingate_Sandstone","Chinle_Formation","Moenkopi_Formation","Cutler_Formation","Glen_Canyon_National_Recreation_Area","Geologic_unit","Paleontology","Geologic_unit","Geologic_unit","Sequence_stratigraphy","Marine_regression","Transgression_(geology)","Cave","Stalactite","Stalagmite","List_of_fossil_sites","Geochronology","Stratigraphy","List_of_Chinese_geological_formations"]}
