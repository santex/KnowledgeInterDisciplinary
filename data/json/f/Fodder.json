{"cursor":"6055","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Fodder' or 'animal feed' is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to\nfeed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and\npigs. Most animal feed is from plants, but some is of animal origin. \"Fodder\"\nrefers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and\ncarried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (see\nforage). It includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and\nmixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes.\n\nThe worldwide animal feed industry consumed tons of feed (compound feed\nequivalent) in 2006, with an annual growth rate of about 2%. The use of\nagricultural land to grow feed rather than human food can be controversial; some\ntypes of feed, such as corn (maize), can also serve as human food; those that\ncannot, such as grassland grass, may be grown on land that can be used for crops\nconsumed by humans. Some agricultural byproducts fed to animals may be\nconsidered unsavory by human consumers.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Fodder","recorded":1362506911,"links":66,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fodder|*"],"headings":["Common plants specifically grown for fodder","Types of fodder","Health concerns","Sprouted grains as fodder","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Fodder_factory02.jpg/250px-Fodder_factory02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Round_hay_bale_at_dawn02.jpg/250px-Round_hay_bale_at_dawn02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Newton_of_Cawdor_stack_of_bales_-_geograph.org.uk_-_545290.jpg/250px-Newton_of_Cawdor_stack_of_bales_-_geograph.org.uk_-_545290.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/African_boy_transporting_fodder_by_bicycle_edit.jpg/250px-African_boy_transporting_fodder_by_bicycle_edit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Salmonsens_konversationsleksikon_-_Foder-B%C3%A6lgplanter%2C_Foder-Gr%C3%A6sser.jpg/300px-Salmonsens_konversationsleksikon_-_Foder-B%C3%A6lgplanter%2C_Foder-Gr%C3%A6sser.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Fodder_growing.jpg/250px-Fodder_growing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/32px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Agriculture","Food","Domesticated","Livestock","Cattle","Goats","Sheep","Horses","Chicken","Pig","Forage","Hay","Straw","Silage","Compound_feed","Legume","Compound_feed","Maize","Grassland","Byproduct","Alfalfa","Barley","Birdsfoot_trefoil","Kale","Rapeseed","Rutabaga","Turnip","Clover","Trifolium_hybridum","Red_clover","Subterranean_clover","White_clover","Grass","Bermuda_grass","Bromus","Arrhenatherum","Fescue","Danthonia","Meadow","Orchard_grass","Ryegrass","Timothy-grass","Maize","Millet","Oat","Sorghum","Soybean","Tree","Pollarding","Wheat","Grass","Hay","Silage","Compound_feed","Premixes","Stover","Copra","Straw","Chaff","Sugar_beet","Fish_meal","Grass","Meat_and_bone_meal","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Molasses","Oligosaccharide","Seaweed","Seed","Grain","Yeast_extract","Bran","Cottonseed","Safflower","Sunflower","Soybean","Peanut","Maize","Sorghum","Horse_gram","Crop","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Meat_and_bone_meal","Cattle","Prion","Mold","Toxin","Veterinary_Feed_Directive","Cannon_fodder","Factory_farming","Forage","Grain","Pasture"]}
