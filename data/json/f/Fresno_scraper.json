Working with farmers in Fresno,\nCalifornia, USA he had recognised the dependence of the Central San Joaquin\nValley on irrigation, and the need for a more efficient means of constructing\ncanals and ditches in the sandy soil. In perfecting the design of his machine,\nPorteous made several revisions on his own and also traded ideas with William\nDeidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, who invented and held patents on\nsimilar scrapers. Porteous bought the patents held by Deidrick, Dusy, and\nMcCall, gaining sole rights to the Fresno Scraper.\n\nThe design of the Fresno Scraper forms the basis of most modern earthmoving\nscrapers, having the ability to scrape and move a quantity of soil, and also to\ndischarge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be\nhandled manually.\n\nPrior scrapers pushed the soil ahead of them, while the 'Fresno scraper' lifted\nit into a C-shaped bowl where it could be dragged along with much less\nfriction. By lifting the handle, the operator could cause the scraper to bite\ndeeper. Once soil was gathered, the handle could be lowered to raise the blade\noff the ground so it could be dragged to a low spot, and dumped by raising the\nhandle very high.\n\nThis design was so revolutionary and economical that it has influenced the\ndesign of modern bulldozer blades and earth movers to this day.\n\nBetween 1884 and 1910 thousands of Fresno scrapers were produced at the Fresno\nAgricultural Works which had been formed by Porteous, and used in agriculture\nand land levelling, as well as road and railroad grading and the construction\nindustry. They played a vital role in the construction of the Panama Canal and\nlater served the US Army in World War I.\n\nIt was one of the most important agricultural and civil engineering machines\never made. In 1991 the Fresno Scraper was designated as an International\nHistoric Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical\nEngineers. It is currently on display at the San Joaquin County Historical\nSociety & Museum.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Fresno_scraper","recorded":1374963837,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:FresnoScraper.GIF","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/FresnoScraper.GIF/350px-FresnoScraper.GIF","/wiki/File:FresnoScraper.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/James_Porteous","/wiki/Fresno,_California","/wiki/Irrigation","/wiki/Sand","/wiki/Soil","/wiki/William_Deidrick","/wiki/Frank_Dusy","/wiki/Abijah_McCall","/wiki/Earthworks_(engineering)","/wiki/Wheel_tractor-scraper","/wiki/Bulldozer","/wiki/Construction","/wiki/Panama_Canal","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wheel_tractor-scraper","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=edit&section=2","http://www.asme.org/about-asme/history/landmarks/topics-a-l/agriculture/-158-fresno-scraper-(1883)","/wiki/The_Engines_of_Our_Ingenuity","http://www.sanjoaquinhistory.org/featured-activities.php?id=7","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&oldid=561214226","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_inventions","/wiki/Category:Engineering_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Historic_Mechanical_Engineering_Landmarks","/wiki/Category:Scottish_inventions","/wiki/Category:Soil","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fresno+scraper&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fresno+scraper","/wiki/Fresno_scraper","/wiki/Talk:Fresno_scraper","#","/wiki/Fresno_scraper","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fresno_scraper","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Fresno_scraper","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&oldid=561214226","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5503209","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Fresno_scraper&id=561214226","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Fresno+scraper","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Fresno+scraper&oldid=561214226&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Fresno_scraper&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5503209#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_scraper","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
