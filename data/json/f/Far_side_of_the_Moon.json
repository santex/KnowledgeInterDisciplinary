{"cursor":"16287","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n ]]\n\nThe 'far side of the Moon', sometimes called the '\"dark side of the Moon\"', is\nthe lunar hemisphere that is permanently turned away, and not visible from the\nsurface of the Earth. The far hemisphere was first photographed by the Soviet\nLuna 3 probe in 1959, and was first directly observed by human eyes when the\nApollo 8 mission orbited the Moon in 1968. The rugged terrain is distinguished\nby a multitude of crater impacts, as well as relatively few lunar maria. It\nincludes the second largest known impact feature in the Solar System, the South\nPole-Aitken basin. The far side has been suggested as a potential location for\na large radio telescope, as it would be shielded from possible radio\ninterference from Earth. To date, there has been no ground exploration of the\nfar side of the Moon.\n","linknr":381,"url":"Far_side_of_the_Moon","recorded":1362268781,"links":45,"instances":["crater","map","crater","crater","publisher"],"pdf":["http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/moon99/pdf/8017.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/moon99/pdf/8017.pdf"],"categories":["Lunar science"],"headings":["Definition","Differences","Exploration","Potential","Alleged UFO sightings and conspiracies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg/300px-Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg/220px-Moon_Farside_LRO.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Soviet_Union-1959-stamp-photo_of_moon.jpg/220px-Soviet_Union-1959-stamp-photo_of_moon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Craters_of_the_Far_Side_of_the_Moon.jpg/220px-Craters_of_the_Far_Side_of_the_Moon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg/28px-Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/120px-FullMoon2010.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scale","map"],["nauka","publisher"],["tsiolkovskiy","crater"],["daedalus","crater"],["saha","crater"]],"members":["saha","scale","tsiolkovskiy","daedalus","nauka"],"related":["Moon","Earth","Luna_3","Apollo_8","Lunar_maria","South_Pole-Aitken_basin","Radio_telescope","Earth","Tidal_locking","Libration","Full_moon","New_moon","Dark_side_of_the_moon","Lunar_mare","Lunar_Prospector","South_Pole-Aitken_basin","Oceanus_Procellarum","Giant_impact_hypothesis","Libration","Mare_Orientale","Julius_Heinrich_Franz","Lunar_Orbiter_4","Soviet_Union","Luna_3","NASA","Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia","USSR_Academy_of_Sciences","USSR_Academy_of_Sciences","NASA","Moscow_State_University","Scale_(map)","Sternberg_Astronomical_Institute","USSR","Museum_of_the_History_of_Science","Oxford","Zond_3","NASA","Moscow","Nauka_(publisher)","Adler_Planetarium","Sternberg_Astronomical_Institute","Moscow_State_University","Soviet_Union","International_Astronomical_Union","Human","Apollo_8","Astronaut","William_Anders","Apollo_8","Apollo_10","Apollo_17","Radio","Lyndon_B._Johnson_Space_Center","Harrison_Schmitt","Tsiolkovskiy_(crater)","Lissajous_orbit","Radio_telescope","Astronomer","Telescope","Arecibo_Observatory","Puerto_Rico","Daedalus_(crater)","Saha_(crater)","Solar_flare","Lagrange_point","Lissajous_orbit","NASA","South_Pole-Aitken_basin","Solar_wind","Lunar_mare","Helium-3","Isotope","Nuclear_fusion","Milton_William_Cooper","Unidentified_flying_object","Lagrangian_point","Near_side_of_the_Moon","Geology_of_the_Moon","Giant_impact_hypothesis"]}
