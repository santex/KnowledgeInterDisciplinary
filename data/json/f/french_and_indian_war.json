The war was fought primarily between\nthe colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by\nmilitary units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, who\ndeclared war on each other in 1756. In the same year, the war escalated from a\nregional affair into a world-wide conflict.\n\nThe name refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists: the royal\nFrench forces and the various Indigenous forces allied with them. British and\nEuropean historians use the term the Seven Years' War, as do many Canadians.\nCanadian historians avoid the term \"French and Indian War\", preferring \"Anglo-\nFrench rivalry.\" The nation of Canada descends from both the British and the\nFrench (and the Indians).<ref>M. Brook Taylor, Canadian History: a Reader's\nGuide: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation (1994) pp 39-48, 72-74</ref> French\nCanadians call it La guerre de la Conquête (\"The War of Conquest\").<ref>[http:/-\n/www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0007300 The\nCanadian Encyclopedia]</ref><ref>[http://bataille.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca/en/guerre-de-sept-\nans/contexte.php The Siege of Quebec: An episode of the Seven Years' War -\nCanadian National Battlefields Commission Plains of Abraham website]</ref>\n\nThe war was fought primarily along the frontiers separating New France from the\nBritish colonies from Virginia to Nova Scotia. The French were greatly\noutnumbered, so they made heavy use of Indian allies. It began with a dispute\nover control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, called\nthe Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne and present-day\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of\nJumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command\nof George Washington ambushed a French patrol. British operations in 1755, 1756\nand 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a\ncombination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective French and\nIndian offense. The 1755 British capture of Fort Beauséjour on the border\nseparating Nova Scotia from Acadia was followed by its policy to deport the\nFrench inhabitants. The British overcame their resistance, transporting many to\nLouisiana, then under French control.\n\nAfter the disastrous 1757 British campaigns (resulting in a failed expedition\nagainst Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry, which was followed by\nIndian torture and massacres of British victims), the British government fell.\nWilliam Pitt came to power. Pitt significantly increased British military\nresources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large\nconvoys to aid the limited forces it had in New France. It concentrated its\nforces against Prussia and its allies in the European theatre of the war.\nBetween 1758 and 1760, the British military successfully penetrated the\nheartland of New France, and took control of Montreal in September 1760.\n\nThe outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo-\nFrench conflict. France ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to\nits ally Spain in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida (which\nSpain had ceded to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba). France's\ncolonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint\nPierre and Miquelon, confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial\npower in the eastern half of North America.\n",
