People executed in this way die from injuries\ncaused by hitting the ground at high velocity.\n\nIn ancient Delphi the sacrilegious were hurled from the top of the Hyampeia, the\nhigh crag of the Phaedriades to the east of the Castalian Spring.

Cacoulides.\n\nIn pre-Roman Sardinia, elderly people who were unable to support themselves were\nritually killed. They were intoxicated with a neurotoxic plant known as the\n\"sardonic herb\" (which some scientists think is hemlock water dropwort) and then\ndropped from a high rock or beaten to death. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-aug-\n09 News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile], Scientific American, August\n2009\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, the Tarpeian Rock, a steep cliff at the southern\nsummit of the Capitoline Hill, was used for public executions. Murderers and\ntraitors, if convicted by the quaestores parricidii, were flung from the cliff\nto their deaths. Those who had a mental or significant physical disability also\nsuffered the same fate as they were thought to have been cursed by the\ngods. Platner (1929).

London. Oxford University Press.\n\nLater, during the Roman Empire, the Gemonian stairs were used for this purpose.\nTheir use as a place of execution is most closely associated with the later part\nof the reign of the emperor Tiberius. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.u-\nchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#61.2 61.2],-\n[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius-\n*.html#62.2 62.2] The condemned were usually strangled before their bodies\nwere bound and thrown down the stairs. Occasionally the corpses of the executed\nwere transferred here for display from other places of execution in Rome.\nCorpses were usually left to rot on the staircase for extended periods of time\nin full view of the Forum, scavenged by dogs or other carrion animals, until\neventually being thrown into the Tiber. Death on the stairs was considered\nextremely dishonourable and dreadful, yet several senators and even an emperor\nmet their demise here.\n\nSuetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity and cruelty of\nTiberius during the later part of his reign while he was living at Capri,\nTiberius would execute people by having them thrown from a cliff into the sea\nwhile he watched. Suetonius, The Lives of\nTwelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/T-\nexts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#62.2 62.2] These people were\ntortured before being executed and if they survived the fall, men waiting below\nin boats would break their bones with oars and boathooks.\n\nIn pre-colonial South Africa, several tribes including the Xhosa and the Zulu\nhad named Execution Hills, from which miscreants were hurled to their deaths.\nThese societies had no form of imprisonment so punishment was corporal, capital\nor expulsion. It is believed that during the Namibian war of independence\nnumerous SWAPO troops were dropped from South African helicopters over the sea.\n\nIran may have used this form of execution for the crime of sodomy. According to\nAmnesty International in 2008, two men were convicted of raping two university\nstudents and sentenced to\ndeath. [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/010/2008/en Iran: UA\n17/08 - Fear of imminent execution/ flogging | Amnesty International] They\nwere to be thrown off a cliff or from a great height. Other men involved in this\nincident were sentenced to lashes, presumably because they did not engage in\npenetrative sex with the victims. The European Union condemned Iran for this\naction in a declaration against Iran's use of the death penalty.
