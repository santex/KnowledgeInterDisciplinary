It is being built alongside the existing\nForth Road Bridge across the Firth of Forth, and will connect Scotland's capital\ncity Edinburgh, at South Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry.\n\nProposals for a second Forth crossing were first put forward in the 1990s, but\nit was not until the discovery of structural issues with the Forth Road Bridge\nin 2005 that plans were moved forward. The decision to proceed with a\nreplacement bridge was taken at the end of 2007, although the following year it\nwas announced that the existing bridge would be retained as a public transport\nlink. The Forth Crossing Act received Royal Assent in January 2011, and\nconstruction began in September 2011.\n\nThe Queensferry Crossing will be a cable-stayed bridge, with an overall length\nof . Around of new connecting roads will be built, including new and upgraded\njunctions at Ferrytoll in Fife, South Queensferry, and Junction 1a on the M9. It\nwill be the third bridge across the Forth at Queensferry, alongside the Forth\nRoad Bridge completed in 1964, and the Forth Bridge completed in 1890. The\nbridge is due to be complete by 2016. Following a public vote, it was formally\nnamed on 26th June 2013.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Forth_Replacement_Crossing","recorded":1375055895,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Queensferry_Crossing","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Forth_Replacement_Crossing&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Forth_Replacement_Crossing_Artist%27s_impression.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Forth_Replacement_Crossing_Artist%27s_impression.jpg/220px-Forth_Replacement_Crossing_Artist%27s_impression.jpg","/wiki/Forth_Road_Bridge","/wiki/Forth_Bridge","/wiki/Firth_of_Forth","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Fife","/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge","/wiki/Dual_carriageway","/wiki/Hard_shoulder","#cite_note-newbridge-1","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Queensferry_Crossing&params=56.0046_N_3.4124_W_type:landmark_region:GB","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Queensferry_Crossing&params=56.0046_N_3.4124_W_type:landmark_region:GB","/wiki/File:Edinburgh_UK_location_map.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Edinburgh_UK_location_map.svg/250px-Edinburgh_UK_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-Red_pog.svg.png","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/Forth_Road_Bridge","/wiki/Firth_of_Forth","/wiki/Edinburgh","/wiki/South_Queensferry","/wiki/Fife","/wiki/North_Queensferry","/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge","/wiki/M9_motorway_(Scotland)","/wiki/Forth_Bridge","#Background_to_the_project","#Planning","#Bidding_process","#Construction","#The_bridge","#Connecting_roads","#Admiralty_Junction","#Ferrytoll_Junction","#South_Queensferry_Junction","#M9_Junction_1a","#Intelligent_Transport_System","#Archaeological_finds","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Scottish_Office","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997","#cite_note-scotsman2004-3","/wiki/File:Forth_Road_Bridge_cable_inspection.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Forth_Road_Bridge_cable_inspection.jpg/220px-Forth_Road_Bridge_cable_inspection.jpg","/wiki/File:Forth_Road_Bridge_cable_inspection.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Design_life","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Minister_for_Housing_and_Transport","/wiki/Nicol_Stephen","#cite_note-scotsman2004-3","/wiki/Forth_Estuary_Transport_Authority","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","/wiki/Alistair_Darling","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Transport_Scotland","/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Finance,_Employment_and_Sustainable_Growth","/wiki/John_Swinney","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth","/wiki/Scottish_Green_Party","/wiki/RSPB","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Scottish_Futures_Trust","/wiki/Public-private_partnership","/wiki/Scottish_Government","#cite_note-cutprice-14","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-cutprice-14","/wiki/Arup","/wiki/Jacobs_Engineering_Group","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment#EU","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","#cite_note-bbc_approved-18","/wiki/Royal_Assent","#cite_note-19","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Transport_Scotland","#cite_note-ts_contract_bidding-20","#cite_note-scotsman_two_bidders-21","#cite_note-scotsman_two_bidders-21","/wiki/Morgan_Sindall","/wiki/BAM_Nuttall","/wiki/Balfour_Beatty","/wiki/Grupo_ACS","/wiki/Hochtief","/wiki/American_Bridge_Company","/wiki/Galliford_Try","#cite_note-invited-22","#cite_note-invited-22","#cite_note-ts_contract_bidding-20","#cite_note-bbc_contract_awarded-23","#cite_note-24","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-early-27","#cite_note-early-27","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Queensferry_Crossing&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Forth_Replacement_Crossing_map.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/th
