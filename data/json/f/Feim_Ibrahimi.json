{"cursor":"4322","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Feim Ibrahimi' (1935â1997) was born on 20 October 1935 in GjirokastÃ«r, southern\nAlbania. Essentially self-taught in his early years, he became the first\nsignificant Albanian composer to study exclusively in his home country, entering\nthe newly-founded Tirana Conservatory in 1962 and studying there with Daija\nuntil 1966. He then taught composition, counterpoint and harmony at the\nconservatory (1966â73), subsequently serving as vice-director of its parent\nbody, the Superior Institute of Arts (1973â7). His most significant post was as\nmusic secretary of the Union of Albanian Writers and Artists (1977â91); he later\nalso served as director of the Theatre of Opera and Ballet, Tirana (1991â92).\nFrom 1992 until his death he taught theory and composition at the Tirana\nConservatory.\n\nAs music secretary during Albaniaâs period of cultural isolation, Ibrahimi\nshowed himself a capable administrator, exerting a positive influence on\nAlbaniaâs musical life. Though obliged by his office to defend socialist\nrealism, during his official travels abroad he tried, as much as was possible,\nto keep up with international musical developments, experimenting in secret with\natonality (e.g. in the Cello Sonata, 1975, rev. 1990), expressing a private\ninterest in Xenakis as early as 1981, and inviting to Albania such avant-garde\nfigures as Stabler. After the collapse of the communist rÃ©gime he worked\ntirelessly to bring Albanian music into the wider European musical arena. In\n1991 he was the first President of National Musicâs Council (member of the\nInternational Musicâs Council to the UNESCO). He founded the festival Evenings\nof New Albanian Music in 1992. In 1994 he founded the artistic society\nâPentatonâ (now Cultural Foundation âFeim Ibrahimiâ), aiming to organize several\ncultural events and to establish a private conservatory for gifted children.\nSome his works are published in England by the Emerson Edition.\n\nFor his artistic merits, in 1989, the Albanian State conferred him the title\nâPeopleâs Artistâ, the highest artistic title in Albania. Whereas in 2000, the\ntown hall of Tirana conferred him the title âThe gratitude of Tiranaâ for his\ncontribution to the Albanian culture, and especially to the culture of the\ncapital. In 2001, the town hall of DurrÃ«s (the city where he passed his\nchildhood and youth) conferred him the Honorary Citizenship.\n\nIbrahimi has won many prizes in national competitions and in âMay Concertsâ (the\nmain national festival organized annually since 1967). He has won two Republic\nprizes â the most important award in the field of creative activity. In 1990, a\nconcert-portrait, which included a lecture on his music, was organized at the\nAalto Theaterfoyer, in Essen (Germany). In 1994, at the Brahms-Gesellschaftâs\ninvitation, he was composer-in-residence at the Brahmshaus of Baden-Baden\n(Germany), and immediately afterwards he studied electro-acoustic music at\nMozarteum in Salzburg (Austria). In 1995, his work De Profundis âcomposed during\nhis residency in Salzburgâ was selected for the festival of electro-acoustic\nmusic in Bourges, France.\n\nIbrahimiâs music includes nearly all genres: instrumental miniatures,\nsoundtracks, chamber music, concertos for solo instruments and orchestra,\nsymphonies, ballets and vocal works. Dialogo for cello and piano and the romance\nE la tua veste Ã¨ bianca (after the poem of S. Quasimodo) for soprano, cello and\npiano (both composed in June 1997) are the last works of the composer, who died\nthe 2 August 1997 in Turin, Italy.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Feim_Ibrahimi","recorded":1375056193,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr","/wiki/Albania","/wiki/Tirana","/w/index.php?title=Tirana_Conservatory&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Aalto_Theatre","/wiki/Bourges","/wiki/Turin","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/68822721","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&oldid=540933648","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1935_births","/wiki/Category:1997_deaths","/wiki/Category:Albanian_composers","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Feim+Ibrahimi&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Feim+Ibrahimi","/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","/wiki/Talk:Feim_Ibrahimi","#","/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Feim_Ibrahimi","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Feim_Ibrahimi","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&oldid=540933648","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2543574","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Feim_Ibrahimi&id=540933648","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Feim+Ibrahimi","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Feim+Ibrahimi&oldid=540933648&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Feim_Ibrahimi&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","//sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2543574#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feim_Ibrahimi","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1935
