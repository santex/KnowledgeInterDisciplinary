It was adopted in\nAugust 1949, and defines humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone,\nand outlaws the practice of total war. There are currently 194 countries party\nto the 1949 Geneva Conventions, including this and the other three\ntreaties.\n\nIn 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted a report from the Secretary-\nGeneral and a Commission of Experts which concluded that the Geneva Conventions\nhad passed into the body of customary international law, thus making them\nbinding on non-signatories to the Conventions whenever they engage in armed\nconflicts.
