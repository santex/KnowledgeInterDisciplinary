{"cursor":"5386","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'frameshift mutation' (also called a 'framing error' or a 'reading frame\nshift') is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) of a\nnumber of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA\nsequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion\nor deletion can change the reading frame (the grouping of the codons),\nresulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier\nin the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein\nproduced is.\n\n\n\nA frameshift mutation will in general cause the reading of the codons after the\nmutation to code for different amino acids. The frameshift mutation will also\nalter the first stop codon (\"UAA\", \"UGA\" or \"UAG\") encountered in the sequence.\nThe polypeptide being created could be abnormally short or abnormally long, and\nwill most likely not be functional.\n\nFrameshift mutations frequently result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-\nSachs disease. A frameshift mutation is responsible for the disabling of the\nCCR5 HIV receptor and some types of familial hypercholesterolemia (Lewis, 2005,\np. 227-228). Frameshift mutations have also been proposed as a source of\nbiological novelty, as with the alleged creation of nylonase. However, a study\nby Negoro et al (2006)\nhttp://www.jbc.org/content/280/47/39644.full.pdf+html found that a\nframeshift mutation was unlikely to have been the cause and that rather a two\namino acid substitution in the catalytic cleft of an ancestral esterase\namplified Ald-hydrolytic activity.\n\nFrameshifting may also occur during prophase translation, producing different\nproteins from overlapping open reading frames, such as the gag-pol-env\nretroviral proteins. This is fairly common in viruses and also occurs in\nbacteria and yeast (Farabaugh, 1996).\n\nA frameshift mutation is not the same as a single-nucleotide polymorphism in\nwhich a nucleotide is replaced, rather than inserted or deleted.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Frameshift_mutation","recorded":1362484000,"links":21,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mutation"],"headings":["Thermodynamics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Frameshift_mutation.jpg/500px-Frameshift_mutation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Genetics","Mutation","Indel","Gene_insertion","Genetic_deletion","Nucleotide","DNA","Gene_expression","Codon","Gene_insertion","Genetic_deletion","Reading_frame","Translation_(genetics)","Genetic_deletion","Gene_insertion","Frameshift","Tay-Sachs_disease","CCR5","Hypercholesterolemia","Nylonase","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Translational_frameshift","Protein","Frameshift","Intron","Frameshift","Frameshift","Translation_(genetics)"]}
