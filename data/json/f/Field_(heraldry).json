The field is\nusually composed of one or more tinctures (colours or metals) or furs. The field\nmay be divided or may consist of a variegated pattern.\n\nIn rare modern cases the field (or a subdivision thereof) is not a tincture, but\nis shown as a scene from a landscape. Landscape fields are regarded\nby many heralds as unheraldic and debased, as they defy the heraldic ideal of\nsimple, boldly coloured images and cannot be consistently drawn from blazon.\n\nThe arms of Count Cesare Fani [http://www.armorial-register.com/arms-it/count-cesare-\nfani.html] are along the same lines, as the field is blazoned as \"sky proper.\"\nThe arms of the Inveraray and District Community Council in Scotland have as a\nfield In waves of the sea. The correct language of heraldry is almost infinitely\nflexible and virtually any image may be blazoned in a correct manner, for\nexample \"sky proper\" might be blazoned simply Azure, whilst \"waves of the sea\"\nmight be blazoned correctly as Azure, 3 bars undee argent which would provide 3\nwavy thick white lines on a blue field.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Field_(heraldry)","recorded":1362898543,"links":29,"instances":["heraldry","heraldry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heraldry"],"headings":["See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Elementy_herbu.jpg/250px-Elementy_herbu.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Herb_Szablon_1.PNG/22px-Herb_Szablon_1.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shield","heraldry"],["tincture","heraldry"]],"members":["shield","tincture"],"related":["Heraldry","Shield_(heraldry)","Tincture_(heraldry)","Colour","Metal","Heraldic_fur","Division_of_the_field","Variation_of_the_field","Landscape","Blazon","Division_of_the_field","Variation_of_the_field"]}
