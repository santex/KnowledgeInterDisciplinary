{"cursor":"1860","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In nonlinear optics, 'filament propagation' is propagation of a beam of light\nthrough a medium without diffraction. This is possible because the Kerr effect\ncauses an index of refraction change in the medium, resulting in self-focusing\nof the beam.\n\nFilamentary damage tracks in glass caused by laser pulses were first observed by\nHercher in 1964. Filament propagation of laser pulses in the\natmosphere was observed in 1994 by GÃ©rard Mourou and his team at University of\nMichigan. The balance between the self-focusing refraction and self-attenuating\ndiffraction by ionization and rarefaction of a laser beam of terawatt\nintensities, created by chirped pulse amplification, in the atmosphere creates\n\"filaments\" which act as waveguides for the beam thus preventing divergence. If\na light filament drops below the intensity needed for this dynamic balance,\ncalled modulation instability, it can merge with another filament and continue\npropagating without broadening as with all earlier means of sending light. The\nfilaments, having made a plasma, turn the narrowband laser pulse into a\nbroadband pulse having a wholly new set of applications.\n\nFilament propagation in a semiconductor medium can also be observed in large\naperture vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Filament_propagation","recorded":1362674143,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nonlinear optics"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Lens_triplet.svg/36px-Lens_triplet.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Nonlinear_optics","Light","Diffraction","Kerr_effect","Index_of_refraction","Gérard_Mourou","University_of_Michigan","Diffraction","Ionization","Rarefaction","Chirped_pulse_amplification","Semiconductor","Vertical_cavity_surface_emitting_laser"]}
