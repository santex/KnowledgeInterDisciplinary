It\nwas created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act,\nlargely in response to a series of financial panics, particularly a severe panic\nin 1907.<ref name=\"mnglass\"/><ref name=\"initial\"/><ref></ref><ref name=FDS-H-\n04/><ref name=FDS-H-05/><ref name=FDS-H-06/> Over time, the roles and\nresponsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure\nhas evolved.<ref name=\"initial\"/><ref> \"It was founded by Congress in 1913 to\nprovide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and\nfinancial system. Over the years, its role in banking and the economy has\nexpanded.\"</ref> Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading\nto changes in the system.<ref></ref>\n\nThe US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the\nFederal Reserve Act: Maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term\ninterest rates.<ref></ref> The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as\nthe Federal Reserve's dual mandate.<ref></ref> Its duties have expanded over the\nyears, and today, according to official Federal Reserve documentation, include\nconducting the nation's monetary policy, supervising and regulating banking\ninstitutions, maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing\nfinancial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign\nofficial institutions.<ref name=\"mission\"></ref> The Fed also conducts research\ninto the economy and releases numerous publications, such as the Beige Book.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System's structure is composed of the presidentially\nappointed Board of Governors (or Federal Reserve Board), the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities\nthroughout the nation, numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various\nadvisory councils.<ref> (See structure)</ref><ref></ref><ref>Advisory Councils –\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm</ref> The FOMC is\nthe committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven\nmembers of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents,\nthough only five bank presidents vote at any given time (the president of the\nNew York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms). The Federal\nReserve System has both private and public components, and was designed to serve\nthe interests of both the general public and private bankers. The result is a\nstructure that is considered unique among central banks. It is also unusual in\nthat an entity outside of the central bank, namely the United States Department\nof the Treasury, creates the currency used.<ref></ref> According to the Board of\nGovernors, the Federal Reserve System \"is considered an independent central bank\nbecause its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the\nPresident or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government,\nit does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the\nmembers of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional\nterms.\"<ref>From \"Who owns the Federal Reserve?\", Current FAQs, Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, at\n[http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm].</ref>\n\nThe authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted by\nthe U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight. The\nmembers of the Board of Governors, including its chairman and vice-chairman, are\nchosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The government also\nexercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the\nsalaries of the system's highest-level employees. Nationally chartered\ncommercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their\nregion; this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the\nregional Federal Reserve Bank. Thus the Federal Reserve system has both public\nand private aspects.<ref\nname=\"who_owns_faq\"></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref> The U.S. Government\nreceives all of the system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on\nmember banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained.\nIn 2010, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $82 billion and transferred $79\nbillion to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"nyt transfer\"></ref> This was followed\nat the end of 2011 with a transfer of $77 billion in profits to the U.S.\nTreasury Department.<ref>Fed Gives $77
