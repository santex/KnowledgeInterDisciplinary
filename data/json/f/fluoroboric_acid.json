As fluoroboric acid has not been isolated,\nits descriptive properties remain largely unknown. It is mainly produced as a\nprecursor to other fluoroborate salts. It is classified as a strong acid,\nfluoroboric acid is corrosive and attacks the skin.\n\nIt is available commercially as a solution in water and other solvents such as\ndiethyl ether. With a strength comparable to nitric acid, fluoroboric acid is a\nstrong acid with a weakly coordinating, non-oxidizing conjugate base.\n\n<!--\n",
