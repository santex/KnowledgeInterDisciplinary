{"cursor":"2855","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule codes for a protein through\ntranslation. The mRNA also contains regions that are not translated: in\neukaryotes these include the '5' untranslated region', 3' untranslated region,\n5' cap and poly-A tail.\n\nThe 'five prime untranslated region' ('5' UTR'), can contain elements for\ncontrolling gene expression by way of regulatory elements. It begins at the\ntranscription start site and ends one nucleotide (nt) before the start codon\n(usually AUG) of the coding region. In prokaryotes, the 5' UTR usually contains\na ribosome binding site (RBS), also known as the Shine Dalgarno sequence\n(AGGAGGU).\n\nThe 5' UTR has a median length of ~150 nt in eukaryotes, but can be as long as\nseveral thousand bases. Some viruses and cellular genes have unusually long and\nstructured 5' UTRs which may impact gene expression. On average, 3' UTR tend to\nbe twice as long as the 5' UTR. In prokaryotic mRNAs the 5' UTR is\nnormally shorter.\n\n ]]\n\nSeveral regulatory sequences may be found in the 5' UTR:\n* Binding sites for proteins, that may affect the mRNA's stability or\n  translation, for example iron responsive elements, that regulate gene\n  expression in response to iron.\n* Riboswitches.\n* Sequences that promote or inhibit translation initiation.\n* Introns within 5' UTRs have been linked to regulation of gene expression and\n  mRNA export.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Five_prime_untranslated_region","recorded":1362374360,"links":15,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Gene expression"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/MRNA_structure.svg/400px-MRNA_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["RNA","Protein","Translation_(genetics)","Eukaryote","Three_prime_untranslated_region","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","Gene","Regulatory_element","Transcription_start_site","Nucleotide","Start_codon","Coding_region","Prokaryotes","Ribosome_binding_site","Shine_Dalgarno","Gene_expression","Regulatory_sequence","Gene_expression","Riboswitches","Three_prime_untranslated_region","Trans-splicing","UTRdb"]}
