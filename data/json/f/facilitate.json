For example:\n\n* Facilitation (business) is used in business and organizational settings to\n  ensure the designing and running of successful meetings and workshops. *Neural\n  facilitation in neuroscience, is the increase in postsynaptic potential evoked\n  by a 2nd impulse.\n* Ecological facilitation describes how an organism profits from the presence of\n  another. Examples are nurse plants, which provide shade for new seedlings or\n  saplings (e.g. using an orange tree to provide shade for a newly planted\n  coffee plant), or plants providing shelter from wind chill in arctic\n  environments.\n\nA person who takes on such a role is called a facilitator. Specifically:\n\n* A facilitator is used in a variety of group settings, including business and\n  other organisations to describe someone whose role it is to work with group\n  processes to ensure meetings run well and achieve a high degree of consensus\n* The term 'facilitator' is used in psychotherapy where the role is more to help\n  group members become aware of the feelings they hold for one another (see\n  Group psychotherapy)\n* The term 'facilitator' is used in education to refer to a specifically trained\n  adult who sits in class with a disabled, or otherwise needy, student to help\n  them follow the lesson that the teacher is giving (see Disability)\n* The term 'facilitator' is used to describe people engaged in the illegal\n  trafficking of human beings across international borders (see Human\n  trafficking)\n* The term 'facilitator' is used to describe those individuals who arrange\n  adoptions by attempting to match available children with prospective adopters\n* The term 'facilitator' is used to describe someone who assists people with\n  communication disorders to use communication aids with their hands.
