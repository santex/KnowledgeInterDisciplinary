MacKinnon, who was\n98 years, 324 days old when he died, was the oldest-ever first-class cricketer\nat that time.\n\nMacKinnon was born at Acryse Park, near Folkestone in Kent, and was educated at\nHarrow School. An amateur cricketer, he joined the MCC in 1870, and played first-\nclass cricket from 1870 to 1885.\n\nHe attended St John's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1871. He\nplayed cricket for Cambridge University, winning his blue in 1870. He played in\nthe famous University match in 1870, known as Cobden's Match, in which\nCambridge's Frank Cobden conceded only one run and took three wickets in the\nlast four-ball over to win the match by two runs.\n\nMacKinnon played for Kent from 1875. He toured Australia with Lord Harris in 1878-\n79, and played his only Test on this tour, making 0 and 5 in his two innings,\nbowled by Fred Spofforth twice. His first dismissal was the second in the first\nTest hat-trick. He was president of Kent in 1889.\n\nIn 1888, MacKinnon married the Hon. Emily Hood. They had one son and one daughter together.\nHis wife died in 1934.\n\nHe was a Captain in the Royal Kent Yeomanry from 1871 to 1893, promoted to\nHonorary Major in 1886. He was a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for\nKent from 1900 to 1902. On the death of his father in 1903, he became The\nMacKinnon of Mackinnon, the 35th Chief of the Mackinnon Clan.\n\nHe died at his home, Drumduan, in Forres, Morayshire, Scotland.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Francis_MacKinnon","recorded":1364043872,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Paddington","/wiki/England","/wiki/Forres","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/England_cricket_team","/wiki/List_of_England_Test_cricketers","/wiki/Australia_cricket_team","/wiki/Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)","/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket","/wiki/Bowling_average","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman","http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/16867.html","/wiki/Deputy_Lieutenant","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Eric_Tindill","/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/w/index.php?title=Acryse_Park&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Folkestone","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Harrow_School","/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club","/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club","/wiki/The_University_Match_(cricket)","/wiki/Frank_Cobden#The_1870_University_Match","/wiki/Frank_Cobden","/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Australian_cricket_team","/wiki/Lord_Harris","/wiki/Fred_Spofforth","/wiki/Test_cricket_hat-tricks","/w/index.php?title=Royal_Kent_Yeomanry&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mackinnon_Clan","/w/index.php?title=Drumduan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Forres","/wiki/Morayshire","/wiki/Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&suro=c&fir=&firo=c&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=MKNN865FA&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50","/wiki/Alumni_Cantabrigienses","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=edit&section=2","http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/16867.html","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/0/943.html","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/34/34.html","/wiki/James_Lillywhite","/wiki/Test_Cricket","/wiki/Reginald_Allen","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Paddington","/wiki/Forres","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&oldid=544085555","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1848_births","/wiki/Category:1947_deaths","/wiki/Category:Anglo-Scots","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge","/wiki/Category:Cambridge_University_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Clan_Mackinnon","/wiki/Category:Deputy_Lieutenants_of_Kent","/wiki/Category:England_Test_cricketers","/wiki/Category:English_people_of_Scottish_descent","/wiki/Category:Kent_cricketers","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Harrow_School","/wiki/Category:Scottish_clan_chiefs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Francis+MacKinnon&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Francis+MacKinnon","/wiki/Francis_MacKinnon","/wiki/Talk:Francis_MacKinnon","#","/wiki/Francis_MacKinnon","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Francis_MacKinnon","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Francis_MacKinnon","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&oldid=544085555","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Francis_MacKinnon&id=544085555","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Francis+MacKinnon","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Francis+MacKinnon&oldid=544085555&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Francis_MacKinnon&printabl
