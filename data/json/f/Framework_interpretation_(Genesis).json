For a more general account of the topic, see Genesis creation\n:narrative.\n\n\nThe 'framework interpretation' (also known as the 'literary framework view',\n'framework theory', or 'framework hypothesis') is an interpretation of the first\nchapter of the Book of Genesis which holds that the seven-day creation account\nis not a literal or scientific description of the origins of the universe,\nrather, it is an ancient religious text which outlines a theology of creation.\nThe seven day \"framework\" is therefore not meant to be chronological but is a\nliterary or symbolic structure designed to reinforce the purposefulness of God\nin creation and the Sabbath commandment.\n\nWhile based primarily on exegetical considerations, the framework interpretation\nalso attempts to synthesize knowledge of historical and cultural conditions out\nof which the text arose, as well as a theology of general revelation. It has\nbeen advanced in modern times by scholars such as Meredith G. Kline and Henri\nBlocher and has the support of commentators including Gordon Wenham. It stands\nin contrast to literalist approaches to the Genesis text.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Framework_interpretation_(Genesis)","recorded":1362559201,"links":23,"instances":["grammar","biblical_scholar","religion"],"pdf":["http://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j24_1/j24_1_5-6.pdf","http://creation.com/images/pdfs/tj/j24_1/j24_1_5-6.pdf","http://www.dbts.edu/journals/2005/McCabe.pdf","http://www.dbts.edu/journals/2005/McCabe.pdf"],"categories":["Creationism","Book of Genesis"],"headings":["Theology of the framework","Other considerations","Supporters and critics","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg/200px-The_Creation_of_Adam.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["parallelism","grammar"],["transcendence","religion"],["james_barr","biblical_scholar"]],"members":["parallelism","james_barr","transcendence"],"related":["Christian","Genesis_creation_narrative","Biblical_hermeneutics","Book_of_Genesis","Genesis_creation_myth","Biblical_literalism","Science","Universe","Theology","Creation_myth","Literary_device","Symbol","Shabbat","Ten_Commandments","Exegesis","General_revelation","Meredith_G._Kline","Henri_Blocher","Gordon_Wenham","Biblical_literalism","Parallelism_(grammar)","Revelation","Meredith_G._Kline","Ancient_Near_East","Animism","Pantheism","Polytheism","Transcendence_(religion)","Biblical_literalism","Science","Hermeneutics","Genre","Yahwist","Theistic_evolution","Progressive_creationism","Church_father","Augustine_of_Hippo","Meredith_G._Kline","Henri_Blocher","Bruce_Waltke","Pentateuch","Gordon_Wenham","Biblical_literalism","Creationists","Creationism","General_revelation","James_Barr_(biblical_scholar)","Systematic_theology","R.C._Sproul","Wayne_Grudem","Millard_Erickson","Allegorical_interpretations_of_Genesis","Theistic_evolution","Creation-evolution_controversy","Catholicism"]}
