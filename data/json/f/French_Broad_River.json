Its confluence\nwith the Holston River at Knoxville is the beginning of the Tennessee River.\n\nThe French Broad River was named by white settlers centuries ago because it was\none of the two broad rivers in western North Carolina. The one which flowed into\nland claimed by France at that time was named the \"French Broad River\", whereas\nthe other, which stayed in land claimed by England â the Colony of North\nCarolina â was named the \"English Broad River\". (The latter was later renamed\nsimply to the \"Broad River\"). The name of the French Broad River in French was\nthe Agiqua River, the Native Americans of this area â the Cherokee Indians â\ncalled it different names: Poelico, Agiqua (broad) in the mountains, Tahkeeosteh\n(racing waters) from Asheville down and Zillicoah above Asheville.

The river\nfollows a general northeasterly direction as it flows through Transylvania,\nHenderson, and Buncombe counties. In Buncombe County, the river flows through\nthe city of Asheville, where it receives the water of the Swannanoa River.\nDownstream of Asheville, the river proceeds north through Madison County, where\nit flows through its county seat of Marshall. Next, the French Broad River flows\nnorthwesterly into Tennessee.\n\nIn Cocke County, Tennessee, the French Broad River receives the waters of both\nthe Pigeon River and the Nolichucky River, after which the French Broad River is\nimpounded behind Douglas Dam, forming Douglas Lake. In Sevier County, the French\nBroad River receives the flow of the Little Pigeon River, and then it flows\nthrough a wide gap in Bays Mountain before reaching the flatlands of Tennessee\nand joining with the Holston River at Knoxville.\n\nThe lower portion of the French Broad River is dominated by the major\nhydroelectric power dam and reservoirs which were built by the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority, and which is one of the larger TVA developments on a tributary of the\nTennessee River. (The two other very large ones are Norris Lake on the Clinch\nRiver and Cherokee Lake on the Holston River.)\n\nIn 1987, the NC General Assembly established the 'French Broad River State\nTrail' as a blueway which follows the river for 67 miles. The paddle trail is a\npart of North Carolina State Trails Program, which is a section of the NC\nDivision of Parks and Recreation. A system of launch points locations were\ncreated along the river for the trail.\n\nThe portion of the French Broad River in Tennessee was designated a state scenic\nriver by the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Approximately of the river in\nCocke County, starting at the North Carolina border and extending downstream to\nthe place where it flows into Douglas Lake, are designated as a Class III,\nPartially Developed River.\n\nWilma Dykeman wrote the book The French Broad (1955) about the river. The book\nbrought public attention to concerns about the polluted condition of parts of\nthe river. Current conservation groups include The French Broad Riverkeeper.\nFacebook also hosts the French Broad Riverkeeper profile to list current river\nhappenings.\n","linknr":402,"url":"French_Broad_River","recorded":1362545143,"links":17,"instances":["tennessee","carolinas"],"pdf":["http://www.knoxcounty.org/frenchbroad/pdfs/fbrbguide.pdf"],"categories":["Geography of Buncombe County, North Carolina","Geography of Henderson County, North Carolina","Geography of Madison County, North Carolina","Rivers of North Carolina","Rivers of Tennessee","Geography of Sevier County, Tennessee","Geography of Cocke County, Tennessee","Geography of Jefferson County, Tennessee","Geography of Knox County, Tennessee","Tennessee River","Rivers used for whitewater recreation","Rivers on the Appalachian Trail","State parks of North Carolina","Water trails"],"headings":["Crossings","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/French_broad_river_9228.JPG/288px-French_broad_river_9228.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Frenchbroadrivermap.png/250px-Frenchbroadrivermap.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["broad_river","carolinas"],["pigeon_river","tennessee_-_north_carolina"],["little_pigeon_river","tennessee"]],"members":["little_pigeon_river","broad_river","pigeon_river"],"related":["Henderson_County,_North_Carolina","Transylvania_County,_North_Carolina","Tennessee_River","Knoxville,_Tennessee","United_States_of_America","Tennessee_River","Transylvania_County,_North_Carolina","Tennessee","Confluence","Holston_River","Knoxville,_Tennessee","Tennessee_River","Century","New_France","England","Colony_of_North_Carolina","Broad_River_(Carolinas)","French_language","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Cherokee_Indian","Eastern_Continental_Divide","Appalachian_Mountains","Henderson_County,_North_Carolina","Buncombe_County,_North_Carolina","Asheville,_North_Carolina","Swannanoa_River","Madison_County,_North_Carolina","Marshall,_North_Carolina","Cocke_County,_Tennessee","Pigeon_River_(Tennessee_-_North_Carolina)","Nolichucky_River","Douglas_Dam","Douglas_Lake","Sevier_County,_Tennessee","Little_Pigeon_River_(Tennessee)","Bays_Mountain","Hydroelectric_power","Tennessee_Valley_Authority","Norris_Dam","Clinch_River","Cherokee_Lake","General_Assembly_of_North_Carolina","Blueway","North_Carolina_Division_of_Parks_and_Recreation","Wilma_Dykeman","Water_pollution","Transylvania_County,_North_Carolina","Henderson_County,_North_Carolina","Etowah,_North_Carolina","U.S._64","Asheville_Regional_Airport","Buncombe_County,_North_Carolina","Asheville,_North_Carolina","Skyland,_North_Carolina","Blue_Ridge_Parkway","Interstate_26","Interstate_40","Biltmore_Estate","Interstate_26","Interstate_240","U.S._19","U.S._74","Leicester,_North_Carolina","Craggy,_North_Carolina","Marshall,_North_Carolina","U.S._25","U.S._70","Hot_Springs,_North_Carolina","Cocke_County,_Tennessee","Del_Rio,_Tennessee","U.S._25","U.S._70","U.S._321","Newport,_Tennessee","Knoxville,_Tennessee","Interstate_40","U.S._70","Douglas_Lake","Dandridge,_Tennessee","Douglas_Dam","Sevierville,_Tennessee","Marbledale,_Tennessee","List_of_North_Carolina_rivers","List_of_Tennessee_rivers","Wilma_Dykeman_RiverWay_Plan","RiverLink"]}
