{"cursor":"34582","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n quarterbackâJevan Snead of the 2006 Texas Longhorns football teamâin the\n \"pocket\" and preparing to pass.]]\n\nIn several forms of football a 'forward pass' is a throwing of the ball in the\ndirection that the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive\nteam's goal line. The forward pass is one of main distinguishers between\ngridiron football (American football and Canadian football) in which the play is\nlegal and widespread, and rugby football (union and league) from which the North\nAmerican games evolved, in which the play is illegal.\n\nIn some football codes, such as association football (soccer), the kicked\nforward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct\nkind of play at all. In these sports, the concept of offside is used to regulate\nwho can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. However, this has not\nalways been the case. Some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited\nforward passing, while others had strict offside rules similar to rugby.\n\nThe development of the forward pass in American football shows how the game has\nevolved from its rugby roots into the distinctive game it is today. Illegal and\nexperimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first\nlegal forward pass in American football took place in 1906, after a change in\nrules. Another change in rules occurred on January 18, 1951, which established\nthat no center, tackle, or guard could receive a forward pass. Today, the only\nlinemen who can receive a forward pass are the ends. Current rules regulate who\nmay throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as\nwell as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed.\nThe primary pass thrower is the quarterback, and statistical analysis is used to\ndetermine a quarterback's success rate at passing in various situations, as well\nas a team's overall success at the \"passing game.\"\n","linknr":622,"url":"Forward_pass","recorded":1362670336,"links":23,"instances":["rugby","nfl","rugby","baseball","american_football","1902","football","american_football","wisconsin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
