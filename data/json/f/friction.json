There are several\ntypes of friction:\n\n*'Dry friction' resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in\ncontact. Dry friction is subdivided into static friction (\"stiction\") between\nnon-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces.\n\n*'Fluid friction' describes the friction between layers within a viscous fluid\nthat are moving relative to each other.<ref name=\"Beer\">{{cite book\n| title = Vector Mechanics for Engineers edition = Sixth last = Beer first =\n| Ferdinand P. authorlink = Ferdinand Beer coauthor = E.

This property can have dramatic\nconsequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of\nwood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to heat whenever\nmotion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred.\nAnother important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may\nlead to performance degradation and/or damage to components. Friction is a\ncomponent of the science of tribology.\n\nFriction is not itself a fundamental force but arises from fundamental\nelectromagnetic forces between the charged particles constituting the two\ncontacting surfaces. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation\nof friction from first principles impossible and necessitates the use of\nempirical methods for analysis and the development of theory.\n","title":"friction","headings":["History","Laws of dry friction","Dry friction<!--Charles-Augustin de Coulomb links here-->","Fluid friction","Lubricated friction","Skin friction","Internal friction","Other types of friction","Reducing friction","Energy of friction","Applications","Instances where friction is advantageous","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Stiction","2: Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb","1: Force","1: Surface","1: Viscous","1: Kinetic_energy","1: Heat","1: Viscous_flow","1: Wear","1: Tribology","1: Fundamental_force","1: Electromagnetic_force","1: First_principle","1: Empirical_method","1: Leonardo_da_Vinci","1: Guillaume_Amontons","1: Leonhard_Euler","1: Angle_of_repose","1: Osborne_Reynolds","1: David_Tabor","1: Atomic_force_microscope","1: Normal_force","1: Curling","1: Euclidean_vector","1: Gravity","1: Mass","1: Acceleration","1: Free_body_diagram","1: Dimensionless_quantity","1: Arthur_Morin","1: Empirical","1: Measurement","1: Experiment","1: Polytetrafluoroethylene","1: Magnetic_levitation","1: Maglev_train","1: Silicone_rubber","1: Acrylic_rubber","1: Temperature","1: Velocity","1: Atmosphere","1: Copper","1: R&D_Magazine","1: Polyethene","1: PTFE","1: Glycol","1: Superlubricity","1: Richard_Feynman","1: Nanomachines","1: Cobalt","1: Carbon_monoxide","1: Platinum","1: Contact_area","1: Saturated_model","1: Adhesive_tape","1: Drag_racing","1: Computer_simulation","1: Multibody_system","1: Granular_material","1: Numerical_integration","1: Nonlinear_system#Types_of_nonlinear_behaviors","1: Painlevé_paradox","1: Brake#Noise","1: Glass_harp","1: Aeroelastic_flutter#Flutter","1: Fluid","1: Superfluid","1: Ideal_fluid","1: Drag_equation","1: Boundary_layer","1: Elastic_deformation","1: Motor_vehicle","1: Road","1: Roadway_noise","1: Electrostatic_charge","1: Explosion","1: Ball_bearing","1: Roller_bearing","1: Fluid_bearing","1: Thermoplastic","1: Nylon","1: HDPE","1: Molecular_weight","1: Lubricant","1: Graphite","1: Talc","1: Acoustic_lubrication","1: Conservation_of_energy","1: Aristotle","1: Irreversibility","1: Mechanical_work","1: Frames_of_reference","1: Polishing","1: Friction_welding","1: Hardness","1: Fretting","1: Surface_roughness","1: Rail_adhesion","1: Frictional_contact_mechanics","1: Road_slipperiness","1: Split_friction","1: Tribometer","1: Profilograph","1: Meteorite","1: Vehicle_brake","1: Contact_dynamics","1: Contact_mechanics","1: Factor_of_adhesion","1: Frictionless_plane","1: Non-smooth_mechanics","1: Stick-slip_phenomenon","1: Transient_friction_loading","1: Triboelectric_effect","1: Unilateral_contact","1: Galling"]}
