It is often used interchangeably with \"First World\".\n\nThe term usually refers to countries such as the United States, the United\nKingdom, France, West Germany, and organizations such as the European Union and\nNATO. In addition, the \"Free World\" occasionally includes the Commonwealth\nrealms, Japan, Israel, and India.\n\nAuthoritarian and dictatorial states were also included in the \"Free World\",\nprovided that they were either capitalistic or anti-communist. Notable examples\ninclude Spain under Francisco Franco, apartheid-era South Africa, and Greece\nunder the military junta of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n",
