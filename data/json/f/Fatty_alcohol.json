The precise chain length varies\nwith the source. http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02330.html Some commercially\nimportant fatty alcohols are lauryl, stearyl, and oleyl alcohols. They are\ncolourless waxy solids, although impure samples may appear yellow. Fatty\nalcohols usually have an even number of carbon atoms and a single alcohol group\n(-OH) attached to the terminal carbon. Some are unsaturated and some are\nbranched. They are widely used in industry.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Fatty_alcohol","recorded":1362512123,"links":22,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fatty alcohols|","Lipids"],"headings":["Production and occurrence","Applications","Types","Safety","Common names and related compounds","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Fatty_alcohol_-_generic.png/220px-Fatty_alcohol_-_generic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bolus","medicine"]],"members":["bolus"],"related":["Lauryl_alcohol","Stearyl_alcohol","Oleyl_alcohol","Alcohol_group","Wax","Ester","Fatty_acid","Animal_echolocation","Sodium","Bouveault–Blanc_reduction","Catalytic_hydrogenation","Tallow","Karl_Ziegler","Polymerization","Ethylene","Whale","Jojoba","Triglyceride","Transesterification","Rapeseed","Ethylene","Oligomer","Triethylaluminium","Hydroformylation","Shell_higher_olefin_process","Olefin_metathesis","Cosmetics","Solvent","Amphipathic","Surfactant","Emulsifier","Emollient","Thickener","Cosmetics","Food_industry","Beeswax","Cholesterol","Octacosanol","Triacontanol","Low-density_lipoprotein","High-density_lipoprotein","Hydrolyzed","Bile","Pancreatic","Carboxyl_esterase","Gastrointestinal_tract","Fibroblasts","Fatty_aldehydes","Fatty_acids","Fatty_alcohol_cycle","Peroxisomal","Adrenoleukodystrophy","Sjögren-Larsson_syndrome","Normal-chain_alcohol","Saturated_alcohol","Unsaturated_alcohol","Acetylenic_alcohol","Sulfated_alcohol","Branched-chain_alcohol","Mono-methylated","Polyisoprenoid","Saturated_polyisoprenoid","Isopranol","Unsaturated_polyisoprenoid","Prenol","Polyprenol","Turpenol","Phenolic_alcohol","LD50","Bolus_(medicine)","NOAEL","Organization_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development","Fugacity","Tert-Butyl_alcohol","Tert-Amyl_alcohol","3-Methyl-3-pentanol","Ethchlorvynol","Capryl_alcohol","2-Ethylhexanol","Pelargonic_alcohol","Capric_alcohol","Undecyl_alcohol","Lauryl_alcohol","Tridecyl alcohol","Myristyl_alcohol","Pentadecyl_alcohol","Cetyl_alcohol","Palmitoleyl_alcohol","Heptadecyl_alcohol","Stearyl_alcohol","Nonadecyl_alcohol","Arachidyl_alcohol","Heneicosyl_alcohol","Behenyl_alcohol","Erucyl_alcohol","Lignoceryl_alcohol","Ceryl_alcohol","1-heptacosanol","Montanyl_alcohol","1-nonacosanol","Myricyl_alcohol","1-dotriacontanol","Geddyl_alcohol","Cetearyl_alcohol"]}
