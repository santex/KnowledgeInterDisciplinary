The fading may vary with time, geographical position or\n  radio frequency, and is often modeled as a random process. A 'fading channel'\n  is a communication channel comprising fading. In wireless systems, fading may\n  either be due to multipath propagation, referred to as 'multipath induced\n  fading', or due to shadowing from obstacles affecting the wave propagation,\n  sometimes referred to as 'shadow fading'.\n","title":"fading","headings":["Key concepts","Slow versus fast fading","Selective fading","Fading models","Mitigation","See also","References","Literature","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: OFDM","3: Multipath_propagation","3: Diversity_scheme","2: Attenuation","2: Signal-to-noise_ratio","2: Forward_error_correction#Interleaving","2: Doppler_effect","2: Rake_receiver","2: Diversity_reception","2: Rayleigh_fading","1: Wireless_communication","1: Random_process","1: Shadow_fading","1: Wave_propagation","1: Superposition_principle","1: Propagation_delay","1: Amplitude","1: Log-normal_distribution","1: Log-distance_path_loss_model","1: Time_diversity","1: Error-correcting_code","1: Selective_fading","1: Radio_propagation","1: Ionosphere","1: Skywave","1: Groundwave","1: Sound","1: Coherence_bandwidth","1: CDMA","1: Error_coding","1: Equalization","1: Bit_loading","1: Equalization_filter","1: Intersymbol_interference","1: Doppler_shift","1: Forward_error_correction","1: Wavelength","1: Nakagami_fading","1: Log-normal_shadow_fading","1: Rician_fading","1: Weibull_fading","1: Multiple-input_multiple-output_communications","1: Space–time_code","1: Attenuation_distortion","1: Backhoe_fade","1: Fade_margin","1: Fading_distribution","1: Frequency_of_optimum_transmission","1: Link_budget","1: Lowest_usable_high_frequency","1: Maximum_usable_frequency","1: Rain_fade","1: Thermal_Fade","1: Ultra-wideband","1: ISTI"]}
