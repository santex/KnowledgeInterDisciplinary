The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately\niced cakes, topped with ornamental sometimes sculptural consumables, drizzled\nwith sauces, sprinkled with seeds, powders, or other toppings, or it may be\naccompanied by edible or inedible garnishes.\n\nThe arrangement and overall styling of food upon bringing it to the plate is\ntermed 'plating'. Christopher Styler & David Lazarus. (2006). Working the\nplate: the art of food presentation. John Wiley and Sons. Some\ncommon styles of plating include a 'classic' arrangement of the main item in the\nfront of the plate with vegetables or starches in the back, a 'stacked'\narrangement of the various items, or the main item leaning or 'shingled' upon a\nvegetable bed or side item. Wayne Gisslen. 2006. Professional Cooking, 6th\nEd. John Wiley and Sons. Item location on the plate is often referenced as\nfor the face of a clock, with six o'clock the position closest to the diner. A\nbasic rule of thumb upon plating, and even in some cases prepping, is to make\nsure you have the 5 components to a dish; protein, traditionally at a 6 o'clock\nposition, vegetable, at a 2 o'clock position, starch at an 11 o'clock position,\nsauce and garnish.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Food_presentation","recorded":1362484295,"links":17,"instances":["food","food","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Serving and dining","Food decorations"],"headings":["See also","Gallery","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Palatschinke.jpg/220px-Palatschinke.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Fruits_and_vegetable_%22flowers%22.jpg/220px-Fruits_and_vegetable_%22flowers%22.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/An_artful_arrangement_of_cheese_and_sausage.jpg/220px-An_artful_arrangement_of_cheese_and_sausage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Olives_attractively_served_in_purple_cabbage_leaves.jpg/160px-Olives_attractively_served_in_purple_cabbage_leaves.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Cocktail_Foods.jpg/168px-Cocktail_Foods.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Veggie_platter.jpg/160px-Veggie_platter.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Juliana_Tea_Party.jpg/137px-Juliana_Tea_Party.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mold","food"],["garnish","food"],["dish","food"]],"members":["dish","mold","garnish"],"related":["Food","Aesthetic","Chef","Food_preparation","Mold_(food)","Cake_decorating","Sugar_sculpture","Sauces","Seeds","Toppings","Garnish_(food)","Clock","Protein","Vegetable","Starch","Sauce","Garnish","Food_preparation","Nouvelle_cuisine","Garde_manger","Entr√©e","Dish_(food)","Food_photography","Food_porn","Condiment"]}
