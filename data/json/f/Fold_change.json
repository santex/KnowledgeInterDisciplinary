{"cursor":"1608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Fold change' is a number describing how much a quantity changes going from an\ninitial to a final value. For example, an initial value of 30 and a final value\nof 60 corresponds to a fold change of 2, or in common terms, a two-fold\nincrease. Fold change is calculated simply as the ratio of the final value to\nthe initial value, i.e. if the initial value is A and final value is B, the fold\nchange is B/A. As another example, a change from 80 to 20 would be a fold change\nof 0.25, while a change from 20 to 80 would be a fold change of 4. Some\npractitioners replace a fold-change value that is less than 1 by the negative of\nits inverse, e.g. a change from 80 to 20 would be a fold change of -4 (or in\ncommon terms, a four-fold decrease).\n\nFold change is often used in analysis of gene expression data in microarray and\nRNA-Seq experiments, for measuring change in the expression level of a gene.\n\n","linknr":87,"url":"Fold_change","recorded":1362685197,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/FCTComparison.pdf"],"categories":["Statistical methods"],"headings":["Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["RNA-Seq"]}
