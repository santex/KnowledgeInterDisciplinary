{"cursor":"1346","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The fatty streak is the first grossly visible lesion in the development of\natherosclerosis. It appears as an irregular yellow-white discoloration on the\nluminal surface of the artery, and consists of aggregates of monocyte-derived\nmacrophages located beneath the inner, endothelial layer of arteries. Fatty\nstreaks are made up of foamy macrophages, sometimes with T lymphocytes,\naggregated platelets, and smooth muscle cells, and regarded as the precursor\nlesion of atheromas which, with time, may evolve to plaques.\n\nThe macrophages have a foamy appearance by light microscopy due to innumerable\nmembrane bound cholesterol-laden vesicles within the cytoplasm.\n\nAlmost all children above the age of 10 in developed countries have fatty\nstreaks, with coronary fatty streaks beginning in adolescence.
