{"cursor":"3815","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn politics, a 'figurehead' is a person who holds [[de jure]] an important\n(often supremely powerful) title or office yet [[de facto]] executes little\nactual power, most commonly limited by convention rather than law. The metaphor\nderives from the carved figurehead at the prow of a sailing ship. Commonly cited\nfigureheads include Queen Elizabeth\nII's [http://www.cbc.ca/news/bigpicture/queen/con_monarchies.html\nConstitutional monarchies], by John Bowman, CBC News Online | Oct. 4, 2002 [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-04-20-royals-\ncover_x.htm On queen's 80th, Britons ask: Is monarchy licked?], by Jeffrey\nStinson, USA Today, | May 3, 2006 @5:22 PM ET role as Queen of the United\nKingdom, sixteen Commonwealth Realms and head of the British Commonwealth\noverall; she has an important office title, but no power over the nations in\nwhich she is not head of state. The Queen also holds all powers of state in her\nkingdoms, but rarely exercises them. Other figureheads are the Emperor Akihito\nof Japan, or presidents in some parliamentary republics, such as the President\nof Israel, President of Bangladesh, President of Greece, President of Germany,\nPresident of Pakistan, and the President of the People's Republic of China\n(without CPC General Secretary post).\n\nWhile the authority of a figurehead is in practice generally symbolic or\nceremonial, public opinion, respect for the office or the office holder and\naccess to high levels of government can give them significant influence on\nevents. In those systems of government where the head of state is in practice a\nfigurehead, they are also generally the titular commanders in chief of the\nnation's defence forces.\n\nSometimes a figurehead can be exploited in times of emergency. For example,\nIndian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi used the figurehead President of India to\nissue unilateral decrees that allowed her to bypass parliament when it no longer\nsupported her.\n\nDuring the crisis of the March on Rome in 1922, King Victor Emmanuel III of\nItaly, though a figurehead, played a key role in handing power to Benito\nMussolini.\n\nAnd, more than 20 years later, the same King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy played\na key role in the dismissal of Benito Mussolini in 1943. Since the abolition of\nmonarchy in Italy and the establishment of a republic in 1948, the Italian\nPresident assumed most of the ceremonial functions of the previous kings;\nhowever, the Italian President retains large powers in appointing a prime\nminister of his choice when in parliament there's no clear majority, creating a\nso-called \"president's cabinet\". For example, the actual (2013) Prime Minister\nof Italy, Sen Mario Monti, was not elected but appointed by the Italian\nPresident (Giorgio Napolitano) as a lifetime-senator and then as Prime Minister\nof the country.\n\nConversely, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, also a figurehead, had in 1981 a key\nrole in defending the newborn Spanish democracy and foiling the attempted coup\nd'Ã©tat, known as \"23-F\".\n","linknr":117,"url":"Figurehead","recorded":1375082192,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Figurehead_(object)","/wiki/De_jure","/wiki/De_facto","/wiki/Metaphor","/wiki/Figurehead_(object)","/wiki/Elizabeth_II","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Commonwealth_Realms","/wiki/British_Commonwealth","/wiki/Akihito","/wiki/President","/wiki/Parliamentary_republic","/wiki/President_of_Israel","/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh","/wiki/President_of_Greece","/wiki/President_of_Germany","/wiki/President_of_Pakistan","/wiki/President_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China","/wiki/CPC_General_Secretary","/wiki/Head_of_state","/wiki/Commander_in_chief","/wiki/Indira_Gandhi","/wiki/President_of_India","/wiki/Decree","/wiki/March_on_Rome","/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_III_of_Italy","/wiki/Benito_Mussolini","/wiki/Benito_Mussolini","/wiki/Mario_Monti","/wiki/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain","/wiki/23-F","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Power_behind_the_throne","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cbc.ca/news/bigpicture/queen/con_monarchies.html","/wiki/CBC_News","#cite_ref-2","http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-04-20-royals-cover_x.htm","/wiki/USA_Today","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Head_of_State","/wiki/Executive_(government)#Titles_and_Positions_of_Responsibility","/wiki/Post_turtle","/wiki/De_jure","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&oldid=565395651","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Metaphors_referring_to_ships","/wiki/Category:Positions_of_authority","/wiki/Category:Political_metaphors_referring_to_people","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Figurehead&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Figurehead","/wiki/Figurehead","/wiki/Talk:Figurehead","#","/wiki/Figurehead","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Figurehead","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Figurehead","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&oldid=565395651","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5448080","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Figurehead&id=565395651","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Figurehead","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Figurehead&oldid=565395651&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Figurehead&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5448080#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurehead","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["object"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metaphors
