The\napplication development consists of modifying callback procedure behaviour and\nmodifying object behaviour using inheritance.\n\nThis paradigm provides the patterns for understanding development with Rapid\nApplication Development (RAD) systems such as Delphi, where the Integrated\nDevelopment Environment (IDE) provides the template application and the\nprogrammer fills in the appropriate event handlers. The developer has the option\nof modifying existing objects via inheritance.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Framework-oriented_design","recorded":1362559161,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Software design"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Programming","Paradigm","Rapid_application_development","Integrated_development_environment"]}
