Malone' (August, 1844 â January 1, 1905) was a professional\nbaseball player in the 1860s and 1870s. He was the catcher for Athletic of\nPhiladelphia in 1871, champion of the first professional league season.\n\nBorn 1842 in Ireland, Malone was one of 4 Irish natives to play in the first\nNational Association season and one of five in the first National League season.\nIf we do not count the NA as a major league, he and Andy Leonard share\ndistinction as the first major leaguers born in Ireland, by good fortune that\ntheir teams met in the first NL game, 22 April 1876. Leonard\nis alone first if we count the NA.\n\nAlthough a left-handed thrower, Malone was mainly a catcher with major teams,\nboth amateur and pro. Physically it was a demanding position, no one using a\nface mask or regularly using a glove. (Doug Allison used buckskin mittens in\n1870, but gloves and masks were only adopted for regular use by some catchers\nbeginning in the late 1870s.)\n\nMalone was the primary catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics 1871â72,\nPhiladelphia White Stockings 1873, and Chicago White Stockings 1874. In\n1873â74, he was team captain, earning manager's credit today. He returned to\nthe Philadelphia Whites and played in eight games in 1875, then returned to\nthe Philadelphia Athletics for the inaugural National League season, catching\n20 of 60 games.\n\nFergy Malone was 34 when the Athletics were expelled from the National League,\nwhich contracted from eight to six for 1877. He returned to the majors with the\none-year Union Association in 1884, managing its Philadelphia entry and playing\nin one game. In 220 major league games Fergy Malone batted .274 with one home\nrun, 160 runs batted in, and 200 runs scored. He was a player-manager for his\nteams in 1873, 1874, and 1884, recording a total of 47 wins and 66 losses.\n\nMalone died 1905 in Seattle, Washington at age 62. He is buried at New Cathedral\nCemetery in Philadelphia.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Fergy_Malone","recorded":1364044255,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Fergy_Malone.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Fergy_Malone.jpg","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/County_Tyrone","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Seattle,_Washington","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860-1876)","/wiki/Philadelphia_Keystones","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860-1876)","/wiki/Diamond_State_Base_Ball_Club","/wiki/Washington_Olympics","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860-1876)","/wiki/Philadelphia_White_Stockings","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Philadelphia_White_Stockings","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860-1876)","/wiki/Philadelphia_Keystones","/wiki/Philadelphia_White_Stockings","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Philadelphia_Keystones","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/Athletic_of_Philadelphia","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Andy_Leonard","/wiki/Doug_Allison","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/Athletic_of_Philadelphia","/wiki/Philadelphia_White_Stockings","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Captain_(sports)","/wiki/Athletic_of_Philadelphia","/wiki/National_League","/wiki/Union_Association","/wiki/Philadelphia_Keystones","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Player-manager","/wiki/Seattle,_Washington","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_player%E2%80%93managers","/wiki/List_of_players_from_Ireland_in_Major_League_Baseball","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0786407794","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit&section=3","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/malonfe01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=malone001fer","http://retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Pmalof101.htm","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=13384684","/wiki/Find_a_Grave","/wiki/Template:1871_Philadelphia_Athletics","/wiki/Template_talk:1871_Philadelphia_Athletics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1871_Philadelphia_Athletics&action=edit","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(1860%E2%80%931876)","/wiki/National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","/wiki/George_Bechtel","/wiki/Ned_Cuthbert","/wiki/Wes_Fisler","/wiki/George_Heubel","/wiki/Dick_McBride","/wiki/Levi_Meyerle","/wiki/John_Radcliff","/wiki/Al_Reach","/wiki/Count_Sensenderfer","/wiki/Dick_McBride","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&oldid=544521027","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:19th-century_Irish_people","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_catchers","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_player%E2%80%93managers","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Keystones_(NABBP)_players","/wiki/Category:Washington_Olympics_(NABBP)_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Athletics_(NABBP)_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Athletics_(NA)_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_White_Stockings_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_White_Stockings_managers","/wiki/Category:Chicago_White_Stockings_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Athletics_(NL)_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Keystones_players","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_players_from_Ireland","/wiki/Category:19th-century_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:1842_births","/wiki/Category:1905_deaths","/wiki/Category:Minor_league_baseball_managers","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_(minor_league_baseball)_players","/wiki/Category:San_Francisco_Californias_players","/wiki/Category:Holyoke_(minor_league_baseball)_players","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Tyrone","/wiki/Category:Irish_sportspeople","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fergy+Malone&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fergy+Malone","/wiki/Fergy_Malone","/wiki/Talk:Fergy_Malone","#","/wiki/Fergy_Malone","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fergy_Malone&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/
