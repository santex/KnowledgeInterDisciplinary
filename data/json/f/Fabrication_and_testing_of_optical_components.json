{"cursor":"3524","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n 'Optical fabrication and testing' spans an enormous range of\nmanufacturing procedures and optical test configurations.\n\nThe manufacture of a conventional spherical lens typically begins with the\ngeneration of the optic's rough shape by grinding a glass blank. This can be done, for example, with ring tools. Next, the lens\nsurface is polished to its final form. Typically this is done by\nlappingârotating and rubbing the rough lens surface against a tool with the\ndesired surface shape, with a mixture of abrasives and fluid in between.\n\nDuring polishing, the lens may be tested to confirm that the desired shape is\nbeing produced, and to ensure that the final shape has the correct form to\nwithin the allowed precision. The deviation of an optical surface from the\ncorrect shape is typically expressed in fractions of a wavelength, for some\nconvenient wavelength of light (perhaps the wavelength at which the lens is to\nbe used, or a visible wavelength for which a source is available). Inexpensive\nlenses may have deviations of form as large as several wavelengths (Î», 2Î»,\netc.). More typical industrial lenses would have deviations no larger than a\nquarter wavelength (Î»/4). Precision lenses for use in applications such as\nlasers, interferometers, and holography have surfaces with a tenth of a\nwavelength (Î»/10) tolerance or better. In addition to surface profile, a lens\nmust meet requirements for surface quality (scratches, pits, specks, etc.) and\naccuracy of dimensions.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Fabrication_and_testing_of_optical_components","recorded":1362481727,"links":11,"instances":["glass","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Optics","Manufacturing","Glass engineering and science"],"headings":["Overview of techniques used in optical fabrication","Optical testing techniques","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"],["annealing","glass"]],"members":["annealing","lens"],"related":["Optics","Lens_(optics)","Polishing","Lapping","Wavelength","Laser","Interferometer","Holography","Batch_mixing","Pouring","Casting","Annealing_(glass)","Index_of_refraction","Diamond_shaping","Diamond_wheel","Diamond_edging","Loose_grit_fabrication","Polishing","Figuring","Single-point_diamond_turning","Glass_moulding","Precision_glass_moulding","Surface_profile_measurement","Foucault_knife-edge_test","Ronchi_test","Caustic_test","Null_corrector","Computer-generated_hologram","Interferometric_testing","Optical_lens_design","Vapor_polishing"]}
