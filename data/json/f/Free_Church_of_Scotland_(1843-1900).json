In 1900 the vast majority of the Free\nChurch of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to\nform the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself re-united with the Church\nof Scotland in 1929).\n\nA minority of the Free Church of Scotland remained outside the union of 1900,\nclaiming the title Free Church of Scotland for itself.
