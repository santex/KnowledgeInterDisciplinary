      "text" : "\n'Sexual reproduction' is a process that creates a new organism by combining the\ngenetic material of two organisms; it occurs both in\neukaryotes<ref></ref><ref></ref> and in prokaryotes.<ref name=\"Michod\"></ref> A\nkey similarity between bacterial sex (bacterial conjugation) and eukaryotic sex\nis that DNA originating from two different individuals (parents) join up so that\nhomologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by\nexchange of genetic information (a process called genetic recombination). After\nthe new recombinant chromosome is formed, it is passed on to progeny).\n\nOn the other hand, bacterial conjugation, a type of transfer of DNA between two\nbacteria, is often regarded as equivalent of sexual reproduction because the\nmechanics are similar.<ref></ref> This is because bacterial conjugation is\ncontrolled by plasmid genes that are adapted for spreading copies of the plasmid\nbetween bacteria. The infrequent integration of a plasmid into a host bacterial\nchromosome, and the subsequent transfer of a part of the host chromosome to\nanother cell do not appear to be bacterial adaptations.<ref name=\"Michod\"\n/><ref></ref>\n\nIn contrast, bacterial transformation can be regarded as a form of sex in\nbacteria.<ref name=\"Michod\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein1\"></ref> Bacterial\ntransformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and\nis clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. This process occurs\nnaturally in at least 40 bacterial species.<ref></ref> For a bacterium to\nbind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter\na special physiological state referred to as competence (see Natural\ncompetence). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have\nevolved from bacterial transformation.<ref name=\"Bernstein2\">Bernstein H,\nBernstein C, Michod RE.

ISBN 978-1-62100-756-2</ref>\n\nSexual reproduction is the primary method of reproduction for the vast majority\nof macroscopic organisms, including almost all animals and plants. The evolution\nof sexual reproduction is a major puzzle. The first fossilized evidence of\nsexual reproduction in organisms such as eukaryotes is in the Stenian period,\nabout 1 to 1.2 billion years ago.<ref name=dateref> {{cite journal |author=N.J.\nButtefield |year=2000 |title=Bangiomorpha pubescens n. gen., n. sp.:\nimplications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity, and the\nMesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes\n|url=http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/386\n|journal=Paleobiology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=386–404 |doi=10.1666/0094-\n8373(2000)026<0386:BPNGNS>2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> There are two main processes during\nsexual reproduction in eukaryotes: meiosis, involving the halving of the number\nof chromosomes; and fertilization, involving the fusion of two gametes and the\nrestoration of the original number of chromosomes. During meiosis, the\nchromosomes of each pair usually cross over to achieve homologous recombination.\nEvolutionary thought proposes several explanations for why sexual reproduction\ndeveloped and why it is maintained. These reasons include fighting the\naccumulation of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of adaptation to changing\nenvironments<ref name=Gray2012></ref> (see the red queen hypothesis), dealing\nwith competition (see the tangled bank hypothesis) or as an adaptation for\nrepairing DNA damage.<ref name=\"Michod\" /><ref name=\"Bernstein1\" /><ref\nname=\"Bernstein2 \"/> The maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained\nby theories that work at several different levels of selection, though some of\nthese models remain controversial. New models presented in recent years,\nhowever, suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly\nreproducing, complex organisms, exhibiting characteristics that depend on the\nspecific environment that the given species inhabit, and the particular survival\nstrategies that they employ.<ref></ref>\n",
