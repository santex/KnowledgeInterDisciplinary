Sir Francis Palmer Selleck was the son of\nChristopher and Emily Selleck, nÃ©e Latimer. Christopher Selleck was born at the\n'Royal Oak Inn' at Meavy in Devon. He emigrated to Australia before 1890 as he\nmarried Emily Latimer at Nathalia, Victoria in 1890.\n\nThere were two children of this marriage:\n1. Francis Palmer Selleck, born 20 August 1895 at Nathalia\n2. Spencer Revell Selleck, born 21 February 1899 at Nathalia.\n\n On 9 March 1915 Selleck enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force.\nPosted to the 24th Battalion, he served (from September) at Gallipoli as\nquartermaster sergeant. In May 1916 he was sent to the Western Front where he\nwas commissioned (September), appointed adjutant (September 1917), promoted\ncaptain (January 1918), mentioned in dispatches (May) and wounded in action\n(July). For his work between March and September 1918âmaking reconnaissances\nunder enemy fire and organizing the battalion's movementsâhe was awarded the\nMilitary Cross. His A.I.F. appointment ended on 23 April 1920. In 1923 he helped\nto form the Legacy Club of Melbourne, of which he was inaugural treasurer. He\nhas been credited with suggesting the name, 'Legacy'. At All Saints Church, St\nKilda, on 22 December 1923 he married with Anglican rites Mollie Constance Maud\nMiller. Australian\nDictionary of Biography\n\n In 1949 he was elected to the Melbourne City Council. He improved\nits management practices and chaired a committee which recommended ways to\nachieve economies and raise additional revenue. On 30 August 1954 he was elected\nLord Mayor. He held office for three, consecutive, one-year terms. The third\nterm was unexpected: councillors had intended that Sir Frank Beaurepaire would\nbe Lord Mayor during the Olympic Games, but he died in May 1956. Selleck\npresided over the redevelopment of the city centre, including the neglected\nsites of the Eastern and Western markets. Recognizing the potential of postwar\nMelbourne, he advocated increased loans as a means of providing municipal\ninfrastructure. He took advantage of the Olympic Games and the attendant\npublicity to promote his city.\n\nSelleck gained a reputation for directness and efficiency, characteristics which\nwere sometimes interpreted as irascibility by council staff. He was a self-made\nman, and his success had been earned. In 1956 he failed to win Liberal and\nCountry Party pre-selection for a seat in the Legislative Council. He was\nknighted that year and appointed KBE in 1957. \n\n'References'\n\nAustralian Dictionary of
