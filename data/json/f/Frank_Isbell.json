He played for the\nChicago Cubs in 1898 briefly, where he had 37 hits in 159 at bats (.233 batting\naverage). With the Cubs, he pitched and played outfield more than anything else.\nThirteen of his seventeen games pitched came with the Cubs. After not being seen\nin baseball for the next year, he showed up again in 1900 playing for the\nChicago White Sox as a full-time first baseman. The American League was not\nrecognized in the Majors until 1901. He played with them until 1909. He batted\nleft-handed, but threw right-handed.\n\nBorn in Delevan, New York, Isbell was nicknamed 'Bald Eagle' due to his receding\nhairline, something he was quite sensitive about. Isbell was a good enough\nhitter to earn a starting spot on some very good White Sox teams including the\npennant-winning 1901 team, managed by Clark Griffith, the 2nd place 1905 team\nled by Fielder Jones, and finally the 1906 World Series champion White Sox that\nincluded shortstop George Davis and pitchers Doc White and Ed Walsh. That team\nwas known as one of the worst hitting teams to ever win the World Series, with\nonly Davis and Isbell hitting above .260 (Davis hit .277, Isbell .279). He also\nset many other offensive World Series records that year, including doubles and\nextra base hits in a game. However, Isbell was better known for his outstanding\nspeed, even for that day-in-age. He never beat out his 1901 season when he had\n52 stolen bases and led the Majors, but he averaged 37 steals a year and ended\nout with 253 in his career.\n\nIn a 10-year career and 1119 games, he ended out with a .250 batting average\nwith 13 home runs and 455 RBIs. He had 1056 career hits in 4219 at bats. As a\npitcher, he went 4â7 with a 3.59 ERA.\n\nIsbell also became notable for being manager and owner of many teams in the\nWestern League. He died in Wichita, Kansas.\n","linknr":187,"url":"Frank_Isbell","recorded":1375076852,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Frank_Isbell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Isbell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Frank_Isbell_baseball_card.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Frank_Isbell_baseball_card.jpg/200px-Frank_Isbell_baseball_card.jpg","/wiki/First_Baseman","/wiki/Second_Baseman","/wiki/Delevan,_New_York","/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Stolen_bases","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/World_Series","/wiki/1906_World_Series","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/File:Play_at_first,_1906_World_Series.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Play_at_first%2C_1906_World_Series.jpg/300px-Play_at_first%2C_1906_World_Series.jpg","/wiki/File:Play_at_first,_1906_World_Series.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Second_baseman","/wiki/Outfielder","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Delevan,_New_York","/wiki/Nickname","/wiki/Baseball_manager","/wiki/Clark_Griffith","/wiki/Fielder_Jones","/wiki/1906_World_Series","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/George_Davis_(shortstop)","/wiki/Doc_White","/wiki/Ed_Walsh","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Extra_base_hit","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Western_League_(defunct_minor_league)","/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Isbell&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_leaders_in_career_stolen_bases","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Isbell&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/isbelfr01.shtml","/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/Topsy_Hartsel","/wiki/Template:1901_Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/Template_talk:1901_Chicago_White_Sox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1901_Chicago_White_Sox&action=edit","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Jimmy_Burke_(baseball)","/wiki/Nixey_Callahan","/wiki/Clark_Griffith","/wiki/Fred_Hartman","/wiki/Zaza_Harvey","/wiki/Dummy_Hoy","/wiki/Fielder_Jones","/wiki/Jack_Katoll","/wiki/Herm_McFarland","/wiki/Sam_Mertes","/wiki/Wiley_Piatt","/wiki/Roy_Patterson","/wiki/Frank_Shugart","/wiki/John_Skopec","/wiki/Joe_Sugden_(baseball)","/wiki/Billy_Sullivan_(baseball)","/wiki/Clark_Griffith","/wiki/1901_Chicago_White_Stockings_season","/wiki/Template:1906_Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/Template_talk:1906_Chicago_White_Sox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1906_Chicago_White_Sox&action=edit","/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox","/wiki/1906_World_Series","/wiki/Nick_Altrock","/wiki/George_Davis_(shortstop)","/wiki/Jiggs_Donahue","/wiki/Patsy_Dougherty","/wiki/Ed_Hahn","/wiki/Fielder_Jones","/wiki/Ed_McFarland","/wiki/Bill_O%27Neill_(baseball)","/wiki/Frank_Owen_(baseball)","/wiki/George_Rohe","/wiki/Billy_Sullivan_(baseball)","/wiki/Lee_Tannehill","/wiki/Babe_Towne","/wiki/Ed_Walsh","/wiki/Doc_White","/wiki/Fielder_Jones","/wiki/1906_Chicago_White_Sox_season","/wiki/Cubs%E2%80%93White_Sox_rivalry","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Delevan,_New_York","/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Isbell&oldid=501348181","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1875_births","/wiki/Category:1941_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_League_stolen_base_champions","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_second_basemen","/wiki/Category:19th-century_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:Chicago_Orphans_players","/wiki/Category:Chicago_White_Sox_players","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_New_York","/wiki/Category:Minor_league_baseball_managers","/wiki/Category:Wichita_Jobbers_players","/wiki/Cat
