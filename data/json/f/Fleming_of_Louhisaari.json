{"cursor":"5266","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Louhisaari' noble family, otherwise known as 'Fleming', is a Finnish family\nof medieval frÃ¤lse.\n\nIts first certainly known male ancestor, knight Peder Klasson (sir Peder\nFleming), is documented living yet in 1406. He came from Denmark to Sweden\nduring the early reign of king Eric XIII of Sweden and is buried in the\nRiddarholm Church, Stockholm. He was probably son of a Claus Fleming who between\n1331 and 1354 is mentioned as bailiff of Barth in the Pomeranian principality of\nRÃ¼gen (a Danish fief) and had in principle the same Coat of Arms. The name of\nthe family denotes some of its origin to Flanders. When having first settled in\nthe eastern part of Sweden (modern day Finland), they soon became assimilated\nwith the country, having married from among natives and grown into local\nsocietal activities. They inherited the manor of Louhisaari (in Swedish VillnÃ¤s)\nin Finland Proper (located in the modern day municipality of Masku).\n\nThe family was one of the most prominent in Finland at the end of Middle Ages.\n\nThe then head of the house, sir Lars Fleming (died 1562), governor of the\nStockholm Palace, was among the first ones to ever be created friherre in\nSweden, which took place in the coronation of Eric XIV of Sweden on 29 June\n1561. Baron Lars got the title Baron of Nynes (NynÃ¤s) from one of his maternally\ninherited manors. His male line went extinct on 5 January 1569.\n\nHis cousin, sir Klaus Fleming (died 1535-1597), member of the Privy Council of\nSweden, afterwards Lord High Admiral of Sweden, Lord High Constable of Sweden\n(marsk) and Governor General of Finland, was created on 2 August 1569 baron of\nthe barony of Vik. His male line went extinct in the Ãbo Bloodbath on 10\nNovember 1599.\n\nWhen the Swedish House of Knights was established, the family of Fleming of\nLouhisaari, noble since time immemorial, was registered there, under number 4 of\nuntitled nobility.\n\nThe 'Over-Governor', or ÃverstÃ¥thÃ¥llaren of Stockholm was the highest official\nfor the City between 1634 and 1967. The Office was instituted by the Instrument\nof Government of 1634,\n\nSir Klas or Claes Larsson Fleming (Flemingvaesnsjigirhgarg) (1592â1644), was an\nadmiral and the first Over-Governor of Stockholm (1634â1644) after the office\nwas instituted by the Instrument of Government of 1634. His children were\nelevated to the friherre rank on 26 March 1651 by queen Christina of Sweden,\nwith the title Baron of Liebelitz, due to service and accomplishments of the\nlate father. This lineage continues to present day.\n\nSir Eric Fleming (1616â79), provincial governor, president, chamber\ncouncillor, afterwards Marshal of Nobility ([[lantmarskalk]]en) was created\nBaron of Lais on 12 May 1654 by queen Christina of Sweden. His male line went\nextinct 29 July 1786.\n\nWidow and children of Baron Claes Fleming af Liebelitz (1649â85), Marshal of\nNobility, Lord High Treasurer of Sweden, president, a grandson of late sir Claes\nthe admiral, were elevated on 10 December 1687 by king Charles XI of Sweden to\nthe comital rank with the title Count to all male-line descendants. Their male\nline went extinct on 15 November 1729.\n\nBaron Claes Adolf Fleming (1771â1831), councillor of state, Lord High Constable\nof Sweden was created count on 11 May 1818, but he did not leave any surviving\nmale descendants.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Fleming_of_Louhisaari","recorded":1375088132,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_von_Fleming.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Coat_of_Arms_of_von_Fleming.jpg/200px-Coat_of_Arms_of_von_Fleming.jpg","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_von_Fleming.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Noble_family","/wiki/Finnish_people","/wiki/Medieval","/wiki/Fr%C3%A4lse","/wiki/Eric_XIII_of_Sweden","/wiki/Riddarholmskyrkan","/wiki/Stockholm","/w/index.php?title=Claus_Fleming_(bailiff)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bailiff","/wiki/Barth,_Germany","/wiki/Duchy_of_Pomerania","/wiki/Principality_of_R%C3%BCgen","/wiki/Flanders","/w/index.php?title=Louhisaari&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Finland_Proper_(historical_province)","/wiki/Masku","/w/index.php?title=Lars_Fleming&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Stockholm_Palace","/wiki/Friherre","/wiki/Coronation","/wiki/Eric_XIV_of_Sweden","/wiki/Klaus_Fleming","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Sweden","/wiki/Lord_High_Admiral_of_Sweden","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_Sweden","/wiki/Governor_General_of_Finland","/w/index.php?title=Barony_of_Vik&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/%C3%85bo_Bloodbath","/wiki/Swedish_House_of_Knights","/wiki/Stockholm","/wiki/Cities_of_Sweden","/wiki/Instrument_of_Government_(1634)","/wiki/Claes_Larsson_Fleming","/wiki/Over-Governor_of_Stockholm","/wiki/Instrument_of_Government_(1634)","/wiki/Christina_of_Sweden","/w/index.php?title=Baron_of_Liebelitz&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lord_Marshal_(Sweden)","/wiki/Lantmarskalk","/w/index.php?title=Baron_of_Lais&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Christina_of_Sweden","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer_of_Sweden","/wiki/Charles_XI_of_Sweden","/wiki/Comital","/wiki/Count","/wiki/Lord_High_Constable_of_Sweden","#Description_of_the_Coat_of_Arms","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Swedish-speaking_Finns","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Swedish_House_of_Lords","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit&section=4","http://www.nba.fi/sv/villnas_agarna","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&oldid=563009841","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Medieval_Finland","/wiki/Category:People_of_medieval_Finland","/wiki/Category:Finnish_noble_families","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_July_2013","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2006","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fleming+of+Louhisaari&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fleming+of+Louhisaari","/wiki/Fleming_of_Louhisaari","/wiki/Talk:Fleming_of_Louhisaari","#","/wiki/Fleming_of_Louhisaari","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fleming_of_Louhisaari&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fleming_of_Louhisaari","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Fleming_of_Louhisaari","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload
