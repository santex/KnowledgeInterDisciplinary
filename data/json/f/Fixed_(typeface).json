It is a set of independent bitmap fonts whichâapart\nfrom all being sans-serif fontsâcannot be described as belonging to a single\nfont family. The misc-fixed fonts were the first fonts available for the X\nWindow System. Their individual origin is not attributed, but it is likely that\nmany of them were created in the early or mid 1980s as part of MIT's Project\nAthena, or at its industrial partner, DEC. The misc-fixed fonts are available\nunder a \"public domain â share and enjoy\" licence.\n\nThe individual fonts in the collection have a short name that matches their\nrespective pixel dimensions, plus a letter that indicates a bold or oblique\nvariant. They can also be accessed using their (much longer) X Logical Font\nDescription string:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|  5x7 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--7-70-75-75-C-50-ISO10646-1 - 5x8 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--8-80-75-75-C-50-ISO10646-\n|  1 -| 6x9 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--9-90-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1 - 6x10 ||\n|  -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--10-100-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1 - 6x12 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Semicondensed--12-110-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-\n|  1 - 6x13 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1\n|  - 6x13B || -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1 -\n|  6x13O || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1 -\n|  7x13 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-1 - 7x13B ||\n|  -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-1 - 7x13O || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-\n|  1 - 7x14 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--14-130-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-1 - 7x14B\n|  || -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--14-130-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-1 - 8x13 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-80-ISO10646-\n|  1 - 8x13B || -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-80-ISO10646-1 - 8x13O\n|  || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-80-ISO10646-1 - 9x15 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--15-140-75-75-C-90-ISO10646-\n|  1 - 9x15B || -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--15-140-75-75-C-90-ISO10646-1 - 9x18\n|  || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--18-120-100-100-C-90-ISO10646-1 - 9x18B || -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--18-120-100-100-C-90-ISO10646-\n|  1 - 10x20 || -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--20-200-75-75-C-100-ISO10646-1 -\n|  12x13ja|| -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ja-13-120-75-75-C-120-ISO10646-1 -\n|  18x18ja|| -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ja-18-120-100-100-C-180-ISO10646-1 -\n|  18x18ko|| -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ko-18-120-100-100-C-180-ISO10646-1 }\n\nThe \"6x13\" font is usually also available under the alias \"fixed\", a font name\nthat is expected to be available on every X server.\n\nThe fonts originally covered only the ASCII repertoire, and were in the early\n1990s extended to cover all characters in ISO 8859-1. In 1997, Markus Kuhn\ninitiated and headed a project to extend the misc-fixed fonts to as large a\nsubset of Unicode/ISO 10646 as is feasible for each of the available font sizes.\nThis project's goal was to get GNU/Linux developers interested in abandoning the\n1990s dominant ISO 8859-1 encoding, in favour of using UTF-8 instead, which\nhappened indeed within a few years. Thanks to this effort, all the misc fixed\nfonts now cover the characters found in\n\n* ISO 8859 parts 1-5, 7-10, 13-15 (i.e., all parts except Arabic and Thai)\n* ISO 6937 and the CEN MES-1 European Unicode Subset\n* IBM/Microsoft code pages CP 437, 850, 1251, 1252, and many others\n* Microsoft/Adobe Systems Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)\n* KOI8-R\n* DEC VT100 graphics symbols\n\nThe 6x13, 8x13, 9x15, 9x18, and 10x20 fonts cover a much larger repertoire,\nthat covers in addition the comprehensive CEN MES-3A European Unicode 3.2\nsubset, the International Phonetic Alphabet, Armenian, Georgian, Thai, Yiddish,\nall Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic characters, all mathematical symbols (including\nthe entire TeX repertoire), APL, Braille, Runes, and much more. 9x15 and 10x20\nalso cover Ethiopic.\n\nThe misc-fixed fonts have been much less commonly used since support for\nscalable outline font formats such as Type 1, TrueType and OpenType has become\navailable for X. However, they are still commonly used with terminal emulators,\nsuch as xterm, and as a fallback font for the many Unicode characters not yet\nfound in common outline fonts.\n\nThe fonts are distributed in the BDF format and are currently maintained by\nMarkus Kuhn.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Fixed_(typeface)","recorded":1362543704,"links":11,"instances":["computer_scientist","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monospaced typefaces","X Window System","1984 introductions"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Fixed_sample.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["markus_kuhn","computer_scientist"],["apl","programming_language"],["markus_kuhn","computer_scientist"],["markus_kuhn","computer_scientist"]],"members":["markus_kuhn","apl"],"related":["Monospaced_font","Sans-serif","Bitmap","Typeface","X_Window_System","X_Window_System","MIT","Project_Athena","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","Bold","Italic_type","X_logical_font_description","ASCII","ISO_8859-1","Markus_Kuhn_(computer_scientist)","Unicode","ISO_10646","ISO_8859-1","UTF-8","ISO_8859","ISO_6937","IBM","Microsoft","Code_page_437","Microsoft","Adobe_Systems","Windows_Glyph_List_4","KOI8-R","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","VT100","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","Armenian_alphabet","Georgian_alphabet","Thai_alphabet","Yiddish","Latin_alphabet","Greek_alphabet","Cyrillic","Mathematical_symbols","TeX","APL_(programming_language)","Braille","Runes","Ethiopic_alphabet","PostScript","TrueType","OpenType","Terminal_emulator","Xterm","Glyph_Bitmap_Distribution_Format","Markus_Kuhn_(computer_scientist)","Markus_Kuhn_(computer_scientist)"]}
