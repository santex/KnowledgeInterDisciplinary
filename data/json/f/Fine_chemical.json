{"cursor":"98829","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 'Fine chemicals' are\ncomplex, single, pure chemical substances. They are produced in limited volumes\n( $10/kg) according to\nexacting specifications, mainly by traditional organic synthesis in multipurpose\nplants. Biotechnical processes are gaining ground. The global production value\nis about $85 billion. Fine chemicals are used as starting materials for\nspecialty chemicals, particularly pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and\nagrochemicals. Custom manufacturing for the life science industry plays a big\nrole; however, a significant portion of the fine chemicals total production\nvolume is manufactured in house by large users. The industry is fragmented and\nextends from small, privately owned companies to divisions of big, diversified\nchemical enterprises. The term \"fine chemicals\" is used in distinction to \"heavy\nchemicals\", which are produced and handled in large lots and are often in a\ncrude state.\n\nSince their inception in the late 1970s, fine chemicals have become an important\npart of the chemical universe. The total production value of $85 billion is\nsplit about 60 / 40 among in-house production by the main consumers, the life\nscience industry, on the one hand, and the fine chemicals industry on the other\nhand. The latter pursues both a âsupply pushâ strategy, whereby standard\nproducts are developed in-house and offered ubiquitously, and a âdemand pullâ\nstrategy, whereby products or services determined by the customer are provided\nexclusively on a âone customer / one supplierâ basis. The products are mainly\nused as building blocks for proprietary products. The hardware of the top tier\nfine chemical companies has become almost identical. The design, lay-out and\nequipment of the plants and laboratories has become practically the same all\nover the world. Most chemical reactions performed go back to the glorious days\nof the dyestuff industry. Numerous regulations determine the way labs and plants\nhave to be operated, thereby contributing to the uniformity.\n","linknr":649,"url":"Fine_chemical","recorded":1362504722,"links":21,"instances":["company","chemistry","chemistry","herbicide","monsanto_brand","company","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology","Chemical
