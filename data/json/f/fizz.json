When the pressure\nis reduced, the carbon dioxide is released from the solution as small bubbles,\nwhich causes the solution to become effervescent, or \"fizz\". An example of\ncarbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water, resulting in\ncarbonated water. Carbonated water is a a primary component of soft drinks.\n",
