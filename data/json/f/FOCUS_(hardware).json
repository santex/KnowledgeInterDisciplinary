{"cursor":"1778","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Hewlett-Packard 'FOCUS' microprocessor, launched in 1982, was the first\ncommercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market. At\nthis time, all 32-bit competitors (DEC, IBM, Prime Computer, etc.) used multi-\nchip bit-slice-CPU designs. The FOCUS architecture (Focus CPU, Focus I/O\nprocessor (IOP), Focus memory controller (MMU), 16Kx8 dynamic RAM, and a timer)\nwas used in the Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 Series 500 workstations and servers\n(originally launched as the HP 9020 and also, unofficially, called HP 9000\nSeries 600). It was a stack architecture, with over 220 instructions (some 32\nbits wide, some 16 bits wide), a segmented memory model, and no general purpose\nprogrammer-visible registers. The design of the FOCUS CPU was richly inspired by\nthe custom silicon on sapphire (SOS) chip design, HP used in their 16-bit HP\n3000 series machines.\n\nBecause of the high density of HP's NMOS-III IC process, heat dissipation was a\nproblem. Therefore the chips were mounted on special printed circuit boards,\nwith a ~1Â mm copper sheet at its core, called \"finstrates\".\n","linknr":102,"url":"FOCUS_(hardware)","recorded":1362667596,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["HP microprocessors"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Microelectronics_stub.svg/40px-Microelectronics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Hewlett-Packard","Microprocessor","32-bit","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","IBM","Prime_Computer","Bit_slicing","HP_9000","Stack_architecture","Processor_register","Silicon_on_sapphire","HP_3000","NMOS_logic_","Printed_circuit_board","Insulated_metal_substrate_"]}
