Flappers were seen as brash\nfor wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner,\nsmoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual\nnorms.<ref></ref> Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the\nRoaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic\ncultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export\nof American jazz culture to Europe.\n",
