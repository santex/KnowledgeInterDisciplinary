{"cursor":"1854","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ferrous' (Fe 2+ ), in chemistry, indicates a divalent iron compound\n(+2 oxidation state), as opposed to ferric, which indicates a trivalent iron\ncompound (+3 oxidation state). . This usage has mostly been\ndeprecated, with current IUPAC nomenclature with names containing the oxidation\nstate in bracketed roman numerals instead, such as iron (III) oxide for\nFe 2O 3.\n\nOutside of chemistry, ferrous is an adjective used to indicate the presence of\niron. The word is derived from the Latin word ferrum\n(\"iron\"). . Ferrous metals include steel and pig iron (with a carbon\ncontent of a few percent) and alloys of iron with other metals (such as\nstainless steel).\n\nThe term [[non-ferrous]] is used to indicate metals other than iron and alloys\nthat do not contain an appreciable amount of iron. .\n","linknr":123,"url":"Ferrous","recorded":1362482245,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Iron"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_oxide"],["iron(ii_chloride"],["iron(ii_bromide"]],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Divalent","Iron","Oxidation_state","Ferric","Trivalent","IUPAC","Latin","Steel","Pig_iron","Alloy","Metal","Ferric","Ferromagnetism","Steelmaking","Ferrous_metal_recycling","Iron(II)_oxide","Iron(II)_chloride","Iron(II)_bromide"]}
