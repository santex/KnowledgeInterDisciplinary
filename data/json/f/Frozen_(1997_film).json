The film was\noriginally shot in 1994, but was banned by Chinese authorities and had to be\nsmuggled out of the country. Perhaps as a result of this long gestation time\nbetween production and release, various sources treat the film as anything from\na 1994 to a 1997 film. Moreover, Wang was operating under a blacklisting\nfrom the Chinese Film Bureau that was imposed after his previous film, [[The\nDays (film)|The Days]], was screened internationally without government\napproval. Berry, Michael (2005). \"Wang Xiaoshuai: Banned in China\"\nin [http://books.google.com/books?id=0PF21mv1vF0C Speaking in Images: Interviews\nWith Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers], p. 168. ISBN 0-231-13330-8. Google Book\nSearch. Retrieved 2008-10-05. As such, Wang was forced to use the\npseudonym \"Wu Ming\" (literally \"Anonymous\") while making this film.\n\nThe film, supposedly based on a true story, follows a young performance artist,\nQi Lei, who attempts to create a masterpiece based around the theme of death.\nAfter two \"acts\" where he simulates death, he decides that his final act will be\na true suicide through hypothermia.\n\nFrozen was originally entitled The Great Game (). This was meant to reflect the\nattitude of both the film and the artist portrayed within it to treat death and\nsuicide as a game or a manipulation.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Frozen_(1997_film)","recorded":1363125325,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Frozen_(1997_film)_DVD_boxart.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Frozen_%281997_film%29_DVD_boxart.jpg/220px-Frozen_%281997_film%29_DVD_boxart.jpg","/wiki/Wang_Xiaoshuai","/w/index.php?title=Pang_Ming&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wang_Xiaoshuai","/wiki/Jia_Hongsheng","/w/index.php?title=Ma_Xiaoqing&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Yang_Shu","/w/index.php?title=International_Film_Circuit,_Inc.&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Fox_Lorber&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cinema_of_China","/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese","/wiki/Chinese_language","/wiki/Pinyin","/wiki/Chinese_films_of_the_1990s","/wiki/Cinema_of_China","/wiki/Wang_Xiaoshuai","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Chinese_Film_Bureau","/wiki/The_Days_(film)","#cite_note-B168-2","/wiki/Performance_art","/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters","/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters","/wiki/Pinyin","#cite_note-B170-3","#Casting","#Production","#DVD_release","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-B169-4","/wiki/Jia_Hongsheng","/wiki/Lou_Ye","/wiki/Weekend_Lover","/wiki/Suzhou_River_(film)","#cite_note-B169-4","#cite_note-B169-4","/w/index.php?title=Ma_Xiaoqing&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-B169-4","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-B170-3","#cite_note-B170-3","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/DVD","/w/index.php?title=Fox_Lorber&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-DVD-5","#cite_note-DVD-5","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-B168_2-0","http://books.google.com/books?id=0PF21mv1vF0C","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0231133308","#cite_ref-B170_3-0","#cite_ref-B170_3-1","#cite_ref-B170_3-2","#cite_ref-B169_4-0","#cite_ref-B169_4-1","#cite_ref-B169_4-2","#cite_ref-B169_4-3","#cite_ref-DVD_5-0","#cite_ref-DVD_5-1","http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/154666/Frozen/dvd","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/154666/Frozen/dvd","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125279/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/v154666","/wiki/AllRovi","http://www.dianying.com/en/title/jdh1997","http://www.internationalfilmcircuit.com/catalog/frozen.html","/wiki/Template:Wang_Xiaoshuai","/wiki/Template_talk:Wang_Xiaoshuai","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Wang_Xiaoshuai&action=edit","/wiki/Wang_Xiaoshuai","/wiki/The_Days_(film)","/wiki/So_Close_to_Paradise","/wiki/The_House_(1999_film)","/wiki/Beijing_Bicycle","/wiki/Drifters_(2003_film)","/wiki/Shanghai_Dreams","/wiki/In_Love_We_Trust","/wiki/Chongqing_Blues","/wiki/11_Flowers","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&oldid=518926116","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1997_films","/wiki/Category:Chinese_films","/wiki/Category:1990s_drama_films","/wiki/Category:Mandarin-language_films","/wiki/Category:Films_set_in_Beijing","/wiki/Category:Films_directed_by_Wang_Xiaoshuai","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Chinese_language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_simplified_Chinese_language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_traditional_Chinese_language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frozen+%281997+film%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frozen+%281997+film%29","/wiki/Frozen_(1997_film)","/wiki/Talk:Frozen_(1997_film)","#","/wiki/Frozen_(1997_film)","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frozen_(1997_film)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Conte
