He was one of the forerunners of\ncognitive psychology. However, while Bartlett considered his own work on\ncognitive psychology, especially remembering, to be a study in social psychology\nmore recent developments have individualised his\nconcepts. *\n\nOne study involved the cognitive and social processes of remembering. He would\nrecite short fables which comprised a sequence of events which were subtly\nillogical, then ask subjects to recall as much of it as possible. Most people\nhad difficulty recalling the story exactly, especially where the elements failed\nto fit into their own schemata.\n\nThe U.K. Ergonomics Society awards a Bartlett medal in his honour, and the\nExperimental Psychology Society holds an annual Bartlett Lecture.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Frederic_Bartlett","recorded":1362670567,"links":33,"instances":["uk","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/research/emotion/cemhp/documents/Dalgleish_Bartlett_commentary_BJP_2009.pdf","http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/research/emotion/cemhp/documents/Dalgleish_Bartlett_commentary_BJP_2009.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf"],"categories":["1886 births","1969 deaths","British psychologists","Experimental psychologists","Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge","Royal Medal winners","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences","Fellows of the Royal Society","Presenters of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures","Knights Bachelor","Presidents of the British Psychological Society"],"headings":["Biography","Honours","Books","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["schema","psychology"],["schema","psychology"],["medical_research_council","uk"],["schema","psychology"]],"members":["medical_research_council","schema"],"related":["United_Kingdom","Psychology","University_of_Cambridge","Memory","Schema_(psychology)","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","United_Kingdom","Psychologist","Professor","Experimental_psychology","University_of_Cambridge","Cognitive_psychology","Schema_(psychology)","United_Kingdom","Ergonomics_Society","Experimental_Psychology_Society","St_John's_College,_Cambridge","Kenneth_Craik","Medical_Research_Council_(UK)","Cognition_and_Brain_Sciences_Unit","Royal_Society","Psychology","Knight","Royal_Air_Force","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Schema_(psychology)","Royal_Institution_Christmas_Lectures","United_Kingdom","Ergonomics_Society","Experimental_Psychology_Society"]}
