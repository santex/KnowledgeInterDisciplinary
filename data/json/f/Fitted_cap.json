{"cursor":"7137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n cap]] A 'baseball cap' is a type of soft cap with a rounded crown and a stiff\n peak projecting in front. The front of the cap typically contains designs or\n logos of sports teams (namely baseball teams, or names of relevant companies,\n when used as a commercial marketing technique). The back of the cap may be\n \"fitted\" to the wearer's head size or it may have a plastic, Velcro, or elastic\n adjuster so that it can be quickly adjusted to fit different wearers.\n\nThe baseball cap is a part of the traditional baseball uniform worn by players,\nwith the brim pointing forward to shield the eyes from the sun. The cap is often\nseen in everyday casual wear.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Fitted_cap","recorded":1362566516,"links":34,"instances":["hat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps","Baseball equipment","Sports clothing"],"headings":["History","Design","Athletic use","Professional use","Use in advertising","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_baseball_cap.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/1888_Reds.jpg/250px-1888_Reds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Lou_Gehrig_1925.jpg/250px-Lou_Gehrig_1925.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/US_Navy_040527-N-4104L-001_Guided_missile_destroyer_USS_Russell_%28DDG_59%29%2C_Commanding_Officer%2C_Cmdr._William_Kearns_III%2C_communicates_with_his_combat_information_center.jpg/250px-thumbnail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["snapback","hat"]],"members":["snapback"],"related":["Cap","Logos","Baseball","Plastic","Velcro","Elastomer","Baseball_uniform","Mascot","Button","Paperboard","Wool","Polyester","Embroidery","Reebok","Nike,_Inc.","Carhartt","Cotton","Golf","United_States_Navy","United_States_Coast_Guard","United_States","Submarine","United_States_Army","Parachute_rigger","Peaked_cap","Campaign_hat","Sheriffs_in_the_United_States","West_Coast_of_the_United_States","San_Francisco_Police_Department","Slovenia","Security","SWAT","Metropolitan_Police","Specialist_Firearms_Command","United_Kingdom","Trucker_cap","Baseball_clothing_and_equipment","Baseball_uniform","Flat_cap","Cricket_cap","Snapback_(hat)","Trucker_hat","59Fifty","Major_League_Baseball","Reebok","NFL"]}
