      "text" : "\n\n's Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, USA.]] , a pedestrian footbridge\nacross the Yarra River]] , Yemen]] s on each corner of intersection four-way in\nTokyo]] A 'footbridge' or 'pedestrian bridge' is a bridge designed for\npedestrians and in some cases cyclists, animal traffic and horse riders, rather\nthan vehicular traffic. Footbridges complement the landscape and can be used\ndecoratively to visually link two distinct areas or to signal a transaction. In\nmany developed countries, footbridges are both functional and can be beautiful\nworks of art and sculpture. For poor rural communities in the developing world,\na footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and\nmarkets, which would otherwise be unreachable when rivers are too high to cross.\nSimple suspension bridge designs have been developed to be sustainable and\neasily constructible in such rural areas using only local materials and labor.\n\nAn enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a skyway.\nBridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as\ngreenbridges and form an important part of sustainable transport movement\ntowards more sustainable cities. Footbridges are often situated to allow\npedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads\nto necessitate a road bridge. They are also located across roads to let\npedestrians cross safely without slowing down the traffic. The latter is a type\nof pedestrian separation structure, examples of which are particularly found\nnear schools, to help prevent children running in front of moving cars.\n\nSmall footbridges can also be used for a technical effect in ornamental gardens.\n\nTypes footbridges include:\n* Simple suspension bridge\n* Clapper bridge\n* Moon bridge\n* Step-stone bridge\n* Zig-zag bridge\n* Plank\n* Boardwalk\n* Joisted\n* Simple truss\n\nThe residential-scale footbridges all span a short distance and can be used for\na broad range of applications. Complicated engineering is not needed and the\nfootbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.<ref\nname=\"Jeswald\">Jeswald, P. (2005). How to build paths, steps & Footbridges.\nNorth Adams, MA: Storey Publishing.</ref>\n\nDifferent types of design footbridges include:\n* Timber footbridges\n* Steel footbridges\n* Concrete footbridges\n\n is a footbridge and also a swing bridge in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires.]]\n\n is a concealed box girder beam bridge in Millennium Park with sculptural\n qualities.]]\n\nFootbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges;\nparticularly suspension bridges and beam bridges. Some former road bridges have\nhad their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian\nbridges; examples in the UK include The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, Shropshire,\nthe Old Bridge at Pontypridd and Windsor Bridge at Windsor, Berkshire.\n\nMost footbridges are equipped with guard rails to reduce the risk of pedestrians\nfalling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a\nfence or other such barrier to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing\nprojectiles onto the traffic below.\n",
