{"cursor":"3333","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Fanny Churberg' (12 December 1845 Vaasa - 10 May 1892 Helsinki) was a Finnish\npainter and one of the great masters of her time.\n\nHer father, Matias Churberg, was a doctor from a family of farmers and her\nmother Maria was the daughter of the vicar in Liperi parish, Nils Johan\nPerander. Fanny was the third of seven children. Four of her siblings died when\nthey were young and so Fanny grew up with her two older brothers Waldemar and\nTorsten. Fanny was proud of her Ostrobothnian family and heritage and was\nplanning along with her brothers on changing the surname to Kuurila according to\nthe family's old estate. They never got around to it though.\n\nWhen Fanny was twelve her mother died and she had to take on large parts of the\nresponsibility of being the matron of the house. Later on she got sent to a\ngirls' school in Porvoo, but she returned to Vaasa when she was 17â18 years old.\nWhen she was 20 her father died. Fanny cared for him day and night during the\nlast months of his life. After her father's death she and her brothers moved to\nHelsinki where they lived with their aunt.\n\n\n\nShe started her artistic training in Helsinki in 1865 with private lessons from\nAlexandra Frosterus-SÃ¥ltin, Emma GyldÃ©n and Berndt Adolf Lindholm. Her studies\ncontinued in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, but she always returned to Finland to paint\nduring the summer. She was also one of the first Finnish painters to study in\nParis, France. Although Churberg remained to a large extent within the\nconventions of the DÃ¼sseldorf school of painting, she openly expressed her\nenthusiasm for the countryside and its dramatic situations, relying above all on\ncolour and a fast brush technique to do so. The charged quality of her work\ndiffered sharply from that of her contemporaries, as did her subjects, for\nexample the tense atmosphere before a thunderstorm in the open country or the\ndeep, swampy heart of the forest.\n\nFanny Churberg's career ended suddenly in 1880. Her health was weaker and she\ntook care of her brother Torsten who was suffering from tuberculosis. Torsten's\ndeath in 1882 made her quite lonely and her will to live lessened as did her\nenergy. The other brother Waldemar, who she used to be very close to, had\nmarried in 1877. The reason for ending her career might also have been the harsh\ncriticism she had met before, but she never withdrew completely from the art\ncircles. She did not however paint anymore after 1880, not even to her own\namusement, but during her career she had still managed to paint over 300\npaintings.\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Churberg, Fanny
