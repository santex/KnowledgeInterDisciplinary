Boas,\n2004, p. 291 (photo of the graveyard marker of Franz and Marie Boas, Dale\nCemetery, Ossining, N.Y.) was a German-American anthropologist and a\npioneer of modern anthropology who has been called the \"Father of American\nAnthropology\" Holloway, M. (1997) The Paradoxical Legacy of Franz Boas -\nfather of American anthropology. Natural History. November 1997.[http://findart-\nicles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_10_106/ai_53479059] Stocking.

(2003) The Blank Slate. p. 22 Like many\nsuch pioneers, he trained in other disciplines; he received his doctorate in\nphysics, and did post-doctoral work in geography. He applied the scientific\nmethod to the study of human cultures and societies; previously this discipline\nwas based on the formulation of grand theories around anecdotal\nknowledge. [http://www.nndb.com/people/861/000097570/ Franz Boas ]\n\nBoas once summed up his approach to anthropology and folklore by saying: \"In the\ncourse of time I became convinced that a materialistic point of view, for a\nphysicist a very real one, was untenable. This gave me a new point of view and I\nrecognized the importance of studying the interaction between the organic and\ninorganic, above all the relation between the life of a people and their\nphysical environment.\" Zumwalt, Rosemary LÃ©vy \"American Folklore\nScholarship: A Dialogue of Dissent.\" Ed.
