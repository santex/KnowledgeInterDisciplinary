Aristotle also discusses the four causes in his Physics,\nBook B, chapter 3.</ref>\n* A change or movement's 'material cause' is the aspect of the change or\n  movement which is determined by the material which the moving or changing\n  things are made of. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might\n  be bronze or marble.\n* A change or movement's 'formal cause' is a change or movement caused by the\n  arrangement, shape or appearance of the thing changing or moving. Aristotle\n  says for example that the ratio 2:1, and number in general, is the cause of\n  the octave.\n* A change or movement's 'efficient' or 'moving cause' refers to things apart\n  from the thing being changed or moved, which interact so as to be an agency of\n  the change or movement. For example, the efficient cause of a table is a\n  carpenter, or a person working as one, and according to Aristotle the\n  efficient cause of a boy is a father.\n* An event's 'final cause' is the aim or purpose being served by it. That for\n  the sake of which a thing is what it is. For a seed, it might be an adult\n  plant. For a sailboat, it might be sailing. For a ball at the top of a ramp,\n  it might be coming to rest at the bottom.\n",
