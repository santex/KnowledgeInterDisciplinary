Unlike rain and snow mixed, ice pellets, or hail, freezing\nrain is made entirely of liquid droplets. The raindrops become supercooled while\npassing through a sub-freezing layer of air many hundreds of feet above the\nsurface, and then freeze upon impact with any object they\nencounter. Glossary of Meteorology.\n[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=f&p=39 F.] Retrieved on 2008-02-\n17. The resulting ice, called glaze, can accumulate to a thickness of\nseveral centimeters. The METAR code for freezing rain is 'FZRA'.\n\nA storm that produces a significant thickness of glaze ice from freezing rain is\noften referred to as an ice storm. Freezing rain is notorious for causing travel\nproblems on roadways, breaking tree limbs, and downing power lines. It is also\nknown for being extremely dangerous to aircraft since the ice can effectively\n'remould' the shape of the airfoil and flight control surfaces. (See atmospheric\nicing.)
