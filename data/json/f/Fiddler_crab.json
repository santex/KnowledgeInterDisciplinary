For other use, see [[UCA]].\nA 'fiddler crab', sometimes known as a calling crab, may be any of approximately\n100 species of semi-terrestrial marine crabs which make up the genus\n'Uca'. As members of the family Ocypodidae, fiddler crabs are most\nclosely related to the ghost crabs of the genus [[Ghost crab|Ocypode]]. This\nentire group is composed of small crabs â the largest being slightly over two\ninches across. Fiddler crabs are found along sea beaches and brackish inter-\ntidal mud flats, lagoons and swamps.\n\nLike all crabs, fiddler crabs shed their shells as they grow. If they have\nlost legs or claws during their present growth cycle, a new one will be\npresent when they molt. If the large fiddle claw is lost, males will develop\none on the opposite side after their next molt. Newly molted crabs are very\nvulnerable because of their soft shells. They are reclusive and hide until the\nnew shell hardens.\n","linknr":303,"url":"Fiddler_crab","recorded":1362672958,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rosenberg/Pubs/JCrustBiol2001v21p839.pdf","http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rosenberg/Pubs/JCrustBiol2001v21p839.pdf","http://richard.eriophora.com.au/pubs/pdf/HowHemmiZeilPeters-07.pdf","http://richard.eriophora.com.au/pubs/pdf/HowHemmiZeilPeters-07.pdf","http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s17/s17rbz.pdf","http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s17/s17rbz.pdf","http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/z02337p062f.pdf","http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/z02337p062f.pdf"],"categories":["Ocypodoidea","Pet crustaceans"],"headings":["Ecology","Life cycle","Subgenera and species","Captivity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Fiddler_crab.jpg/220px-Fiddler_crab.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Uca_perplexa_male_waving.gif/220px-Uca_perplexa_male_waving.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Fiddler_crab_anatomy-en.svg/400px-Fiddler_crab_anatomy-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Boca-cava-terra.jpg/220px-Boca-cava-terra.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Animal","Arthropod","Crustacean","Malacostraca","Decapoda","Crab","Ocypodidae","William_Elford_Leach","Crab","Ocypodidae","Ghost_crab","Mangrove","Beach","West_Africa","Atlantic_Ocean","Pacific_Ocean","Indo-Pacific","Detritivore","Alga","Microbe","Fungus","Detritus","Plankton","Signalling_theory","Species","Subgenera","Declawing_of_crabs"]}
