White\n would classify the accompaniment as motivic material since it was, \"derived\n from an important motive stated earlier.\" ]]\n\nA musical 'figure' or 'figuration' is the shortest idea in music, a short\nsuccession of notes, often recurring. It may have melodic pitch, harmonic\nprogression and rhythmic (duration). The 1964 Grove's Dictionary (1964).\nGrove's Dictionary. cited in Scruton, Roger (1997). defines the figure as\n\"the exact counterpart of the German 'motiv' and the French 'motif'\": it\nproduces a \"single complete and distinct impression\".

In\nhearing a phrase as a figure, rather than a motif, we are at the same time\nplacing it in the background, even if it is...strong and melodious.\"\n\nA phrase originally presented or heard as a motif may become a figure which\naccompanies another melody, such as in the second movement of Claude Debussy's\nString Quartet. It is perhaps best to view a figure as a motif when it has\nspecial importance in a piece. According to White, motives are, \"significant in\nthe structure of the work,\" while figures or figurations are not and, \"may often\noccur in accompaniment passages or in transitional or connective material\ndesigned to link two sections together,\" with the former being more common.\n\nMinimalist music may be constructed entirely from figures. Roger\nScruton Scruton (1997), 63. describes music by Philip Glass such as\n[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]] as \"nothing but figures...endless daisy-chains\". A\nbasic figure is known as a riff in American popular music.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Figure_(music)","recorded":1362371285,"links":26,"instances":["schubert","debussy","music","music","music","decorative","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Accompaniment","Formal sections in music analysis","Rhythm","Harmony","Melody"],"headings":["See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Schubert_-_Octet%2C_Op._166_figuration.png/400px-Schubert_-_Octet%2C_Op._166_figuration.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8d/Debussy_String_Quartet_second_movement_opening.PNG/400px-Debussy_String_Quartet_second_movement_opening.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FClef.svg/30px-FClef.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg/80px-Missel_dominicain_MG_2113.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["octet","schubert"],["string_quartet","debussy"],["pitch","music"],["motif","music"],["motif","music"],["molding","decorative"],["repetition","music"],["phrase","music"],["string_quartet","debussy"]],"members":["octet","string_quartet","pitch","repetition","phrase","molding","motif"],"related":["Franz_Schubert","Octet_(Schubert)","Claude_Debussy","String_Quartet_(Debussy)","Music","Note","Pitch_(music)","Chord_progression","Rhythm","Motif_(music)","Nattiez,_Jean-Jacques","Motif_(music)","Molding_(decorative)","Repetition_(music)","Phrase_(music)","Melody","Claude_Debussy","String_Quartet_(Debussy)","Minimalist","Philip_Glass","Riff","Alberti_bass"]}
