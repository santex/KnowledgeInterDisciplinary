The adjective \"paternal\" refers to a father\nand comparatively to \"maternal\" for a mother. The verb \"to father\" means to\nprocreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun \"fathering\".\nFathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either\ncontains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome\n(male).<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/classes/bms/bms655/lesson6.html HUMAN GENETICS,\nMENDELIAN INHERITANCE] retrieved 25 February 2012</ref> Related terms of\nendearment are dad, daddy, pa, papa, pop and pops\n",
