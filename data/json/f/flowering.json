The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction,\nusually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may\nfacilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a\npopulation) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower).\nSome flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers\ncontain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise\nto fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as\nto cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.\n\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have\nlong been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as\nobjects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.\n",
