The two\ncrew sit in tandem positions on the left hand side of the vehicle, each with a\nset of driving controls facing opposite directions. A large earthmoving bucket\nis fitted at the rear of the vehicle and a rocket-propelled anchor on a 100m\nhawser attached to an 8 tonne winch can be fitted to the front. When operated\nfrom the rear seat the bucket is used for earth moving; clearing obstacles,\npaths or digging tank or gun pits and anti-tank ditches. When operated from the\nfront-facing seat it can be driven on the road, and the anchor can be used to\npull the CET up steep obstacles such as riverbanks. The winch rope can be\ndeployed to the front or the rear of the vehicle with a maximum pull of 8 tonnes\nin both configurations. The vehicle is NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical)\nproofed and has an air filtration unit, supplying clean air to the crew when\noperating with the crew hatches closed down in a contaminated environment. The\nNBC air system is also used to inflate the buoyancy aids required to trim the\nvehicle when swimming.\n\nAn Auxiliary Lifting Attachment (ALA) - a davit with a winch rope roller -\nfitted to the inside of the earthmoving bucket was used for lifting loads of up\nto 4tonnes. Loads such as Medium Girder Bridge pallets could be lifted\nvertically to a height of 1.8m. This then allowed a cargo vehicle to back under\nthe suspended load, the CET could not travel or turn with a suspended load on\nthe ALA due to lateral weakness of the ALA and the proximity of the load to the\nearthmoving bucket. Use of the ALA was discontinued in the 1990s due to\ndifficulties in annual testing of the safe working load, and a reduced\nrequirement for its use.\n\nThe amphibious propulsion is provided by to two Dowty water impellers, one\nmounted on each side of the vehicle and controlled by the commander in the rear\nseat facing forwards. The water jets are used to steer the vehicle when\nswimming, this is with the use of movable cowls directing the flow of water.\nWhen not in use, the propulsion unit water intakes are closed off with armoured\ncovers to prevent damage during digging operations. Flotation aids are required\nto trim the vehicle for swimming and a \"wash board\" is fitted to the front of\nthe vehicle to prevent the bow wave flooding the crew compartment when entering\nwater. Maximum speed in water is 8.5 knots, the vehicle will wade in 1.8m of\nwater and requires preparation for operating in deeper water this as it\nachieves buoyancy.\n\nThe CET is scheduled to be replaced by a new, larger vehicle - the 30 tonne\nTerrier. This will be better protected, equipped with night vision and be\nremotely operated if required in more hazardous circumstances.\n","linknr":128,"url":"FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","recorded":1375070038,"links":["/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:CET_02BG.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/CET_02BG.jpg/300px-CET_02BG.jpg","/wiki/Combat_engineering","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/British_Army","/wiki/Indian_Army","/wiki/Singapore_Army","/wiki/Tonne","/wiki/Short_ton","/wiki/Long_ton","/wiki/Vehicle_armour","/wiki/Rolls-Royce_C_range_engines","/wiki/Torsion_bar_suspension","/wiki/British_Army","/wiki/Royal_Engineers","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Hawser","/wiki/Nuclear,_biological_and_chemical_protection","/wiki/Medium_Girder_Bridge","/wiki/Dowty_Rotol","/wiki/Terrier_vehicle","/wiki/Night_vision","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","#cite_ref-1","http://www.khakicorpsimports.com/in-tractor.htm","/wiki/Template:ModernUKNonAFVNav","/wiki/Template_talk:ModernUKNonAFVNav","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:ModernUKNonAFVNav&action=edit","/wiki/Land_Rover_Defender","/wiki/Snatch_Land_Rover","/wiki/All_Terrain_Mobility_Platform","/wiki/Jackal_(MWMIK)","/wiki/Iveco_LMV","/wiki/International_MXT-MV","/wiki/Ocelot_(vehicle)","/wiki/Pinzgauer_High_Mobility_All-Terrain_Vehicle","/wiki/Alvis_Stalwart_(FV620)","/wiki/Bedford_MK","/wiki/AEC_Militant","/wiki/Thornycroft_Antar","/wiki/Scammell_Commander","/wiki/BARV","/wiki/FV106_Samson","/wiki/FV434","/wiki/Template:ModernUKAFVsNav","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&oldid=562019740","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Armoured_fighting_vehicles_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Amphibious_armoured_fighting_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Military_engineering_vehicles","/wiki/Category:Corps_of_Royal_Engineers","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_October_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FV180+Combat+Engineer+Tractor&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=FV180+Combat+Engineer+Tractor","/wiki/FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","/wiki/Talk:FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","#","/wiki/FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&oldid=562019740","/w/index.php?title=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1113467","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=FV180_Combat_Engineer_Tractor&id=562019740","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&b
