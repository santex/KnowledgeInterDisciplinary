      "text" : "\n\n in Lubbock, Texas，USA.]]\n\nA 'frontier' is the political and geographical areas near or beyond a boundary.\nThe term came from French in the 15th century, with the meaning \"borderland\"—the\nregion of a country that fronts on another country (see also marches).\n\nThe word \"frontier\" also means a region at the edge of a settled area,\nespecially in North American development. It is a transition zone where\nexplorers, pioneers and settlers were arriving. That is, as pioneers moved into\nthe \"frontier zone\", they were changed by the encounter.\n\nThat is what Frederick Jackson Turner calls \"the significance of the frontier.\"\nFor example, Turner argues that, in United States' 1893, one change was that\nunlimited free land in this zone was available, and thus offered the\npsychological sense of unlimited opportunity. This, in turn, had many\nconsequences such as optimism, future orientation, shedding of restraints due to\nland scarcity, and wastefulness of natural resources.\n",
