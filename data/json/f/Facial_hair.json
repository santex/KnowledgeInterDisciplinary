Men typically\nstart developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence,\nbetween seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a\nfully adult beard until their early twenties or later. [http://beardcommunity.com/faq.php#1 The Beard\nCommunity Bulletin Board FAQ ] This varies, as\nboys may first develop facial hair between fourteen and sixteen years of age,\nand boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. In addition,\nthe patches of hair can vary between bushy and bristly. Women are also capable\nof developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically\nsignificantly less than men.\n\nMale pogonotrophy (the growing of facial hair; i.e., beardedness) is often\nculturally associated with wisdom and virility. Men may style their\nfacial hair into beards, moustaches, goatees or sideburns; others completely\nshave their facial hair. The term \"whiskers,\" when used to refer to human facial\nhair, indicates the hair on the chin and\ncheeks.
