The\nobjects become discolored by a layer of fungal growth. Molds are fungi that grow\nin the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. A connected network of these tubular branching hyphae, called\na mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally\ntransparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over\nthe surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the\nhyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty\ntexture of many molds is caused by profuse numbers of asexual spores conidia\nformed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape\nof these spores is traditionally used to classify the mold fungi.\nMany of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the\nhuman eye at this stage in its life-cycle. In contrast, fungi that can adopt a\nsingle celled growth habit are called yeasts.\n\nMolds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or\nphylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and\nAscomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the\nDeuteromycota. Molds cause biodegradation of natural\nmaterials, that can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to\nproperty. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in\nthe production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and\nenzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by molds, usually as\na result of allergic sensitivity to their spores or caused by toxic compounds\nproduced as molds grow.\n","linknr":397,"url":"Filamentous_fungi","recorded":1362512794,"links":77,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/dhibbett/AFTOL/documents/AFTOL%20class%20mss%2023,%2024/AFTOL%20CLASS%20MS%20resub.pdf","http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/dhibbett/AFTOL/documents/AFTOL%20class%20mss%2023,%2024/AFTOL%20CLASS%20MS%20resub.pdf"],"categories":["Fungi","Articles containing video clips"],"headings":["Biology","Common molds","Food production","Pharmaceuticals from molds","Health effects","Growth in buildings and homes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/DecayingPeachSmall.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Mouldy_Clementine.jpg/220px-Mouldy_Clementine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Spinellus_fusiger_51504.jpg/220px-Spinellus_fusiger_51504.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Mold_on_tomatoes_%28macro%29.jpg/220px-Mold_on_tomatoes_%28macro%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Water_mold_Mizukabi_colony.jpg/220px-Water_mold_Mizukabi_colony.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png/25px-Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colony","biology"]],"members":["colony"],"related":["Peach","Fungi","Multicellular_organism","Hyphae","Cell_nucleus","Conidia","Yeast","Microorganism","Taxonomy","Phylogeny","Zygomycota","Ascomycota","Deuteromycota","Biodegradation","Decomposition","Antibiotic","Enzyme","Saprotroph","Mesophile","Thermophile","Opportunistic_pathogen","Photosynthesis","Organic_material","Heterotroph","Enzymes","Biopolymers","Starch","Cellulose","Lignin","Decomposition","Ecosystem","Mycotoxin","Siderophore","Microorganism","Spores","Cell_nucleus","Multinucleate","Mitosis","Meiosis","Colony_(biology)","Mycelium","Xerophile","Miso","Shoyu","Starch","Katsuobushi","Red_rice_yeast","Monacolin","Cholesterol","Statin","Sausage","Salami","Quorn","Cheese","Oncom","Rennet","Tempeh","Tortilla","Alexander_Fleming","Penicillin","Lovastatin","Howard_Florey","Ernst_Chain","Norman_Heatley","Edward_Abraham","Cyclosporine","Mold_health_issues","Mold_growth,_assessment_and_remediation","Bioaerosol","Decomposition","Medicinal_molds","Medicinal_mushrooms","Mildew","Mold_mite","Mycorrhiza","Oomycete"]}
