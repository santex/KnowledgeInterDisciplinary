{"cursor":"7238","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'From the House of the Dead' (Z mrtvÃ©ho domu in Czech) is an opera by LeoÅ¡\nJanÃ¡Äek, in three acts. The libretto was translated and adapted by the composer\nfrom the novel by Dostoyevsky. It was the composer's last opera, premiered on 12\nApril 1930 in Brno, two years after his death.\n\nJanÃ¡Äek worked on this opera knowing that it would be his last, and for it he\nbroke away from the habit he had developed of creating characters modeled on his\nlove interest Kamila StÃ¶sslovÃ¡, although the themes of loneliness and isolation\ncan clearly be seen as a response to her indifference to his feelings. There is\nonly one female character, and the setting, a Siberian prison, presents a large\nensemble cast instead of one or several prominent leads. There is no narrative\nto the work as a whole, but individual characters narrate episodes in their\nlives, and there is a \"play-within-a-play\" in Act 2.\n\nFrom the House of the Dead was virtually finished when JanÃ¡Äek died. Two of his\nstudents, believing the orchestration was incomplete, \"filled out\" large\nportions of the score and adapted the ending to be more optimistic in tone. In\naddition to the work of Bretislav Bakala, Ota Zitek made changes to the text and\nsequence of events in the opera. Hans Hollander, \"JanÃ¡Äek's Last Opera\" in\nThe Musical Times, '97(1362)', 407-409 (1956). Decades later, a version\ncloser to the composer's intentions superseded that version, and it is the one\nmost often heard today. Some productions, however, still use the earlier\nversion's ending to lessen the bleakness of the story.\n\nThe opera requires a vast orchestra, including chains as a percussion instrument\nto evoke the sound of the prisoners.\n","linknr":147,"url":"From_the_House_of_the_Dead","recorded":1362476874,"links":16,"instances":["voice_type","novel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Czech-language operas","Operas by Leoš Janáček","Operas","1930 operas","Operas based on novels","Operas set in Russia"],"headings":["Roles","Synopsis","Recordings","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Leos_Janacek_relief.jpg/220px-Leos_Janacek_relief.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_house_of_the_dead","novel"],["bass","voice_type"]],"members":["bass","the_house_of_the_dead"],"related":["Czech_language","Opera","Leoš_Janáček","Libretto","Translation","Composer","The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel)","Brno","Kamila_Stosslova","Siberia","Prison","Story_within_a_story","Percussion","Břetislav_Bakala","Baritone","Mezzo-soprano","Tenor","Bass_(voice_type)","Vienna_Philharmonic_Orchestra","Charles_Mackerras","Olaf_Bär","Štefan_Margita","Arnold_Schoenberg_Chor","Mahler_Chamber_Orchestra","Pierre_Boulez","Patrice_Chéreau","Beno_Blachut","Czech_Philharmonic_Chorus","Czech_Philharmonic_Orchestra","Václav_Neumann"]}
