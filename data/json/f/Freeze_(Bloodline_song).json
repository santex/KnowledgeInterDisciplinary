It was\nrecorded at Konk Studio, in London, during sessions that lasted from January to\nMarch 1991, being mixed late that same year. The album was produced by Alan\nWilder, engineered by Steve Lyon, and assisted by Dave Eringa.\n\nBloodline was Alan Wilder's third Recoil release.\n\nAfter completing Depeche Mode's most successful album, [[Violator\n(album)|Violator]], and subsequent World Violation Tour (with Nitzer Ebb as the\nsupport act), Wilder co-produced Nitzer's 1991 album [[Ebbhead]]. This cemented\nboth a good personal and working relationship with Nitzer lead singer Douglas\nMcCarthy. From Recoil's official website:\n[http://www.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/ebbhead.htm Shunt] After completing\nthe Nitzer Ebb album, Wilder went to work on his solo project, and McCarthy\nreturned the favor by performing on the Recoil album.\n\nWilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time: Moby, Toni Halliday (from\nthe band Curve), and Douglas McCarthy, helping produce a significant move\nforward. It also marked the first Recoil single, a cover of the Alex Harvey song\n\"Faith Healer\". From Recoil's official website:\n[http://www.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/bloodline.htm Shunt]\n\nThe album is also notable for the track \"Electro Blues for Bukka White\", which\nintroduced the idea of taking very old recordings and setting them in a new\nelectronic setting. Moby, who did vocals on this album, arguably used this\ninspiration for his breakthrough 1999 album, [[Play (Moby album)|Play]]. Moby\nused several old field recordings by Alan Lomax, much as Wilder used an old\nrecording of White's \"Shake 'Em on Down\".\n","linknr":183,"url":"Freeze_(Bloodline_song)","recorded":1362893059,"links":24,"instances":["film","musician","music_producer","band","band","musician","band","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1992 albums","Mute Records albums","Recoil albums","Electronic albums","Sire Records albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Single","Credits and personnel","Trivia","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Bloodline_%28Recoil_album%29.jpg/220px-Bloodline_%28Recoil_album%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["recoil","band"],["recoil","band"],["curve","band"],["alex_harvey","musician"],["electro","music"],["lfo","band"],["daniel_miller","music_producer"],["lfo","band"],["jimmy_hughes","musician"],["the_silence_of_the_lambs","film"]],"members":["the_silence_of_the_lambs","jimmy_hughes","daniel_miller","curve","recoil","alex_harvey","lfo","electro"],"related":["Recoil_(band)","Mute_Records","Sire_Records","Reprise_Records","Warner_Bros._Records","Allmusic","CDNOW","Recoil_(band)","Konk_Studio","London","Steve_Lyon","Dave_Eringa","Depeche_Mode","World_Violation_Tour","Nitzer_Ebb","Douglas_McCarthy","Moby","Toni_Halliday","Curve_(band)","Alex_Harvey_(musician)","Electro_(music)","Blues","Bukka_White","Alan_Lomax","Shake_'Em_on_Down","Douglas_McCarthy","Bukka_White","Toni_Halliday","Moby","Toni_Halliday","LFO_(band)","Daniel_Miller_(music_producer)","Philipp_Erb","Mike_Bigwood","LFO_(band)","Moby","Douglas_McCarthy","Lead_vocals","Rapping","Jimmy_Hughes_(musician)","David_Bowie","Diamanda_Gal√°s","The_Lord's_Prayer","Anthony_Hopkins","The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)","Kraftwerk"]}
