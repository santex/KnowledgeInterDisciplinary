A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. However, the term\n\"feast\" has also entered common secular parlance as a synonym for any large or\nelaborate meal. When used as in the meaning of a festival, most often refers to\na religious festival rather than a film or art festival.\n\nIn the Philippines and many other former Spanish colonies, the Spanish word\n'fiesta' is used to denote a communal religious feast to honor a patron saint.\n\nIn the Christian liturgical calendar there are two principal feasts, properly\nknown as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the\nResurrection, (Easter). In the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican\nliturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the\nyear commemorating saints, sacred events, doctrines, etc.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Festival","recorded":1362673325,"links":73,"instances":["solar_term","meeting"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Festivals|","Social events"],"headings":["Etymology","Function","Types of festivals","Lists of festivals","Ancient Egyptian festivals","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Renfair_entertainers.jpg/220px-Renfair_entertainers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Village_Feast_Fac_simile_of_a_Woodcut_of_the_Sandrin_ou_Verd_Galant_facetious_Work_of_the_End_of_the_Sixteenth_Century_edition_of_1609.png/220px-Village_Feast_Fac_simile_of_a_Woodcut_of_the_Sandrin_ou_Verd_Galant_facetious_Work_of_the_End_of_the_Sixteenth_Century_edition_of_1609.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Een_festival_bij_Anvers_Alexander.jpg/220px-Een_festival_bij_Anvers_Alexander.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dongzhi","solar_term"],["convention","meeting"]],"members":["dongzhi","convention"],"related":["United_Kingdom","Religion","God","Polytheism","Secular","Idiom","Meal","Religious_festival","Philippine_Fiesta","Patron_saint","Christian","Liturgical_calendar","Christmas","Easter","Catholic","Eastern_Orthodox","Anglican","Middle_English","Middle_French","Party","Elderly","Family","Mating","Anniversary","Solar_calendar","Lunar_calendar","Season","Inundation","Nile_River","Irrigation","Alps","Pasture","Chinese_New_Year","Dongzhi_(solar_term)","Dree_Festival","Abare_Festival","Arts_festival","Beer_festival","Comedy_festival","Japanese_Cultural_festival","Esala_Perahera","Film_festival","Beltane","Folk_festival","Food_festival","Literary_festival","Mela_Festival","Music_festival","Oyster_Festival","Peanut_Festival","Ribfest","Religious_festival","Renaissance_festival","Rock_festival","Science_festival","Sindhi_festivals","Storytelling_festival","Theatre_festival","Wine_festivals","Winter_festivals","Ancient_Egypt","Rameses_III","Libyans","Sed_festival","Pharaoh","Convention_(meeting)","Event_planning","Fair","Festive_ecology","Holiday","List_of_festivals_in_the_United_States","List_of_music_festivals","Liturgical_year","Moveable_feast","Trade_show","Czech_folklore"]}
