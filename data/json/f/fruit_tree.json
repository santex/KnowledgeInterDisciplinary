In\nhorticultural usage, the term 'fruit tree' is limited to those that provide\nfruit for human food. Types of fruits are described and defined elsewhere (see\nFruit), but would include \"fruit\" in a culinary sense, as well as some nut-\nbearing trees, such as walnuts.\n\nThe scientific study and the cultivation of fruits is called pomology, which\ndivides fruits into groups based on plant morphology and anatomy. Some of those\ngroups are: Pome fruits, which include apples and pears, and stone fruits, which\ninclude peaches/nectarines, almonds, apricots, plums and cherries.<ref\nname=Editors2003></ref>\n",
