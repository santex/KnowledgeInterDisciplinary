Its arrival is considered due to\n the existence of time and the laws of physics. Due to the apparent nature of\n reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists\n and will can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist for\n the whole of the future, or , meaning that it won't and thus will come to an\n end. The future and the concept of eternity have been major subjects of\n philosophy, religion, and science, and defining them non-controversially has\n consistently eluded the greatest of minds.<ref>Hastings, J., Selbie, J.

Page 18.</ref>\n\nIn the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists\nand the future and the past are unreal. Religions consider the future when they\naddress issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study\nwhat the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as\nprophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future. Organized efforts to\npredict or forecast the future may have derived from observations by early man\nof heavenly objects.\n\nFuture studies, or futurology, is the science, art and practice of\npostulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of\nalternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the\nlimitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible\nand preferable futures.\n\nThe future has been explored through several art movements and cultural genres.\nThe futurism art movement at the beginning of the 20th century, explored every\nmedium of art, including painting, sculpture, poetry, theatre, music,\narchitecture and even gastronomy. Futurists had passionate loathing of ideas\nfrom the past, especially political and artistic traditions. Instead, they\nespoused a love of speed, technology, and violence.<ref>Umbro Apollonio (ed.),\nFuturist Manifestos, MFA Publications, 2001 ISBN 978-0-87846-627-6</ref><ref\nname=\"futurmanifest\"></ref> Futuristic music involved homage to, inclusion of,\nor imitation of machines. Futurism expanded to encompass other artistic domains\nand ultimately included industrial design, textiles, and architecture.\n","title":"future","headings":["Forecasting","Future studies","Physics","Philosophy","Psychology","Religion","In art and culture","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["4: Eternity","4: Futurology","3: Past","3: Afterlife","3: Reincarnation","3: Reality","3: Religion","3: Existence","3: Eschatology","3: Futurism","3: Technology","3: Science_fiction","2: Time","2: Present","2: Chronology","2: Philosophy","2: Science","2: Western_culture","2: Special_relativity","2: Absolute_future","2: Light_cone","2: Philosophy_of_time","2: Belief","2: Karma","2: Prophet","2: Divination","2: Prediction","2: Art","2: Art_movement","2: Painting","2: Sculpture","2: Poetry","2: Theatre","2: Music","2: Architecture","2: Gastronomy","2: Speed","2: Violence","2: Future_studies","2: Futurewise","2: Buddhism","2: Ethology","2: Italy","1: Arguments_for_eternity","1: Paleontology","1: Fatalism","1: Philosophy_of_space_and_time","1: Creation_myth","1: End_Times","1: Day_of_Judgement","1: Immortality","1: Kalachakra","1: Metric_Time","1: Hexadecimal_time","1: Radiometric_dating","1: Chronobiology","1: Evolution","1: Cosmogony","1: Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe","1: Time_in_Physics","1: Spacetime","1: Space","1: Space-time_continuum","1: Time_Travel","1: Grandfather_Paradox","1: Ebenezer_Scrooge","1: Charles_Dickens","1: Time_period","1: Laws_of_physics","1: Dimension","1: Forecasting","1: Estimation","1: Weather_forecasting","1: Earthquake_prediction","1: Transport_planning","1: Labour_market","1: Risk","1: Uncertainty","1: Time_series","1: Cross-sectional_data","1: Longitudinal_study","1: Econometric","1: Probability","1: Delphi_method","1: Scenario_building","1: Simulation","1: Astrology","1: Haruspicy","1: Augury","1: Pseudoscience","1: Scientific_modeling","1: Causal_model","1: Cognition","1: Stochastic_process","1: Chaos_theory","1: Patrick_Dixon","1: Classical_physics","1: Frame_of_reference","1: Light_speed","1: Wormhole","1: Michio_Kaku","1: Cosmic_string","1: Information","1: Bell_inequality","1: John_Lewis_Gaddis","1: Logic","1: Fictionalism","1: Growing_block_universe","1: Theory","1: Galilean_relativity","1: Hendrik_Lorentz","1: Einstein","1: Thesis","1: Augustine_of_Hippo","1: Research_proposal","1: William_James","1: Indian_Buddhism","1: Buddhist_philosophy","1: Theodor_Ippolitovich_Stcherbatsky","1: Fixed_action_pattern","1: Human_behavior","1: Optimism","1: Pessimism","1: Hope","1: Spirit","1: Mind","1: Death","1: Spirituality","1: Ghost","1: Planes_of_existence","1: Esotericism","1: Metaphysics","1: Materialism","1: Supernatural","1: Theists","1: Atheism","1: God","1: Agnosticism","1: Paganism","1: Calvinistic","1: Protestant","1: Theology","1: History_of_the_world","1: Destiny","1: All_humanity","1: Mysticism","1: Prophecy","1: Sacred_text","1: Folklore","1: Messiah","1: Messianic_Age","1: End_time","1: Russia","1: Nature","1: Luigi_Russolo","1: Antonio_Russolo","1: Arthur_Honegger","1: Pacific_231","1: Rationalism","1: Modernism","1: Cyberpunk","1: Robert_A._Heinlein","1: Scientific_method","1: Fiction","1: Time_travel","1: Psionics","1: Nanotechnology","1: Faster-than-light","1: Robot","1: History","1: Future_history","1: H.G._Wells","1: Alternative_future","1: Cheiromancy","1: Paleofuture","1: Timeline_of_the_near_future","1: Timeline_of_the_future_in_forecasts","1: Timeline_of_the_far_future","1: Future_of_the_Earth","1: Future_of_the_Solar_System","1: Future_of_an_expanding_universe"]}
