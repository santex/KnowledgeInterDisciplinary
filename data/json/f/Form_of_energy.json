The term potential energy is a very general\nterm, because it exists in all force fields, such as gravitation, electrostatic\nand magnetic fields. Potential energy refers to the energy any object gain due\nto its position in a force field.\n\nThe relation between mechanical energy with kinetic and potential energy is\nsimply\n\n: E = T + V \\,\\! .\n\n'[[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]'\n\nIn more advanced topics, kinetic plus potential energy is physically the total\nenergy of the system, but also known as the [[Hamiltonian\nmechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the system:\n\n: H = T + V , \\,\\!\n\nused in Hamilton's equations of motion, to obtain equations describing a\nclassical system in terms of energy rather than forces. The Hamiltonian is just\na mathematical expression, rather than a form of energy.\n\nAnother analogous quantity of diverse applicability and efficiency is the\nLagrangian of the system:\n\n: L = T - V \\,\\! ,\n\nused in Lagrange's equations of motion, which serve the same purpose as\nHamilton's equations.\n\nKinetic energy\n\n\n'General scope'\n\nKinetic energy is the work required to accelerate an object to a given speed.\nThese values are expressed as:\n\n: E_\\mathrm{k} = \\int \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x} = \\int \\mathbf{v} \\cdot\n:d \\mathbf{p}= \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\,\\!\n\n'Special Relativistic mechanics'\n\nAt speeds approaching the speed of light c, this work must be calculated using\nLorentz transformations, and applying mass and energy conservation, which\nresults in the following:\n\n: E_\\mathrm{k} = \\left ( \\gamma - 1 \\right ) m c^2 \\,\\!\n\nwhere\n\n: \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left ( \\frac{v}{c} \\right )^2}} \\,\\!\n\nis the lorentz factor.\n\nHere the two terms on the right hand side are identified with the total energy\nand the rest energy of the object, respectively. This equation reduces to the\none above it, at small (compared to 'c') speed. The kinetic energy is zero at\nv=0 (when Î³ = 1), so that at rest, the total energy is the rest energy. So a\nmass at rest in some inertial reference frame has a corresponding amount of rest\nenergy equal to:\n\n: E_0 = m_0 c^2 \\,\\!\n\nAll masses at rest have a tremendous amount of energy, due to the\nproportionality factor of c 2.\n\nPotential energy\n\n\nPotential energy is defined as the work done against a given force in changing\nthe position of an object with respect to a reference position, often taken to\nbe infinite separation. In other words it is the work done on the object to give\nit that much energy. Changes in work and potential energy are related simply,\n\n: \\Delta U = -\\Delta W .\n\nThe name \"potential\" energy originally signified the idea that the energy could\nreadily be transferred as work â at least in an idealized system (reversible\nprocess, see below). This is not completely true for any real system, but is\noften a reasonable first approximation in classical mechanics.\n\nMechanical work\n\n\n'Translational motion'\n\nIf 'F' is the force and 'r' is the displacement, then the change in mechanical\nwork done along the path between positions 'r' 1 and 'r' 2\ndue to the force is, in integral form:\n\n: \\Delta W = \\int_{\\mathbf{r}_1}^{\\mathbf{r}_2}\n:\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} ,\n\n(the dot represents the scalar product of the two vectors). The general equation\nabove can be simplified in a number of common cases, notably when dealing with\ngravity or with elastic forces. If the force is conservative the equation can be\nwritten in differential form as\n\n: \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla W .\n\n'Rotational motion'\n\nThe rotational analogue is the work done by a torque 'Ï', between the angles\nÎ¸ 1 and Î¸ 2,\n\n: \\Delta W = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\left | \\boldsymbol{\\tau} \\right |\n:\\mathrm{d}\\theta .\n\nElastic potential energy\n\n, it accelerates downward, its initial potential energy converting into kinetic\nenergy. On impact with a hard surface the ball deforms, converting the kinetic\nenergy into elastic potential energy. As the ball springs back, the energy\nconverts back firstly to kinetic energy and then as the ball re-gains height\ninto potential energy. Energy conversion to heat due to inelastic deformation\nand air resistance cause each successive bounce to be lower than the last.]]\n\n\n\nElastic potential energy is defined as a work needed to compress or extend a\nspring. The tension/compression force 'F' in a spring or any other system which\nobeys Hooke's law is proportional to the extension/compression 'x',\n\n: \\mathbf{F} = -k\\mathbf{x}\\,\\! ,\n\nwhere k is the force constant of the particular spring or system. In this case\nthe force is conservative, the calculated work becomes\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,e} = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\,\\! .\n\nIf k is not constant the above equation will fail. Hooke's law is a good\napproximation for behaviour of chemical bonds under stable conditions, i.e. when\nthey are not being broken or formed.\n\nSurface energy\n\nIf there is any kind of tension in a surface, such as a stretched sheet of\nrubber or material interfaces, it is possible to define 'surface energy'.\n\nIf Î³ is the surface tension, and S = surface area, then the work done W to\nincrease the area by a unit area is the surface energy:\n\n: \\mathrm{d}W = \\gamma \\mathrm{d}S . \\,\\!\n\nIn particular, any meeting of dissimilar materials that do not mix will result\nin some kind of surface tension, if there is freedom for the surfaces to move\nthen, as seen in capillary surfaces for example, the minimum energy will as\nusual be sought.\n\nA minimal surface, for example, represents the smallest possible energy that a\nsurface can have if its energy is proportional to the area of the surface. For\nthis reason, (open) soap films of small size are minimal surfaces (small size\nreduces gravity effects, and openness prevents pressure from building up. Note\nthat a bubble is a minimum energy surface but not a minimal surface by\ndefinition).\n\nSound energy\n\nSound is a form of mechanical vibration which propagates through any mechanical\nmedium. It is closely related to the ability of the human ear to perceive sound.\nThe wide outer area of the ear is maximized to collect sound vibrations. It is\namplified and passed through the outer ear, striking the eardrum, which\ntransmits sounds into the inner ear. Auditory nerves fire according to the\nparticular vibrations of the sound waves in the inner ear, which designate such\nthings as the pitch and volume of the sound. The ear is set up in an optimal way\nto interpret sound energy in the form of vibrations.\n\nGravitational potential energy\n\n\nThe gravitational force very near the surface of a massive body (e.g. a planet)\nvaries very little with small changes in height, h, and locally is equal m'g'\nwhere m is mass, and 'g' is the gravitational acceleration (AKA field strength).\nAt the Earth's surface g = 9.81 m s -1 . In these cases, the\ngravitational potential energy is given by\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,g} \\approx mgh\\,\\!\n\nA more general expression for the potential energy due to Newtonian gravitation\nbetween two bodies of masses m 1 and m 2, is\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,g} = -\\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r}\\,\\! ,\n\nwhere r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the\ngravitational constant,\n6.6742(10) Ã 10 -11 m 3 kg -1 s -2 . In this case, the zero potential reference point is the\n  infinite separation of the two bodies. Care must be taken that these masses\n  are point masses or uniform spherical solids/shells. It cannot be applied\n  directly to any objects of any shape and any mass.\n\nIn terms of the gravitational potential (Î¦, U or V), the potential energy is (by\ndefinition of gravitational potential),\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,g} = -\\Phi m \\,\\! .\n\nThermal energy\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px; margin:10px\"\n|-\n|+ Examples of the interconversion of energy -\n! colspan=2 | Thermal energy is converted\n|-\n! into by\n|- '[[Mechanical energy]]' Steam turbine - '[[Thermal energy]]' Heat exchanger -\n|'[[Electric energy]]' Thermocouple - '[[Electromagnetic radiation]]' Hot\n|objects - '[[Chemical energy]]' Blast furnace - '[[Nuclear binding\n|energy|Nuclear energy]]' Supernova }\n\n\n\n'General scope'\n\nThermal energy (of some state of matter - gas, plasma, solid, etc.) is the\nenergy associated with the microscopical random motion of particles constituting\nthe media. For example, in case of monoatomic gas it is just a kinetic energy of\nmotion of atoms of gas as measured in the reference frame of the center of mass\nof gas. In case of molecules in the gas rotational and vibrational energy is\ninvolved. In the case of liquids and solids there is also potential energy (of\ninteraction of atoms) involved, and so on.\n\nA heat is defined as a transfer (flow) of thermal energy across certain boundary\n(for example, from a hot body to cold via the area of their contact). A\npractical definition for small transfers of heat is\n\n: \\Delta q = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_\\mathrm{v}\\mathrm{d}T\n\nwhere C v is the heat capacity of the system. This definition\nwill fail if the system undergoes a phase transitionâe.g. if ice is melting\nto waterâas in these cases the system can absorb heat without increasing\nits temperature. In more complex systems, it is preferable to use the\nconcept of internal energy rather than that of thermal energy (see\n''Chemical energy'' below).\n\nDespite the theoretical problems, the above definition is useful in the\nexperimental measurement of energy changes. In a wide variety of situations, it\nis possible to use the energy released by a system to raise the temperature of\nanother object, e.g. a bath of water. It is also possible to measure the amount\nof electric energy required to raise the temperature of the object by the same\namount. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of energy required to\nraise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 Â°C (approximately\n4.1855 J, although the definition later changed), and the British thermal\nunit was defined as the energy required to heat one pound of water by 1 Â°F\n(later fixed as 1055.06 J).\n\n'Kinetic theory'\n\nIn kinetic theory which describes the ideal gas, the thermal energy per degree\nof freedom is given by:\n\n: U = \\frac{d_f}{2}k_B T \n\nwhere d f is the number of degrees of freedom and k B is the\nBoltzmann constant. The total themeral energies would equal the total internal\nenergy of the gas, since intermolecular potential energy is neglected in this\ntheory. The term k BT occurs very frequently into statistical\nthermodynamics.\n\nChemical energy\n\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px; margin:10px\"\n|-\n|+ Examples of the interconversion of energy -\n! colspan=2 | Chemical energy is converted\n|-\n! into by\n|- '[[Mechanical energy]]' Muscle - '[[Thermal energy]]' Fire - '[[Electric\n|energy]]' Fuel cell - '[[Electromagnetic radiation]]' Glowworms - '[[Chemical\n|energy]]' Chemical reaction }\n\nChemical energy is the energy due to associations of atoms in molecules and\nvarious other kinds of aggregates of matter. It may be defined as a work done by\nelectric forces during re-arrangement of mutual positions of electric charges,\nelectrons and protons, in the process of aggregation. So, basically it is\nelectrostatic potential energy of electric charges. If the chemical energy of a\nsystem decreases during a chemical reaction, the difference is transferred to\nthe surroundings in some form (often heat or light); on the other hand if the\nchemical energy of a system increases as a result of a chemical reaction - the\ndifference then is supplied by the surroundings (usually again in form of heat\nor light). For example, :when two hydrogen atoms react to form a dihydrogen\nmolecule, the chemical energy decreases by 724 zJ (the bond energy of the\nHâH bond); :when the electron is completely removed from a hydrogen atom,\nforming a hydrogen ion (in the gas phase), the chemical energy increases by\n2.18 aJ (the ionization energy of hydrogen). It is common to quote the\nchanges in chemical energy for one mole of the substance in question: typical\nvalues for the change in molar chemical energy during a chemical reaction range\nfrom tens to hundreds of kilojoules per mole.\n\nThe chemical energy as defined above is also referred to by chemists as the\ninternal energy, 'U': technically, this is measured by keeping the volume of the\nsystem constant. Most practical chemistry is performed at constant pressure and,\nif the volume changes during the reaction (e.g. a gas is given off), a\ncorrection must be applied to take account of the work done by or on the\natmosphere to obtain the enthalpy, 'H', this correction is the work done by an\nexpanding gas,\n\n: \\Delta E = p \\Delta V \\,\\! ,\n\nso the enthalpy now reads;\n\n: \\Delta H = \\Delta U + p \\Delta V \\,\\! .\n\nA second correction, for the change in entropy, 'S', must also be performed to\ndetermine whether a chemical reaction will take place or not, giving the Gibbs\nfree energy, 'G'. The correction is the energy required to create order from\ndisorder, Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe, R.E. Dickerson, I. Geis, W.A.\nBenjamin Inc. (USA), 1976, ISBN 0-19-855148-7\n\n: \\Delta E = T \\Delta S \\,\\! ,\n\nso we have;\n\n: \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,\\! .\n\nThese corrections are sometimes negligible, but often not (especially in\nreactions involving gases).\n\nSince the industrial revolution, the burning of coal, oil, natural gas or\nproducts derived from them has been a socially significant transformation of\nchemical energy into other forms of energy. the energy \"consumption\" (one\nshould really speak of \"energy transformation\") of a society or country is\noften quoted in reference to the average energy released by the combustion of\nthese fossil fuels:\n:1  tonne of coal equivalent (TCE) = 29.3076 GJ = 8,141 kilowatt hour\n:1 tonne of oil equivalent (TOE) = 41.868 GJ = 11,630 kilowatt hour\nOn the same basis, a tank-full of gasoline (45 litres, 12 gallons) is\nequivalent to about 1.6 GJ of chemical energy. Another chemically based\nunit of measurement for energy is the \"tonne of TNT\", taken as 4.184 GJ.\nHence, burning a tonne of oil releases about ten times as much energy as the\nexplosion of one tonne of TNT: fortunately, the energy is usually released\nin a slower, more controlled manner.\n\nSimple examples of storage of chemical energy are batteries and food. When food\nis digested and metabolized (often with oxygen), chemical energy is released,\nwhich can in turn be transformed into heat, or by muscles into kinetic energy.\n\nAccording to the Bohr theory of the atom, the chemical energy is characterized\nby the Rydberg constant.\n: R_y= \\frac{m_e e^4}{8 \\varepsilon_0^2 h^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 m_ec^2 =\n:13.605\\;692\\;53(30) \\ \\mathrm{eV}\n(see Rydberg constant for the meaning of the symbols).\n\nElectric energy\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px; margin:10px\"\n|-\n|+ Examples of the interconversion of energy -\n! colspan=2 | Electric energy is converted\n|-\n! into by\n|- '[[Mechanical energy]]' Electric motor - '[[Thermal energy]]' Resistor -\n|'[[Electric energy]]' Transformer - '[[Electromagnetic radiation]]' Light-\n|emitting diode - '[[Chemical energy]]' Electrolysis - '[[Nuclear binding\n|energy|Nuclear energy]]' Synchrotron }\n\nElectrostatic energy\n\n'General scope'\n\nThe electric potential energy of given configuration of charges is defined as\nthe work which must be done against the Coulomb force to rearrange charges from\ninfinite separation to this configuration (or the work done by the Coulomb force\nseparating the charges from this configuration to infinity). For two point-like\ncharges Q 1 and Q 2 at a distance r this work, and hence\nelectric potential energy is equal to:\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,e} = \\frac{1}\n\nwhere Îµ 0 is the electric constant of a vacuum,\n10 7/4Ïc 02 or 8.854188â¦ Ã 10 â12 F\nm â1 . In terms of electrostatic potential (Ï for\nabsolute, V for difference in potential), again by definition, electrostatic\npotential energy is given by:\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,e} = \\phi q \\,\\! .\n\nIf the charge is accumulated in a capacitor (of capacitance C), the reference\nconfiguration is usually selected not to be infinite separation of charges, but\nvice versa - charges at an extremely close proximity to each other (so there is\nzero net charge on each plate of a capacitor). The justification for this choice\nis purely practical - it is easier to measure both voltage difference and\nmagnitude of charges on a capacitor plates not versus infinite separation of\ncharges but rather versus discharged capacitor where charges return to close\nproximity to each other (electrons and ions recombine making the plates\nneutral). In this case the work and thus the electric potential energy becomes\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,e} = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \\frac{1}{2}VQ\n:\\,\\! ,\n\n(different forms obtained using the definition of capacitance).\n\nElectric energy\n\n\n'Electric circuits'\n\nIf an electric current passes through a resistor, electric energy is converted\nto heat; if the current passes through an electric appliance, some of the\nelectric energy will be converted into other forms of energy (although some will\nalways be lost as heat). The amount of electric energy due to an electric\ncurrent can be expressed in a number of different ways:\n\n: E = VQ = VIt = Pt = \\frac{V^2 t}{R} = {I^2}Rt \\,\\!\n\nwhere V is the electric potential difference (in volts), Q is the charge (in\ncoulombs), I is the current (in amperes), t is the time for which the current\nflows (in seconds), P is the power (in watts) and R is the electric resistance\n(in ohms). The last of these expressions is important in the practical\nmeasurement of energy, as potential difference, resistance and time can all be\nmeasured with considerable accuracy.\n\nMagnetic energy\n\n\n'General scope'\n\nThere is no fundamental difference between magnetic energy and electric energy:\nthe two phenomena are related by Maxwell's equations. The potential energy of a\nmagnet of magnetic moment 'm' in a magnetic field 'B' is defined as the work of\nmagnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of\nthe magnetic dipole moment, and is equal to:\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,m} = -\\mathbf{m}\\cdot \\mathbf{B} .\n\n'Electric circuits'\n\nThe energy stored in an inductor (of inductance L) carrying current I is\n\n: E_\\mathrm{p,m} = \\frac{1}{2}LI^2 .\n\nThis second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic\nenergy storage.\n\nElectromagnetic energy\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px; margin:10px\"\n|-\n|+ Examples of the interconversion of energy -\n! colspan=2 | Electromagnetic radiation is converted\n|-\n! into by\n|- '[[Mechanical energy]]' Solar sail - '[[Thermal energy]]' Solar collector -\n|'[[Electric energy]]' Solar cell - '[[Electromagnetic radiation]]' Non-linear\n|optics - '[[Chemical energy]]' Photosynthesis - '[[Nuclear binding\n|energy|Nuclear energy]]' MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy }\n\nCalculating work needed to create an electric or magnetic field in unit volume\n(say, in a capacitor or an inductor) results in the electric and magnetic fields\nenergy densities:\n\n: u_e=\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\left| \\mathbf{E} \\right |^2 , \\quad\n:u_m=\\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\left| \\mathbf{B} \\right |^2 \\,\\! ,\n\nin SI units.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, visible light or gamma rays,\nrepresents a flow of electromagnetic energy. Applying the above expressions to\nmagnetic and electric components of electromagnetic field both the volumetric\ndensity and the flow of energy in EM field can be calculated. The resulting\nPoynting vector, which is expressed as\n\n: \\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B},\n\nin SI units, gives the density of the flow of energy and its direction.\n\nThe energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized (has discrete energy\nlevels). The energy of a photon is:\n\n: E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\,\\! ,\n\nso the spacing between energy levels is:\n\n: \\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = hc \\left ( \\nu_2 - \\nu_1 \\right ) = hc \\left (\n:\\frac{1}{\\lambda_2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} \\right ) \\,\\! ,\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant, 6.6260693(11)Ã10 â34 Js, and Î½ is the frequency of the radiation. This quantity of\nelectromagnetic energy is usually called a photon. The photons which make up\nvisible light have energies of 270â520 yJ, equivalent to\n160â310 kJ/mol, the strength of weaker chemical bonds.\n\nNuclear energy\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:150px; margin:10px\"\n|-\n|+ Examples of the interconversion of energy -\n! colspan=2 | Nuclear binding energy is converted\n|-\n! into by\n|- '[[Mechanical energy]]' Alpha radiation - '[[Thermal energy]]' Sun -\n|'[[Electrical energy]]' Beta radiation - '[[Electromagnetic radiation]]' Gamma\n|radiation - '[[Chemical energy]]' Radioactive decay - '[[Nuclear binding\n|energy|Nuclear energy]]' Nuclear isomerism }\n\n'[[Nuclear potential energy]]', along with electric potential energy, provides\nthe energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. The\nresult of both these processes are nuclei in which the more-optimal size of the\nnucleus allows the nuclear force (which is opposed by the electromagnetic force)\nto bind nuclear particles more tightly together than before the reaction.\n\nThe Weak nuclear force (different from the strong force) provides the potential\nenergy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay.\n\nThe energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the relativistic\nchange in mass (after the energy has been removed) can be as much as several\nparts per thousand.\n\nNuclear particles (nucleons) like protons and neutrons are not destroyed (law\nof conservation of baryon number) in fission and fusion processes. A few\nlighter particles may be created or destroyed (example: beta minus and beta\nplus decay, or electron capture decay), but these minor processes are not\nimportant to the immediate energy release in fission and fusion. Rather,\nfission and fusion release energy when collections of baryons become more\ntightly bound, and it is the energy associated with a fraction of the mass of\nthe nucleons (but not the whole particles) which appears as the heat and\nelectromagnetic radiation generated by nuclear reactions. This heat and\nradiation retains the \"missing\" mass, but the mass is missing only because it\nescapes in the form of heat or light, which retain the mass and conduct it out\nof the system where it is not measured.\n\nThe energy from the Sun, also called solar energy, is an example of this form of\nenergy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4\nmillion metric tons of solar \"matter\" per second into light, which is radiated\ninto space, but during this process, although protons change into neutrons, the\nnumber of total protons-plus-neutrons does not change. In this system, the\nradiated light itself (as a system) retains the \"missing\" mass, which represents\n4 million tons per second of electromagnetic radiation, moving into space. Each\nof the helium nuclei which are formed in the process are less massive than the\nfour protons from they were formed, but (to a good approximation), no particles\nare destroyed in the process of turning the Sun's nuclear potential energy into\nlight. Instead, the four nucleons in a helium nucleus in the Sun have an average\nmass that is less than the protons which formed them, and this mass difference\n(4 million tons/second) is the mass that moves off as sunlight.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of energy storage
