{"cursor":"3977","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Franz Tamayo Solares' (1878, La Paz â 1956) was a Bolivian intellectual,\nwriter, and politician. The Franz Tamayo Province is named after him. He was\nrenowned for his oratory. A prominent Bolivian poet and philosopher, he wrote a\nnumber of educational treatises and also practiced law, journalism, and\ndiplomacy. Tamayo was of Mestizo background; he had both Aymara and Spanish\nancestry.\n\nTamayo's racial concepts were and continue to be very influential in Bolivian\nthought, life, and culture. He considered Indians (indigneous or originary\npeople) skilled only in the faculties of physical labor, such as agricultural\nwork or military service, but deficient in faculties of the mind that whites\n(creoles or those of European descent) excelled in. Mestizos (of mixed decent)\nhe considered proficient in both the areas of physical and mental labor and\ntherefore able to function as citizens of the Bolivian Republic, assuming\nacculturation to European culture. This racialized understanding of the mestizo\n(or Cholo) and modern citizen would greatly influence and underline Bolivia's\npolitics and national identity after the 1952 revolution.\n\nIn politics, Tamayo originally supported the Liberal Party but switched to the\nopposition Republican Party around 1920. In 1931 he was appointed Minister of\nForeign Relations by president Daniel Salamanca. He actually won the 1934\npresidential elections, but these were annulled by the leaders of the military\ncoup that toppled Salamanca from power.\n\nThis is an old anecdote about Franz Tamayo that is illustrative of his\ncharacter:\n\nTamayo lived in [[La Paz]] (Bolivia's Capital), and every morning he would get\nup early and spend 15 minutes gazing from his balcony to the imposing Illimani,\nthe highest of the mountains surrounding the city.\n\nAfter a while, a man came to live in the same building as Tamayo, and one\nmorning he saw him in his \"ritual\". \"Franz\", he called out, for Tamayo was well\nknown in the city. \"Franz!\". After some minutes of shouting and receiving no\nanswer, he lost his temper and shouted \"For God's sake, Franz, what is your\nproblem? I am trying to say 'good morning' to you\" Tamayo turned around, his\neyes on fire, and shouted. \"Â¡Silencio! Dos cumbres se contemplan\" (\"Silence!,\ntwo giants gaze upon each other.)\n\nAnother anecdote,\n\nTamayo was serving in the Bolivian House of Representatives when he gave one of\nhis famed impassioned speeches before that august body. Inevitably, someone took\nexception to his thinking and booed the great poet and orator, tossing (of all\nthings) a horseshoe at him to show his displeasure. Tamayo calmly picked up the\nhorseshoe and said aloud \"incidentally, would the gentleman who has lost his\nshoe please come up front to claim it?\"\n","linknr":126,"url":"Franz_Tamayo","recorded":1375075336,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Bolivian_province","/wiki/Franz_Tamayo_Province","/wiki/La_Paz","/wiki/Bolivia","/wiki/Franz_Tamayo_Province","/wiki/Mestizo","/wiki/Aymara_people","/wiki/Spanish_people","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_americas","/wiki/White_people","/wiki/Creole_elite","/wiki/Mestizos","/wiki/Racialized","/wiki/Cholo","/wiki/Citizen","/wiki/National_identity","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Bolivia)","/wiki/Daniel_Salamanca","/wiki/La_Paz","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-884964-18-4","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/32029228","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Bolivia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flag_of_Bolivia.svg/30px-Flag_of_Bolivia.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Bolivia-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Bolivia-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bolivia-politician-stub&action=edit","/wiki/Bolivia","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Flag_of_Bolivia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Bolivia.svg.png","/wiki/File:Quill_and_ink.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Quill_and_ink.svg/30px-Quill_and_ink.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Bolivia-writer-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Bolivia-writer-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bolivia-writer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&oldid=544183526","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1878_births","/wiki/Category:1956_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_La_Paz","/wiki/Category:Bolivian_people_of_Aymara_descent","/wiki/Category:Bolivian_writers","/wiki/Category:Bolivian_people_of_Spanish_descent","/wiki/Category:Foreign_ministers_of_Bolivia","/wiki/Category:Liberal_Party_(Bolivia)_politicians","/wiki/Category:Bolivian_politician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Bolivian_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:South_American_writer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Franz+Tamayo&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Franz+Tamayo","/wiki/Franz_Tamayo","/wiki/Talk:Franz_Tamayo","#","/wiki/Franz_Tamayo","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Franz_Tamayo","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Franz_Tamayo","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&oldid=544183526","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2367617","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Franz_Tamayo&id=544183526","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Franz+Tamayo","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Franz+Tamayo&oldid=544183526&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Franz_Tamayo&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tamayo","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Tamayo","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2367617#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_
