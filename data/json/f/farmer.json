originally used to describe a tenant\npaying a leasehold rent (a farm), often for holding a lord's manorial demesne.\nThe use of the word was eventually extended to mean any tenant or owner of a\nlarge holding, though when Gregory King estimated that that there were 150,000\nfarmers in the late seventeenth century he evidently defined them by their\ntenures, as freeholders were counted separately.\"</ref> (also called an\n'agriculturer') is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for\nfood or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some\ncombination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other\nlivestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on\nland owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm\nowner, while employees of the farm are farm workers, farmhands, etc.\n","title":"farmer","headings":["History","Types","Farming organizations","Income","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Agriculture","2: Market","2: Goat","2: Horse","2: Agribusiness","2: Organic_farming","1: Employment","1: Rancher","1: Grazier","1: Canadian_dollar","1: Demesne","1: Gregory_King","1: Crops","1: Orchard","1: Vineyard","1: Poultry","1: Livestock","1: Farm","1: Neolithic","1: Bronze_Age","1: Sumerians","1: Division_of_labour","1: Ancient_Egyptian","1: Nile","1: Animal_husbandry","1: Dog","1: Sheep","1: Asia","1: Domestic_pig","1: Middle_East","1: China","1: Mugan_plain","1: Domestication","1: Cattle","1: Domestic_sheep","1: Ranching","1: Chicken","1: Duck","1: Goose","1: Meat","1: Feather","1: Agricultural_policy","1: Subsidy","1: Tax_deduction","1: Developing_nation","1: Subsistence_agriculture","1: Crop_rotation","1: Seed_saving","1: Slash_and_burn","1: Developed_nation","1: Gardener","1: Hobbyist","1: Poverty","1: Local_food","1: The_National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry","1: Fédération_Nationale_des_Syndicats_d'Exploitants_d'Agricoles","1: Genetically_modified_food","1: International_Federation_of_Agricultural_Producers","1: Farmers'_market","1: Agroecology","1: Corporate_farming","1: Family_farm","1: Farmworker","1: Gardening","1: Landed_gentry","1: Pastoralism","1: Peasant","1: Sustainable_agriculture","1: Agricultural_History_Review","1: Iowa_State_University"]}
