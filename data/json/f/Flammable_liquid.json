Less-flammable liquids (with a\nflashpoint between 100 degrees and 200 degrees Fahrenheit) are defined as\n'combustible liquids'. This definition is used by the National Fire\nProtection Association, The US Department of Transportation, the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the US Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration and others.\n\nThese categories are further subdivided, depending on the liquid's flash point\nand boiling point.\n\n*Class IA flammable liquids have a flash point below 73 Â°F (the upper end of the\ncommon range of room temperature) and a boiling point below 100 Â°F *Class IB\nflammable liquids have a flash point below 73 Â°F and a boiling point greater\nthan or equal to 100 Â°F *Class IC flammable liquids have a flash point greater\nthan or equal to 73 Â°F and below 100 Â°F\n\n*Class II combustible liquids have a flash point greater than or equal to 100 Â°F\nand below 140 Â°F *Class IIIA combustible liquids have a flash point greater than\nor equal to 140 Â°F and below 200 Â°F *Class IIIB combustible liquids have a flash\npoint greater than or equal to 200 Â°F\n","linknr":115,"url":"Flammable_liquid","recorded":1362666838,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://avatarcorp.com/msds/MSDS_0160_01_Canola_RBD.pdf"],"categories":["Fuels"],"headings":["Examples of flammable liquids","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flammable_liquid.svg/220px-Flammable_liquid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg/35px-Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Flash_point","National_Fire_Protection_Association","United_States_Department_of_Transportation","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","US_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Flash_point","Boiling_point","Room_temperature","CAS_Number","Flash_point","Autoignition_Temperature","Acetone","Biodiesel","Dimethyl_ether","Diesel_fuel","Ethanol","Diethyl_ether","Gasoline","Jet_fuel","Kerosene","Methanol","Nitromethane","Vegetable_oil","Fire_prevention","Fire_protection","Flammability","List_of_R-phrases"]}
