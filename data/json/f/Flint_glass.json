Flint glasses are arbitrarily defined as having an Abbe number of\n50 to 55 or less. The currently known flint glasses have refractive indices\nranging between 1.45 and 2.00. A concave lens of flint glass is commonly\ncombined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet\nlens because of their compensating optical properties, which reduces chromatic\naberration (colour defects).\n\nWith respect to glass, the term flint derives from the flint nodules found in\nthe chalk deposits of southeast England that were used as a source of high\npurity silica by George Ravenscroft, circa 1662, to produce a potash lead glass\nthat was the precursor to English lead crystal.\n\nTraditionally, flint glasses were lead glasses containing around 4â60% lead\noxide; however, the manufacture and disposal of these glasses were sources of\npollution. In many modern flint glasses, the lead can be replaced with other\nadditives such as titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide without significantly\naltering the optical properties of the glass.\n\nFlint glass can be fashioned into rhinestones which are used as diamond\nsimulants.\n\nElectric Bulbs and Spectacle glasses are made of Flint glass.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Flint_glass","recorded":1362481652,"links":21,"instances":["optics","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass compositions","Diamond simulants"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Lens6b-en.svg/220px-Lens6b-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crown_glass","optics"],["dispersion","optics"],["lens","optics#types_of_simple_lenses"],["lens","optics#types_of_simple_lenses"],["crown_glass","optics"],["crown_glass","optics"]],"members":["crown_glass","lens","dispersion"],"related":["Crown_glass_(optics)","Glass","Refractive_index","Abbe_number","Dispersion_(optics)","Crown_glass_(optics)","Achromatic_doublet","Chromatic_aberration","Flint","George_Ravenscroft","Potash","Lead_glass","Lead_crystal","Lead_glass","Lead_oxide","Pollution","Titanium_dioxide","Zirconium_dioxide","Rhinestone","Diamond_simulant","Crown_glass_(optics)","Chromatic_aberration","Cup_plate"]}
