{"cursor":"2121","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Falling' is a real-time card game from James Ernest in which all players are\nfalling from the sky for no apparent reason. The object of the game is to hit\nthe ground last. As the box copy says, \"It's not much of a goal, but it's all\nyou could think of on the way down.\" {{cite journal\n | title=Falling (Review)\n | url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=129 journal=Pyramid\n | (online) publisher=Steve Jackson Games last=Karakash first=John date=1998-05-\n | 29 accessdate=2008-02-23}}\n\nThe game has an uncommon element in card games, in that one player is a dealer\nwhose only role is to smoothly pass out cards in front of the other player. All\nplayers may play cards simultaneously, as in other real-time games like [[Brawl\n(game)|Brawl]] and [[Fightball]]. A game takes about a minute to play before\neveryone hits the ground with predictable results.\n\nThe players receive stacks of cards, and try to cope with them as quickly and\naccurately as they can. At any time, a player may take the top card from any\nstack belonging to him or her, and then must play it before doing anything else.\nSome cards are called riders, and can be played on oneself or any other player\n(except the dealer). These have effects such as creating an extra pile in front\nof a player, or giving a player an extra card when the dealer gets to him or\nher. Other cards cancel or move the effects of riders between players. When\nencountering riders, the dealer immediately removes them and implements their\neffects, then moves to the next player.\n\nOn the bottom of the deck are five Ground cards: when a player get a Ground\ncard, he or she is out, and the last player to hit the Ground wins.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Falling_(game)","recorded":1374549145,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Real-time_card_game","/wiki/James_Ernest","#cite_note-Pyramid-1","/wiki/Card_game","/wiki/Card_game#Deal","/wiki/Brawl_(game)","/wiki/Fightball","#cite_note-Pyramid-1","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Pyramid_1-0","#cite_ref-Pyramid_1-1","http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=129","/wiki/Pyramid_(magazine)","/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.cheapass.com/","http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/75","/wiki/BoardGameGeek","/wiki/File:Quads_A.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Quads_A.svg/35px-Quads_A.svg.png","/wiki/Card_game","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Card-game-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Card-game-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Card-game-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&oldid=547814360","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dedicated_deck_card_games","/wiki/Category:Cheapass_Games_games","/wiki/Category:Paizo_Publishing_games","/wiki/Category:Card_game_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Falling+%28game%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Falling+%28game%29","/wiki/Falling_(game)","/wiki/Talk:Falling_(game)","#","/wiki/Falling_(game)","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Falling_(game)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Falling_(game)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&oldid=547814360","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5432301","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Falling_%28game%29&id=547814360","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Falling+%28game%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Falling+%28game%29&oldid=547814360&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Falling_(game)&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5432301#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_(game)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["magazine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dedicated
