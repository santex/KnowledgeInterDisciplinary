It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is\n   temporary; some last only an afternoon while others may last as long as ten\n   weeks. Activities at fairs vary widely. Some trade fairs are important\n   regular business events either where products are traded between\n   businesspeople, as at the Frankfurt Book Fair, where publishers sell book\n   rights in other markets to other publishers, or where products are showcased\n   to consumers, as for example in agricultural districts where they present\n   opportunities to display and demonstrate the latest machinery on the market\n   to farmers.\n\nFairs are also known by many different names around the world, such as\nagricultural show, fÍte, county fair, exhibition or state fair, festival, market\nand show.
