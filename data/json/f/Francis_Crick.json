Watson. He, Watson, and Maurice Wilkins were jointly awarded the\n1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning\nthe molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information\ntransfer in living\nmaterial\". [http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1962/index.html The\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962]. Nobel Prize Site for Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology or Medicine 1962.\n\nCrick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role\nin research related to revealing the genetic code. He is widely known for use of\nthe term \"central dogma\" to summarize an idea that genetic information flow in\ncells is essentially one-way, from DNA to RNA to protein. \n\nDuring the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer\nDistinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in\nLa Jolla, California. His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology\nand attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained\nin this post until his death; \"he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a\nscientist until the bitter end\" according to Christof Koch.\n","linknr":1271,"url":"Francis_Crick","recorded":1362483934,"links":112,"instances":["physicist","magazine","commonwealth","biochemistry","physicist","spirit","molecule","cell","physicist","uk","ship","systems","biology","physicist"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/franklingosling.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Y/X/_/scbbyx.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Y/X/_/scbbyx.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Z/L/_/scbbzl.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Z/L/_/scbbzl.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/G/F/_/scbbgf.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Z/Y/_/scbbzy.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/Z/Y/_/scbbzy.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/J/_/scbcbj.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/J/_/scbcbj.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/X/_/scbcbx.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/X/_/scbcbx.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/F/_/scbcff.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/J/_/scbccj.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/J/_/scbccj.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/P/_/scbccp.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/D/_/scbcfd.pdf","http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman_Crick_VisionResearch2005.pdf","http://www.cshlpress.com/pdf/sample/Crick.pdf","http://chem-faculty.ucsd.edu/joseph/CHEM13/DNA1.pdf","http://www.biochemist.org/bio/02605/0080/026050080.pdf","http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman_Crick_VisionResearch2005.pdf"],"categories":["1916
