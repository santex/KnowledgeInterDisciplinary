{"cursor":"6653","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn about 1934, in company with David Brown, Harry Ferguson formed the 'Ferguson-\nBrown Company' and the two men produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor\nwith a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. Ferguson surmised that the tractor\nhitch was the key to having a better plough and designed a simpler tractor\nattachment for it.\n\nIn 1938 Ferguson made a handshake agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson\nSystem Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson's own self-regulating three-point\nhitch system, beginning with the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is\nrecognizable by the blue Ford emblem on the front of the hood and the Ferguson\nSystem emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch\nattachment system among farmers in North America and around the world. This\ntractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used\nto power three point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This\nPTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.\n\nIn December 1945 Standard Motor Company Limited announced that an arrangement\nhad been made to manufacture Mr Harry Ferguson's world-famous tractors and\nStandard's newly acquired factory at Banner Lane Coventry would be used for the\nproject. These tractors would be for the Eastern hemisphere, Ferguson tractors\nbuilt by Ford in America for the Western hemisphere. Production was expected to\nstart in 1946. Implements would be sourced separately by Ferguson who would also\nmerchandise the tractors and the implements. Standard Motor Company Record\nTurnover And Profit, Mr. C. J. Band On Expansion Policy The Times, Friday, Dec\n21, 1945; pg. 10; Issue 50331\n\nIn 1946 the Ford Motor Company parted from Ferguson and a protracted lawsuit\nfollowed, involving Ford's continued use of Ferguson's patents. Ford altered the\nhydraulic design of its postwar tractors to avoid Ferguson's hydraulic system\npatent, but continued to produce machines equipped with the basic Ferguson hitch\narrangement. Equipped with the three-point hitch, the postwar Ford 8N became the\ntop-selling individual tractor of all time in North America.\n\nAfter the split with Ford, Ferguson took the opportunity to have the Standard\nMotor Company of the UK produce a new design, the Model TE20. The model name\ncame from Tractor, England but is affectionately known as the Little Grey\nFergie. There were several variants of the TE20; the first tractors were\ndesigned to run on petrol, and were known as the TEA20 following the\nintroduction of the TED20 which ran on TVO (tractor vapourising oil, similar to\nparaffin). Later a diesel model was introduced, the TEF20. There were other\nvariants with narrow wheelbases for working in vineyards and orchards, like the\nTEB20 and TEC20.\n\nIn all over 500,000 Little Grey Fergies were built between 1946 and 1956, and a\nsurprising number survive today. So successful was the TE20 that Ford nicknamed\nit the \"Grey Menace\" as sales of the tractor spread across the world. They were\neven used on an expedition to the South Pole in 1958 by Sir Edmund Hillary, a\ntestament to the durability of the machine. Ford ultimately settled the legal\nproceedings with a multi-million dollar sum that allowed Ferguson to further\nexpand his own manufacturing interests. Settlement In Suit Against Ford\nCompany Â£3M. Award To Fergusons The Times, Thursday, Apr 10, 1952; pg. 6; Issue\n52283\n\nThere is a monument in Wentworth on the junction of the Darling and Murray\nRivers in Australia commemorating the time in 1956 when both rivers flooded and\na fleet of little grey Fergies was used to build levee banks to save the town.\n\nThe principal feature of the Ferguson System was the three-point linkage. This\nallowed trailed implements to be supported on a hydraulic system with the two\ndrag links attached under the rear axle and a single compression link, connected\nto the upper rear transmission case, that was automatically regulating the\nhydraulic suspension's height. Thus the implement could be built at a minimum\nweight because it needed no attached wheels, manual controls and so on. It was\nalso assisting the tractor to maintain traction because it was applying a\ncombined drag and rotary force to the axle that kept the driving wheels, on that\naxle, on the ground and the steering wheels held onto the ground too.\nConsequently the \"rearing and bucking\" of overloaded tractors was overcome,\nmaking tractors much safer.\n\nFerguson designs for tractors were the first with single-wheel brakes that\nallowed the driver to turn sharply by braking the inside wheel. The TE20 was one\nof the first tractors to have a four-speed gearbox with integrated Differential\nand hydraulic system.\n\nIn 1953 Ferguson and Massey-Harris merged and the combined company Massey-Harris-\nFerguson (later shortened to Massey Ferguson) became the manufacturer of the\ntractors and other designs. By then many manufacturers had developed their own\nthree-point linkages and the linkage had become standardised worldwide.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Ferguson_Company","recorded":1363126317,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Ferguson_Tractor.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Ferguson_Tractor.JPG/220px-Ferguson_Tractor.JPG","/wiki/File:Ferguson_Tractor.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/David_Brown_(entrepreneur)","/wiki/Harry_Ferguson","/wiki/Tractor","/wiki/Hydraulic","/wiki/File:Jack_Robinson_Implement_Co.,_Blytheville,_Ark.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Jack_Robinson_Implement_Co.%2C_Blytheville%2C_Ark.jpg/220px-Jack_Robinson_Implement_Co.%2C_Blytheville%2C_Ark.jpg","/wiki/File:Jack_Robinson_Implement_Co.,_Blytheville,_Ark.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Henry_Ford","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company","/wiki/Patent","/wiki/Ford_N_Series_Tractors","/wiki/Standard_Motor_Company","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ferguson_TE20","/wiki/Petrol","/wiki/Tractor_vaporising_oil","/wiki/Kerosene","/wiki/Diesel_engine","/wiki/Wheelbase","/wiki/Vineyard","/wiki/Orchard","/wiki/Edmund_Hillary","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Wentworth,_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Darling_River","/wiki/Murray_River","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Levee","/wiki/Three-point_hitch","/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)","/wiki/Gearbox","/wiki/Differential_(automotive)","/wiki/Massey-Ferguson","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Ford_N_Series_Tractors","/wiki/Massey_Ferguson","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ferguson_vehicles","http://web.archive.org/web/20091027020936/http://geocities.com/MotorCity/Downs/9828/","http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/harryferguson.htm","http://www.ytmag.com/cgi-bin/ntracz.pl?m=massey","http://www.ytmag.com/cgi-bin/ntracz.pl?m=ferg","http://www.coventry.historians.co.uk/ferguson.html","http://www.ferguson-museum.co.uk/","http://www.abc.net.au/rural/mdbc/minutes/s669550.htm","http://www.masseyferguson.com","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&oldid=542504997","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Companies_established_in_1934","/wiki/Category:Tractor_manufacturers_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Companies_disestablished_in_1953","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ferguson+Company&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Ferguson+Company","/wiki/Ferguson_Company","/wiki/Talk:Ferguson_Company","#","/wiki/Ferguson_Company","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Ferguson_Company","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Ferguson_Company","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&oldid=542504997","/w/index.php?title=Ferguson_Company&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Ferguson_Comp
