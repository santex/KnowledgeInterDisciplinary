In 1896 he\nentered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied under the notable\nmathematicians Ulisse Dini and Luigi Bianchi. He gained some early fame when his\n1900 doctoral thesis, entitled [[Clifford parallel|Clifford's parallelism]] in\n[[elliptic space]]s, was discussed in a widely-read work on differential\ngeometry published by Bianchi in 1902.\n\nAfter earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships. In 1901 he\nbegan teaching at the University of Catania in Sicily; shortly afterwards he\nmoved to the University of Genoa; and in 1908 he moved to the Politecnico in\nTurin and then the University of Turin, where he would stay for a few decades.\n\nDuring this time his research focused primarily on topics in mathematical\nanalysis, especially differential equations, functional analysis, and complex\nanalysis; but he also studied the calculus of variations, group theory, non-\nEuclidean geometry, and projective geometry, among other topics. With the\noutbreak of World War I, he shifted his work towards more applied topics,\nstudying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an\napplied direction, applying results from this work to problems in electrical\ncircuits and acoustics.\n\nIn 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, Benito Mussolini's\nFascists adopted the anti-Jewish policies advocated for several years by Adolf\nHitler's Nazis. As a Jew, Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so\naccepted an invitation by Princeton University to teach there; he died in New\nYork City four years later.\n","title":"Guido%20Fubini","headings":["Books by G.
