{"cursor":"1771","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fosterville' is a Canadian rural community located in western York County, New\nBrunswick mainly on Route 122\n\nSituated on the CanadaâUnited States border in the parish of North Lake,\nFosterville has a small population but is popular in the summer months with\ncottage owners from the state of Maine and surrounding areas in New Brunswick.\n\nThe community was home to a school up until the late 1980s when it was closed by\nthe New Brunswick Department of Education. The building was taken over by the\ncommunity and turned into a community centre. In 2004 the building was removed\nand replaced with a new, modern structure to meet the needs of the parish. The\nlocal Fire Department is also based in Fosterville as well as a church.\n\nOn November 26, 1924 two young girls from the town where murdered in their half-\nuncles cabin. Darius Thornton, who changed his name to Harry D. Williams to\nevade his ex-wife, shot both of the girls in the head. Thornton had served in\nthe Canadian military for four years, and was well liked by the community. It is\nbelieved that Thornton had a strong interest in The older of the two\ngirls.
