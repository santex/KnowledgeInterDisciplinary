{"cursor":"25550","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fuel efficiency' is a form of thermal efficiency, meaning the efficiency of a\nprocess that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into\nkinetic energy or work. Overall fuel efficiency may vary per device, which in\nturn may vary per application fuel efficiency, especially fossil fuel power\nplants or industries dealing with combustion, such as ammonia production during\nthe Haber process.\n\nIn the context of transport, fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a\nparticular vehicle, and is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of\nfuel consumed. Fuel economy is expressed in miles per gallon (mpg) in the USA\nand usually also in the UK—there is sometimes confusion as the imperial\ngallon is 20% larger then the US gallon so that mpg values are not directly\ncomparable. In countries using the metric system fuel economy is stated in\nkilometres per litre (km/L) in the Netherlands, Denmark and in several Latin\nAmerican or Asian countries such as India, Japan, South\nKorea [http://www.cmsindia.org/Anup.pdf] , or as the reciprocal ratio,\n\"fuel consumption\" in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) in much of\nEurope, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Litres per mil are used in Norway\nand Sweden.\n\nWeight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for\nfreight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Fuel_efficiency","recorded":1362483624,"links":21,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":["http://www.cmsindia.org/Anup.pdf","http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_railways/documents/page/dft_railways_611287.pdf"],"categories":["Energy economics","Physical quantities","Energy conservation","Transport economics"],"headings":["Vehicle design","Fleet efficiency","Energy efficiency terminology","Energy content of fuel","Fuel efficiency of vehicles","Fuel efficiency in microgravity","Transportation","Driving technique","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/4/f/e4fab61de8a051ecda21aacc25238ffc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/d/9dd4e461268c8034f5c8564e155c67a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/1/9b1ead6217f1b57372125ef2952db3b7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drag","physics"]],"members":["drag"],"related":["Thermal_efficiency","Fuel","Kinetic_energy","Mechanical_work","Fossil_fuel_power_plant","Ammonia","Haber_process","Transport","Ratio","Motor_fuel","Mile","Gallon","Metric_system","Netherland","Denmark","Latin_America","India","Japan","South_Korea","Liter","Kilometers","Scandinavian_mile","Norway","Sweden","Freight","Engine","Drag_(physics)","Rolling_resistance","Hybrid_vehicles","Distance","Fuel_economy_in_automobiles","Kilowatt_hour","Center_for_Transportation_Analysis","Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory","British_thermal_unit","Gallon","US_gallon","Octane_rating","Gasoline","Gasoline","Autogas","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Propane","Butane","Ethanol_fuel","Methanol","Alcohol_fuel","E85","Diesel_fuel","Cetane_number","BioDiesel","Cetane_number","WVO","Aviation_gasoline","Jet_fuel","Jet_fuel","Liquefied_natural_gas","Liquid_hydrogen","Gibbs_free_energy","Brake_specific_fuel_consumption","Brake_specific_fuel_consumption","Multiplicative_inverse","Distributive","Supermini_car","Motorway","Carbon_dioxide","North_America","Mid-size_car","Full-size_car","SUV","Pickup_truck","V8_engine","Microcar","Turbocharger","Daimler_AG","Volkswagen_Group","Diesel_engine","Energy_conversion_efficiency","Gross_vehicle_weight_rating","National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration","Microgravity","Convection","Zero_gravity","Outer_space","Sphere","Diffusion_flame","Premixed_flame","Natural_gas_vehicle","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Biofuel","CO2","CO2","Air_conditioner","Hypermiler","Prius","Wayne_Gerdes","Honda_Accord","Acura_MDX","Electric_vehicles","Railway","Overhead_lines","Diesel-electric_transmission","Eurostar","Renewable_energy","Electric_generation","Hydrogen_vehicle","Fuel_cell","Natural_gas_vehicle","Electrolysis","Hydroelectricity","Thorium_fuel_cycle","Molten_salt_reactor","Annual_fuel_utilization_efficiency","ACEA_agreement","Alternative_propulsion","Association_for_the_Study_of_Peak_Oil_and_Gas","Carbon_dioxide_equivalent","Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy","EcoAuto","Emission_standard","Energy_content_of_Biofuel","Energy_conservation","Energy_conversion_efficiency","Energy_density","Fuel_economy_in_automobiles","Fuel_economy-maximizing_behaviors","Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation","Gas-guzzler","Heating_value","Life_cycle_assessment","Low-energy_vehicle","Low-rolling_resistance_tires","Marine_fuel_management"]}
