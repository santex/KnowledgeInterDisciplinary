Businesses are\n  | predominant in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned\n  | and administered to provide service to its customers. Businesses may also be\n  | not-for-profit or state-owned. A business owned by multiple individuals may\n  | be referred to as a company, although that term also has a more precise\n  | meaning.\n\nThe etymology of \"business\" relates to the state of being busy either as an\nindividual or society, as a whole, doing commercially viable and profitable\nwork. The term \"business\" has at least three usages, depending on the\nscope&nbsp;— the singular usage to mean a particular organization; the\ngeneralized usage to refer to a particular market sector, \"the music business\"\nand compound forms such as agribusiness; and the broadest meaning, which\nencompasses all activity by the community of suppliers of goods and services.\nHowever, the exact definition of business, like much else in the philosophy of\nbusiness, is a matter of debate and complexity of meanings. <!-- This article is\nconcerned primarily with the first definition of individual businesses, but also\ncontains links to general business and management topics, in the sense of the\nsecond definition.-->\n",
