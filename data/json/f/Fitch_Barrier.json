Impact\nattenuators are designed to absorb the colliding vehicle's kinetic energy. http://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-\ndevices/crumple-zone1.htm They may also be designed to redirect the\nvehicle away from the hazard or away from roadway machinery and workers. [h-\nttp://www.extranet.vdot.state.va.us/locdes/GRIT/Appendices%5CAppendix6.pdf 03-21-00_.PDF ] Impact attenuators are usually placed in front of\nfixed structures near freeways, such as gore points, Jersey barrier\nintroductions, or overpass supports and temporary versions can be used for road\nconstruction projects.\n\nTruck-mounted versions (TMA), similar to railcar buffers, can be deployed on\nvehicles that are prone to being struck from behind, such as snow plows and\nroad construction or maintenance vehicles. Work zone regulations often\nspecify a minimum buffer distance between the attenuator truck and the work\narea, and a minimum mass for the truck, to minimize the chances that the\ntruck will be pushed forward by a crash into the workers or machinery. This\nis especially important in mobile work zones, where the truck's parking brake\nmay not be engaged.\n\nImpact attenuators can be categorized by the method used to dissipate\nkinetic energy:\n# Momentum transfer. Many early models used successive rows of sand- or water-\n# filled barrels or modules. Momentum is transferred to the sand or water,\n# reducing the speed of the impacting vehicle. Material deformation. Many newer\n# attenuators use crushable materials that create a crumple zone, absorbing\n# energy. Others flatten a corrugated steel guard rail section, or split a steel\n# box beam. Friction. Some attenuators work by forcing a steel cable or strap\n# through an angled slot or tube, converting kinetic energy into heat.\n\nIn the United States, impact attenuators are tested and classified according to\nAASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), which superseded the Federal\nHighway Administration\n[http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/roadway_dept/policy_guide/road_hardware/nchrp_350/\nNCHRP Report 350]. Classification is based on the maximum speed of a vehicle\nduring a collision for which the attenuator is designed.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Fitch_Barrier","recorded":1362890058,"links":17,"instances":["driver","rail_transport","road"],"pdf":["http://www.extranet.vdot.state.va.us/locdes/GRIT/Appendices%5CAppendix6.pdf","http://www.racesafety.com/pdf/saltlaketribune.pdf"],"categories":["Road safety","Road infrastructure"],"headings":["Fitch Barrier","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Impact_Attenuator_In_Auckland.jpg/220px-Impact_Attenuator_In_Auckland.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/FitchBarrels2008.jpg/220px-FitchBarrels2008.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Autoroute_icone.svg/30px-Autoroute_icone.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gore","road"],["buffer","rail_transport"],["john_fitch","driver"],["gore","road"]],"members":["john_fitch","buffer","gore"],"related":["Motor_vehicle","Kinetic_energy","Freeway","Gore_(road)","Jersey_barrier","Overpass","Buffer_(rail_transport)","Snow_plow","Crumple_zone","United_States","AASHTO","Federal_Highway_Administration","Race_car_driver","John_Fitch_(driver)","Strafing","World_War_II","Guard_rail","Highway","Gore_(road)","Kinetic_energy","Traffic_barrier","Crumple_zone"]}
