Flushing dogs are different from other gundog types such as pointers\nand setters, dogs which remain still after locating the game, or retrievers,\ndogs that fetch the game after it has been shot. Some types of dogs have been\nspecially bred for flushing ability, such as cockers and other spaniels. Other\nbreeds of gundog are also often trained as flushing dogs, especially retrievers.\nMost flushing dogs are very people-friendly and make excellent companions and\npets.
