In older firearms, the propellant was typically black\npowder, but modern firearms use smokeless powder or other propellants. Most\nmodern firearms (with the notable exception of smoothbore firearms) have rifled\nbarrels to impart spin to the projectile for improved flight stability.\n\nModern firearms are typically described by their bore diameter (75mm) or calibre\n(.357) or gauge (12 ga.), the type of action employed (muzzle, breech, lever,\nbolt, revolver, semi-automatic, or automatic) together with the usual means of\ndeportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). They may be further distinguished\nby reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and the barrel length (19\ninch), the design's primary intended target (anti-aircraft), or the commonly\naccepted name for a particular variation (Gatling gun).\n\nFirearms may sometimes be referred to as small arms when they are intended\nprimarily for use by military forces if they can be carried by a single\nindividual.\n\nFirearms are aimed visually at their targets by hand using either iron sights or\noptical sights. The accurate range of pistols is generally limited to , while\nmost rifles are accurate to using iron sights, or longer ranges using optical\nsights. (Firearm rounds may be dangerous or lethal well beyond their accurate\nrange; minimum distance for safety is much greater than specified range.) Some\npurpose-built sniper rifles are accurate to ranges of more than . A successful\nsniper attack has been made from slightly more than .\n\nThe manufacture of firearms is a large industry. According to the National\nShooting Sports Foundation (N.S.S.F.), a trade association for the US firearms\nindustry, all economic activity from firearm manufacturing, distribution, and\nother ancillary activities totaled US$27.8 billion in 2010 in the United\nStates.<ref></ref>\n",
