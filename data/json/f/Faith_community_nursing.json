{"cursor":"7425","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Faith Community Nursing', also known as 'Parish Nursing', 'Parrish Nursing',\n'Congregational Nursing' or 'Church Nursing', is a movement of over 15,000\nregistered nurses, primarily in the United States. There are also Parish nurses\nin Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kienya, Korea,\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan,\nScotland, Singapore, South Africa, Swaziland, Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and\nZimbabwe. Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the\nintentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and\nprevention and minimization of illness within the context of a community of\nfaith. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of\nnursing so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the\npopulation which faith community nurses serve.\n\nParish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr.\nGranger Westberg as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done\nby religious orders, such as the \"Parish Deaconesses\" in Europe and America in\nthe 1800s. Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the\nhistoric practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic\nassumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of\nGod's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations. There\nare Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in\nsimilar capacities within other faith traditions.\n\nFaith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a specialty nursing practice.\nFaith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice was approved by the\nAmerican Nurses Association in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the\nspecialty as \"...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses\non the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting\nholistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community.\"\n(American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards\nof Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith\nCommunity Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and\npriorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice\nevaluation. Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that\nserve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.\n\nTo become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2\nyears experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith\ncommunity is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for\nthe specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association. There\nare several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which\nhave been developed by a panel of nursing faculty. These are offered though a\npartnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more\nthan 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad. Faith\ncommunity nurses serve in several roles, including: â¢ Health advisor â¢ Educator\non health issues â¢ Visit church members at home or in the hospital â¢ Make\nreferrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed\nhealth services â¢ Develop support groups within the church â¢ Train and\ncoordinate volunteers â¢ Provide health screenings\n\nIt is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide\npatient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of\nreferrals for services in the community. They coordinate existing services and\nsupplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring. A parish nurse\nprogram or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways.\nThese include: one church supporting their own full or part-time nurse, several\nchurches supporting one nurse, a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or\nseveral churches or a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a\nchurch or churches as part of his or her job. Of the several thousand faith\ncommunity nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated for their ministry.\nIn the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health\nMinistries Association with is the national professional membership organization\nfor faith community nurses. They also have available the International Parish\nNurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others.\n\nThe Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care\nMinistry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas. It began\nwith an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses\nfrom various denominations and they were commissioned on 27 February 2005.\n\nInitially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were\nintroduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of\nDiocese 2000 & Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and\nTurks & Caicos Islands.\n\nTo date, we have over sixty persons trained and actively engaged in the ministry\nas either Parish Nurses or Health & Wellness Carers. Since the ministry began in\n2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care\nMinistry [Parish Nursing] Council. However, effective 7 March 2008 the name\nchanged to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council.\n\nIt is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme\nwill spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean. To\nthis end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and\nby extension the Caribbean Council of Churches.
