It covers public\nbodies over which the Scottish Parliament has jurisdiction, fulfilling a\nsimilar purpose to the UK-level Freedom of Information Act 2000. It, too, came\ninto force at the beginning of 2005.\n\nNot all public bodies situated in Scotland fall under this remit - Scottish-\nbased departments of the Ministry of Defence, for example, are not subject to\nthe Scottish Parliament, and thus would be covered by the 2000 Act not the 2002\nAct. Similarly the Scottish parts of UK-wide bodies such as the Forestry\nCommission (which is headquartered in Scotland) are subject to the 2000 Act\nrather than the 2002 Act, even though they fall within the remit of the Scottish\nParliament. The Act also created a Scottish Information Commissioner, whose\nduties were similar to those of the Information Commissioner, but limited to the\nbodies covered by the 2002 Act.\n\nWhilst the two Acts are similar in principle, there are some significant\ndifferences in implementation; as a rule, the Scottish Act is more strongly\nworded. For example, the Scottish test for public interest is stated in terms of\n\"substantial prejudice\" rather than \"prejudice\", which is clearly a higher\nstandard, and imposes a stricter time limit in cases where public interest has\nto be considered. It contains explicit mention of disability access rights and\nthe duties incumbent on a body which does not have the information requested,\nboth of which are lacking in the 2000 Act, and provides for an objective test\n(rather than \"the reasonable opinion of a qualified person\") to determine if the\npublic interest means information should be withheld.\n\nThe 2002 Act established a Scottish Information Commissioner, but no tribunal;\nany appeals against the Commissioner would go to the Court of Session.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002","recorded":1372154890,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg/140px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg.png","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Jim_Wallace,_Baron_Wallace_of_Tankerness","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Coming_into_force","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000","http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/billsPassed/billsum-s1.htm#P1040_84841","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020013_en_1","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id?title=Freedom+of+Information+%28Scotland%29+Act+2002","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_public_bodies","/wiki/Jurisdiction","/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Forestry_Commission","/wiki/Scottish_Information_Commissioner","/wiki/Information_Commissioner%27s_Office","/wiki/Public_interest","/wiki/Disability_access_rights","/wiki/Tribunal","/wiki/Court_of_Session","/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Freedom_of_information_in_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2002/20020437.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2003/20030477.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2004/20040203.htm","/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_Information_(Scotland)_Act_2002&action=edit&section=3","http://www.scotland-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/20020013.htm","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/government/foi","http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/home/ScottishInformationCommissioner.asp","/wiki/Template:Freedom_of_information","/wiki/Template_talk:Freedom_of_information","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Freedom_of_information&action=edit","/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country","/wiki/Freedom_of_information_in_Canada","/wiki/Censorship_in_France#Freedom_of_information","/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act","/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000","/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)","/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England_to_1483","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1485%E2%80%931601","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1603%E2%80%931641","/wiki/List_of_Ordinances_and_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1642%E2%80%931660","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1660%E2%80%931699","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England,_1700%E2%80%931706","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Scotland_to_1707","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland_to_1700","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Ireland,_1701%E2%80%931800","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1707%E2%80%931719","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1720%E2%80%931739","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1740%E2%80%931759","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1760%E2%80%931779","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain,_1780%E2%80%931800","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1801%E2%80%931819","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom,_1820%E2%80
