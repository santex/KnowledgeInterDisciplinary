It is an important discipline in many branches of\nmanufacturing industry, such as the electronics industry, where it is a vital\ntool used in the development of new products and for the improvement of existing\nproducts. There are many companies which provide services to find the cause of\nfailure analysis in products, devices and in post disaster situations. http://www.rjlg.com/expertise/failure-\nanalysis.aspx http://www.intertek.com/analytical-\nlaboratories The failure analysis process relies on collecting failed\ncomponents for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a\nwide array of methods, especially microscopy and spectroscopy. The NDT or\nnondestructive testing methods are valuable because the failed products are\nunaffected by analysis, so inspection always starts using these methods.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Failure_analysis","recorded":1362485836,"links":16,"instances":["materials_science","material"],"pdf":["http://www.nenastran.com/newnoran/conferencePaper2/08_CPFiniteElementImplementationAdvancedFailureCriteriaComposites.pdf"],"categories":["Failure","Reliability engineering","Semiconductor analysis","Maintenance","Problem solving"],"headings":["Forensic investigation","Failure analysis engineers","Methods of analysis","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","material"],["characterization","materials_science"]],"members":["characterization","fatigue"],"related":["Failure","Microscopy","Spectroscopy","Nondestructive_testing","Forensic","Forensic_engineering","Fatigue_(material)","Brittle","Stress_corrosion_cracking","Environmental_stress_cracking","Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis","Fault_tree_analysis","Prototyping","Precautionary_principle","Optical_microscope","Liquid_crystal","Scanning_acoustic_microscope","Atomic_force_microscope","Stereomicroscope","X-ray_microscope","Infra-red","Scanning_SQUID_microscope","Jet-etcher","Plasma_etcher","Back_side_thinning_tools","Mechanical_back-side_thinning","Laser_chemical_back-side_etching","Transmission_line","Auger_electron_spectroscopy","Deep-level_transient_spectroscopy","Focused_ion_beam","Dye_penetrant_inspection","Surface_analysis_tools","Scanning_electron_microscope","Electron_beam_induced_current","Charge-induced_voltage_alteration","Voltage_contrast","Electron_backscatter_diffraction","Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy","Transmission_electron_microscope","Optical_beam_induced_current","Light-induced_voltage_alteration","Laser-assisted_device_alteration","Thermal_laser_stimulation","Thermal_laser_stimulation","Thermal_laser_stimulation","Thermal_laser_stimulation","Thermal_laser_stimulation","Mechanical_probe_station","Electron_beam_prober","Laser_voltage_prober","Time-resolved_photon_emission_prober","CAD_Navigation","Automatic_test_pattern_generation","Metallurgical_failure_analysis","Acronyms_in_microscopy","List_of_materials_analysis_methods","List_of_materials-testing_resources","Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis","Failure_rate","Forensic_electrical_engineering","Forensic_engineering","Forensic_materials_engineering","Forensic_polymer_engineering","Forensic_science","Microscope","Material_science","Sample_preparation_equipment","Accident_analysis","Characterization_(materials_science)","Failure_reporting,_analysis_and_corrective_action_systems"]}
