Framework decisions were similar to directives in that\nthey required member states to achieve particular results without dictating the\nmeans of achieving that result. Lebeck, Carl, [http://germanlawjournal.net/pdfs/Vol08No05/PDF_Vol_08_No_05_501-\n532_Articles_Lebeck.pdf Sliding Towards Supranationalism? The Constitutional\nStatus of EU Framework Decisions after Pupino], 8(5) German Law Journal 501 at\n507. However unlike directives, framework decisions were not capable of\ndirect effect, they were only subject to the optional\njurisdiction of the European Court of Justice Article 35 of the Treaty on\nEuropean Union (Treaty of Nice Version) (OJ C 325, 24 December 2002, p 1).\nand enforcement proceedings could not be taken by the European Commission for\nany failure to transpose a framework decision into domestic law.\n\nFramework decisions were created in the Amsterdam Treaty and replaced joint\nactions which were legal instruments available under the Maastricht Treaty. The\nLisbon Treaty abolished framework decisions and the EU can now enact directives\nand regulations in the area of criminal justice by means of the ordinary\nlegislative procedure.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Framework_decision","recorded":1362559163,"links":16,"instances":["european_union","law","european_union"],"pdf":["http://www.statewatch.org/analyses/no-199-uk-opt-out.pdf","http://www.statewatch.org/analyses/no-199-uk-opt-out.pdf"],"categories":["European Union law"],"headings":["Legal basis","Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice","List of framework decisions","See also","Footnotes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directive","european_union"],["transposition","law"],["regulation","european_union"],["directive","european_union"],["regulation","european_union"]],"members":["regulation","transposition","directive"],"related":["European_Union","Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters","Directive_(European_Union)","Direct_effect","European_Court_of_Justice","European_Commission","Transposition_(law)","Amsterdam_Treaty","Maastricht_Treaty","Regulation_(European_Union)","Ordinary_legislative_procedure","European_Court_of_Justice","Preliminary_ruling","Maastricht_Treaty","European_Union_member_states","European_Commission","Directive_(European_Union)","Regulation_(European_Union)"]}
