For example, the number 15 factors into\nprimes as 3 &times; 5, and the polynomial x<sup>2</sup> &minus; 4 factors as (x\n&minus; 2)(x + 2). In all cases, a product of simpler objects is obtained.\n\nThe aim of factoring is usually to reduce something to “basic building blocks,”\nsuch as numbers to prime numbers, or polynomials to irreducible polynomials.\nFactoring integers are covered by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and\nfactoring polynomials by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Viète's formulas\nrelate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots.\n\nThe opposite of polynomial factorization is expansion, the multiplying\ntogether of polynomial factors to an “expanded” polynomial, written as just a\nsum of terms.\n\nInteger factorization for large integers appears to be a difficult problem.\nThere is no known method to carry it out quickly. Its complexity is the basis of\nthe assumed security of some public key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA.\n\nA matrix can also be factorized into a product of matrices of special types, for\nan application in which that form is convenient. One major example of this uses\nan orthogonal or unitary matrix, and a triangular matrix. There are different\ntypes: QR decomposition, LQ, QL, RQ, RZ.\n\nAnother example is the factorization of a function as the composition of other\nfunctions having certain properties; for example, every function can be viewed\nas the composition of a surjective function with an injective function. This\nsituation is generalized by factorization systems.\n","title":"Factorization","headings":["Integers","Polynomials","Matrices","Euclidean domains","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic","2: Integer_factorization","2: Quadratic_formula","1: Mathematics","1: Number","1: Polynomial","1: Multiplication","1: Prime_number","1: Irreducible_polynomial","1: Polynomial_factorization","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra","1: Viète's_formulas","1: Polynomial_expansion","1: Divisor","1: Public_key_cryptography","1: Orthogonal_matrix","1: Unitary_matrix","1: Triangular_matrix","1: QR_decomposition","1: Function_composition","1: Surjective_function","1: Injective_function","1: Factorization_system","1: Integer","1: Prime_factorization","1: Primes","1: Algorithm","1: Quadratic_polynomial","1: Complex_numbers","1: Root_of_a_function","1: Vieta's_formulas","1: Quadratic_equation","1: Discriminant","1: Difference_of_two_squares","1: Polynomial_greatest_common_divisor","1: Geometric_series#Formula","1: Completing_the_square","1: Factorization_of_polynomials","1: Factor_theorem","1: FOIL_rule","1: Monoid_factorisation","1: Pascal's_triangle","1: Prime_factor","1: Fermat's_factorization_method","1: Euler's_factorization_method","1: Program_synthesis","1: Table_of_Gaussian_integer_factorizations","1: Unique_factorization_domain","1: Wolfram_Alpha"]}
