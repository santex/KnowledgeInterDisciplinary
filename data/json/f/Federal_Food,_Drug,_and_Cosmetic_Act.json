A principal author of this law was Royal S.\nCopeland, a three-term U.S. Senator from New\nYork. [http://www.homeowatch.org/history/reghx.html Homeopathic Drugs, Royal\nCopeland, and Federal Drug Regulation ] In\n1968, the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the\nFD&C. Also in that year the FDA formed the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation\n(DESI) to incorporate into FD&C regulations the recommendations from a National\nAcademy of Sciences investigation of effectiveness of previously marketed\ndrugs. [http://www.fda.gov/cder/about/history/time1.htm CDER - Time Line ] The act has been amended many times, most\nrecently to add requirements about bioterrorism preparations.\n\nThe introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100\npatients due to a sulfanilamide medication where diethylene glycol was used to\ndissolve the drug and make a liquid\nform. [http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/article_news.asp?CID=167&DID=2024&id=3659\nASHP Website : News Article ] See Elixir\nSulfanilamide disaster. It replaced the earlier Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act","recorded":1374544181,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/140px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress","http://research.archives.gov/description/299847","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act","/wiki/Title_21_of_the_United_States_Code","/wiki/United_States_Code","/wiki/Royal_S._Copeland","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Energy_and_Commerce","/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt","/wiki/1951_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetics_Act_Amendments","/wiki/1962_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetics_Act_Amendments","/wiki/Fair_Packaging_and_Labeling_Act","/wiki/Medical_Device_Regulation_Act","/w/index.php?title=Radiation_Control_for_Safety_and_Health_Act&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Drug_Price_Competition_and_Patent_Term_Restoration_Act_of_1984","/wiki/Nutrition_Labeling_and_Education_Act","/wiki/Safe_Medical_Device_Amendments_of_1990","/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_Revitalization_Act","/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_And_Education_Act_of_1994","/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_Modernization_Act_of_1997","/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_Amendments_Act_of_2007","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Template:Infobox_U.S._legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_U.S._legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_U.S._legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_States_Congress","/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","/wiki/Food_safety","/wiki/Royal_S._Copeland","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Drug_Efficacy_Study_Implementation","/wiki/United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bioterrorism","/wiki/Sulfanilamide","/wiki/Diethylene_glycol","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Elixir_Sulfanilamide_disaster","/wiki/Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act","#Contents","#Food_coloring","#Certifiable_colors","#Food_additives","#Definition_of_food_additive","#Genetically_modified_foods_are_regarded_as_containing_food_additives","#Homeopathic_medications","#Bottled_water","#Cosmetics","#Medical_devices","#Premarket_notification_.28510.28k.29.29","#Premarket_approval_.28PMA.29","#Related_legislation","#Significant_amendments_and_related_laws","#Comparison_to_state_laws","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Chewing_gum","/wiki/Drug","/wiki/Medical_device","/wiki/Dietary_supplement","/wiki/Private_law","/wiki/Criminal_law","/wiki/Commerce_clause","/wiki/Strict_liability","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Medical_devices","/wiki/Form_483","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Food_coloring","/wiki/Food_additive","/wiki/Generally_recognized_as_safe","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Brilliant_Blue_FCF","/wiki/Blue","/wiki/Indigotine","/wiki/Royal_blue","/wiki/Fast_Green_FCF","/wiki/Sea_green","/wiki/Erythrosine","/wiki/Cherry","/wiki/Red","/wiki/Allura_Red_AC","/wiki/Orange_(colour)","/wiki/Red","/wiki/Tartrazine","/wiki/Lemon_(color)","/wiki/Sunset_Yellow_FCF","/wiki/Orange_(colour)","/wiki/Orange_B","/wiki/Citrus_Red_No.2","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Generally_recognized_as_safe","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Genetic_engineering","/wiki/Genetically_modified_food","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Homeopathy","/w/index.php?title=Fed
