The\nprocess of soliciting and gathering fund is known as fundraising.\n\nSources of funding include credit, venture capital, donations, grants, savings,\nsubsidies, and taxes. Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants that\nhave no direct requirement for return of investment are described as \"'soft\nfunding'\" or \"crowdfunding\". Funding that facilitates the exchange of equity\nownership in a company for capital investment via an online funding portal as\nper the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (alternately, the \"JOBS Act of\n2012\") (U.S.) is known as 'equity crowdfunding'.\n\nFunds can be allocated for either short-term or long-term purposes.\n",
