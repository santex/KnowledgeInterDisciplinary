In January 1928 he\nreported what is now known as Griffith's Experiment, the first widely accepted\ndemonstrations of bacterial transformation, whereby a bacterium distinctly\nchanges its form and function.\n\nHe showed that [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], implicated in many cases of lobar\npneumonia, could transform from one strain into a\ndifferent strain. The observation was attributed to an unidentified transforming\nprinciple or transforming factor. This was later\nidentified as DNA.\n\nAmerica's leading pneumococcal researcher, Oswald T. Avery, speculated that\nGriffith had failed to apply adequate controls. A\ncautious and thorough researcher, and a reticent individual, Griffith's tendency\nwas to publish only findings that he believed truly significant, and Griffith's\nfindings were rapidly confirmed by researchers in Avery's laboratory. His discovery was one of the first to show the central role\nof DNA in heredity.\n","linknr":396,"url":"Frederick_Griffith","recorded":1362374043,"links":35,"instances":["microbiology","united_kingdom","biology"],"pdf":["http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/73/1/1.pdf","http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/73/1/1.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/CC/A/A/O/F/_/ccaaof.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/CC/A/A/I/K/_/ccaaik.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/CC/A/A/I/K/_/ccaaik.pdf"],"categories":["1879 births","1941 deaths","British pathologists","People from Hale, Greater Manchester"],"headings":["Early life","Ministry of Health office","Griffith's Experiment","Impact of Griffith's discovery","Posthumous identification of transforming factor","Griffith's further work and legacy","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f4/Griffithm.jpg/140px-Griffithm.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Fred_Griffith_and_%22Bobby%22_1936.jpg/190px-Fred_Griffith_and_%22Bobby%22_1936.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","biology"],["ministry_of_health","united_kingdom"],["capsule","microbiology"]],"members":["capsule","ministry_of_health","morphology"],"related":["Bacteriologist","Epidemiology","Pathology","Pneumonia","Griffith's_experiment","Bacterial_transformation","Morphology_(biology)","Physiology","Lobar_pneumonia","DNA","Oswald_T._Avery","Scientific_control","Cheshire","Liverpool_University","Liverpool_Royal_Infirmary","Tuberculosis","World_War_I","UK","Ministry_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)","William_M._Scott","World_War_II","Virulent","Capsule_(microbiology)","Polysaccharide","Peptidoglycan","Cell_wall","Phagocytosis","Innate_immune_system","Subcutaneous","Avirulent","Serology","Antigenicity","Fred_Neufeld","Robert_Koch","Robert_Koch_Institute","Berlin","Germany","Alphonse_Dochez","United_States","New_York_City","Rene_Dubos","Martin_Dawson","Robert_Koch","Robert_Koch_Institute","Grave's_disease","Strategic_bombing","London_Blitz","Obituary","Colin_MacLeod","Maclyn_McCarty","Chromosomes","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Biowarfare","Korean_War","Clinicians","Tonsillitis","Sequelae","Strep_throat","Scarlet_fever","Puerperal_fever","Streptococcal_sepsis","Streptomycin","Antibiotic_resistance","Erythromycin"]}
