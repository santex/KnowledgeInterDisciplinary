Collectively known as 'fig trees' or 'figs', they are native\nthroughout the tropics with a few species extending into the semi-warm temperate\nzone. The Common Fig (F. carica) is a temperate species native to southwest Asia\nand the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan to Portugal), which has been\nwidely cultivated from ancient times for its fruit, also referred to as 'figs'.\nThe fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only\nlocal economic importance or eaten as bushfood. However, they are extremely\nimportant food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of considerable cultural\nimportance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many\npractical uses.\n","title":"Ficus","headings":["Description","Ecology and uses","Cultural and spiritual significance","Fig fruit and reproduction system","Mutualism with the pollinating fig wasps","Selected species","List of famous fig trees","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Sycamore_Fig","4: Common_Fig","4: Fig_wasp","4: Miq.","3: Moraceae","3: Syconium","3: Weeping_Fig","3: Creeping_Fig","3: Sacred_Fig","2: Species","2: Inflorescence","2: Ostiole","2: Latex","2: Cambodia","2: Middle_East","2: Banyan","2: Sri_Maha_Bodhi","2: Hinduism","2: World_tree","2: Wavy-leaved_Fig","2: Bengali_language","2: Coevolution","2: Indian_Banyan","2: Indian_Rubber_Plant","2: Fiddle-leaved_Fig","2: Moreton_Bay_Fig","2: Chinese_Banyan","2: Roxburgh_Fig","2: Mistletoe_Fig","1: Plantae","1: Angiosperms","1: Eudicots","1: Rosids","1: Rosales","1: Charles_Gaudichaud-Beaupré","1: Carolus_Linnaeus","1: Genus","1: Tree","1: Shrub","1: Vine","1: Epiphyte","1: Hemiepiphyte","1: Tropics","1: Temperate","1: Asia","1: Mediterranean","1: Afghanistan","1: Portugal","1: Fruit","1: Bushfood","1: Ecological_niche","1: Evergreen","1: Pollination_syndrome","1: Agaonidae","1: Aerial_root","1: Pollination","1: Stipules","1: Fossil","1: Molecular_clock","1: Extant_taxon","1: Fig_leaf","1: Iconography","1: Rain_forest","1: Sandpaper_fig","1: Australia","1: Adaptive_radiation","1: Biogeographic","1: Alpha_diversity","1: Species_richness","1: Keystone_species","1: Rainforest","1: Ecosystem","1: Frugivores","1: Megabat","1: Capuchin_monkey","1: Colobinae","1: Mangabey","1: Bird","1: Megalaimidae","1: Columbidae","1: Hornbill","1: Cyclopsittacini","1: Bulbul","1: Taxon","1: Lepidoptera","1: Caterpillar","1: Danaus_chrysippus","1: Papilio_cresphontes","1: Badamia_exclamationis","1: Choreutidae","1: Copromorphidae","1: Moth","1: Citrus_long-horned_beetle","1: Wood","1: Sweet_Potato_Whitefly","1: Houseplant","1: Mummy","1: Casket","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Mesoamerica","1: Nahuatl","1: Barkcloth","1: Uganda","1: Ficus_benghalensis","1: Herbalism","1: Huexotzinco_Codex","1: Subfossil","1: 10th_millennium_BCE","1: Neolithic","1: Gilgal_I","1: Jericho","1: Parthenogenesis","1: Cereal","1: Anuradhapura","1: Islam","1: Sura","1: At-Tin","1: East_Asia","1: Buddhism","1: Jainism","1: Buddha","1: Sacred_fig","1: Sarasvati_River","1: Bible","1: Deuteronomy","1: False_fruit","1: Multiple_fruit","1: CEDICT","1: Pollinator","1: Gynoecium","1: Androdioecious","1: Gynodioecious","1: Lofty_fig","1: Mediterranean_region","1: Goat","1: Ficain","1: Parthenocarpic","1: Cultivar","1: Hawaii","1: Invasive_species","1: Speciation","1: Cryptic_species_complex","1: Cryptic_species_concept","1: Introgression","1: Backcrossing","1: Abbey_Tree","1: Phueng_Tree","1: Florida_Strangler_Fig","1: Thavital","1: Pakistan","1: Indian_fig","1: Short-leaved_Fig","1: Creek_Sandpaper_Fig","1: Round-leaved_Banana_Fig","1: Highland_Breadfruit","1: Tok_Pisin","1: Rubber_tree","1: Shiny_Sandpaper_Fig","1: Samoa","1: White-leaved_Fig","1: Ficus_kerkhovenii","1: Subspecies","1: Sulawesi","1: George_Bentham","1: Luganda","1: Small-leaved_Fig","1: Sweet_Sandpaper_Fig","1: Climbing_Fig","1: Desert_Fig","1: Banana_Fig","1: Ficus_pumila_var._awkeotsang","1: Cluster_Fig","1: Sanskrit","1: Port_Jackson_Fig","1: Sydney_Language","1: Rumpf's_Fig","1: Willow-leaved_Fig","1: Philippines","1: Ficus_superba_var._henneana","1: Dye_Fig","1: L.f.","1: Red-stipule_Fig","1: White_Fig","1: Gun-djeihmi","1: Ficus_virens_var._sublanceolata","1: New_South_Wales","1: Watkins'_Fig","1: Bodhi_tree","1: Charybdis_Fig_Tree","1: Odyssey","1: Curtain_Fig_Tree","1: Ficus_Ruminalis","1: Santa_Barbara's_Moreton_Bay_Fig_Tree","1: The_Great_Banyan","1: Clonal_colony","1: Vidurashwatha","1: Vidura","1: Wonderboom_Nature_Reserve","1: Abraham_Mauricio_Salazar","1: Amphoe_Pho_Sai","1: Amphoe_Suan_Phueng","1: Thailand","1: Edred_John_Henry_Corner","1: Fig_Newton","1: Fig-parrot","1: Figs_in_the_Bible","1: Figtree,_California","1: Figtree,_New_South_Wales","1: Figtree,_Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","1: Figtree,_Zimbabwe","1: God_hates_figs","1: Cursing_the_fig_tree","1: List_of_fruits","1: Mission_fig","1: Naturopathic_medicine","1: Nutrition","1: Subgenus","1: Phytonutrients","1: Pippalada","1: Atharva-Veda","1: Strangler_fig","1: Zacchaeus"]}
