It is\n thought that only neutron stars are smoother.]]\n\n'Fused quartz' or 'fused silica' is glass consisting of high-purity silica in\namorphous (non-crystalline) form. It is different from traditional glasses in\nthat no other ingredients are added to lower the melt temperature. Fused silica,\ntherefore, has much higher working and melting temperatures than soda-lime or\nborosilicate glasses.\n\nFused quartz is manufactured by fusing (melting) naturally occurring quartz\ncrystals of high purity at approximately 2000 Â°C, using either an electrically\nheated furnace (electrically fused) or a gas/oxygen-fuelled furnace (flame\nfused). Fused quartz is normally transparent. The optical and thermal properties\nof fused quartz are superior to those of other types of glass due to its purity.\nFor these reasons, it finds use in situations such as semiconductor fabrication\nand laboratory equipment. It has better ultraviolet transmission than most other\nglasses, and so is used to make lenses and other optics for the ultraviolet\nspectrum. Its low coefficient of thermal expansion also makes it a useful\nmaterial for precision mirror substrates.\n\nFused silica is produced using high-purity silica sand as the feedstock, and is\nnormally melted using an electric furnace, resulting in a material that is\ntranslucent or opaque. (This opacity is caused by very small air bubbles trapped\nwithin the material.)\n\nSynthetic fused silica is made from a silicon-rich chemical precursor usually\nusing a continuous flame hydrolysis process which involves chemical gasification\nof silicon, oxidation of this gas to silicon dioxide, and thermal fusion of the\nresulting dust (although there are alternative processes). This results in a\ntransparent glass with an ultra-high purity and improved optical transmission in\nthe deep ultraviolet. One common method involves adding silicon tetrachloride to\na hydrogenâoxygen flame, however use of this precursor results in\nenvironmentally unfriendly by-products including chlorine and hydrochloric acid.\nTo eliminate these by-products, new processes have been developed using an\nalternative feedstock, which has also resulted in a higher purity fused silica\nwith further improved deep ultraviolet transmission.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Fused_quartz","recorded":1362481644,"links":32,"instances":["optics","physics","glass","optics","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass types","Low-expansion glass","Chemical engineering","Glass compositions","Silicon dioxide","Transparent materials","Quartz varieties"],"headings":["Chemistry","Applications","Physical properties","Optical properties","Typical properties of clear fused silica","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Einstein_gyro_gravity_probe_b.jpg/320px-Einstein_gyro_gravity_probe_b.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Eprom32k.jpg/220px-Eprom32k.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Fused_silica_phosphorescence_from_a_24_million_watt_flash.jpg/300px-Fused_silica_phosphorescence_from_a_24_million_watt_flash.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Microflash-quartz-phosphorescence.jpg/250px-Microflash-quartz-phosphorescence.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/c/4fcb8a2b330d43df4d0df8d1387131da.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/2/b72bb92668acc30b4474caff40274044.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/2/b72bb92668acc30b4474caff40274044.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"],["crown_glass","optics"],["solarisation","physics"],["dispersion","optics"],["annealing","glass"]],"members":["crown_glass","solarisation","annealing","lens","dispersion"],"related":["Gravity_Probe_B","Neutron_stars","Glass","Silicon_dioxide","Amorphous_solid","Crystal","Soda-lime_glass","Melting","Quartz","Semiconductor","Ultraviolet","Lens_(optics)","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Silicon","Hydrolysis","Gasification","Oxidation","Ultraviolet","Silicon_tetrachloride","Chlorine","Hydrochloric_acid","Silicon_dioxide","Silicon","Oxygen","Quartz","Aluminium","Titanium","Optical_fiber","Glass","Halogen_lamp","Photolithography","EPROM","Integrated_circuit","Ultraviolet","Silicon","UV_light","First_surface_mirror","Telescope","Flint_glass","Crown_glass_(optics)","Steelmaking","Investment_casting","Hydrofluoric_acid","Quartz_heater","Q_factor","Thermal_shock","Phosphorescence","Solarisation_(physics)","Flashtube","Ultraviolet_light","Wavelength","Infrared","Water_absorption","Hydroxyl","Dispersion_(optics)","Sellmeier_equation","Density","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Gigapascal","Tensile_strength","Megapascal","Compressive_strength","Gigapascal","Bulk_modulus","Rigidity_modulus","Young's_modulus","Poisson's_ratio","Lame_elastic_constants","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Thermal_conductivity","Specific_heat_capacity","Softening_point","Annealing_(glass)","Strain_point","Electrical_resistivity","Dielectric_constant","Refractive_index","Strain-optic_coefficients","Hamaker_constant","Dielectric_strength","Vycor","Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses"]}
