{"cursor":"1213","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer engineering, an 'execution unit' (also called a 'functional unit')\nis a part of a CPU that performs the operations and calculations called for by\nthe Branch Unit, which receives data from the CPU. It may have its own internal\ncontrol sequence unit (not to be confused with the CPUs main control unit), some\nregisters, and other internal units such as a sub-ALU or FPU, or some smaller,\nmore specific components.\n\nIt is commonplace for modern CPUs to have multiple parallel execution units,\nreferred to as scalar or superscalar design. The simplest arrangement is to use\none, the bus manager, to manage the memory interface, and the others to perform\ncalculations. Additionally, modern CPUs' execution units are usually pipelined.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Functional_unit","recorded":1362486327,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Central processing unit","Computer arithmetic"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_kfig.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computer_engineering","Central_processing_unit","Branch_Unit","CPU","Control_unit","Processor_register","Arithmetic_logic_unit","Floating_point_unit","Superscalar","Instruction_pipelining"]}
