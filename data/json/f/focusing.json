It involves holding a kind of open, non-judging attention to an\ninternal knowing which is directly experienced but is not yet in words. Focusing\ncan, among other things, be used to become clear on what one feels or wants, to\nobtain new insights about one's situation, and to stimulate change or healing of\nthe situation.<ref name=AWCFocusingManual> {{cite book\n | author=Ann Weiser Cornell | author2=Barbara McGavin title=The Focusing\n | Student's and Companion's Manual.
