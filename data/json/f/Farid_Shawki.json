{"cursor":"6920","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Farid Shawki Mohammad Abduh Badawi' () (July 29, 1920 in Cairo - July 27, 1998)\nknown as 'Farid Shawki' () was an Egyptian actor, screenwriter and film\nproducer. In his life, he acted in 361 films, 12 plays and 12 television series;\nwrote 22 film scripts; and produced 26 films.\n\nHe was also known as 'Malek El Terso' (\"The King of the Third Class\" - a\nreference to his popularity among the poor, who bought third-class seats in\nmovie theatres), as \"Wahsh Ash shashah Al Arabiyah the Monster of the Arab\nSilver Screen\" in honor of his various roles of beloved hero, as 'Farid Bay'\n(\"Sir Farid\", an informal title of respect), and as 'Abu el-Banat' (\"father of\nall girls\", a reference to his having five daughters and no sons).\n\nIn a career spanning almost 60 years, Shawki starred, produced, or wrote the\nscenario of over 400 films - more than the films produced collectively by the\nwhole Arab world - in addition to theatre, television and video plays. His\npopularity covered the whole of the Arab World, including Turkey where he acted\nin some films there, and directors always addressed his as ' Farid Bay' (Sir\nFarid) as a sign of respect. As he worked with over 90 Film directors and\nproducers.\n\nFor the first ten years he typically cast as a villain. By late 1940s his name\nalongside that of the late Mahmoud el-Mileegy guaranteed a box-office success.\nIn 1950 he changed that image forever, playing the leading role in Ga'aloony\nMujriman (\"They Made Me a Criminal\"), his own script in which he tackled the\nproblem of homeless children and the first crime thus exposing the failure of\ngovernment policy and the corruption of state run orphanages and young offenders\ninstitutions.\n\nDisliked by the establishment, the film was later awarded the State Prize;\nShawki went on to collect 10 best actor awards in many festivals, and four other\nawards for his scripts in the next thirty years.\n\nCritics referred to him as the \"John Wayne\" or \"Anthony Quinn\" of Egyptian\ncinema and of the Arabic speaking World\", and to the masses he was the Beast of\nthe Silver Screen, who championed the underdog, especially women, and the\ndispossessed using an effective mixture of cunning, physical strength, personal\ncharm, and unbending principles, to overcome the wicked aggressors. With an\nilliteracy of over 80 per cent at the time, the \"Screen Beast\" personified the\nmasses' dreams of defeating the wealthy, who were above the law thanks to an\nunjust class system.\n\nScreenwriter Abd-el-Hay Adeeb once had to rewrite a scene in a film after it had\nbeen released: Shawki's character was slapped on the back of the neck, which is\na sign of contempt in southern Mediterranean countries; the cinema audience in\nthe city of Assiut rioted in protest, destroying the building.\n\nIn 1969, Youssef Chahine's film [[al-Ardh]] (\"The Land\") ended with the main\ncharacter being dragged to his death behind the horse of a corrupt police\nofficer. Audiences called for the \"Beast\" - Shawki - to come to his rescue,\ndespite the fact that Shawki did not appear in that film.\n\nA number of critics spent a great deal of time discussing the phenomenon as it\nwas clear that Shawki lived in the psyche of the nation as an image greater than\nreality and he represented hope and implementation of justice during the\ntotalitarian military rule in the 1950s and 60's. With the influence of Egyptian\ncinema on the whole of the Middle East, the \"Beast of the Silver Screen\" had a\nsimilar status in all Arabic-speaking nations, where the main entertainment was,\nand still to a large degree, Egyptian films.\n\nFilm producers and financiers called Shawki - Malek el-Terso - or the King of\nthe Third Class (Terso is an Egyptian slang word derived from the Italian word\nreferring to the cheap third class seats in the cinema from which the bulk of\nthe box office takings came). Shawki was born in July 1920 in El Baghghala\nneighborhood of Cairo's popular quarter of Al-Sayyedah Zynab, where the majority\nof residents were the terso- film goers when Egyptian cinema started turning\ninto a big industry. Shawki worked as a civil servant as the Second World War\nbroke out. He was given small parts in Ramsis Theatre group headed by Youssef\nBay Wahby, then he worked with Anwar Wagdy doing small parts on the silver\nscreen. He also formed a local theatre group `The National League of Acting'\nwhich included his young wife actress Zainab Abd-el-Hady whom he married in\n1941, they had one daughter Mona. They were divorced four years later, when he\nmarried his second wife, dancer Saneya Shawki, whom he also divorced in 1950.\n\nBy 1943 the NLA became The 20 Theatre as the members grew to 20 all became\nhousehold names in Egyptian theatre and cinema for decades to come. The group\nspecialized in presenting Chekov's plays, and Shawki excelled in playing the\nleading parts - later on he loved to play classic parts in screenplays of novels\nby Nobel Prize holder Naguib Mahfouz. One of them was playing the role of Sultan\nin the film Bidaya wa nihaya.\n\nWith success in theatre, and small parts in films, Shawki left his post at the\ncivil service in 1946. Few months later the 20 Theatre became the nucleus of the\nHigher Institute of Drama. In 1947 he made his mark in the film âMalaâeka Fi\nGohanamâ ` Angels in Hell'. With his third wife, singer and actress Huda Sultan,\nwhom he married in 1951, they made a famous partnership in more than 80 films.\nThe marriage lasted 18 years and produced two daughters Maha and Nahed who is a\nsuccessful film producer in her own right. He was working on a script for his\ndaughter in film dealing with homeless young people just before he died.\n\nIn 1970, he married Soheir Turk, they stayed together until he died, she also\ngave him two daughters Rania and Abir.\n\nHe was survived by wife Soheir Turk and five daughters Mona, Nahed, Maha, Rania\nand Abir. His brother was the late General Staff of Egyptian Army Ahmad Shawki.\nFarid's youngest daughter, Rania, is a well known actress. She has two children\nfrom husband Atef Awad, Fareeda and Malak. His other daughter from Soheir, Abir,\nis a film director with two children as well.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Farid_Shawki","recorded":1375069347,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Farid_Shawki.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Farid_Shawki.jpg/250px-Farid_Shawki.jpg","/wiki/File:Farid_Shawki.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Cairo","/wiki/Arabic_language","/wiki/Egyptians","/wiki/Actor","/wiki/Screenwriter","/wiki/Film_producer","/wiki/Arab_World","/wiki/Turkey","/w/index.php?title=Mahmoud_el-Mileegy&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Wayne","/wiki/Anthony_Quinn","/w/index.php?title=Abd-el-Hay_Adeeb&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Assiut","/wiki/Youssef_Chahine","/w/index.php?title=Al-Ardh&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Nobel_Prize","/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz","/wiki/Bidaya_wa_nihaya","/w/index.php?title=Huda_Sultan&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=edit&section=1","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790096/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.mideastnews.com/shawki.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&oldid=549867659","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1920_births","/wiki/Category:1998_deaths","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_actors","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_January_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Arabic-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Farid+Shawki&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Farid+Shawki","/wiki/Farid_Shawki","/wiki/Talk:Farid_Shawki","#","/wiki/Farid_Shawki","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Farid_Shawki","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Farid_Shawki","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&oldid=549867659","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981905","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Farid_Shawki&id=549867659","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Farid+Shawki","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Farid+Shawki&oldid=549867659&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Farid_Shawki&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF_%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%82%D9%8A","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farid_Shawqi","//arz.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF_%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%82%D9%89","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farid_%C5%A0auqi","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981905#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farid_Shawki","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//
