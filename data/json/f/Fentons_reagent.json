Fenton's reagent can be used to\ndestroy organic compounds such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and\ntetrachloroethylene (PCE).\n\nIt was developed in the 1890s by Henry John Horstman Fenton as an analytical\nreagent. {{cite journal\n | doi = 10.1039/ct8946500899 title = Oxidation of tartaric acid in presence of\n | iron author = Fenton H.J.H. journal = J.

Iron(III) is then reduced back to\niron(II), a peroxide radical and a proton by the same hydrogen peroxide\n(disproportionation).The hydroxyl free radical generated by Fentonâs reagent is\na powerful, non-selective oxidant. Oxidation of an organic compound by Fentonâs\nreagent is rapid and exothermic (heat-producing) and results in the oxidation of\ncontaminants to primarily carbon dioxide and\nwater. http://geocleanse.com/fentonsreagent.asp\n\n(1) Fe 2+ + H 2O 2 â Fe 3+ + OH'Â·' +\n    OH â\n\n(2) Fe 3+ + H 2O 2 â Fe 2+ + OOH'Â·' +\n    H +\n\nReaction (1) was suggested by Haber and Weiss in the 1930s. In the\nnet reaction the presence of iron is truly catalytic and two molecules of\nhydrogen peroxide are converted into two hydroxyl radicals and water. The\ngenerated radicals then engage in secondary reactions. Iron(II) sulfate is a\ntypical iron compound in Fenton's reagent. The exact mechanisms are debated\n(also non-OH'Â·' oxidizing mechanisms of organic compounds have been suggested)\nand, therefore, it may be appropriate to broadly discuss 'Fenton chemistry'\nrather than a 'Fenton reaction'.\n\nIn the electro-Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide is produced in the required\namount from the electrochemical reduction of oxygen.\n\nFenton's reagent is also used in organic synthesis for the hydroxylation of\narenes in a radical substitution reaction such as the classical conversion of\nbenzene into phenol.\n\n(3) C 6H 6 + FeSO 4 + H 2O 2 â\n    C 6H 5OH\n\nA recent hydroxylation example involves the oxidation of barbituric acid to\nalloxane. Another application of the reagent in organic synthesis is\nin coupling reactions of alkanes. As an example ''tert''-butanol is dimerized\nwith Fenton's reagent and sulfuric acid to 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-\nhexanediol.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Fenton's_reagent","recorded":1362672229,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://tchie.uni.opole.pl/freeECE/S_16_3/Barbusinski_16(3).pdf"],"categories":["Oxidizing agents","Environmental chemistry","Analytical reagents"],"headings":["References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_sulfate"]],"members":[],"related":["Hydrogen_peroxide","Iron","Catalyst","Oxidize","Contaminants","Waste_water","Organic_compound","Trichloroethylene","Tetrachloroethylene","Henry_John_Horstman_Fenton","Ferrous","Ferric","Hydroxyl_radical","Hydroxyl","Anion","Hydrogen_atom","Disproportionation","Fritz_Haber","Catalyst","Iron(II)_sulfate","Electro-Fenton","Electrochemical","Organic_synthesis","Hydroxylation","Arene","Radical_substitution","Benzene","Phenol","Organic_oxidation","Barbituric_acid","Alloxane","Coupling_reaction","Tert-Butanol","Sulfuric_acid"]}
