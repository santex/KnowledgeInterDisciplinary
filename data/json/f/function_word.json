      "text" : "\n\n'Function words' (or 'grammatical words' or 'synsemantic words' or 'structure-\nclass words') are words that have little lexical meaning or have ambiguous\nmeaning, but instead serve to express grammatical relationships with other words\nwithin a sentence, or specify the attitude or mood of the speaker. They signal\nthe structural relationships that words have to one another and are the glue\nthat holds sentences together. Thus, they serve as important elements to the\nstructures of sentences. <ref>Klammer , Thomas, Muriel R. Schulz and Angela\nDella Volpe. (2009). Analyzing English Grammar (6th ed).Longman.</ref> Consider\nthe following two sentences:\n\n#The winfy prunkilmonger from the glidgement mominkled and brangified all his\nlevensers vederously. #Glop angry investigator larm blonk government harassed\ngerfritz infuriated sutbor pumrog listeners thoroughly.\n\nIn sentence (1) above, the content words have been changed into nonsense\nsyllables but it is not difficult for one to posit that winfy is an adjective,\nprunkilmonger, glidgement, levensers as nouns, mominkled, brangified as verbs\nand vederously as an adverb based on clues like the derivational and\ninflectional morphemes. (The clue is in the suffixes: -y indicates adjectives\nsuch as \"wintery\"; -er, -ment and -ers indicates nouns such as \"baker\",\n\"battlement\" and \"messengers\"; -led and -fied suggests verbs such as \"mingled\"\nand \"clarified\"; and -ly is that of adverbs such as \"vigorously\"). Hence, even\nwithout lexical meaning, the sentence can be said to be rather \"meaningful\".\nHowever, when the reverse is done and the function words are being changed to\nnonsense syllables as in sentence (2), the result is a totally incomprehensible\nsentence as the grammatical meaning which is signaled by the structure words is\nnot present. Hence, function words provide the grammatical relationships between\nthe open class words and helps create meaning in sentences.\n\nWords that are not function words are called [[content word]]s (or open class\nwords or lexical words or autosemantic words): these include nouns, verbs,\nadjectives, and most adverbs, although some adverbs are function words (e.g.,\nthen and why). Dictionaries define the specific meanings of content words, but\ncan only describe the general usages of function words. By contrast, grammars\ndescribe the use of function words in detail, but treat lexical words in general\nterms only.\n\nFunction words might be prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions,\ngrammatical articles or particles, all of which belong to the group of closed-\nclass words. Interjections are sometimes considered function words but they\nbelong to the group of open-class words. Function words might or might not be\ninflected or might have affixes.\n\nFunction words belong to the closed class of words in grammar in that it is very\nuncommon to have new function words created in the course of speech, whereas in\nthe open class of words (that is, nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs) new\nwords may be added readily (such as slang words, technical terms, and adoptions\nand adaptations of foreign words). See neologism.\n\nEach function word either gives some grammatical information on other words in a\nsentence or clause, and cannot be isolated from other words, or it may indicate\nthe speaker's mental model as to what is being said.\n\nGrammatical words, as a class, can have distinct phonological properties from\ncontent words. Grammatical words sometimes do not make full use of all the\nsounds in a language. For example, in some of the Khoisan languages, most\ncontent words begin with clicks, but very few function words do.<ref\nname=\"EB\"></ref> In English, very few words other than function words begin with\nvoiced th- (see Pronunciation of English th).\n\nThe following is a list of the kind of words considered to be function words:\n*articles — the and a. In some inflected languages, the articles may take on the\ncase of the declension of the following noun. *pronouns — inflected in English,\nas he — him, she — her, etc. *adpositions — uninflected in English *conjunctions\n— uninflected in English *auxiliary verbs — forming part of the conjugation\n(pattern of the tenses of main verbs), always inflected *interjections —\nsometimes called \"filled pauses\", uninflected *particles — convey the attitude\nof the speaker and are uninflected, as if, then, well, however, thus, etc.\n*expletives — take the place of sentences, among other functions. *pro-sentences\n— yes, okay, etc.\n",
