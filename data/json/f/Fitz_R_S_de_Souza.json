R.\nS. de Souza' and 'Fitz De Souza', is a Kenyan lawyer and ex-politician of Indian\norigin, who was an important figure in the campaign for independence for Kenya,\na member of the Kenyan parliament in the 1960s and Deputy Speaker for several\nyears. He helped provide a legal defence for those accused of Mau Mau activities\nincluding the Kapenguria Six, and he was one of the people involved in the\nLancaster House conferences held to draw up a constitutional framework for\nKenyan independence.\n\nBorn to a Goan family in Mumbai, de Souza lived in Zanzibar before settling in\nKenya in 1942. Fitz de Souza took a first degree in England and trained as a\nbarrister at Lincoln's Inn.\n\nAs a young man in 1952 he joined a team of lawyers from various Commonwealth\ncountries, including the British barrister Denis Nowell Pritt and other lawyers\neducated in England but not born there, defending Kenyans accused of Mau Mau\nactivities by the British colonial administration, in a series of trials\nincluding that of Jomo Kenyatta. Feelings in the country were running high, with\nsome settlers of European ancestry disrupting any legal process for people they\nconsidered assassins, while other people in Kenya were convinced of bad faith\namongst those involved in the all-white British prosecution. In this atmosphere,\nde Souza and an Asian colleague faced implied allegations of 'encouraging'\ndefendants to criticise police witnesses, but judges at the East African Court\nof Appeal supported them, praising their assistance to the court.\n\nFor part of the 1950s Fitz de Souza was studying for a PhD at the London School\nof Economics and was politically active both there and in Kenya. His doctoral\nthesis was on \"Indian Political Organization in East Africa\" (1959). He knew\nKenyatta and was a major figure in the movement towards an independent Kenya. He\nhas been described during this period both as a \"freedom\nfighter\" [http://meaindia.nic.in/pressbriefing/2004/01/08pb01.htm Press\nBriefing by Indian Ministry for External Affairs] and as someone\n\"organiz[ing] Africans and Asians against the colour\nbar\". [http://moia.gov.in/shared/sublinkimages/432.htm Ministry of Overseas\nIndian Affairs biographical sketch]\n\nIn the early 1960s he was a legal adviser at the Lancaster House conferences in\nLondon where Kenyatta and the Kenyans worked with the UK Colonial Secretary,\nReginald Maudling, and his team to develop a constitution for the country. In\n2001 de Souza told the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission why he felt the\nLancaster House Constitution had been a good constitutional framework, and\nexpressed his disagreement with some subsequent changes, especially the re-\nintroduction of detention without trial. The Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs\nhas described him as making \"a principled exit from public life in the\n70s\". [http://moia.gov.in/shared/sublinkimages/432.htm MOIA biographical\nsketch]\n\nDe Souza was an elected member of the Kenyan Parliament even before full\nindependence in 1963, and Deputy Speaker of the Lower House from June 1963. He\nleft this post in 1970, spent many years in private practice, and is now semi-\nretired. He is married with four grown-up children.\n\nIn 2004 he was given a Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award alongside other people\nhonoured for their \"outstanding contribution to the understanding of the Indian\ncivilisation and for advancing India's cause\nabroad\" [http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/09/stories/2004010904691100.htm The\nHindu online edition, 8 January 2004] at a conference opened by the Indian\nprime minister and organised with the aim of \"bringing together the Indian\nDiaspora and leveraging the potential offered by the Global Indian\nFamily\". [http://www.indemb.no/IndianEmbassy/IEpionorway.html Indian\nEmbassy, Oslo, news story]\n\n2005 brought a different kind of publicity when a Pulitzer prize-winning book\nwritten by Caroline Elkins, an associate professor at Harvard, quoted a\n\"respected attorney in Nairobi\", Elkins, page 87 de Souza, as\nbelieving that at least one hundred thousand Kikuyu disappeared at the time of\nMau Mau, in \"a form of ethnic cleansing on the part of the British\ngovernment\". Elkins, page 89 These figures have been challenged by\nJohn Darwin, a fellow of Nuffield College, and lecturer on the History of the\nBritish Commonwealth at Oxford University. The Times Higher Education\nSupplement, 30 September 2005\n\nIn December 2006, Commissioner for Non Resident Indian affairs (Government of\nGoa) Eduardo Faleiro announced that Souza would be one of the eight persons to\nbe honoured during the Global Goans Convention, to be held from 3â5 January\n2006. The awards, for the first time, are being given to \"eminent non-resident\nGoans and persons of Goan origin.\"\n","linknr":135,"url":"Fitz_R_S_de_Souza","recorded":1375074793,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_R_S_de_Souza&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Mumbai","/wiki/Kenya","/wiki/India","/wiki/Kenya","/wiki/Deputy_Speaker","/wiki/Mau_Mau","/wiki/Kapenguria_Six","/wiki/Lancaster_House_Conferences_(Kenya)","/wiki/Goa","/wiki/Zanzibar","/wiki/Barrister","/wiki/Lincoln%27s_Inn","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/Denis_Nowell_Pritt","/wiki/Mau_Mau","/wiki/Jomo_Kenyatta","/wiki/Asian_people","/wiki/London_School_of_Economics","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies","/wiki/Reginald_Maudling","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Diaspora","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Pulitzer_prize","/wiki/Caroline_Elkins","/wiki/Harvard","/wiki/Nairobi","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Kikuyu_people","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Nuffield_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Oxford_University","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=edit&section=1","http://www.parliament.go.ke/history.php","/wiki/Imperial_Reckoning:_The_Untold_Story_of_Britain%27s_Gulag_in_Kenya","http://www.kenyaconstitution.org/docs/03d002.htm","http://coombs.anu.edu.au/Biblio/biblio_sasiadiaspora.html#D","#cite_ref-1","http://meaindia.nic.in/pressbriefing/2004/01/08pb01.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://moia.gov.in/shared/sublinkimages/432.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://moia.gov.in/shared/sublinkimages/432.htm","#cite_ref-4","http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/09/stories/2004010904691100.htm","#cite_ref-5","http://www.indemb.no/IndianEmbassy/IEpionorway.html","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=edit&section=2","http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/07/03/secrets__lies/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&oldid=560659031","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Kenyan_people_of_Indian_descent","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_London_School_of_Economics","/wiki/Category:1929_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_from_Goa","/wiki/Category:Kenyan_Roman_Catholics","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Kenya","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fitz+Remedios+Santana+de+Souza&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fitz+Remedios+Santana+de+Souza","/wiki/Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","/wiki/Talk:Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","#","/wiki/Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&oldid=560659031","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5455562","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de_Souza&id=560659031","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Fitz+Remedios+Santana+de+Souza","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Fitz+Remedios+Santana+de+Souza&oldid=560659031&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Fitz_Remedios_Santana_de
