An example is the function that relates each real number x to its\nsquare x<sup>2</sup>. The output of a function f corresponding to an input x is\ndenoted by f(x) (read \"f of x\"). In this example, if the input is &minus;3, then\nthe output is 9, and we may write f(&minus;3) = 9. The input variable(s) are\nsometimes referred to as the argument(s) of the function.\n\nFunctions are \"the central objects of investigation\" in most fields of modern\nmathematics. There are many ways to describe or represent a function. Some\nfunctions may be defined by a formula or algorithm that tells how to compute\nthe output for a given input. Others are given by a picture, called the graph\nof the function. In science, functions are sometimes defined by a table that\ngives the outputs for selected inputs. A function could be described\nimplicitly, for example as the inverse to another function or as a solution of\na differential equation.\n\nThe input and output of a function can be expressed as an ordered pair, ordered\nso that the first element is the input (or tuple of inputs, if the function\ntakes more than one input), and the second is the output. In the example above,\nf(x) = x<sup>2</sup>, we have the ordered pair (&minus;3, 9). If both input and\noutput are real numbers, this ordered pair can be viewed as the Cartesian\ncoordinates of a point on the graph of the function. But no picture can exactly\ndefine every point in an infinite set. In modern mathematics , a function is\ndefined by its set of inputs, called the [[Domain of a function|domain]], a set\ncontaining the outputs, called its [[codomain (mathematics)|codomain]], and the\nset of all paired input and outputs, called the [[graph of a function|graph]].\nFor example, we could define a function using the rule f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> by\nsaying that the domain and codomain are the real numbers, and that the ordered\npairs are all pairs of real numbers (x, x<sup>2</sup>). Collections of functions\nwith the same domain and the same codomain are called function spaces, the\nproperties of which are studied in such mathematical disciplines as real\nanalysis and complex analysis.\n\nIn analogy with arithmetic, it is possible to define addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division of functions, in those cases where the output\nis a number. Another important operation defined on functions is function\ncomposition, where the output from one function becomes the input to\nanother function.\n","title":"Function%20%28mathematics%29","headings":["Introduction and examples","Definition","Notation","Specifying a function","Basic properties","Types of functions","Function spaces","Variants and generalizations","History","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Binary_relation","3: Algorithm","3: Ordered_pair","2: Formula","2: Differential_equation","2: Real_numbers","2: Real_analysis","2: Complex_analysis","2: Arithmetic","2: Argument_of_a_function","2: Integer","2: Cartesian_product","2: Real_number","2: Cardinality","2: Surjective","2: Empty_function","1: Cartesian_plane","1: Vertical_line_test","1: Mathematics","1: Graph_of_a_function","1: Inverse_function","1: Tuple","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Function_space","1: Composition_of_functions","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Codomain","1: Natural_numbers","1: Polygon","1: Signum_function","1: Velocity","1: Prefix_notation","1: Natural_number","1: Integers","1: Piecewise_function","1: Recursion","1: Analytic_function","1: Analytic_continuation","1: Integral_equation","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Syntax","1: Axiom","1: Axiom_of_Choice","1: Factorial","1: Postfix_notation","1: Euclidean_algorithm","1: Greatest_common_divisor","1: Number_theory","1: Computability_theory","1: Countable","1: Busy_beaver_function","1: Halting_problem","1: List_of_undecidable_problems","1: Constant_function","1: Ordinal_number","1: Nicolas_Bourbaki","1: Subgroup","1: Restriction","1: Quadratic_form","1: Universal_quantification","1: Associative_operation","1: Identity_element","1: Multiplicative_identity","1: Multiplicative_inverse","1: Subset","1: Complex_numbers","1: Affine_function","1: Quadratic_function","1: Continuous_function","1: Trigonometric_function","1: Differentiable_function","1: Integrable_function","1: Polynomial","1: Rational_function","1: Algebraic_function","1: Transcendental_function","1: Even_and_odd_functions","1: Convex_function","1: Monotonic_function","1: Holomorphic_function","1: Meromorphic_function","1: Entire_function","1: Vector-valued_function","1: Computable_function","1: Infinity","1: Uncountable_set","1: Currying","1: Bijection","1: Partial_function","1: Power_set","1: Recursion_theory","1: Functional_analysis","1: Division_by_zero","1: Total_function","1: Single-valued_function","1: Binary_operation","1: Addition","1: Multiplication","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Infix","1: Mathematical_structure","1: Homomorphism","1: Morphism","1: Category_theory","1: Category_of_sets","1: Empty_set","1: Categorification","1: Functor","1: Associative_array","1: Functional_decomposition","1: Functional_predicate","1: Functional_programming","1: Generalized_function","1: Implicit_function","1: Parametric_equation","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
