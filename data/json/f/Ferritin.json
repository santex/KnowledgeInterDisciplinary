The amount of ferritin stored reflects the amount of\niron stored. The protein is produced by almost all living organisms, including\nalgae, bacteria, higher plants, and animals. In humans, it acts as a buffer\nagainst iron deficiency and iron overload.

Ferritin that is not\ncombined with iron is called 'apoferritin'.\n","linknr":749,"url":"Ferritin","recorded":1362685834,"links":56,"instances":["tests","biology","tests","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/images/1R03_ram_m_500.pdf"],"categories":["Iron metabolism","Blood tests","Chemical pathology","Acute phase proteins"],"headings":["Description","Function","Expression","Diagnostic uses","Application","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Ferritin.png/220px-Ferritin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Mitochondrial_Ferritin.png/220px-Mitochondrial_Ferritin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"],["translation","biology"],["cell","biology"],["specificity","tests"],["sensitivity","tests"],["dps","dna-binding_proteins_from_starved_cells"]],"members":["dps","sensitivity","homology","specificity","translation","cell"],"related":["Ferritin_light_chain","Ferritin_light_chain","FTH1","FTH1","Globular_protein","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Crystallite","Phosphate","Hydroxide","Ferrihydrite","Iron","Vertebrate","Gene","Physiological","Homology_(biology)","Protein","Mitochondrial_ferritin","Ramachandran_plot","Intron","Translation_(biology)","Toxic","Cell_(biology)","Reactive_oxygen_species","Fenton_Reaction","Biological_tissue","Hemosiderin","Reticuloendothelial_system","Hemosiderin","Steady_state","Blood_serum","Polyplacophora","Radula","Ferroxidase","Hydrogen_peroxide","Fenton_reaction","Hydroxyl_radical","Oxygen_toxicity","Acute-phase_protein","Mitochondrial_ferritin","Nanoparticle","Carbon_nanotube","Chemical_vapor_deposition","Blood_plasma","Medical_laboratory","Anemia","Restless_legs_syndrome","Anemia_of_chronic_disease","Acute_phase_protein","Reference_interval","Medical_laboratory","Anemia","Anemia","Blood_serum","Specificity_(tests)","Iron_deficiency_anemia","Sensitivity_(tests)","Hypothyroidism","Vitamin_C","Celiac_disease","Restless_legs_syndrome","False_positive","Hook_effect","Vegetarianism","Biomarker","Iron_overload_disorder","Hemochromatosis","Hemosiderosis","Adult-onset_Still's_disease","Porphyrias","Hemophagocytic_lymphohistiocytosis","Macrophage_activation_syndrome","Acute_phase_proteins","Disease","C-reactive_protein","Anorexia_nervosa","Malnutrition","Dps_(DNA-binding_proteins_from_starved_cells)","Nanoparticles","Protein","Bacterioferritin","DNA-binding_protein_from_starved_cells","Transferrin","Ferritin_light_chain"]}
