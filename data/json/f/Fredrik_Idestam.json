{"cursor":"7298","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Knut Fredrik Idestam' (October 28, 1838, TyrvÃ¤ntÃ¶, Finland, Russia â April 8,\n1916, Helsinki, Finland, Russia) was a Finnish mining engineer and businessman,\nbest known as a founder of Nokia. Fredrik Idestam's training was in Mining, in\nwhich he held a Master's degree; and, following in his father's footsteps, he\nplanned a career as a civil servant in the Board of Mines of the Grand Duchy of\nFinland. In 1863 - 64, on a Finnish Senate (government) scholarship, Idestam\nundertook further studies in basic metals in Germany at the School of Mines\n(Bergakademie) in Freiberg, Saxony. While there, he was appointed as a mining\nengineer at the Finnish Board of Mines. But as early as the summer of 1864 his\ncareer plans changed. On his way through the Harz Mountains on his return trip\nfrom Freiberg, he visited a groundwood mill. This was a new invention: a factory\nwhich produced raw material for paper from wood. The process and equipment had\nbeen developed by the paper manufacturer Heinrich Voelter. The plant that\nIdestam saw had already reached the stage where it was capable of commercial\nproduction.\n\nThe demand for paper was increasing rapidly in the industrialising world - in\nEurope and North America. But production could not grow, because there was a\nshortage of the rags used as raw material and there was no way of increasing the\nsupply. Idestam believed that Voelter's solution to the raw-material problem was\nthe correct one. He realised the importance of this innovation for Finland.\nThere was an unlimited supply of raw material in Finland's forests, and amidst\nthe woods were rapids and waterfalls that could provide power for mills. As soon\nas he returned to Finland he ordered machines designed by Voelter from Germany,\nand he was granted an operating permit by the Senate on 12 May 1865, the date\nwhich today's Nokia group of companies regards as its foundation day. The mill\nbegan production beside the lower falls of the Tammerkoski Rapids in Tampere\nearly in 1866.\n\nIdestam was not the first in his field in Finland. The pharmacist Achates\nThuneberg had established a groundwood mill near Viipuri in 1860. Thuneberg's\nplant had been developed in Viipuri - apparently independently of Voelter - and\nhad been built in Finland. But Thuneberg was not successful: his mill was not as\ngood as Voelter's, and the small-scale venture soon petered out. In contrast,\nIdestam was successful and attracted competitors.\n\nLike Voelter in Germany, Idestam had to market his product energetically. Wood\npulp was cheaper than rag pulp, but paper manufacturers and consumers regarded\nit as an inferior substitute - as 'wood rag'. From the Frenckell (rag)paper mill\nin Tampere, Idestam ordered paper whose fibres consisted of equal parts of rag\nand his pulp. In December 1866 the Tampereen Sanomat became the first newspaper\nin Finland to be printed on paper containing wood. The Helsingfors Dagblad in\nHelsinki soon followed suit. Idestam exhibited his groundwood at the 1867 Paris\nExhibition and was awarded a Bronze Medal. This was the decisive breakthrough,\nas Idestam himself stated later. Voelter's mill received a Gold Medal at the\nsame exhibition. It was only at this point that the world realised the\nimportance of Voelter's process and equipment, and they began to come into more\ngeneral use.\n\nIdestam's first competitor in Finland was the Tampere pharmacist Gustaf Adolf\nSerlachius, who had become familiar with the field as the manager of Idestam's\nmill, Idestam himself being prevented from running it because of his official\npost. Serlachius founded a mill at MÃ¤nttÃ¤ in 1868. Tampere lost yet another\npharmacist to the paper industry when Edvard Julius Granberg established a\ngroundwood mill and paper mill at Valkeakoski in 1871. In 1868 Idestam built a\nsecond mill at Nokia, fifteen kilometres west of Tampere.\n\nA number of groundwood mills were established in Finland in the early 1870s.\nFinland had been some twenty years behind Sweden and Norway in the sawmill\nindustry, but the wood-pulp industry began at the same time and developed at the\nsame pace in all three Nordic countries. From the early 1870s to the beginning\nof the First World War, the share of the chemical forest industry in Finland's\ntotal exports rose from zero to 20 percent, and at the same time the value of\nFinland's total exports increased tenfold.\n\nIdestam transformed his firm into a share company in 1871. With his close friend\nLeo Mechelin, statesman and Finland's most prominent public figure in the late\n19th century, he founded Nokia Ltd and transferred all activities to Nokia,\nwhere a new mill was built. Idestam's mills and Nokia Manor and its interest in\nthe Nokia Rapids, which had been acquired by Mechelin, were transferred to the\nnew company. Idestam owned well over half the shares in the firm. He resigned\nfrom the Board of Mines and his position there as Master of the Mint and devoted\nhimself entirely to managing Nokia Ltd. Mechelin gave him important support by\nattracting capital investments and funding.\n\nThe development of Nokia Ltd proceeded well. Idestam was a cautious business\nmanager, and his financial planning allowed for future bad times. Although\nNokia's investments in expanding its production and increasing the degree of\nprocessing were large, Idestam, unlike many other pioneers of Finnish industry,\ncoped with the crises that arose, and in the early 1880s three paper machines\nwere built at Nokia, as well as Finland's first sulphite pulp mill in 1885. The\nfirst sulphate pulp mill had already been established earlier at Valkeakoski -\nin 1880. Chemical wood-pulp now replaced cloth-pulp as a raw material for almost\nall paper qualities. By the late 1880s Nokia was processing all of its\ngroundwood and chemical wood-pulp into paper.\n\nOn Idestam's initiative and under his leadership, the paper-industry magnates\nfounded their producers' organisations: a cardboard association in 1874, a pulp\nassociation in 1875 and a paper association in 1892. These were cartels used by\nthe Finns to divide up their most important marketing area, the Russian market,\nand to eliminate mutual competition. Idestam was the general manager and\nchairman of the Paper Association until 1903. He retired from the management of\nNokia in 1896. He was succeeded as general manager by his son-in-law Gustaf\nFogelholm and as chairman of the board by Leo Mechelin.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Fredrik_Idestam","recorded":1375086892,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fredrik_Idestam&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fredrik_Idestam&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Fredrik_Idestam.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Fredrik_Idestam.png/175px-Fredrik_Idestam.png","/wiki/File:Fredrik_Idestam.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland","/wiki/Russian_Empire","/wiki/Helsinki","/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland","/wiki/Russian_Empire","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Mining_engineering","/wiki/Businessperson","/wiki/Nokia","/w/index.php?title=Fredrik_Idestam&action=edit&section=1","http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=4296","/wiki/Template:Nokia","/wiki/Template_talk:Nokia","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Nokia&action=edit","/wiki/Nokia","/wiki/Nokia_Siemens_Networks","/wiki/Navteq","/wiki/MikroMikko","/wiki/Nokian_Tyres","/wiki/Qt_Development_Frameworks","/wiki/Symbian_Ltd.","/wiki/Vertu","/wiki/File:Nokian_p%C3%A4%C3%A4konttori_Keilaniemess%C3%A4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Nokian_p%C3%A4%C3%A4konttori_Keilaniemess%C3%A4.jpg/140px-Nokian_p%C3%A4%C3%A4konttori_Keilaniemess%C3%A4.jpg","/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Nokia","/wiki/Dopplr","/wiki/Enpocket","/wiki/Ipsilon_Networks","/wiki/Intellisync","/wiki/Metrowerks","/wiki/Navteq","/wiki/Novarra_Inc.","/wiki/Plazes","/wiki/Qt_Development_Frameworks","/wiki/Scalado","/wiki/Smarterphone","/wiki/Twango","/wiki/List_of_Nokia_products","/wiki/Nokia_Internet_tablet","/wiki/Maemo","/wiki/MeeGo","/wiki/Category:Nokia_mobile_phones","/wiki/Nokia_phone_series","/wiki/Series_40","/wiki/Symbian","/wiki/Windows_Phone","/wiki/Here_(Nokia)","/wiki/N-Gage_(service)","/wiki/Category:N-Gage_service_games","/wiki/Nokia_Life_Tools","/wiki/Nokia_Music_Store","/wiki/Ovi_(Nokia)","/wiki/Nokia_Point_%26_Find","/wiki/Nokia_City_Lens","/wiki/Category:Nokia_software_products","/wiki/Kaapelitehdas","/wiki/Nokia_Arena","/wiki/Nokia_head_office","/wiki/Nokia_Theatre_L.A._Live","/wiki/Stephen_Elop","/wiki/Kari_Kairamo","/wiki/Olli-Pekka_Kallasvuo","/wiki/Leo_Mechelin","/wiki/Jorma_Ollila","/wiki/Risto_Siilasmaa","/wiki/Simo_Vuorilehto","/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Westerlund","/wiki/Instituto_Nokia_de_Tecnologia","/wiki/Jolla","/wiki/Nokian_Footwear","/wiki/Nokia_Game","/wiki/Nokia_Pure","/wiki/Nokia_Trends","/wiki/Nokia_tune","/wiki/Python_(programming_language)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","/wiki/Category:Nokia","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nokia","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/18px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png","//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Nokia","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Finland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Finland.svg/30px-Flag_of_Finland.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_app_Login_Manager_2.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fredrik_Idestam&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Finland-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Finland-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Finland-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fredrik_Idestam&oldid=561583967","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1838_births","/wiki/Category:1916_deaths","/wiki/Category:Finnish_businesspeople","/wiki/Category:Mining_engineers","/wiki/Category:Nokia_people","/wiki/Category:Finnish_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_l
