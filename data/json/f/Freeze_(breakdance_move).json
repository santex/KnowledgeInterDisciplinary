Various handstands (\"inverts\", \"Nikes\", and \"pikes\") can be\nfrozen, and skilled breakers sometimes incorporate the technique of threading\ninto handstands by forming a loop with one arm and leg, then \"threading\" the\nother leg in and out of the loop.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Freeze_(breakdance_move)","recorded":1362893063,"links":22,"instances":["breakdance_move","breakdance_move","breakdance_move","exercise","breakdance_move"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Breakdance moves"],"headings":["Variants","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Breakdance.jpg/275px-Breakdance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Figure4.JPG/250px-Figure4.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/Airchairpike.jpg/275px-Airchairpike.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","breakdance_move"],["kick","breakdance_move"],["stab","breakdance_move"],["stab","breakdance_move"],["bridge","exercise"],["stab","breakdance_move"],["float","breakdance_move"]],"members":["float","spin","kick","bridge","stab"],"related":["B-boying","Spin_(breakdance_move)","Kick_(breakdance_move)","Handstand","Headstand","Handstand","Forearm","Elbow-joint","Shoulder","Stab_(breakdance_move)","Stab_(breakdance_move)","Bridge_(exercise)","Stab_(breakdance_move)","Float_(breakdance_move)"]}
