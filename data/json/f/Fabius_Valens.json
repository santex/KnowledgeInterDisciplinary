{"cursor":"4018","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fabius Valens' of Anagnia (d. 69) was a Roman commander favoured by Nero. In 69\nhe was commander of Legio I ''Germanica'' based in Germania Inferior. When the\ntroops refused to endorse the new emperor Galba after Nero's death, he had them\nproclaim Vitellius, the governor of Germania Inferior, as emperor.\n\nThe forces supporting Vitellius were divided into two armies for the march on\nRome, one of them commanded by Valens. Valens' troops took a route through Gaul,\nprobably to recruit additional soldiers, before eventually joining with the\nother Vitellian army, led by Caecina, at Cremona. By then Galba had been killed\nand Otho had been proclaimed emperor at Rome. Otho's forces met the combined\nVitellian armies at the first Battle of Bedriacum. Valens and Caecina won a\ndecisive victory, and Otho committed suicide when he heard the news of his\narmy's defeat. Vitellius was able to make a triumphant entry into Rome.\n\nHowever, the armies in the east had proclaimed Vespasian as emperor, and two\narmies supporting Vespasian marched on Rome. The first to reach Italy was\ncomposed of five legions from Pannonia and Moesia, commanded by Antonius\nPrimus. Valens was ill at the time, so that the force that Vitellius despatched\nfrom Rome to counter this threat was commanded by Caecina. Caecina tried to\nbetray Vitellius and proclaim Vespasian as emperor, but his army refused to\nfollow his lead, and put him in chains. By this time Valens had recovered from\nhis illness and was on his way to join the army, but before he could arrive,\nthe second Battle of Bedriacum had been fought and the Vitellian forces\ndefeated by Antonius.\n\nValens tried to continue the struggle, and departed by ship from Pisa for Gaul\nto try to raise new troops. He put in at Hercules Monoecus (modern Monaco) but\nwas advised not to try to march inland as a procurator named Valerius Paulus had\nraised a strong force from former members of Otho's Praetorian Guard. These had\nbeen dismissed from the service after Vitellius' victory, but were only too\nready to re-enlist to support Vitellius' rival. Valens therefore sailed on, and\nwas cast up by a storm on the Stoechades (modern Iles d'Hyeres, near Toulon).\nHere he was caught by surprise by some galleys sent after him by Valerius\nPaulinus, and captured. Paulinus sent him back to Italy, where he was executed\nby beheading at Urvinum (modern Urbino). His head was taken to Narni to be shown\nto the Vitellian troops who were still resisting there and had been hoping that\nValens would return with reinforcements. The sight of Valens' head was enough to\npersuade them to surrender.\n\nOne anecdote says that he appeared on the music-stage hall at Nero's coming of\nage celebrations, not at the command of Nero but voluntarily. At the time this\nwas frowned upon, and many people thought that he was merely a man of fashion.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Fabius_Valens","recorded":1375083663,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Anagni","/wiki/Roman_Empire","/wiki/Nero","/wiki/Legio_I_Germanica","/wiki/Germania_Inferior","/wiki/Galba","/wiki/Vitellius","/wiki/Roman_governors_of_Germania_Inferior","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Gaul","/wiki/Aulus_Caecina_Alienus","/wiki/Cremona","/wiki/Otho","/wiki/Battle_of_Bedriacum","/wiki/Vespasian","/wiki/Pannonia","/wiki/Moesia","/wiki/Antonius_Primus","/wiki/Pisa","/wiki/Monaco","/wiki/Praetorian_Guard","/wiki/Toulon","/wiki/Urbino","/wiki/Narni","/wiki/Galba","/wiki/Titus_Vinius","/wiki/List_of_early_imperial_Roman_consuls","/wiki/Roman_Empire","/wiki/Arrius_Antoninus","/wiki/Vespasian","/wiki/Titus","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&oldid=553832090","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:69_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Anagni","/wiki/Category:1st-century_Romans","/wiki/Category:Imperial_Roman_consuls","/wiki/Category:Ancient_Roman_generals","/wiki/Category:Year_of_Four_Emperors","/wiki/Category:Executed_Ancient_Roman_people","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_the_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Category:1st-century_executions","/wiki/Category:People_executed_by_decapitation","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fabius+Valens&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fabius+Valens","/wiki/Fabius_Valens","/wiki/Talk:Fabius_Valens","#","/wiki/Fabius_Valens","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fabius_Valens","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Fabius_Valens","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&oldid=553832090","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q953748","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Fabius_Valens&id=553832090","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Fabius+Valens","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Fabius+Valens&oldid=553832090&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Fabius_Valens&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabi_Valent","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Valens","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Valente","//eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Valente","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Valens","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Valente","//la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Valens","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Valens","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q953748#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabius_Valens","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vec
