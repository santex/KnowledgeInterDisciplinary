{"cursor":"2967","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In population genetics, 'fixation' is the change in a gene pool from a situation\nwhere there exists at least two variants of a particular gene (allele) to a\nsituation where only one of the alleles remains. The term can refer to a gene in\ngeneral or particular nucleotide position in the DNA chain (locus).\n\nIn the process of 'substitution', a previously non-existent allele arises by\nmutation and undergoes fixation by spreading through the population by random\ngenetic drift and/or positive selection. Once the frequency of the allele is at\n100%, i.e. being the only gene variant present in any member, it is said to be\n\"fixed\" in the population.\n\nSimilarly, genetic differences between taxa are said to have been fixed in\neach species.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Fixation_(population_genetics)","recorded":1362483371,"links":19,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population genetics"],"headings":["Probability of fixation","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/8/83878c91171338902e0fe0fb97a8c47a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/2/b72bb92668acc30b4474caff40274044.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/f/81f4d59b02e97015b56ef8612697d837.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/0/710b06297fe507ee54d18f55a3a6338b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"]],"members":["locus"],"related":["Population_genetics","Gene_pool","Allele","Nucleotide","Locus_(genetics)","Mutation","Biological_inheritance","Genetic_drift","Natural_selection","Allele_frequency","Taxa","Species","Diploid","Mutation_rate"]}
