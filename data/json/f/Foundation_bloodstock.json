{"cursor":"3768","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Foundation bloodstock' or 'foundation stock' are horses that are the\nprogenitor, or foundation, of a new horse breed or a given bloodline within a\nbreed. The term is also used in a similar manner when discussing purebred dogs.\nA group of animals collectively may be referred to as foundation bloodstock when\none breed, or group of breeds, provides the underlying genetic base for a new\nbreed. This is particularly common in older breeds where a written stud book was\nnot created until after the breed phenotype was well established.\n\nHowever, other breeds can be traced to specific named animals. In these cases, a\n\"Foundation sire\" is a stallion or male horse who is identified as an original\nprogenitor of the breed, and a \"Foundation mare\" is a female. There are usually\nfew foundation sires, but several mares, though in many cases, foundation mares\nare not always identified in old pedigree records. In most cases, breeds that\nrequire that all members trace to specific foundation stock have a closed stud\nbook and do not allow crossbreeding to other animals. Some breeds that may have\nnamed foundation stock but are still allowing outside bloodlines to contribute\nto the genetic base of the breed have at least a partially open stud book. An\nexample of a partially open stud book is the American Quarter Horse, which still\nallows limited registration of animals with one Quarter Horse parent and one\nThoroughbred parent. Many warmblood breeds also have open stud books, where\nhorses that are registered may be of a variety of bloodlines, but must pass a\nrigorous studbook selection process.\n\nThe term \"Foundation\" when applied to horses also may be used to refer to\nanimals of a phenotype that resembles that of the original foundation stock,\nparticularly when the modern look of the animal is different. It may also refer\nto animals tracing only to a select number of the oldest foundation bloodlines,\nparticularly when newer breeding has been added that changed the original\nphenotype.\n\nSome breeds, such as the Morgan horse, have a single named foundation sire,\nwhile others, such as the Lipizzan, may have several. In some cases,\nparticularly very ancient horse breeds, not even all foundation sires may be\nknown. However, in breeds with a well-documented breed registry, nearly all\nfoundation animals may be identified. For example there are three major\nfoundation sires of the Thoroughbred, and another 24 or 25 minor foundation\nsires, along with 74 foundation mares. An example of a breed formed by\nfoundation stock from other breeds, but not necessarily all from named\nindividual animals is the Hackney horse, with bloodlines contributed from\nThoroughbred and Norfolk Trotter. In other cases, where a breed or landrace is\nolder than any written records, the foundation bloodstock is sometimes described\nby myths or legends, such as the mythical horses of Mohammad, known as [[Al\nKhamsa]] or \"the five,\" said to be the foundation mares of the Arabian horse.\n\nAn example of a foundation bloodstock pedigree line within a breed would be the\n\"Crabbet\" lines from the Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. These animals were\nbred by the same program for 92 years, were exported worldwide, and had a\nsubstantial impact on the breed. Some Arabian breeders today not only breed\npurebred horses, but horses descended only from this breeding program.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Foundation_bloodstock","recorded":1374962632,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Horse","/wiki/List_of_horse_breeds","/wiki/Purebred","/wiki/Dog","/wiki/Breed_registry","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Sire","/wiki/Stallion","/wiki/Mare_(horse)","/wiki/Pedigree_chart","/wiki/Closed_stud_book","/wiki/Crossbreeding","/wiki/Open_stud_book","/wiki/American_Quarter_Horse","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Warmblood","/wiki/Studbook_selection","/wiki/Phenotype","/wiki/Morgan_horse","/wiki/Lipizzan","/wiki/Breed_registry","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Hackney_horse","/wiki/Thoroughbred","/wiki/Norfolk_Trotter","/wiki/Landrace","/wiki/Mohammad","/wiki/Al_Khamsa","/wiki/Arabian_horse","/wiki/Crabbet_Arabian_Stud","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Breed_registry","/wiki/Dog_breeding","/wiki/Closed_stud_book","/wiki/Horse_breeding","/wiki/Thoroughbred_breeding_theories","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&oldid=445409135","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Horse_breeding_and_studs","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_October_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Foundation+bloodstock&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Foundation+bloodstock","/wiki/Foundation_bloodstock","/wiki/Talk:Foundation_bloodstock","#","/wiki/Foundation_bloodstock","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Foundation_bloodstock","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Foundation_bloodstock","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&oldid=445409135","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5474377","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Foundation_bloodstock&id=445409135","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Foundation+bloodstock","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Foundation+bloodstock&oldid=445409135&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Foundation_bloodstock&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5474377#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_bloodstock","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["horse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horse
