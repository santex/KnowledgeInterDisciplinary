When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the\noverall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and\nmanagement. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using\nfundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up\nanalysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such\nanalysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis\nand technical analysis.\n\nFundamental analysis is performed on historical and present data, but with the\ngoal of making financial forecasts. There are several possible objectives:\n* to conduct a company stock valuation and predict its probable price evolution,\n* to make a projection on its business performance,\n* to evaluate its management and make internal business decisions,\n* to calculate its credit risk.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Fundamental_analysis","recorded":1362666705,"links":42,"instances":["investments","finance","finance","accounting","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fundamental analysis|","Commodities market","Derivatives (finance)","Foreign exchange market","Stock market"],"headings":["Two analytical models","Use by different portfolio styles","Top-down and bottom-up","Procedures","Criticisms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg/135px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quantitative_analysis","finance"],["profit","accounting"],["portfolio","finance"],["productivity","economics"],["mosaic_theory","investments"]],"members":["mosaic_theory","portfolio","quantitative_analysis","profit","productivity"],"related":["Financial_statements","Competitors","Markets","Futures_contract","Foreign_exchange_market","Investment_analysis","Quantitative_analysis_(finance)","Technical_analysis","Forecasts","Stock_valuation","Credit_risk","Profit_(accounting)","Technical_analysis","Efficient-market_hypothesis","Random_walk_hypothesis","Capital_asset_pricing_model","Fed_model","Market-based_valuation","Behavioral_finance","Portfolio_(finance)","Investment_management","Investor_profile","Growth_stock","Quantitative_analysis","Economic_indicator","GDP","Inflation","Interest","Exchange_rate","Productivity_(economics)","Financial_ratio","Thomson_Reuters","Discount_rate","Discounted_cash_flow","Dividend","Gordon_model","Cash_flows","Debt_to_equity_ratio","P/E_ratio","Time_value_of_money","PEG_ratio","Burton_Malkiel","Technical_analysis","Stock_picking","Security_analysis","Stock_selection_criterion","Mosaic_theory_(investments)","Chepakovich_valuation_model"]}
