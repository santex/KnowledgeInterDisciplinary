{"cursor":"4499","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Titus Flavius Simonides Agrippa', also known as 'Titus Flavius Agrippa' (}},\nflourished second half of 1st century & first half of 2nd century, born 79) was\nan aristocratic, wealthy Roman Jew.\n\nAgrippa was born and raised in Rome. He was the second son born to the Roman\nJewish Historian Josephus and from his fourth wife, a distinguished unnamed\nGreek Jewish noblewoman from Crete. Fergus, The History of the Jewish People\nin the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135) p.p.45-6 The parents of\nAgrippa met in Rome and Josephus describes his mother, as one âin character, who\nexcelled many women, as her subsequent life demonstratedâ. Josephus, Flavius\nJosephus: translation and commentary p.p.10&170 Agrippa had an older full\nblooded brother called Justus and an older paternal half-brother called\nHyrcanus. Fergus, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus\nChrist (175 B.C. - A.D. 135) p.p.45-6\n\nHis paternal uncle was Matthias, while his paternal grandparents were Matthias\nand his wife, an unnamed Jewish noblewoman. His paternal grandmother was an\naristocratic woman who descended royalty and of the former ruling Hasmonean\nDynasty. Nodet, A search for the origins of Judaism: from Joshua to the\nMishnah p.250 His paternal grandfather had descended from the priestly\norder of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the twenty four-orders of Priests\nin the Temple in Jerusalem Fergus, The History of the Jewish People in the\nAge of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135) p.p.45-6 and was a descendant of\nthe High Priest Jonathon. Jonathon may have been Alexander Jannaeus, the High\nPriest and Hasmonean ruler who governed Judea from 103 BC-76 BC. Fergus, The\nHistory of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135)\np.p.45-6\n\nAgrippaâs Greek cognomen Simonides doesnât appear on his corpse or among any\nJewish inscriptions in Rome. Josephus, Flavius Josephus: translation and\ncommentary p.10 It is unknown why Josephus gave his son a Greek cognomen,\nhe perhaps named his son after Simonides of Ceos, a Greek Poet that flourished\nin the 6th century BC and 5th century BC. Josephus, Flavius Josephus:\ntranslation and commentary p.10 Josephus during his years in Rome\ndedicated his time, in studying Greek Poetry and his literacy contemporaries\nsuch as Plutarch and Quintilian remembered the works of Simonides. Josephus,\nFlavius Josephus: translation and commentary p.10 His second cognomen is a\nLatin name Agrippa. Josephus, Flavius Josephus: translation and commentary\np.10 He was perhaps named after the Herodian Prince and King Agrippa\nII. Josephus, Flavius Josephus: translation and commentary p.10\nAgrippa II was a contemporary King to Josephus and they were very good\nacquaintances.\n\nAgrippa was a contemporary of the ruling Flavian dynasty and NervaâAntonine\ndynasty of the Roman Empire. He was alive when Josephus was compiling his\nhistorical writings and when his father died about 100. Unfortunately little is\nknown on his remaining life.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","recorded":1374766337,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Greek_language","/wiki/Roman_citizenship","/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Italy","/wiki/Ancient_Rome","/wiki/Josephus","/wiki/Ancient_Greece","/wiki/Crete","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Flavius_Justus","/wiki/Flavius_Hyrcanus","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Matthias_(brother_of_Josephus)","/wiki/Matthias_(father_of_Josephus)","/wiki/Hasmoneans","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Jehoiarib","/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Alexander_Jannaeus","/wiki/Hasmoneans","/wiki/Judea","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Cognomen","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Plutarch","/wiki/Quintilian","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Latin","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Herodian_Dynasty","/wiki/Agrippa_II","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Flavian_dynasty","/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty","/wiki/Roman_Empire","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","#cite_ref-10","#cite_ref-11","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&oldid=554641275","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Flavii","/wiki/Category:Jewish_clergy","/wiki/Category:Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Category:Roman-era_Jews","/wiki/Category:Jewish_history_in_Rome","/wiki/Category:Hasmoneans","/wiki/Category:1st-century_people","/wiki/Category:1st-century_clergy","/wiki/Category:2nd-century_people","/wiki/Category:2nd-century_clergy","/wiki/Category:79_births","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Ancient_Greek-language_text","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Greek-language_text","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_death_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flavius+Simonides+Agrippa&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Flavius+Simonides+Agrippa","/wiki/Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","/wiki/Talk:Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","#","/wiki/Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&oldid=554641275","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5458141","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&id=554641275","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Flavius+Simonides+Agrippa","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Flavius+Simonides+Agrippa&oldid=554641275&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Flavius_Simonides_Agrippa&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5458141#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Gene
