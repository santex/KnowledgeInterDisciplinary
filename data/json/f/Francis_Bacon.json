Kt.,\nKC (22 January 1561 â 9 April 1626) was an English philosopher, statesman,\nscientist, jurist, and author. He served both as Attorney General and Lord\nChancellor of England. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he\nremained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical\nadvocate and practitioner of the scientific method during the scientific\nrevolution.\n\nBacon has been called the creator of\nempiricism. http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm His works\nestablished and popularised inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry,\noften called the [[Baconian method]], or simply the scientific method. His\ndemand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new\nturn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which\nstill surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today.\n\nBacon was knighted in 1603, and created both the Baron Verulam in 1618 and the\nViscount St. Alban in 1621; Contemporary spelling, used by\nBacon himself in his letter of thanks to the king for his elevation.  as\nhe died without heirs, both peerages became extinct upon his death. He famously\ndied by contracting pneumonia while studying the effects of freezing on the\npreservation of meat, bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists\nwho were killed by their own experiments.\n","linknr":1070,"url":"Francis_Bacon","recorded":1362485203,"links":124,"instances":["uk_parliament_constituency","law","philosophy","francis_bacon","soldier","courtier","governor","mythology","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","academic","astronomer","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","jesuit","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency"],"pdf":["http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery.pdf","http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery.pdf"],"categories":["1561
