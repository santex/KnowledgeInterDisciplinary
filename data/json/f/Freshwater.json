Fresh water is\ngenerally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and\nother total dissolved solids. The term specifically excludes seawater and\nbrackish water although it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate\nsprings. The term \"sweet water\" has been used to describe fresh water in\ncontrast to salt water.\n","linknr":464,"url":"Freshwater","recorded":1362482263,"links":74,"instances":["chemistry","meteorology","freshwater_ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd17/basic_wate.pdf","http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd17/basic_wate.pdf","http://extension.oregonstate.edu/douglas/sites/default/files/documents/lf/WATERLF0503.pdf","http://extension.oregonstate.edu/douglas/sites/default/files/documents/lf/WATERLF0503.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2q719335u606034/fulltext.pdf","http://www.fba.org.uk/pdf/ReviewOfFreshwaterEcology.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Liquid water","Hydrology"],"headings":["Systems","Source","Water distribution","Numerical definition","Aquatic organisms","Fresh water as a resource","Accessing fresh water","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/240px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Water_surface_lake.jpg/220px-Water_surface_lake.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Earth_water_distribution.svg/290px-Earth_water_distribution.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Fresh_water_fountain.jpg/180px-Fresh_water_fountain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["upland_and_lowland","freshwater_ecology"]],"members":["salt","precipitation","upland_and_lowland"],"related":["Apollo_17","Antarctic_ice_sheet","Water","Earth","Ice_sheet","Ice_cap","Glacier","Icebergs","Bog","Pond","Lake","River","Stream","Groundwater","Aquifer","Concentration","Salt_(chemistry)","Total_dissolved_solids","Seawater","Brackish_water","Chalybeate","Salt_water","Lentic","Pond","Swamp","Bog","Lotic","Groundwater","Aquifer","Hyporheic_zone","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Earth's_atmosphere","Mist","Rain","Snow","Atmosphere","Industry","Acidic","Sulfur","Nitrogen","Acid_rain","Pollution","Sodium","Chloride","Magnesium","Sulfate","Desert","Sand","Dust","Iron","Sahara","North_Africa","Lake_Kariba","Mammal","Rodent","Metabolism","Cereal","Earth","Ocean","Sea","Groundwater","Glacier","Ice","Snow","Groundwater","Soil","Surface_water","Lake","Swamp","River","United_States_Geological_Survey","African_Great_Lakes","Lake_Baikal","North_American_Great_Lakes","Swamp","Amazon_River","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Ice_sheet","Parts_per_million","Salt","American_Meteorological_Society","Practical_Fishkeeping","Hypotonicity","Gill","Protist","Contractile_vacuole","Freshwater_fish","Kidney","Osmotic","Diadromous","Fish","Fish_migration","Seawater","Eel","Hormone","Prolactin","Salmon","Cortisol","Sea_bird","Marine_iguana","Galápagos_Islands","Streamflow","Instream_use","Ecosystem","Petroleum","Royal_Dutch_Shell","Argentina","Soil","Human","Irrigation","Water_cycle","Reservoirs","Climate_change","Water_pollution","Eutrophication","Canada","India","African_Great_Lakes","Aral_Sea","Desalination","Upland_and_lowland_(freshwater_ecology)","Great_Lakes","Lake_Baikal","Lake","Limnology","List_of_countries_by_freshwater_withdrawal","List_of_countries_by_total_renewable_water_resources","River","Seawater","Water_crisis","Water_cycle","Properties_of_water","Water_resources","Drinking_water","Water_well","Freshwater_Biological_Association","Environment_Agency"]}
