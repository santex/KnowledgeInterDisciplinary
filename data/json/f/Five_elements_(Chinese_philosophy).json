{"cursor":"20068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Wu Xing', ( wÅ­ xÃ­ng) also known as the 'Five Elements', 'Five Phases', the\n'Five Agents', the 'Five Movements', 'Five Processes', and the 'Five\nSteps/Stages', is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese\nfields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the\ninteraction between internal organs, and from the succession of political\nregimes to the properties of medicinal drugs. The \"Five Phases\" are Wood ( mÃ¹),\nFire ( huÇ), Earth ( tÇ), Metal ( jÄ«n), and Water ( shuÇ). This order of\npresentation is known as the \"mutual generation\" (xiangsheng ç¸ç) sequence. In\nthe order of \"mutual conquest\" (xiangsheng ç¸ç) or \"mutual overcoming\" (xiangke\nç¸å), they are Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal.\n\n\"Wu Xing\" is often translated as 'Five Elements' and this is used extensively\nby many including practitioners of Five Element acupuncture. This translation\narose by false analogy with the Western system of the four elements. Nathan\nSivin (1995), \"Science and Medicine in Chinese History,\" in his Science in\nAncient China (Aldershot, England: Variorum), text VI, p. 179. Whereas\nthe classical Greek elements were concerned with substances or natural\nqualities, the Chinese xing are \"primarily concerned with process and change,\"\nhence the common translation as \"phases\" or \"agents.\" Nathan Sivin (1987), Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China (Ann\nArbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan) p. 73. By\nthe same token, Mu is thought of as \"Tree\" rather than \"Wood\". {{Cite media\n|title = åå¤ä¸­å»ä¹å¼ ä»²æ¯. Wood and Metal were often replaced with air |publisher =\nLecture Room, CCTV-10}} The words Element is thus used within the context\nof Chinese medicine with a different meaning to its usual meaning. Evolution of\nlanguage in this way is not without precedence. It should be recognized that\nthe word Phase although commonly preferred may be better, but is not perfect.\nPhase is a better translation for the five 'seasons'(äºé wÅ­ yÃ¹n) mentioned\nbelow, and so Agents or Processes might be preferred for the primary term Xing.\nManfred Porkert attempts to resolve this by using 'Evolutive Phase' for Wu Xing\n(äºè¡ wÅ­ xÃ­ng) and 'Circuit Phase' for Wu Yun (äºé wÅ­ yÃ¹n), but these have the\ndrawback of being unwieldy terms. In some ways arguing for one one term over\nanother is a flawed argument because any single word is probably inadequate for\ntranslation of what is a concept.\n\nSome of the Mawangdui Silk Texts (no later than 168 BC) also present the Wu Xing\nas \"five virtues\" or types of activities. Nathan Sivin (1987), Traditional\nMedicine in Contemporary China, p. 72. Within Chinese medicine texts the\nWu Xing are also referred to as Wu Yun (äºé wÅ­ yÃ¹n) or a combination of the two\ncharacters (Wu Xing-Yun) these emphasise the correspondence of five elements to\nfive 'seasons' (four seasons plus one). Another tradition refers to the wu xing\nas wu de äºå¾·, the Five Virtues ().\n\nThe system of five phases was used for describing interactions and relationships\nbetween phenomena. After it came to maturity in the second or first century BCE\nduring the Han dynasty, this device was employed in many fields of early Chinese\nthought, including seemingly disparate fields such as geomancy or Feng shui,\nastrology, traditional Chinese medicine, music, military strategy and martial\narts. The system is still used as a reference in some forms of complementary and\nalternative medicine and martial arts.\n","linknr":657,"url":"Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)","recorded":1362372199,"links":56,"instances":["substance","color","wu_xing","chinese_medicine","geometry","chinese_medicine","four_symbols","fire","chinese_medicine","wu_xing","chinese_medicine","wu_xing","geology","chinese_medicine","chinese_astronomy","chinese_medicine","sense","anatomy","chinese_medicine","wu_xing","taste","chinese_medicine","substance","physics","planet","knowledge","chinese_medicine","anatomy","chinese_medicine","wu_xing","chinese_medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chinese
