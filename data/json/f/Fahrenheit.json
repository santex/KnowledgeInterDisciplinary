Within this scale, the freezing of water into ice is\ndefined at 32 degrees, while the boiling point of water is defined to be\n212 degrees - on Fahrenheit's original scale the freezing point of brine\nwas zero degrees.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, most countries used the Celsius scale rather\nthan the Fahrenheit scale, though Canada retains it as a supplementary scale\nthat can be used alongside Celsius.
