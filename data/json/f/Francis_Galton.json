He was\nknighted in 1909.\n\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books. He also created the statistical\nconcept of correlation and widely promoted regression toward the mean. He was\nthe first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and\ninheritance of intelligence, and introduced the use of questionnaires and\nsurveys for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for\ngenealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies.\n\nHe was a pioneer in eugenics, coining the term itself and the phrase \"nature\nversus nurture\". His book Hereditary Genius (1869) was the first social\nscientific attempt to study genius and greatness. Galton, F. (1869). [http://galton.org/books/hereditary-\ngenius/ Hereditary Genius]. London: Macmillan.\n\nAs an investigator of the human mind, he founded psychometrics (the science of\nmeasuring mental faculties) and differential psychology and the lexical\nhypothesis of personality. He devised a method for classifying fingerprints that\nproved useful in forensic science. He also conducted research on the power of\nprayer, concluding it had none by its null effects on the longevity of those\nprayed for. http://www.abelard.org/galton/galton.htm\n\nAs the initiator of scientific meteorology, he devised the first weather map,\nproposed a theory of anticyclones, and was the first to establish a complete\nrecord of short-term climatic phenomena on a European\nscale.
