Lady Justice is depicted as a goddess equipped with\n three symbols of justice: a sword symbolising the court's coercive power;\n scales representing an objective standard by which competing claims are\n weighed; and a blindfold indicating that justice is or should be meted out\n objectively, without fear or favor, regardless of power, money, wealth, or\n identity.<ref>Luban, Law's Blindfold, 23</ref>]]\n\n'Law' is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition,<ref\nname=\"Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39\">Lord Lloyd of Hampstead.\nIntroduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens & Sons. London. 1972.\nSecond Impression. 1975. Page 39.</ref> but one definition is that law is a\nsystem of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to\ngovern behavior<!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED ,wherever possible-->.<ref\nname=\"ReferenceB\">Robertson, Crimes against humanity, 90.</ref> Laws are made by\ngovernments, specifically by their legislatures. The formation of laws\nthemselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the\nrights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics and society in\ncountless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.\n\nA general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions (including\nCanon and Socialist law), in which the legislature or other central body\ncodifies and consolidates their laws, and common law systems, where judge-made\nbinding precedents are accepted. Historically, religious laws played a\nsignificant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case in\nsome countries, particularly Islamic, and some religious communities,\nparticularly Jewish Halakha.\n\nThe adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. Criminal\nlaw deals with conduct that is considered harmful to social order and in which\nthe guilty party may be imprisoned or fined. Civil law (not to be confused with\ncivil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of lawsuits (disputes)\nbetween individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a legal\nremedy (often monetary damages) to the winning litigant.\n\nUnder civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: Contract law\nregulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets.\nProperty law regulates the transfer and title of personal property and real\nproperty. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial\nsecurity. Tort law allows claims for compensation if a person's property is\nharmed. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the\nprotection of human rights and the election of political representatives.\nAdministrative law is used to review the decisions of government agencies.\nInternational law governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging\nfrom trade to military action.\n\nTo implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public\nservants, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While\nall these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an\nindependent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support\ntheir progress.\n\nLaw provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy,\neconomic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues\nconcerning equality, fairness, and justice. All are equal before the law. The\nauthor Anatole France said in 1894, \"In its majestic equality, the law forbids\nrich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves\nof bread.\"<ref>(France, The Red Lily, [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-\nlily/8/ Chapter VII]). The original French is: \"La loi, dans un grand souci\nd'égalité, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de\nmendier dans les rues et de voler du pain.\".</ref> Writing in 350 BC, the Greek\nphilosopher Aristotle declared, \"The rule of law is better than the rule of any\nindividual.\"<ref>Aristotle. Politics, Book 3#3:16. n.b. This translation reads,\n\"it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens\"</ref>\nMikhail Bakunin said: \"All law has for its object to confirm and exalt into a\nsystem the exploitation of the workers by a ruling class\".<ref>Stewart and\nBurgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. ISBN 0 00\n470009 0. Page 229.</ref> Cicero said \"more law, less justice\".<ref>Cicero, De\nofficiis, I, 10, 33. Latin: \"summum ius, summa iniuria\". For the translation\ngiven above, see, for example, Adler and Doren, Great Treasury of Western\nThought, Bowker, 1977, p 851.</ref> Marxist doctrine asserts that law will not\nbe required once the state has withered away.<ref>\"Withering away of the state\".\nPalgrave McMillan Dictionary of Political Thought. 2007.</ref>\n","title":"law","headings":["Definition","Legal subjects","Legal
