Campbell Memorial Award in 2002. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2002 title =\n| 2002 Award Winners & Nominees work = Worlds Without End accessdate=2009-07-11\n}}\n\nIt centres on Hal Cousins, a scientist who wishes to find a way to prevent\ndeath. He gets his funding from angel investors - rich businessmen who are keen\nto live a thousand years. However, on a fact-finding exploration in a small\nsubmarine, his pilot goes berserk, starts spouting gibberish, and tries to kill\nhim. He survives, but when he gets back to the ship, he finds that a member of\nthe crew also went mad and started spouting gibberish, killing four scientists\non board the ship. The rest of the crew is distant from him, on the grounds of\nwhat he calls bad [[mojo (African American culture)|mojo]]. He is disowned by\nthe sponsor in question. Hal's twin brother Rob is shot, by who is later\nrevealed to be Ben Bridger.\n\nThe story develops from there, taking in his twin brother's widow, Lissa; Rudy\nBanning, a once respected professor and writer turned into an anti-semitic\nconspiracy theorist by a brain-altering microbe; and a scheming group of\nimmortals who want to stay unique. They are able to do this because they have\naccess to bacteriological research by Russian scientist Maxim Golokhov from the\n1940s who was working for Beria and Stalin. Stalin possibly cameos in the story,\nbut the issue is left vague.\n\nThere are five parts with different first-person narrators. Parts one, three,\nand five are narrated by Hal Cousins, and parts two and four are narrated by\nBenjamin Bridger.\n\nBy the end of the book, the main characters are all either dead, irrelevant, or\nthe victim of mind altering xenophages.\n\nSome elements of the book relate to transhumanism and life extension. Biology is\na major theme in Bear's work, and bacteria and bacterial intelligence played a\ncentral role in his 1983 novel [[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]] as well.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Vitals_(novel)","recorded":1374965724,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Vital_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Science_fiction","/wiki/Techno-thriller","/wiki/Novel","/wiki/Greg_Bear","/wiki/John_W._Campbell_Memorial_Award","#cite_note-WWE-2002-1","/wiki/Angel_investors","/wiki/Mojo_(African_American_culture)","/wiki/Anti-Semitism","/wiki/Conspiracy_theory","/wiki/Immortality","/wiki/Microbiology","/wiki/Lavrenty_Beria","/wiki/Joseph_Stalin","/wiki/Transhumanism","/wiki/Life_expectancy","/wiki/Bacteria","/wiki/Blood_Music_(novel)","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-WWE-2002_1-0","http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2002","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.worldswithoutend.com/novel.asp?ID=400","/wiki/File:Sfbook.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Sfbook.png/30px-Sfbook.png","/wiki/Science_fiction_novel","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:2000s-sf-novel-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:2000s-sf-novel-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:2000s-sf-novel-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&oldid=414126882","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2000s_science_fiction_novels","/wiki/Category:American_science_fiction_novels","/wiki/Category:2002_novels","/wiki/Category:Novels_by_Greg_Bear","/wiki/Category:2000s_science_fiction_novel_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vitals+%28novel%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Vitals+%28novel%29","/wiki/Vitals_(novel)","/wiki/Talk:Vitals_(novel)","#","/wiki/Vitals_(novel)","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Vitals_(novel)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Vitals_(novel)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&oldid=414126882","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7936915","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Vitals_%28novel%29&id=414126882","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Vitals+%28novel%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Vitals+%28novel%29&oldid=414126882&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Vitals_(novel)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7936915#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitals_(novel)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["2000s
