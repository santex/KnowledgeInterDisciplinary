{"cursor":"56747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Morality' (from the Latin {{Lang|la|moralitas}} \"manner, character, proper\nbehavior\") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between\nthose that are \"good\" (or right) and those that are \"bad\" (or wrong). The\nphilosophy of morality is ethics. A moral code is a system of morality\n(according to a particular philosophy, religion, culture, etc.) and a moral is\nany one practice or teaching within a moral code. Morality may also be\nspecifically synonymous with \"goodness\" or \"rightness.\" Immorality is the active\nopposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while\namorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or\ndisbelief in any set of moral standards or principles.\n\n\n\n \"having no moral standards, restraints, or principles; unaware of or\nindifferent to questions of right or wrong\"  \"(of people) not\nbelieving in or caring for morality and immorality\"  An example of a moral\ncode is the Golden Rule which states that, \"One should treat others as one would\nlike others to treat oneself.\" This dictionary of philosophy\ncontains the following exact quote under the entry for \"golden rule\": \"The maxim\n'Treat others how you wish to be treated'. Various expressions of this\nfundamental moral rule are to be found in tenets of most religions and creeds\nthrough the ages, testifying to its universal applicability.\" (end
