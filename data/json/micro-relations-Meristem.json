{"cursor":"27649","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". The inner L3 layer is called the corpus. Cells in the L1 and L2 layers divide\n  in a sideways fashion, which keeps these layers distinct, whereas the L3 layer\n  divides in a more random fashion.|right]]\n\nA 'meristem' is the tissue in most plants consisting of undifferentiated cells\n('meristematic cells'), found in zones of the plant where growth can take place.\n\nThe meristematic cells give rise to various organs of the plant, and keep the\nplant growing. The Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) gives rise to organs like the\nleaves and flowers. The cells of the apical meristems - SAM and RAM (Root Apical\nMeristem) - divide rapidly and are considered to be indeterminate, in that they\ndo not possess any defined end fate. In that sense, the meristematic cells are\nfrequently compared to the stem cells in animals, which have an analogous\nbehavior and function.\n\nThe term meristem was first used in 1858 by Karl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli (1817â1891)\nin his book BeitrÃ¤ge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik.

ISBN 9789812704085 It is derived from the Greek word merizein\n(Î¼ÎµÏÎ¯Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½), meaning to divide, in recognition of its inherent function.\n\nIn general, differentiated plant cells cannot divide or produce cells of a\ndifferent type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is required to provide\nnew cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new\norgans, providing the basic structure of the plant body.\n\nMeristematic cells are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are\ncapable of continued cellular division (youthful). Furthermore, the cells are\nsmall and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely\nsmall. The cytoplasm does not contain differentiated plastids (chloroplasts or\nchromoplasts), although they are present in rudimentary form (proplastids).\nMeristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities.\nThe cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.\n\nMaintenance of the cells requires a balance between two antagonistic processes:\norgan initiation and stem cell population renewal.\n","linknr":436,"url":"Meristem","recorded":1362372938,"links":52,"instances":["biochemistry","genetics","chemistry","botany","botany","biochemistry","genes"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Plant physiology","Tissues"],"headings":["Meristematic zones","Apical meristems","Primary meristems","Secondary meristems","Indeterminate growth of meristems","Cloning","See also","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/M%C3%A9rist%C3%A8me_couches.png/240px-M%C3%A9rist%C3%A8me_couches.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/M%C3%A9rist%C3%A8me_coupe_zones_chiffres.png/250px-M%C3%A9rist%C3%A8me_coupe_zones_chiffres.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Root-tip-tag.png/220px-Root-tip-tag.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Linaria_spur.jpg/200px-Linaria_spur.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Cardamine_hirsuta.jpg/180px-Cardamine_hirsuta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1859-Martinique.web.jpg/100px-1859-Martinique.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["homology","chemistry"],["conservation","genetics"],["knox","genes"],["epidermis","botany"],["cortex","botany"]],"members":["receptor","conservation","homology","cortex","epidermis","ligand","knox"],"related":["Biological_tissue","Plant","Stem_cells","Animal","Karl_Wilhelm_von_Nägeli","Mitosis","Cellular_differentiation","Protoplasm","Vacuole","Cytoplasm","Plastid","Chloroplast","Chromoplast","Proplastid","Soybean","Pea","Rhizobium","Oligosaccharide","Nod-factor","Leucine-rich_repeat","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Kinase","Peptide","Phenotype","Cellular_differentiation","Bud","Plant","Root","Shoot","Monocot","Dicot","Primordia","Plastochron","Stem_cell","Stem_cell","Cell_division","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Homology_(chemistry)","Maize","Amino_acid","Conservation_(genetics)","Cytoplasm","Signal_transduction","GTPase","Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase","Cellular_differentiation","Root_cap","Monocot","Horsetails","Stamen","Carpel","Apical_dominance","Auxin","Vascular_cambium","Strigolactone","Mycorrhizal_fungi","Stem_cells","Regulation","Maize","Rice","Monocots","Angiosperms","Stem_cell","Innovation","Genetic_screens","KNOX_(genes)","Arabidopsis_thaliana","Rice","Barley","Tomato","Algae","Spur","Innovation","Pollinator","Transposon","Leaf","Complex_leaves","Vascular_plants","Correlation","Complex_leaf","Epidermis_(botany)","Xylem","Phloem","Vascular_cambium","Cortex_(botany)","Pith","Cork_cambium","Vascular_cambium","Wood","Arborescent","Herbaceous","Cork_cambium","Cloning","Horticulture","Genotype","Thallus","University_of_Texas"]}
