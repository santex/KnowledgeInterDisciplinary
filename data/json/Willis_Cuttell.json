Along with Albert Hallam,\nhis support for Briggs and Mold gave Lancashire its first official County\nchampionship victory in 1897. His bowling was also important to Lancashire's\nChampionship win seven years later, in which they went through the whole season\nwithout being beaten.\n\nCuttell was a slow right-arm bowler who possessed the unusual ability to turn\nthe ball from leg without throwing it up enough to encourage risk-taking batsmen\nto attack him. He was very accurate in length and also possessed the\ncharacteristic break-back of most bowlers of his time, which made him as\nunplayable as any bowler when the pitch helped him.\n\nHe was very slow to move into first-class cricket. Cuttell's early cricket was\nplayed for the Accrington Club in the Lancashire League. Having been born in\nYorkshire and his father William Cuttell having played for them in the 1860s, he\ndecided to try for a place in the Yorkshire eleven. However, his form in a\ncouple of matches against opposition that was not recognized as first-class was\nnot encouraging, so that Willis returned to league cricket. From 1891 he shifted\nto the Nelson Club (later famous as where Ted McDonald played when qualifying\nfor Lancashire) and proved himself the best bowler in league cricket. In 1895 he\ntook 106 wickets for 8Â½ runs apiece and in 1893 as many as 118 wickets fell to\nhis bowling in league games.\n\nCuttell, long qualified by residence for Lancashire, was finally engaged by them\nfor the season of 1896. He played only two games and then was dropped, but the\nfollowing year, after a rather slow start, Cuttell showed himself right up to\nthe standard of first-class county cricket. On hard pitches he was never\nespecially difficult, but on the softer pitches at the end of the season he was\nfrequently deadly, taking twelve for 81 in the last match against\nNottinghamshire. His work on soft pitches was deadly enough for him to head the\nLancashire averages for all first-class games and was chosen as [[Wisden\nCricketers of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]] by [[Wisden Cricketers'\nAlmanack|Wisden]].\n\nIn 1898, with Hallam ill, Mold injured more than once, and Briggs terribly out\nof form, Cuttell became the mainstay of Lancashire cricket. Although his wickets\nwere very expensive considering the many rain-affected wickets, his batting\nadvanced so much that he accomplished the \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100\nwickets. He achieved his best haul of eight for 105 against Gloucestershire on a\ngood pitch in July. He toured South Africa because the matting wickets were\nexpected to suit his style, but did nothing of remarkable quality in his only\nTests. The following year, with very few pitches to help him, Cuttell was less\nsuccessful as a bowler and could not gain a place against Australia, but he\nbatted very well, scoring 137 against Nottinghamshire and scoring more runs than\nin any other season. 1900 saw Cuttell re-assert himself as one of the best\nbowlers in England, but with Rhodes and Haigh establishing themselves as the\ndeadliest bowlers on sticky wickets Cuttell's days as a representative player\nwere over. 1901 to 1903 were very disappointing both in batting and bowling, but\nin 1904 Cuttell's bowling on several sticky wickets in May was decisive in\ngiving Lancashire a surprise championship win after losing Sydney Barnes.\n\nDespite a dreadful 1905, Cuttell bowled with deadly effect in 1906, being ahead\neven of Haigh in the national bowling averages despite taking over 100 fewer\nwickets. However, aged 43, he had already decided on the post of coach at Rugby,\nwhich he held right through to 1926. At the age of 63, he then became an umpire\nin county matches, but could carry out this role for only two years before his\nhealth deteriorated too much.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Willis_Cuttell","recorded":1375079292,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Willis_Cuttell_Cigarette_Card.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Willis_Cuttell_Cigarette_Card.jpg/220px-Willis_Cuttell_Cigarette_Card.jpg","/wiki/English_cricket_team","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)","/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket","/wiki/Bowling_average","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman","http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/10900.html","/wiki/Sheffield","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Nelson,_England","/wiki/Lancashire","/wiki/England","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Albert_Hallam","/wiki/Johnny_Briggs_(cricketer)","/wiki/Arthur_Mold","/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Ted_McDonald","/wiki/Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year","/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers%27_Almanack","/wiki/Wilfred_Rhodes","/wiki/Schofield_Haigh","/wiki/Sydney_Barnes","/wiki/Rugby_School","/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=edit&section=1","http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/223/f_Batting_by_Season.html","http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/0/223/f_Bowling_by_Season.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&oldid=557481535","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1863_births","/wiki/Category:1929_deaths","/wiki/Category:England_Test_cricketers","/wiki/Category:English_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Lancashire_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Sportspeople_from_Sheffield","/wiki/Category:Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year","/wiki/Category:Players_cricketers","/wiki/Category:North_v_South_cricketers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Willis+Cuttell&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Willis+Cuttell","/wiki/Willis_Cuttell","/wiki/Talk:Willis_Cuttell","#","/wiki/Willis_Cuttell","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Willis_Cuttell","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Willis_Cuttell","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&oldid=557481535","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3529507","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Willis_Cuttell&id=557481535","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Willis+Cuttell","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Willis+Cuttell&oldid=557481535&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Willis_Cuttell&printable=yes","//mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%89%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B2","//ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3529507#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/
