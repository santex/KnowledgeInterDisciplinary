{"cursor":"53944","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Meat' is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Lawrie,\n1. Humans are omnivorous, and have hunted and killed animals for meat\nsince prehistoric times. But the advent of civilization allowed the\ndomestication of animals such as sheep, pigs and cattle, and their use in meat\nproduction on an industrial scale.\n\nMeat is mainly composed of water and protein, and is usually eaten together with\nother food. It is edible raw but is normally eaten cooked and seasoned in a\nvariety of ways. Unprocessed, it will spoil within hours or days.\n\nMeat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious\npreferences. Vegetarians choose not to eat meat because of ethical,\nenvironmental, religious or health concerns that are associated with meat\nproduction and consumption.\n","linknr":1422,"url":"Meat","recorded":1362504671,"links":143,"instances":["food","food","food","food","food_preservation","food","genetics","food","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/293589/wrs011c_1_.pdf","http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/265_podberscek.pdf","http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/265_podberscek.pdf","http://www.beef.org/uDocs/whatyoumisswithoutmeat638.pdf","http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/foodreview/jan1996/frjan96f.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf"],"categories":["Meat|","Meat
