A hospital is one common type of medical facility.]]\n\n, illustrating a common smaller facility.]]\n\nA 'medical facility' is, in general, any location at which medicine is practiced\nregularly.

The number and quality of medical facilities in a country or\nregion is one common measure of that area's prosperity and quality of life. In\nmany countries, medical facilities are regulated to some extent by law;\nlicensing by a regulatory agency is often required before a facility may open\nfor business. Medical facilities may be owned and operated by for-profit\nbusinesses, non-profit organizations, governments, and in some cases by\nindividuals, with proportions varying by country.\n","linknr":216,"url":"Medical_facility","recorded":1362689489,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ahwo.gov.au/documents/Publications/1996/Australian%20medical%20workforce%20benchmarks.pdf","http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/4FAEFE0B-0194-40FC-A1F7-7BA9CC96F0CD/0/44finalDefinitions2010.pdf"],"categories":["Health care"],"headings":["Medical facility workload","Types of medical facility","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Hartford_Hospital_main_entrance.JPG/220px-Hartford_Hospital_main_entrance.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/2008-09-02_NC_Eye%2C_Ear%2C_Nose_%26_Throat_in_Durham.jpg/220px-2008-09-02_NC_Eye%2C_Ear%2C_Nose_%26_Throat_in_Durham.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/13px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Hartford,_Connecticut","Hospital","Medicine","Clinic","Doctor's_office","Urgent_care","Hospital","Emergency_room","Trauma_center","Country","Prosperity","Quality_of_life","Regulation","Health_law","Licensing","Business","Non-profit_organization","Government","Individual","Health_care","Patient","Disease","Primary_health_care","For-profit_hospital","Non-profit_organization","Health_insurance","Charitable_organization","Clinic","Doctor's_office","Urgent_care","Ambulatory_surgery_center","Residential_treatment_center","Geriatric_care_management","Hospital_pharmacy","Laboratory","Health","Patient","Microbiology","Hematology","Clinical_biochemistry","Immunology","Serology","Histology","Cell_biology","Cytogenetics","Virology","Hospital","General_practitioner","Basic_research","Applied_research","Medicine","Clinical_trial","Pre-clinical_development","Health_care_industry","Lists_of_hospitals"]}
