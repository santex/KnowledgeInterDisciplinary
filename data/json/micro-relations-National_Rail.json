{"cursor":"11798","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n {{Infobox Brand |logo= |name= National Rail |image= |type= Public transport\n |currentowner= ATOC |origin= |introduced= 1999 |discontinued= |related=\n National Rail Enquiries |markets= United Kingdom |previousowners= British Rail\n |website= http://www.nationalrail.co.uk }} 'National Rail' is used by the\n Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) as a generic term to define the\n passenger rail services operated in Great Britain - before the adoption of\n National Rail, \"Great Britain Passenger Railway\" was used. ATOC is an\n unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger Train\n Operating Companies (TOCs) of Great Britain that run the passenger services\n previously provided by the British Railways Board, from 1965 using the brand\n name British Rail). National Rail generally does not include services that do\n not have a BR history; this distinction is important because National Rail\n services share a ticketing structure and inter-availability that do not\n necessarily extend to other services.\n\nThe National Rail (NR) logo was introduced by ATOC in 1999, and was used on the\nGreat Britain public timetable for the first time in the edition valid from 26\nSeptember in that year. Rules for its use are set out in the Corporate Identity\nStyle Guidelines published by ATOC, available on its\nwebsite. http://www.nationalrailguidelines.co.uk The NR title is\nsometimes described as a \"brand\" but according to ATOC this is incorrect. The\n2000 guidelines said: 'It has not been designed as a brand or identity, but to\nexplain to rail travellers that there is a National Railway network and material\ncarrying this descriptor covers all passenger Train Companies.' Consistent use\nof the NR logo on signs and maps, however, points travellers to railway\nstations. As it was used by British Rail, the single operator before\nfranchising, its use also maintains continuity and public familiarity; and it\navoids the need to replace signage.\n","linknr":258,"url":"National_Rail","recorded":1362897031,"links":31,"instances":["typeface","typeface","typeface"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Post-privatisation British railway companies","1999 establishments in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["National Rail and Network Rail","Train operating companies (TOCs)","Design and marketing","Other passenger rail operators in Great Britain","Ticketing","Timetables and websites","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/NationalRail.svg/250px-NationalRail.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/British_rail_ticket_Wellington_Shrewsbury.jpg/250px-British_rail_ticket_Wellington_Shrewsbury.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/EK_to_Central_Ticket.jpg/220px-EK_to_Central_Ticket.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sassoon","typeface"],["bliss","typeface"],["precious","typeface"]],"members":["bliss","precious","sassoon"],"related":["Association_of_Train_Operating_Companies","United_Kingdom","British_Rail","Association_of_Train_Operating_Companies","Unincorporated_association","Train_Operating_Company","Great_Britain","British_Rail","Shrewsbury","London","Heathrow_Express","London_Underground","Privatisation_of_British_Rail","Look_and_feel","Design_Research_Unit","Trademark","Secretary_of_State_for_Transport","Sassoon_(typeface)","Rail_Alphabet","Helvetica","Univers","Frutiger","Futura","Stagecoach_Group","FirstGroup","National_Express","Arriva_Trains_Wales","Bliss_(typeface)","CrossCountry","Precious_(typeface)","London_Midland","Rapid_transit","Tram","London_Underground","Docklands_Light_Railway","Blackpool_tramway","Tramlink","Glasgow_Subway","Tyne_and_Wear_Metro","Manchester_Metrolink","Sheffield_Supertram","Midland_Metro","Nottingham_Express_Transit","Merseyrail","London_Midland","Valley_Lines","Strathclyde_Partnership_for_Transport","West_Yorkshire_Passenger_Transport_Executive","London_Overground","Transport_for_London","Network_Rail","Silverlink","Heathrow_Express","Eurostar","Northern_Ireland_Railways","List_of_British_heritage_and_private_railways","British_Rail","Heathrow_Express","London_Underground","Oyster_card","Greater_London","Penalty_fare","Great_Britain_railway_technical_manuals","Great_Britain_railway_technical_manuals","Rail_Accident_Investigation_Branch","Rail_transport_in_the_United_Kingdom","Disabled_Persons_Railcard"]}
