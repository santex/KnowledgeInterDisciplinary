They are found in plant seeds, egg whites, and milk.\n\nFerritin is an example of a storage protein that stores iron. Iron is a\ncomponent of heme, which is contained in the transport protein hemoglobin and in\ncytochromes.\n\nSome storage proteins store amino acids. Storage proteins' amino acids are used\nin embryonic development of animals or plants. Two amino acid storage proteins\nin animals are casein and ovalbumin.\n\nSeeds, particularly of leguminous plants, contain high concentrations of storage\nproteins. Up to 25 percent of the dry weight of the seed can be composed of\nstorage proteins.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Protein_storage","recorded":1362676670,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins","Molecular biology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg/30px-Blue_morpho_butterfly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ions","Amino_acids","Ferritin","Heme","Transport_protein","Hemoglobin","Cytochromes","Casein","Ovalbumin","Plant_seed_proteins"]}
