The age of the organisms and their\nresulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650\nmillion years. Paul Mann, Lisa Gahagan, and Mark B. Gordon, \"Tectonic\nsetting of the world's giant oil and gas fields,\" in Michel T. Halbouty (ed.)\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=mrghwzjeU-AC&pg=PA50 Giant Oil and Gas Fields\nof the Decade, 1990â1999], Tulsa, Okla.: American Association of Petroleum\nGeologists, p.50, accessed 22 June 2009. Fossil fuels contain high\npercentages of carbon and include coal, petroleum, and natural gas.\nThey range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen ratios like methane,\nto liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon,\nlike anthracite coal. Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields, alone,\nassociated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates. Fossil fuels formed\nfrom the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and\npressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years. This biogenic\ntheory was first introduced by Georg Agricola in 1556 and later by Mikhail\nLomonosov in the 18th century.\n\nIt was estimated by the Energy Information Administration that in 2007 primary\nsources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%,\namounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in\nthe world. Non-fossil sources in 2006 included hydroelectric 6.3%,\nnuclear 8.5%, and others (geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste) amounting\nto 0.9%. World energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year.\n\nFossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to\nform, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.\nThe production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global\nmovement toward the generation of renewable energy is therefore under way to\nhelp meet increased energy needs.\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3\ngigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO 2) per year, but it is estimated\nthat natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a\nnet increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one\ntonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon\ndioxide). Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances\nradiative forcing and contributes to global warming, causing the average surface\ntemperature of the Earth to rise in response, which the vast majority of climate\nscientists agree will cause major adverse effects.\n","linknr":622,"url":"Fossil_fuels","recorded":1362373442,"links":108,"instances":["petroleum_industry","waste","chemistry","geology","petroleum_industry"],"pdf":["http://www.worldbank.org/html/fpd/ggfrforum06/kadany.pdf","http://www.worldbank.org/html/fpd/ggfrforum06/kadany.pdf","http://acaa.affiniscape.com/associations/8003/files/2004_CCP_Survey(9-9-05).pdf","http://acaa.affiniscape.com/associations/8003/files/2004_CCP_Survey(9-9-05).pdf","http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf","http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf"],"categories":["Fossil
