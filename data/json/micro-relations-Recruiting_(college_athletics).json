{"cursor":"24140","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" athletes often end with a hat selection ceremony in which they make a verbal\n commitment.]] In college athletics, recruiting is the term used for the process\n whereby college coaches add prospective student athletes to their roster each\n off-season. In most instances, it involves a coach extending an athletic\n scholarship offer to a player who is about to graduate from high school or a\n junior college. There are instances, mostly at lower division universities,\n where no scholarship can be awarded and the player has to pay for all of his or\n her own tuition, housing, and book fees. During this recruiting process, most schools try hard\n to comply with recruiting bylaws that support the NCAAâs underlying principles\n of fairness and integrity. The rules define who may be involved in the\n recruiting process, when recruiting may occur and the conditions under which\n recruiting may be conducted. Recruiting rules seek, as much as possible, to\n control intrusions into the lives of prospective student-athletes. The NCAA\n defines recruiting as âany solicitation of prospective student-athletes or\n their parents by an institutional staff member or by a representative of the\n institutionâs athletics interests for the purpose of securing a prospective student-\n athleteâs enrollment and ultimate participation in the institutionâs\n intercollegiate athletics program.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Recruiting_(college_athletics)","recorded":1364134610,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:20121220_Jabari_Parker_verbal_commitment_press_conference_team_hats.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/20121220_Jabari_Parker_verbal_commitment_press_conference_team_hats.JPG/220px-20121220_Jabari_Parker_verbal_commitment_press_conference_team_hats.JPG","/wiki/File:20121220_Jabari_Parker_verbal_commitment_press_conference_team_hats.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Blue_chip_(sports)","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruiting_(college_athletics)","/wiki/Athletic_scholarship","#cite_note-The_Use_and_Misuse_of_College_Athletics-1","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#General_Recruiting_Process","#National_Letter_of_Intent","#Intercollegiate_Athletics","#College_football","#College_basketball","#Terminology","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-FastWeb-3","#cite_note-FastWeb-3","#cite_note-FastWeb-3","#cite_note-FastWeb-3","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-Koch-4","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-National_Letter_of_Intent-5","#cite_note-National_Letter_of_Intent-5","#cite_note-National_Letter_of_Intent-5","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-The_Use_and_Misuse_of_College_Athletics-1","#cite_note-Koch-4","#cite_note-NCAA_Manuel-6","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-Letawsky-7","#cite_note-Drescher-8","#cite_note-Letawsky-7","/wiki/College_athletics","/wiki/Coach_(sport)","/wiki/Roster","/wiki/Athletic_scholarship","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Junior_college","/wiki/Tuition","/wiki/Premium-rate_telephone_number","/wiki/Online","/wiki/Website","/wiki/Video","/wiki/Statistics","/wiki/Interview","/wiki/Subscription_business_model","/wiki/NCAA_student-athlete_recruiting","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Bowl_Subdivision","/wiki/NCAA","/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)#Football_Championship_Subdivision","/wiki/Division_II_(NCAA)","/wiki/College_campus","/wiki/40-yard_dash","/wiki/Vertical_jump","/wiki/Bench_press","/wiki/SPARQ_Training","/wiki/National_Signing_Day","/wiki/National_Letter_of_Intent","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Union","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Oversigning","#cite_note-NCAA_Manuel-6","#cite_note-NCAA-2","#cite_note-NCAA-2","/wiki/Blue_chip_(sports)","/wiki/National_Letter_of_Intent","#cite_note-NCAA-2","/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft","/wiki/Eligibility_for_the_NBA_Draft","/wiki/WNBA_Draft","/wiki/NFL_Draft","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Draft","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series","/wiki/Mid-major","/w/index.php?title=Recruiting_(college_athletics)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-The_Use_and_Misuse_of_College_Athletics_1-0","#cite_ref-The_Use_and_Misuse_of_College_Athletics_1-1","/wiki/JSTOR","http://www.jstor.org/stable/1980793","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-0","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-1","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-2","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-3","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-4","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-5","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-6","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-7","#cite_ref-NCAA_2-8","http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/Test/Issues/Recruiting/","http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/Test/Issues/Recruiting/","#cite_ref-FastWeb_3-0","#cite_ref-FastWeb_3-1","#cite_ref-FastWeb_3-2","#cite_ref-FastWeb_3-3","http://www.fastweb.com/college-search/articles/693-playing-the-ncaa-game-rules-for-recruitment","http://www.fastweb.com/college-search/articles/693-playing-the-ncaa-game-rules-for-recruitment","#cite_ref-Koch_4-0","#cite_ref-Koch_4-1","/wiki/JSTOR","http://www.jstor.org/stable/1190965","#cite_ref-National_Letter_of_Intent_5-0","#cite_r
