Although disability rights has historically existed\nas a relatively cohesive movement, the movement centered around inclusion has\nonly recently begun to take shape and to position itself in the eye of the\ngeneral public.\n\nExamples now exist worldwide. In the United Kingdom it is symbolized most\nvisibly in British Broadcasting Corporation radio programs like\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch Ouch!], hosted by Mat Fraser and Liz Carr, and in the\nassociated comedy, variety and/or stage acts in similar circles, such as\n[http://www.abnormallyfunnypeople.com/ Abnormally Funny People]. In the United\nStates New York City and San Francisco Bay Area communities, the\n[http://www.iampwd.org I AM PWD Project], the hip-hop group\n[http://4wheelcity.com/info/_index2.php 4-Wheel City], the modern dance\nensembles AXIS Dance Company and [http://www.thegimpproject.com The GIMP\nProject], and the stage theater companies Theater Breaking Through Barriers,\n[http://www.visibletheatre.org/page/page/726626.htm Visible Theater] and Nicu's\nSpoon, are all part of this emerging phenomenon. [http://www.posterbrat.com\nLawrence Carter-Long], a nationally acknowledged US social advocate and orator\nin the disability rights field with spastic diplegia, founded and ran\n[http://www.disthis.org the disTHIS! Film Series] in downtown Manhattan once per\nmonth for most of the year from 2005 through 2010. The series is now no longer\nactive and it remains to be seen whether other leaders of the\n[http://www.dnnyc.net Disabilities Network of New York City] will take over and\nre-launch the series from 2011.\n\nThe concept of inclusion emphasizes universal design for policy-oriented\nphysical accessibility issues, such as ease-of-use of physical structures and\nelimination of barriers to ease of movement in the world, but the largest part\nof its purpose is on being culturally transformational. Inclusion typically\npromotes disability studies as an intellectual movement and stresses the need\nfor disabled people â the inclusion-rights community usually uses the reclaimed\nword \"cripple\" or \"crip\" instead â to immerse themselves, sometimes forcibly,\ninto mainstream culture through various modes of artistic expression. Inclusion\nadvocates argue that melding what they term \"disability-art\" or \"dis/art\" into\nmainstream art makes integration of different body types unavoidable, direct,\nand thus positive. They argue it helps able-bodied people deal with their fears\nof being or becoming disabled, which, unbeknownst to the person, is usually what\nunderlies both the feelings of \"inspiration\" and feelings of pity s/he may have\nwhen watching a disabled person moving in his or her unusual way(s), or in\nparticipating in activities that obviously draw attention to the person's\ncondition(s). Inclusion advocates often specifically encourage disabled people\nwho choose to subscribe to this set of ideas to take it upon themselves to\ninvolve themselves in activities that give them the widest public audience\npossible, such as becoming professional dancers, actors, visual artists, front-\nline political activists, filmmakers, orators, and similar professions.\n\nMainstreaming is typically limited to putting a person with a disability next to\ntypical people in the usually quite vague and unspecific hope that each will\nadapt to and learn about the other. Inclusion, while acknowledging the value of\nmainstreaming as a tool, argues that this is not enough: the whole of society,\nits physical accessibility, and its social attitudes, they say, should exist\nwith universal design in mind, thus ending physical marginalization of all kinds\nby ending the idea that a body that is different is incapable of self-\nmanagement, physical attractiveness, and so on. This all-encompassing practice,\nits advocates argue, ensures that people of differing abilities visibly and\npalpably belong to, are engaged in, and are actively connected to the goals and\nobjectives of the whole wider society, as opposed to being a \"novelty\" that\n'normal' people might be afraid to ask direct questions of.\n\nThe inclusive attitude is quite divergent from, and usually the exact opposite\nof, the prevailing attitude in most countries worldwide. Inclusion's opposite\ntends to be an attitude or undercurrent of pity and/or sorrow among the\npopulation of the able-bodied towards people with disabilities â and, among the\nmedical community, a prevalence of the medical model of disability focusing on\nthe physical and/or mental therapies, medications, surgeries and assistive\ndevices that might help to \"normalize\" or \"fix\" the disabled person so that they\nmay have an easier time in their surrounding environment. The attitude of\ninclusion, which has a lot in common with the social model of disability,\nalleges that this entire approach is wrong and that those who have physical,\nsensory and/or intellectual impairments are automatically put on a much more\neffective and fulfilling road to a good, complete, and 'full' life if they are,\ninstead, looked at and valued by society from the outset as totally \"normal\"\npeople who just happen to have these \"extra differences.\" Like the social\nmovements of feminism, anti-racism and gay rights before it, inclusion is often\nderided by critics from the right as naÃ¯vitÃ©, and by critics from the left as\nidentity politics. As it looks less towards 'overcoming' and 'achieving', and\nmore towards being and existing in the moment, inclusion by its very nature\nforces others in the world to possibly begin to actually accept bodily forms and\nprocesses they may not be immediately comfortable with.\n\nSome say that part of the reason for resistance to inclusion in the United\nStates may be that the older architecture of its more prominent cities makes\nstructural adjustment for disabled people costly and supposedly impractical,\nleading indirectly to a high measure of hostility towards disabled people lest\nthey end up feeling 'entitled' to receive such adjustments automatically and\nunquestionably. Others tend to blame the attitude of Social Darwinism more\ngenerally, accusing it of corrupting the attitude of able-bodied people in the\nU.S. in particular towards disabled people â often to the point that it prevents\nthat country's culture from readily accepting disabled people in aspects and\nvenues that are not directly legality or law-related, e.g. theater, film, dance,\nand sexuality.
