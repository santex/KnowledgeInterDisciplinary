Elevation, or 'geometric height', is mainly\n used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or\n geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft\n in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the\n surface. .]]\n\nLess commonly, elevation is measured using the center of the Earth as the\nreference point. Due to equatorial bulge, there is debate as to which of the\nsummits of Mt. Everest or Chimborazo is at the higher elevation, as the\nChimborazo summit is further from the Earth's center while the Mt. Everest\nsummit is higher above mean sea level.\n","title":"elevation","headings":["Maps and GIS","Topography","Global 1-kilometer map","Hypsography","Temperature","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Earth","2: Sea_level","2: Altitude","2: Topographic_map","2: Geodesy","1: Geographic","1: Geoid","1: Equipotential","1: Gravitation","1: Equipotential_surface","1: Geodetic_system#Vertical_datum","1: Geopotential_height","1: Aircraft","1: Spacecraft","1: Three-dimensional_space","1: Equatorial_bulge","1: Mount_Everest","1: Haleakala","1: Hawaii","1: SRTM","1: NASA","1: Cape_Peninsula","1: Cape_of_Good_Hope","1: South_Africa","1: Map","1: Contour_line","1: Geographic_Information_System","1: Digital_elevation_model","1: Raster_graphics","1: Digital_terrain_model","1: Geophysical_survey","1: Ground_control_point","1: Mountain","1: Topographical_summit","1: GTOPO30","1: Mars","1: Venus","1: Greek_language","1: Hypsometry","1: Arithmetic_mean","1: Troposphere","1: Temperatures","1: Lapse_rate","1: North_America","1: Sea_Level_Datum_of_1929","1: National_Geodetic_Vertical_Datum_of_1929","1: NGVD_29","1: North_American_Vertical_Datum_of_1988","1: NAVD_88","1: List_of_European_cities_by_elevation","1: List_of_highest_mountains","1: List_of_highest_towns_by_country","1: Physical_geography","1: Table_of_the_highest_major_summits_of_North_America","1: Topographic_isolation","1: Topographic_prominence","1: Topography","1: Vertical_pressure_variation"]}
