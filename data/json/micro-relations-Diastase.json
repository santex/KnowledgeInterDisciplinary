Alpha amylase\ndegrades starch to a mixture of the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide\nmaltotriose, which contains three Î± (1-4)-linked glucose residues, and\noligosaccharides known as dextrins that contain the Î± (1-6)-linked glucose\nbranches. {{Cite journal| doi=10.1056/NEJM197506052922308| author=Gray, G.M.\n| title=Carbohydrate digestion and absorption journal=New England Journal of\n| Medicine year=1975 volume=292| issue=23 pages=1225â1230| pmid=1093023}}\n| Diastase was the first enzyme discovered.

It was extracted from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and\n#  Jean-FranÃ§ois Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory. Payen & Persoz\n#  (1833), page 77. Payen and Persoz found diastase in the seeds of barley,\n#  oats, and wheat, as well as in potatoes (Payen & Persoz (1833), page\n#  76). The name \"diastase\" comes from the Greek word Î´Î¹Î¬ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¹Ï\n#  (diastasis) (a parting, a separation) because when beer mash is heated, the\n#  enzyme causes the starch in the barley seed to transform quickly into soluble\n#  sugars and hence the husk to separate from the rest of the seed. Payen &\n#  Persoz (1833), pages 75-\n#  76. [http://www.myetymology.com/english/diastase.html Etymology of\n#  \"diastase\"] Today, diastase means any Î±-, Î²-, or Î³-amylase (all of them\n#  hydrolases) that can break down carbohydrates .\n\nThe commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from the name\ndiastase. The naming of enzymes using the suffix \"-ase\" has been traced to\nFrench scientist Ãmile Duclaux (1840-1904), who intended to honor the\ndiscoverers of diastase by introducing the practice in his book [http://books.google.com/books?id=Kp9EAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&ie=ISO-8859-\n1&output=html TraitÃ© de Microbiologie], vol. 2 (Paris, France: Masson and Co.,\n1899), Chapter 1, especially page 9.\n\nWhen used as a pharmaceutical drug, diastase has the ATC code .\n","linknr":154,"url":"Diastase","recorded":1362510484,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Greek_language","Enzyme","Catalysis","Starch","Maltose","Amylase","Malt","Anselme_Payen","Mashing","Amylase","Hydrolase","Carbohydrate","-ase","Émile_Duclaux","Pharmaceutical_drug","ATC_code","Takadiastase","Whipple_disease","Amylase"]}
