[http://www-\nimmuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec11/lec11_97.html Lecture 12. Tolerance ] The concept of central tolerance was proposed in\n1959 by Joshua Lederberg, Lederberg, J.: Genes and antibodies. Science 129,\n1649-1653. (1959) as part of his general theory of immunity and\ntolerance, and is often mistakenly attributed to MacFarlane Burnet. Wing K.\nand Sakaguchi S. (2010) Regulatory T cells exert checks and balances on self\ntolerance and autoimmunity. Nature Immunology 11:7-13 Lederberg\nhypothesized that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an\nantigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes\nbeing tolerance sensitive. Lederberg's theory that self-tolerance is 'learned'\nduring lymphocyte development was a major conceptual contribution to\nimmunology, and it was experimentally substantiated in the late 1980s when\ntools to analyze lymphocyte development became available. Central tolerance is\ndistinct from periphery tolerance in that it occurs while cells are still\npresent in the primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bone-marrow), prior to\nexport into the periphery, while peripheral tolerance is generated after the\ncells reach the periphery. Regulatory T cells can be considered both central\ntolerance and peripheral tolerance mechanisms, as they can be generated from\nself(or foreign)-reactive T cells in the thymus during T cell differentiation,\nbut they exert their immune suppression in the periphery on other self(or foreign)-\nreactive T cells.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Central_tolerance","recorded":1362538120,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology articles"],"headings":["Requirement for central tolerance","Mechanisms of central tolerance","Genetic diseases caused by defects in central tolerance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["v(dj_recombination"]],"members":[],"related":["T_cell","B_cell","Joshua_Lederberg","Regulatory_T_cells","T_cell_receptor","B_cell_receptor","V(D)J_recombination","Complementarity_determining_region","Generation_of_Diversity","T_cell_receptor","Antibodies","Generation_of_Diversity","T_cells","B_cells","Thymus","Bone_marrow","T_cells","B_cells","T_cells","B_cells","Anergic","Negative_selection","B_cells","Bone_marrow","Dendritic_cells","Autoimmune_Regulator","Insulin","B_cell","Bone_marrow","Immune_tolerance","Antigen","Pathogen","Exogenous_antigen","Immunoglobulin_M","Clonal_deletion","Immunoglobulin_M","Polyvalent_antibody","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Apoptosis","Receptor_editing","Soluble","Immunoglobulin_M","Downregulate","Drug_tolerance","Immunoglobulin_D","Anergy","Immunoglobulin_M","Immunoglobulin_D","Antibody","Peripheral_tolerance","Apoptosis","Immunoglobulin_M","Anergy","T_cell","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Thymus","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Pathogen","CD4+","CD8+_cell","Thymocyte","Co-receptor","MHC_II","MHC_I","Dendritic_cell","AIRE","Peripheral_tolerance","Thymus","Autoimmune_Regulator","Autoimmunity","Immunology","Peripheral_tolerance"]}
