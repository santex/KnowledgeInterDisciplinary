      "text" : "\n\nA 'morgen' was a unit of measurement of land in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland\nand the Dutch colonies, including South Africa and Taiwan. The size of a morgen\nvaries from 1/2 to 2½ acres, which equals approximately 0.2 to 1 ha. It was also\nused in old Prussia, in the Balkans, Norway and Denmark, where it was equal to\nabout two-thirds of an acre (0.27 ha).\n\nThe word is usually taken to be the same as the German and Dutch word for\n\"morning\". Similarly to the Imperial acre, it was approximately the amount of\nland tillable by one man behind an ox in the morning hours of a day. The\n\"morgen\" was commonly set at about 60-70% of the \"tagwerk\" (literally \"day\nwork\") referring to a full day of ploughing. In 1869, the North German\nConfederation fixed the morgen at a quarter hectare (i.e. 2500 square\nmeters)<ref>See -German version of Wikipedia</ref> but in modern times most\nfarmland work is measured in full hectares. The next lower measurement unit was\nthe German \"rute\" or Imperial rod but the metric rod length of 5 metres never\nbecame popular. It is still used in Taiwan today, called \"ka.\" 1 ka is 2934\n\"tsubo\" (Japanese) or \"phêng\" (Taiwanese).\n",
