{"cursor":"3776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John de Burnham' (died 1363) was an English born judge and official who spent\nmuch of his career in Ireland, being Lord High Treasurer of Ireland and Chief\nBaron of the Irish Exchequer. He spent many years clearing himself of charges of\ncorruption, which seem to have been the invention of malicious colleagues.\n\nHe was a native of Norfolk, apparently born in the Burnhams. Ball, F.\nElrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1\np.81 He became parish priest of Felmersham, Bedfordshire in 1333 and was\nnamed as a tax assessor for the same county in 1340. Ball p.81 He was\na member of the Royal household from the 1320s, and gained great experience in\nthe field of finance, especially army accounts. Connolly, Philomena The\nProceedings against John de Burnham, Tresurer of Ireland 1343-9 in \"Essays\nPresented to J.F. Lydon\" Cambridge University Press 1993 p.57\n\nIn 1343 he was sent to Ireland as Lord Treasurer; Patent Rolls Edward III\nVol.6 p.3 he also became canon of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin and a\nprebendary of Cloyne. Ball p.81 His appointment was apparently\nconnected with complaints by the Privy Council of Ireland about the efficiency\nof the Irish Exchequer, and doubts about the honesty of Burnham's predecessor\nHugh de Burgh. Connolly p.57 It was apparently thought that Burnham,\nwith his long experience of administering royal finances , would be a reforming\nTreasurer; but it is difficult to determine what if anything his reforms\nachieved, and his long battle to clear himself of charges of corruption can\nhardly have made the task of reform any easier.\n\nIn 1348 he was summoned to England to account for his record as Treasurer: the\ncharges against him were very serious, involving accusations of fraud ,\nnegligence and concealment of royal revenue. His stay in England lasted several\nyears, requiring him to appoint attorneys to manage his Irish\naffairs. Patent Rolls Edward III Vol.10 p,82 The charges appear to\nhave been the work of William de Barton, Connolly p.58 a disgruntled\nofficial of the Exchequer of Ireland with a grudge against Burnham, who\napparently belonged to a rival faction in the Dublin administration, and who\nplayed a large part in the subsequent inquiry; there is no evidence that Burnham\nwas widely seen as corrupt.\n\nIn the end Burnham was cleared of any charge of wrongdoing. While the charges\nwere numerous and detailed, Connolly concludes that none of them amount to\nevidence of any serious wrongdoing, and that they were largely the invention of\nhis rival William de Barton. Although Barton could not hope, given the lack of\nevidence, to prove the charges, he could, rightly, hope that the length and\ncomplexity of the inquiry, which he himslef would draw out as far as possible,\nwould cause Burnham a great deal of time and trouble. Connolly p.71\n\nHaving vindicated his good name, Burnham returned to Ireland as Lord Chief Baron\nin 1355 and remained in office until his death in 1363. Ball p.81 He\nand Barton appear to have resolved their differences, and worked amicably\ntogether in the Exchequer for several years. Connolly
