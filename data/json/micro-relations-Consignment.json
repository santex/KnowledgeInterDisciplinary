This may be done for shipping, transfer of goods to auction, or for\nsale in a store (i.e.,Â a 'consignment shop'). To consign means to send and\ntherefore consignment means sending goods to another person. In case of\nconsignment goods are sent to the agent for the purpose of sale. The ownership\nof these goods remains with the sender. The agent sells the goods on behalf of\nthe sender, according to his instructions. The sender of goods is known as\nconsignor and the agent is known as the consignee.\n\nFeatures of consignment are: *The relation between the two parties is that of\nconsignor and consignee and not that of buyer and seller *The consignor is\nentitled to receive all the expenses in connection with consignment *The\nconsignee is not responsible for damage of goods during transport or any other\nprocedure *Goods are sold at the risk of consignor. The profit or loss belongs\nto consignor only\n\nThe word consignment comes from the French consigner, meaning \"to hand over or\ntransmit\", originally from the Latin consignare \"to affix a seal\", as was done\nwith official documents just before being sent.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Consignment","recorded":1362559907,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Retailing","Supply chain management"],"headings":["Second-hand shops","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Shipping","Sales","Consignor","Consignee","French_language","Latin_language","United_States","Second-hand_shop","Used_good","Consignee","Consignor","Antique","Athletic_equipment","Automobile","Books","Clothing","Furniture","Firearms","Music","Musical_instrument","Tool","Paraglider","Toy","EBay","Vendor_managed_inventory","Customer_managed_inventory","Inventory","Charity_shop","Thrift_shop","Pawn_shop","UK","Dress_Agency","Designer_clothing","Scan-based_trading"]}
