ITIS was originally formed in 1996 as an interagency\ngroup within the U.S. federal government, involving several US Federal agencies\nand has now become an international body, with Canadian and Mexican government\nagencies participating. The database draws from a large community of taxonomic\nexperts. Primary content staff are housed at the Smithsonian National Museum of\nNatural History and IT services are provided by a US Geological Survey facility\nin Denver. The primary focus of ITIS is North American species, but many groups\nare worldwide and ITIS continues to collaborate with other international\nagencies to increase its global coverage. {{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-\n1739.2007.00857.x |title=Monitoring International Wildlife Trade with Coded\nSpecies Data |accessdate=2007-05-09 |last=Coote |first=Lonny D, et al. |date=2008-\n02 |publisher=Conservation Biology |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00857.x}}\n","linknr":225,"url":"Integrated_Taxonomic_Information_System_","recorded":1362544123,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Taxonomy organizations","Organizations based in the United States","Organizations established in 1996","Biology websites","Biodiversity databases"],"headings":["Reference database","Catalogue of life","Legacy database","Standards","Member agencies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/ITIS_logo.jpg/220px-ITIS_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Taxonomy","Species","United_States","Canada","Mexico","North_America","Database","Biodiversity_informatics","English_language","French_language","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","Catalogue_of_Life","Catalogue_of_Life","Catalogue_of_Life","University_of_Reading","Catalogue_of_Life","Encyclopedia_of_Life","Harvard_University","Creative_Commons","National_Oceanographic_Data_Center","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","Scientific_literature","Agriculture_and_Agri-Food_Canada","Comisi√≥n_Nacional_para_el_Conocimiento_y_Uso_de_la_Biodiversidad","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","National_Park_Service","NatureServe","Smithsonian_Institution","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","United_States_Geological_Survey","United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service","Catalogue_of_life","Encyclopedia_of_Life","Wikispecies","World_Register_of_Marine_Species"]}
