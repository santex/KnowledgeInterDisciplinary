{"cursor":"2094","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Maryland High School Assessments (HSA)' are standardized tests that measure\nschool and individual student progress toward the High School Core Learning\nGoals of the U.S. state of Maryland, which were established after passing of the\nNo Child Left Behind Act. Passing the HSA is one of several graduation\nrequirements beginning with the graduating class of 2009. The assessments\nconsist of three timed exams, which are English 2 (or English 10), Biology, and\nAlgebra/Data Analysis. The exams are usually held at the end of their\ncorresponding courses. Each of the exams contains both multiple choice and\nwritten response questions. As of 2009, Maryland has eliminated written response\nand made it a long series of multiple choices. This test is considered by many\nstudents to be easy, and some think that it places to much emphasis on just a\nfew topics. Beginning with the class of 2012, the American Government HSA would\nno longer be a graduation requirement. The last administration of the Government\nHSA was during May 2011.\n\nThere are three ways for a student to pass the HSAs. One way is to earn the\npassing score on each exam. The passing scores for the three HSAs are:\n\n*English 10 - 396 *Algebra/Data Analysis - 412 *Biology - 400\n\nIn addition, a student may still be eligible for graduation if he/she does not\nmeet the passing score. The first option, the combined-score option, requires\nthat they earn a combined 1208 on all three assessments. The second alternative\noption allows the student to complete a Bridge Project for Academic Validation\nif they do not pass the HSA in that subject area.\n","linknr":80,"url":"Maryland_High_School_Assessments","recorded":1374762304,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/U.S._state","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act","/wiki/English_Language","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/Algebra","/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=edit&section=1","http://marylandpublicschools.org/MSDE/testing/hsa/","http://hsaexam.org/","http://hsaexam.org/img/Elimination_of_HSA_Gov.042011.pdf","http://hsaexam.org/about/over/pass.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&oldid=518959443","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Education_in_Maryland","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maryland+High+School+Assessments&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Maryland+High+School+Assessments","/wiki/Maryland_High_School_Assessments","/wiki/Talk:Maryland_High_School_Assessments","#","/wiki/Maryland_High_School_Assessments","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Maryland_High_School_Assessments","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Maryland_High_School_Assessments","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&oldid=518959443","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6781337","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&id=518959443","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Maryland+High+School+Assessments","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Maryland+High+School+Assessments&oldid=518959443&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Maryland_High_School_Assessments&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6781337#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_High_School_Assessments","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":["http://hsaexam.org/img/Elimination_of_HSA_Gov.042011.pdf"],"categories":["Education
