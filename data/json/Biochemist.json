Typical biochemists study\nchemical processes and chemical transformations in living organisms. The word\n\"biochemist\" is a portmanteau of \"biological chemist\".\n\nBiochemist also research how certain chemical reactions happen in cells and\ntissues and observe and record the effects of products as in food additives and\nmedicines. Biochemist main function is to focus on improving the qualities of\nlives. \n\nBiochemist researchers focus on planning and conducting research experiments,\nmain for developing new products and updating existing products and analyzing\nsaid products. It is also the responsibility of a biochemist to present their\nresearch findings and create grant proposals to obtain funds for future\nresearch. \n","linknr":157,"url":"Biochemist","recorded":1362508469,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science occupations","Occupations","Biochemists|*"],"headings":["Role","Training","Employment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biochemistry","Portmanteau","Chemistry","Management","Organic_chemistry","Inorganic_chemistry","Physical_chemistry","Biology","Microbiology","Molecular_biology","Molecular_genetics","Cell_biology","Genomics","Life_sciences","Pharmaceutical","Biotechnology","Nutrition","Genetics","Biophysics","Pharmacology","Toxicology","Vaccine","Forensic_science","Wildlife_management","Marine_biology","Viticulture","List_of_biochemists"]}
