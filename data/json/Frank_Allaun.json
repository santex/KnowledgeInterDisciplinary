{"cursor":"3931","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Frank Julian Allaun' (27 February 1913 â 26 November 2002) was a British Labour\npolitician.\n\nBorn in Manchester, http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/art-\nicle1181144.ece/ Allaun was educated at Manchester Grammar School and\nworked as an engineer, shop assistant, tour leader, chartered accountant and\njournalist. He helped to organise the first Aldermaston March in 1958 and was\nchair of the Labour Peace Fellowship. Allaun was against British membership of\nthe EEC. David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, The 1975 Referendum (London:\nMacmillan, 1976), p. 105, p. 235.\n\nAllaun contested Manchester Moss Side in 1951. He was Member of Parliament for\nSalford East from 1955 to 1983.\n\nHe was a veteran of leftwing causes, especially the Campaign for Nuclear\nDisarmament, of which he was vice president from 1983.\n\nNaive or optimistic, or just unappreciative of war culture, Allaun was a\nstraight up-and-down idealist. His style was intensely gentle, the voice never\nraised, but the questions - chiefly on peace and housing - insistent. The\nbeautiful manners and the soft Lancashire voice must have got on ministerial\nnerves. But then, as one of the organisers of the first Aldermaston march, he\nhelped launch a movement whose appeal in the late 1950s and 1960s did more than\nget on nerves.\n\nOutside the peace movement, his preoccupation was with public housing, and the\nvastly increased expenditure he urged should be paid for by cuts, equally\nmassive, in defence. Defence cuts would, of course, come, but, despite Allaun's\nlife work, Britain remained a nuclear power. His books included Spreading The\nNews: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle For Peace (1992).\n\nHis recreations were walking and swimming.\n\nHis first wife, Lilian, whom he married in 1941, died in 1986. He married\nsecondly in 1989 Millie Bobker.\n\nHe died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89. His second wife, son and daughter\nsurvived him. His second wife, Millie also had 3 children from a previous\nmarriage who all survived after Frank's death.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Frank_Allaun","recorded":1375075260,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Manchester","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Manchester_Grammar_School","/wiki/Aldermaston_Marches","/w/index.php?title=Labour_Peace_Fellowship&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/European_Community","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Manchester_Moss_Side_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Salford_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1181144.ece/","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit&section=2","http://www.wcml.org.uk/people/frankallaun4.htm","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit&section=3","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-frank-allaun","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Edward_Arthur_Hardy","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Salford_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1955","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/Stanley_Orme,_Baron_Orme","/wiki/Joan_Lestor","/wiki/Chair_of_The_Labour_Party","/wiki/Lena_Jeger","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/91229945","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Bigben_small.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Bigben_small.png/25px-Bigben_small.png","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Labour-UK-MP-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Flag_of_England.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/30px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit","/wiki/Template:England-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:England-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:England-politician-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&oldid=552230950","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1913_births","/wiki/Category:2002_deaths","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_MPs","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1955%E2%80%931959","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1959%E2%80%931964","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1964%E2%80%931966","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1966%E2%80%931970","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1970%E2%80%931974","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1974","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1974%E2%80%931979","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1979%E2%80%931983","/wiki/Category:Politicians_from_Manchester","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Manchester_Grammar_School","/wiki/Category:Labour_MP_(UK)_stubs","/wiki/Category:English_politician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-MP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frank+Allaun&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Frank+Allaun","/wiki/Frank_Allaun","/wiki/Talk:Frank_Allaun","#","/wiki/Frank_Allaun","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Frank_Allaun&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_co
