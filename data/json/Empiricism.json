{"cursor":"42940","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]\n\n'Empiricism' is a theory of knowledge that asserts that knowledge comes only or\nprimarily from sensory experience. One of several views of\nepistemology, the study of human knowledge, along with rationalism, idealism,\nand historicism, empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence,\nespecially sensory experience, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of\ninnate ideas or traditions; empiricists may argue however that\ntraditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense\nexperiences. Hume, David. Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding,\n1748.\n\nEmpiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as\ndiscovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of the scientific method\nthat all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the\nnatural world rather than resting solely on [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]]\nreasoning, intuition, or revelation.\n\nPhilosophers associated with empiricism include Aristotle, Alhazen, Avicenna,\nIbn Tufail, Robert Grosseteste, William of Ockham, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes,\nRobert Boyle, John Locke, George Berkeley, Hermann von Helmholtz, David Hume,\nLeopold von Ranke, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Popper.\n","linknr":1516,"url":"Empiricism","recorded":1362889511,"links":99,"instances":["knowledge","book_publisher","philosopher","philosophy","philosophy","logic"],"pdf":["http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/Empiricism%20oct%20069.pdf","http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/Empiricism%20oct%20069.pdf","http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf"],"categories":["Empiricism|","Philosophical
