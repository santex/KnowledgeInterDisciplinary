Alphaviruses, like all\nother group IV viruses have a positive sense single stranded RNA genome. There\nare 30 alphaviruses able to infect various vertebrates such as humans, rodents,\nfish, birds, and larger mammals such as horses as well as invertebrates.\nTransmission between species and individuals occurs mainly via mosquitoes making\nthe alphaviruses a contributor to the collection of Arboviruses â or Arthropod\nBorne Viruses. Alphaviruses particles are enveloped, have a 70 nm diameter,\ntend to be spherical (although slightly pleomorphic), and have a 40 nm\nisometric nucleocapsid.\n","linknr":342,"url":"Alphavirus","recorded":1362501613,"links":52,"instances":["biochemistry","molecular","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Togaviruses"],"headings":["Genome","Virology","Evolution","Taxonomy","Pathogenesis and  immune response","Diagnosis, prevention, and control","Research","See also","Sources","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Alphavirus.gif/220px-Alphavirus.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/PDB_1rer_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1rer_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/PDB_1z8y_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1z8y_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["binding","molecular"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","binding","cell"],"related":["Biology","Immunology","Togaviridae","Viruses","Genome","David_Baltimore","RNA","Vertebrates","Invertebrates","Arboviruses","Arthropod","Poly-A_tail","Open_reading_frames","Secondary_structure","Nucleocapsid","Protein","Protein","Heterodimer","Virus","Glycoproteins","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Cell_(biology)","Membrane_fusion","Proteolytic","Glycoprotein","Protein_dimer","Virus","Cell_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Structurally","Proteins","Influenza_virus","Secondary_structure","Structural_domain","Primary_sequence","Protein-protein_interaction","Cytoplasm","Binding_(molecular)","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Nanometer","Barmah_Forest_virus","Chikungunya_virus","India","South-east_asia","Mayaro_virus","South_America","O'nyong'nyong_virus","Primate","Ross_River_virus","Oceania","Semliki_Forest_Virus","Sindbis_virus","Europe","Africa","Australia","Una_virus","South_America","Eastern_equine_encephalitis_virus","Americas","Tonate_virus","Venezuelan_equine_encephalitis_virus","Rodent","Western_equine_encephalitis_virus","North_America","Arthritis","Encephalitis","Rashes","Fever","Venezuelan_equine_encephalitis","Viremia","Central_nervous_system","Encephalitis","Interferons","Gene_therapy","Sindbis_virus","Semliki_Forest_virus","Venezuelan_equine_encephalitis","Retroviral_integration","Gene_therapy","Replicon","Alphavirus_infection","Chikungunya","Semliki_forest_virus","Sindbis_virus"]}
