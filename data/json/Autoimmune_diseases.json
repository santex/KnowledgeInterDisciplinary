This may be\nrestricted to certain organs (e.g. in autoimmune thyroiditis) or involve a\nparticular tissue in different places (e.g. Goodpasture's disease which may\naffect the basement membrane in both the lung and the kidney). The treatment of\nautoimmune diseases is typically with immunosuppression—medication that\ndecreases the immune response. A large number of autoimmune diseases are\nrecognised.\n","linknr":1223,"url":"Autoimmune_diseases","recorded":1362580156,"links":35,"instances":["streptococcus","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2005/45/smw-11162.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414122100/http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2005/45/smw-11162.pdf","http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2005/45/smw-11162.pdf"],"categories":["Autoimmune
