      "text" : " using index cards]]\n\nA museum is distinguished by a 'collection' of often unique objects that forms\nthe core of its activities for , education, research, etc. This differentiates\nit from an archive or library, where the contents may be more paper-based,\nreplaceable and less exhibition oriented, or a private collection of art formed\nby an individual, family or institution that may grant no public access. A\nmuseum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in\ncertain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection.\nThe process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called\naccessioning and each object is given a unique accession number.\n\nMuseum collections, and archives in general, are normally catalogued in a\ncollection catalogue, traditionally in a card index, but nowadays in a\ncomputerized database. Transferring collection catalogues onto computer-based\nmedia is a major undertaking for most museums. All new acquisitions are normally\ncatalogued on a computer in modern museums, but there is typically a backlog of\nold catalogue entries to be computerized as time and funding allows.\n",
