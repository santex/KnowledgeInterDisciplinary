The applications were originally for dealing with radioactive or\nbiohazardous materials, using robotic arms, or they were used in inaccessible\nplaces. In more recent developments they have been used in applications such as\nrobotically-assisted surgery and in space. It is an arm-like mechanism that\nconsists of a series of segments, usually sliding or jointed, which grasp and\nmove objects with a number of degrees of freedom.\n",
