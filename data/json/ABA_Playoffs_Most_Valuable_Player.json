The award was first awarded\nin the 1968 ABA Playoffs, and was retired as part of the ABAâNBA merger. In\nsports, the player judged to be the most important to the team is the most\nvaluable player (MVP).\n\nThe inaugural award winner was Pittsburgh Pipers' player Connie Hawkins. On all\noccasions, the player who wins the Playoffs MVP award is from the team that won\nthe ABA championship. Julius Erving, who led the New York Nets to two ABA\nchampionships in 1974 and 1976, is the only player to win the award
