Fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds. Many of\nthem that bear edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements\nof humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal\nand nutrition, respectively; in fact, humans and many animals have become\ndependent on fruits as a source of food. Fruits\naccount for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some\n(such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and\nsymbolic meanings.\n\nIn common language usage, \"fruit\" normally means the fleshy seed-associated\nstructures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such\nas apples, oranges, grapes, strawberries, bananas, and lemons. On the other\nhand, the botanical sense of \"fruit\" includes many structures that are not\ncommonly called \"fruits\", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, and\ntomatoes. \n\nThe section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting\nbody.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Fruits","recorded":1372152367,"links":[],"instances":["fruit","botany","plants","fruit","biology","fruit","botany","fruit","fruit","fruit","fruit","botany","fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fruit|","Fruit
