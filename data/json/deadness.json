In the English language,\nblessings directed towards a dead person include [[rest in peace]], or its\ninitialism RIP.\n\nThe most common cause of human deaths in the world is heart disease, followed by\nstroke and other cerebrovascular diseases, and in the third place lower\nrespiratory\ninfections.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index.html\nThe top 10 causes of death] updated June 2011, retrieved 16 October 2012</ref>\n",
