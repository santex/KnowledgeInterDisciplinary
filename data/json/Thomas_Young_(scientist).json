Young made\nnotable scientific contributions to the fields of vision, light, solid\nmechanics, energy, physiology, language, musical harmony, and Egyptology. He\n\"made a number of original and insightful innovations\" Dictionary Of\nNational Biography in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs\n(specifically the Rosetta Stone) before Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion eventually\nexpanded on his work.
