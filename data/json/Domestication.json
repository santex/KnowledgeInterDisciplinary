{"cursor":"47274","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ns and sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated.]] 'Domestication'\n(from Latin {{lang|la|domesticus}}) is the process where by a population of\nanimals or plants is changed at the genetic level through a process of\nselection, in order to accentuate traits that benefit humans. It differs from\ntaming in that a change in the phenotypical expression and genotype of the\nanimal occurs, whereas taming is simply the process by which animals become\naccustomed to human presence. In the Convention on Biological Diversity, a\ndomesticated species is defined as a \"species in which the evolutionary process\nhas been influenced by humans to meet their needs.\" See Article 2 (Use of\nTerms) of the Convention on Biological Diversity Therefore, a defining\ncharacteristic of domestication is artificial selection by humans. Humans have\nbrought these populations under their control and care for a wide range of\nreasons: to produce food or valuable commodities (such as wool, cotton, or\nsilk), for types of work (such as transportation, protection, and warfare),\nscientific research, or simply to enjoy as companions or ornaments.\n\nPlants domesticated primarily for aesthetic enjoyment in and around the home are\nusually called house plants or ornamentals, while those domesticated for large-\nscale food production are generally called crops. A distinction can be made\nbetween those domesticated plants that have been deliberately altered or\nselected for special desirable characteristics (see cultigen) and those plants\nthat are used for human benefit, but are essentially no different from the wild\npopulations of the species. Animals domesticated for home companionship are\nusually called [[pet]]s while those domesticated for food or work are called\n[[livestock]] or farm animals.\n","linknr":972,"url":"Domestication","recorded":1362373335,"links":99,"instances":["horse","animal","animal","insect","language","biology","fruit","botany","nutrition","cat","economics","legume"],"pdf":["http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf","http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/content/307/5715/1618.full.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/content/307/5715/1618.full.pdf","http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ANZCCART/publications/dom_chicken.pdf","http://www.adelaide.edu.au/ANZCCART/publications/dom_chicken.pdf","http://www.animaltraction.net/donkeys/donkeys-blench-history.pdf"],"categories":["Domesticated
