{"cursor":"30764","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Cabinet of Finland' (also called the 'Council of State', Finnish:\nvaltioneuvosto, Swedish: statsrÃ¥det; officially rendered 'Finnish Government')\nis the body that directs the Government of Finland. However, in governmental\ntranslations to English, the distinction is often blurred between cabinet and\ngovernment in the wider sense. This wider sense includes the Parliament of\nFinland (on which the cabinet is dependent), the governmental agencies that are\ndirected by the Cabinet, and the independent judicial branch of government.\nDespite of the occasional blurring by translators, the difference is\nsignificant. The Cabinet is directly responsible to the parliament and may be\ndismissed by a motion of no confidence. The President, according the 2000\nconstitution, formally appoints the cabinet, but the daily working is the\nresponsibility of the Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1918, after Finland's independence, the Cabinet, that in the Grand Duchy of\nFinland had been called the Senate of Finland, was reorganized and renamed to\nthe Council of State. One of the main objectives of that reform was to separate\nthe judiciary from the executive branch.\n\nAccording to the recent revision of the Constitution of Finland (), the power\nover foreign affairs is retained by the president, as it also is in France,\nalthough with a narrow definition of foreign affairs that excludes influence\nover preparations of decisions within the European Union. International treaties\nand declaration of war are within the authority of the parliament.\n\nMatters within the authority of the Cabinet are decided at plenary meetings,\nwith a quorum of five ministers present, in the case of matters of wide\nimportance and matters that are significant for reasons of principle. Less\nimportant matters are decided within the respective ministries.\n\nMatters within the authority of the President are decided at plenary meetings of\nthe Cabinet, with the exception of appointments, pardon, and calling of\nextraordinary elections.\n","linknr":642,"url":"Cabinet_of_Finland","recorded":1375082462,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_of_Finland&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_of_Finland&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Valtioneuvoston_linna_Helsingiss%C3%A4_Senaatintorin_laidalla.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Valtioneuvoston_linna_Helsingiss%C3%A4_Senaatintorin_laidalla.jpg/220px-Valtioneuvoston_linna_Helsingiss%C3%A4_Senaatintorin_laidalla.jpg","/wiki/File:Valtioneuvoston_linna_Helsingiss%C3%A4_Senaatintorin_laidalla.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Finland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Coat_of_arms_of_Finland.svg/110px-Coat_of_arms_of_Finland.svg.png","/wiki/Politics_of_Finland","/wiki/Government_of_Finland","/wiki/Constitution_of_Finland","/wiki/Finnish_Declaration_of_Independence","/wiki/Human_rights_in_Finland","/wiki/Politics_of_Finland#Executive_branch","/wiki/President_of_Finland","/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Finland","/wiki/Sauli_Niinist%C3%B6","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Finland","/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Finland","/wiki/Jyrki_Katainen","/wiki/Government_of_Finland#Ministries","/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Finland","/wiki/Eero_Hein%C3%A4luoma","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland#General_Courts","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Finland","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland#Courts_of_Appeal","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland#District_Courts","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland#Administrative_Courts","/wiki/Supreme_Administrative_Court_of_Finland","/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Finland#Regional_Administrative_Courts","/wiki/Prosecutor_General_of_Finland","/wiki/Matti_Kuusim%C3%A4ki","/wiki/Chancellor_of_Justice_of_Finland","/wiki/Elections_in_Finland","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_1991","/wiki/Finnish_presidential_election,_1994","/w/index.php?title=EU_Membership_Referendum_of_Finland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_1995","/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1996_(Finland)","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_1999","/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_1999_(Finland)","/wiki/Finnish_presidential_election,_2000","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_2003","/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2004_(Finland)","/wiki/Finnish_presidential_election,_2006","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_2007","/wiki/Finnish_parliamentary_election,_2011","/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Finland","/wiki/Regions_of_Finland","/wiki/Sub-regions_of_Finland","/wiki/Municipalities_of_Finland","/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Finland","/wiki/National_Coalition_Party","/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Finland","/wiki/True_Finns","/wiki/Centre_Party_(Finland)","/wiki/Left_Alliance_(Finland)","/wiki/Green_League","/wiki/Swedish_People%27s_Party_of_Finland","/wiki/Christian_Democrats_(Finland)","/wiki/Category:Finnish_politicians","/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Finland","/wiki/List_of_Ambassadors_from_Finland","/wiki/Politics_of_the_European_Union","/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Finland","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/16px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Politics_of_Finland","/wiki/Template_talk:Politics_of_Finland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Finland&action=edit","/wiki/Finland-Swedish","/wiki/Government_of_Finland","/wiki/Parliament_of_Finland","/wiki/Judicial_branch","/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence","/wiki/Finland%27s_declaration_of_independence","/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland","/wiki/Senate_of_Finland","/wiki/Executive_branch","/wiki/Constitution_of_Finland","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_of_Finland&action=edit","/wiki/Foreign_affairs_of_Finland","/wiki/President_of_Finland","/wiki/European_Union","/wiki/Treaty","/wiki/Declaration_of_war","/wiki/Pardon","#Formation","#Current_Council_of_State","#Previous_Senates","#Previous_Councils_of_State","#References","#See_also","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Cabinet_of_Finlan
