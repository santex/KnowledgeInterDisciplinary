He moved\nback to the United States in 1981 to write for twenty episodes of [[Saturday\nNight Live]] before returning to Canada.\n\nHe is best known for producing such television shows as [[It's Only Rock & Roll\n(TV series)|It's Only Rock & Roll]], [[Comics!]], and [[The Kids in the Hall]]\nand helping to launch the careers of the young talent featured on those shows.\nHe also co-wrote the first draft of the film [[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's\nWorld]] with Mike Myers.\n\nBodolai was a founder of The Comedy Network, helping the new channel secure its\nlicence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in\n1996, and expected to be named the new channel's head by its owners. He was\ndisappointed when he was not hired and decided to return permanently to the\nUnited States.\n\nBodolai was found dead on December 26, 2011 in a Hollywood hotel room of an\napparent suicide; he was 63. No suicide note\nwas found, though on December 23 a long post was added to his blog,\nentitled \"If this were your last day alive what would you do?\"\n","linknr":138,"url":"Joe_Bodolai","recorded":1375084451,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Writer","/wiki/The_Comedy_Network","/wiki/Writer","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Opposition_to_the_U.S._involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War","#cite_note-cbc-3","/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_7)","/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live","/wiki/It%27s_Only_Rock_%26_Roll_(TV_series)","/wiki/Comics!","/wiki/The_Kids_in_the_Hall","/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film)","/wiki/Mike_Myers","/wiki/The_Comedy_Network","/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission","#cite_note-Globe-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Suicide_note","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://joebodolai.inmemoriam.org","#cite_ref-2","http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/28/local/la-me-passings-20111228","#cite_ref-cbc_3-0","http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/12/27/obit-joe-bodolai.html","#cite_ref-Globe_4-0","http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/television/tv-writer-joe-bodolai-63-found-dead-in-los-angeles/article2284422/","#cite_ref-5","http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/12/former-snl-writer-joe-bodolai-dead-of-apparent-suicideicide.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/saturday-night-live-writer-joe-bodolai-suicide-276390","#cite_ref-7","http://online.wsj.com/article/APab0d3a17d8d04299b8c65b72c2a0e2f2.html","#cite_ref-8","http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/27/showbiz/snl-writer-dead","#cite_ref-9","http://qualityshows.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/if-this-were-y0ur-last-day-alive-what-would-you-do/","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1188688/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","https://twitter.com/joebodolai","/wiki/Twitter","http://qualityshows.wordpress.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio","/wiki/File:Filmreel-icon.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Filmreel-icon.svg/30px-Filmreel-icon.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Film-producer-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Film-producer-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Film-producer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&oldid=558966023","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1948_births","/wiki/Category:2011_deaths","/wiki/Category:American_television_writers","/wiki/Category:Canadian_television_writers","/wiki/Category:American_screenwriters","/wiki/Category:Canadian_television_producers","/wiki/Category:American_expatriate_writers_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Suicides_in_California","/wiki/Category:Suicides_by_poison","/wiki/Category:Writers_from_Youngstown,_Ohio","/wiki/Category:Film_producer_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joe+Bodolai&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Joe+Bodolai","/wiki/Joe_Bodolai","/wiki/Talk:Joe_Bodolai","#","/wiki/Joe_Bodolai","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Joe_Bodolai","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Joe_Bodolai","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&oldid=558966023","/w/index.php?title=Joe_Bodolai&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6208686","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite
