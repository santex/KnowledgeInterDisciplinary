[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/-\nnyregion/02penraat.html?ex=1151985600&en=a4353f3e47911b9e&ei=5087%0A New York\nTimes \"Jaap Penraat Dies at 88; Saved Hundreds in Holocaust\" July 2, 2006]\n\nPenraat was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands. As a child, he helped Jewish\nneighbors by switching lights for them on [[Shabbat]], which they were forbidden\nto do. When the Nazis occupied The Netherlands and began acting against the\nJews, Penraat was an interior designer, architect and sculptor of tiles and\nstatues. He started his resistance activities by forging identity papers for\nJews, but was discovered and jailed for several months. Later he made over 20\ntrips smuggling a total of 406 Jewish people to safety from The Netherlands to\nSpain via France by using his forgery skills to convince the Nazis they were\nslave laborers for the Atlantic Wall, on France's Atlantic coast. He lost only\none man, who was hit by a train. Penraat was tortured by the Nazis but revealed\nnothing about his operations. After his release, he continued his activities\nuntil 1944, when it became too risky to continue, and he spent the rest of the\nwar hiding in a village, living on sugar beets.\n\nAfter the war, Penraat became a noted designer in Amsterdam, until in 1958 he\nmoved to the United States. In 1964, he designed the Dutch mill cafe, for the\nNew York World's Fair.\n\nHe remained silent about his wartime activities until his daughters convinced\nhim that his grandchildren should know about them. He went on to describe his\nexperiences to school groups. In subsequent interviews, he insisted he had only\n\"done the decent thing\". Yad Vashem, the official Israeli memorial to victims of\nthe Holocaust, awarded him the designation of Righteous Among the Nations and\nput him on its honor roll on June 11, 1988.\n\nA longtime friend of Penraat's, Hudson Talbott, authored a children's book about\nPenraat's activities, entitled Forging Freedom: A True Story of Heroism During\nthe Holocaust. Talbott said in an interview that Penraat \"just loved the idea of\nputting one over on the Nazis\".\n\nPenraat died at his home in Catskill, New York at the age of 88, three years\nfollowing the death of his wife, Jettie. He is survived by his three daughters,\nMarjolijn, Mir, and Noelle.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Jaap_Penraat","recorded":1375083406,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Amsterdam","/wiki/Netherlands","#cite_note-nyt-1","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Catskill_(town),_New_York","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Dutch_people","/wiki/Second_World_War","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Amsterdam","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Shabbat","/wiki/Nazis","/wiki/Interior_designer","/wiki/Architect","/wiki/Sculptor","/wiki/Atlantic_Wall","/wiki/France","/wiki/Sugar_beet","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/New_York_World%27s_Fair","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Yad_Vashem","/wiki/Righteous_Among_the_Nations","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Hudson_Talbott","#cite_note-nyt-1","/wiki/Catskill_(town),_New_York","#cite_note-nyt-1","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hudson_Talbott","#cite_ref-nyt_1-0","#cite_ref-nyt_1-1","#cite_ref-nyt_1-2","#cite_ref-nyt_1-3","#cite_ref-nyt_1-4","#cite_ref-nyt_1-5","#cite_ref-nyt_1-6","#cite_ref-nyt_1-7","#cite_ref-nyt_1-8","#cite_ref-nyt_1-9","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/nyregion/02penraat.html?ex=1151985600&en=a4353f3e47911b9e&ei=5087%0A","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=edit&section=2","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/nyregion/02penraat.html?ex=1151985600&en=a4353f3e47911b9e&ei=5087%0A","http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885897898&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull","http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=14798966","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/173568679","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Amsterdam","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Catskill_(town),_New_York","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&oldid=550874982","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Dutch_Resistance_members","/wiki/Category:Dutch_architects","/wiki/Category:Artists_from_Amsterdam","/wiki/Category:Dutch_Righteous_Among_the_Nations","/wiki/Category:1918_births","/wiki/Category:2006_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jaap+Penraat&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jaap+Penraat","/wiki/Jaap_Penraat","/wiki/Talk:Jaap_Penraat","#","/wiki/Jaap_Penraat","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Jaap_Penraat","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Jaap_Penraat","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&oldid=550874982","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5375498","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Jaap_Penraat&id=550874982","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Jaap+Penraat","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Jaap+Penraat&oldid=550874982&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Jaap_Penraat&printable=yes","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaap_Penraat","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5375498#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikiped
