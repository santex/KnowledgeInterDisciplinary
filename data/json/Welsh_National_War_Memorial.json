The memorial was designed by Sir Ninian Comper and unveiled in\nJune 1928 by the Prince of Wales. The memorial commemorates the servicemen who\ndied during the First World War and has a commemorative plaque for those who\ndied during the Second World War, added in 1949.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left direction = horizontal header = Welsh National War\n | Memorial header_align = center header_background = footer =\n | footer_align = left footer_background = width = image1 = The Welsh National\n | War Memorial, Cathays Park, Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 320468.jpg width1 =\n | 130 alt1 = caption1 = image2 = Welsh National War Memorial, Cathays Park.jpg\n | width2 = 130 alt2 = caption2 =\n}}\n\nThe memorial takes the form of a circular colonnade surrounding a sunken court.\nOn the frieze above the columns are inscriptions in Welsh, on the outer side,\nand in English, on the inner side (see inset). The English inscription was\ncomposed by Comper himself. At the centre of the court is a group of bronze\nsculptures by Alfred Bertram Pegram, arranged around a stone pylon. Around the\nbase stand three figures, a soldier, sailor and airman, holding wreaths aloft.\nThere are appropriate inscriptions above the figures e.g. 'Over the sea he went\nto die', above the sailor. Above them, crowning the structure, is a winged male\nnude representing Victory.\n\nThe memorial is the only 'secular' work by Comper, who was primarily a furnisher\nof churches. He received much hostility, from the president of the Royal\nInstitute of British Architects and others, for not being a qualified architect,\nbut was supported by the sculptors Sir William Goscombe John and Sir Hamo\nThornycroft. The memorial's form was inspired by two visits to French North\nAfrica and particularly Tunisia, where the architect was inspired by the public\nworks erected by the emperor Hadrian; it seems that historical and secular\narchitecture and religious design in architecture coincided within the memorials\nerected in the West, in particular in the 1927 Lorimer War Memorial in Edinburgh\nwhere the use of a sword as an element with the 'Cross of Sacrifice' in the\ncemeteries of the Imperial War Graves Commission is echoed within the central\nelement of the Shrine (this memorial having been opened in 1927 by the Prince of\nWales as the 'Scottish National War Memorial', and consequently presumably in\nsome form associated with that of Wales and possibly others). In order for\nPegram to find a model for the bronzes, the crews of two battleships were\ninvited to the Union Jack Club in Waterloo, London. The sculptor selected a\nyoung sailor called Fred Barker, who modelled in the nude and in uniform.\n\nA number of other war memorials can also be found in Alexandra Gardens. These\ninclude one to Raoul Wallenberg who was a Swedish Ambassador in Hungary and\nsaved 100,000 people by issuing them with Swedish passports enabling them to\nflee to safety. A recent addition is for the men of Cardiff who were killed in\naction during the Falklands War. A new memorial has also recently been built\ndedicated to the men from the International Brigade who fought in the Spanish\nCivil War.\n\nThe Memorial is Grade II* listed.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Welsh_National_War_Memorial","recorded":1374540623,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&params=51.487_N_-3.180_E_region:GB_scale:5000","/wiki/Cardiff_Council","/wiki/File:Welsh_National_War_Memorial.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Welsh_National_War_Memorial.JPG/200px-Welsh_National_War_Memorial.JPG","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Cardiff_city_centre","/wiki/Ninian_Comper","/wiki/Sic","/wiki/In_hoc_signo_vinces","/wiki/Cathays_Park","/wiki/Cardiff","/wiki/Ninian_Comper","/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Commemorative_plaque","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/File:The_Welsh_National_War_Memorial,_Cathays_Park,_Cardiff_-_geograph.org.uk_-_320468.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/The_Welsh_National_War_Memorial%2C_Cathays_Park%2C_Cardiff_-_geograph.org.uk_-_320468.jpg/130px-The_Welsh_National_War_Memorial%2C_Cathays_Park%2C_Cardiff_-_geograph.org.uk_-_320468.jpg","/wiki/File:Welsh_National_War_Memorial,_Cathays_Park.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Welsh_National_War_Memorial%2C_Cathays_Park.jpg/130px-Welsh_National_War_Memorial%2C_Cathays_Park.jpg","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Bertram_Pegram&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects","/wiki/William_Goscombe_John","/wiki/Hamo_Thornycroft","/wiki/Tunisia","/wiki/Hadrian","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Scottish_National_War_Memorial","/wiki/Union_Jack_Club","/wiki/Raoul_Wallenberg","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Ambassador","/wiki/Hungary","/wiki/Passport","/wiki/Falklands_War","/wiki/International_Brigade","/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War","/wiki/Listed_building","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-13742-welsh-national-war-memorial-castle","/w/index.php?title=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&action=edit&section=2","http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/L/lostgeneration/search/m-record.jsp?id=73662","/wiki/Template:Landmarks_and_visitor_attractions_in_Cardiff","/wiki/Template_talk:Landmarks_and_visitor_attractions_in_Cardiff","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Landmarks_and_visitor_attractions_in_Cardiff&action=edit","/wiki/Cardiff","/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_Cardiff","/wiki/Capital_Tower,_Cardiff","/wiki/Stadium_House,_Cardiff","/wiki/Llanishen#Parc_Ty_Glas_Industrial_Estate","/wiki/Altolusso","/wiki/Meridian_Gate,_Cardiff","/wiki/T%C5%B7_Pont_Haearn","/wiki/Holland_House,_Cardiff","/wiki/Llandaff_Cathedral","/wiki/City_Hall,_Cardiff","/wiki/Helmont_House","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PierheadCardiff.jpg/90px-PierheadCardiff.jpg","/wiki/Wales_Millennium_Centre","/wiki/Millennium_Stadium","/wiki/Pierhead_Building","/wiki/Senedd","/wiki/St_David%27s_Hall","/wiki/St_David%27s_Hotel_%26_Spa","/wiki/Ninian_Park","/wiki/SWALEC_Stadium","/wiki/Cardiff_International_Sports_Stadium","/wiki/Cardiff_City_Stadium","/wiki/Cardiff_Central_Library","/wiki/Temple_of_Peace,_Cardiff","/wiki/Llandaff_Cathedral","/wiki/Cardiff_Market","/wiki/Animal_Wall","/wiki/Alliance_(sculpture)","/wiki/National_Museum_Cardiff","/wiki/St_Fagans_National_History_Museum","/wiki/Cardiff_Castle","/wiki/Castell_Coch","/wiki/2_Glynrhondda_Street","/wiki/Cardiff_Bay","/wiki/Cardiff_Centenary_Walk","/wiki/Bute_Park","/wiki/Cardiff_International_Sports_Village","/wiki/Doctor_Who_exhibitions#Cardiff","/wiki/Insole_Court","/wiki/Mermaid_Quay","/wiki/Firing_Line:_Cardiff_Castle_Museum_of_the_Welsh_Soldier","/wiki/Norwegian_Church,_Cardiff","/wiki/Red_Dragon_Centre","/wiki/Techniquest","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Welsh_National_War_Memorial&oldid=551245290","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Landmarks_in_Cardiff","/wiki/Category:Cathays","/wiki/Category:Grade_II*_listed_buildings_in_Cardiff","/wiki/Category:British_military_memorials_and_cemeteries","/wiki/Category:Col
