In the US and EU it is easier to gain marketing approval for an\norphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives, such as extended\nexclusivity periods, all intended to encourage the development of drugs which\nmight otherwise lack a sufficient profit motive. The assignment of orphan status\nto a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of public policy\nin many countries, and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have\notherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug research and development.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Orphan_drug","recorded":1362505306,"links":25,"instances":["law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orphan drugs|*","Biotechnology law","Drug discovery","Pharmaceuticals policy","Health economics"],"headings":["Orphan drug legislation","Orphan diseases","Activism","Industry involvement","Research centers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["public_policy","law"]],"members":["public_policy"],"related":["Medication","Rare_disease","Profit_motive","Public_policy_(law)","Medical_research","Pharmacokinetics","Pharmacodynamics","Dosing","Clinical_trial","Free_market","Market_failure","Economics","Tax","Patent","Crown_corporation","Orphan_Drug_Act","United_States","National_Organization_for_Rare_Disorders","Pharmaceutical_company","Tax_incentive","Public_Health_Service_Act","Rare_diseases","European_Union","Committee_on_Orphan_Medicinal_Products","European_Medicines_Agency","Glioma","Multiple_myeloma","Cystic_fibrosis","Phenylketonuria","Snake_venom","Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura","European_Medicines_Agency","Ribose-5-phosphate_isomerase_deficiency","Pulmozyme","Tobramycin","Homozygous_familial_hypercholesterolemia","Statins","Penicillamine","National_Organization_for_Rare_Disorders","Global_Genes_Project","Abetalipoproteinemia_Collaboration_Foundation","Zellweger_Baby_Support_Network","Friedreich's_Ataxia_Research_Alliance","Biovitrum","Shire_plc","GlaxoSmithKline","Pfizer","Novartis","Genzyme","Lundbeck","Prosensa","BioMarin_Pharmaceutical","National_Organization_for_Rare_Disorders","European_Organization_for_Rare_Diseases","Center_for_Orphan_Drug_Research","University_of_Minnesota","Keck_Graduate_Institute","Drug_development","European_Organization_for_Rare_Diseases","Orphan_disease","Supplementary_protection_certificate","European_Commission"]}
