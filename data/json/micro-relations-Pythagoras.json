The length of his life was\nvariously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly\nripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty.\"\nWilliam Keith Chambers Guthrie, (1978), A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1:\nThe earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans, page 173. Cambridge University\nPress [http://www-groups.dcs.st-\nand.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Pythagoras.html Biographies] was an Ionian\nGreek philosopher, mathematician, and founder of the religious movement called\nPythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down\ncenturies after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about\nhim. He was born on the island of Samos, and might have travelled widely in his\nyouth, visiting Egypt and other places seeking knowledge. Around 530 BC, he\nmoved to Croton, a Greek colony in southern Italy, and there set up a religious\nsect. His followers pursued the religious rites and practices developed by\nPythagoras, and studied his philosophical theories. The society took an active\nrole in the politics of Croton, but this eventually led to their downfall. The\nPythagorean meeting-places were burned, and Pythagoras was forced to flee the\ncity. He is said to have ended his days in Metapontum.\n\nPythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religious teaching\nin the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic\nand scientist, but he is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which bears his\nname. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that\nof the other pre-Socratic philosophers, one can give only a tentative account of\nhis teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to\nmathematics and natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to\nPythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and\nsuccessors. Whether or not his disciples believed that everything was related to\nmathematics and that numbers were the ultimate reality is unknown. It was said\nthat he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of\nwisdom, Cicero, [[Tusculan Disputations]], 5.3.8â9 = Heraclides Ponticus fr.\n88 Wehrli, Diogenes LaÃ«rtius 1.12, 8.8, Iamblichus VP 58. Burkert attempted to\ndiscredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel,\nPythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism (1966), pp. 97â102, and C. Riedweg,\nPythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence (2005), p. 92. and\nPythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of\nWestern philosophy.\n","linknr":1202,"url":"Pythagoras","recorded":1362485218,"links":145,"instances":["philosopher","scholar","religion","spirit","philosopher","philosopher","philosopher","plato","fractal","ancient"],"pdf":[],"categories":["6th-century
