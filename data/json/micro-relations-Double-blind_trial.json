{"cursor":"18222","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'blind' or 'blinded experiment' is a scientific experiment where some of the\npeople involved are prevented from knowing certain information that might lead\nto conscious or subconscious bias on their part, thus invalidating the results.\n\nFor example, when asking consumers to compare the tastes of different brands of\na product, the identities of the product should be concealed â otherwise\nconsumers will generally tend to prefer the brand they are familiar with.\nSimilarly, when evaluating the effectiveness of a medical drug, both the\npatients and the doctors who administer the drug may be kept in the dark about\nthe dosage being applied in each case â to forestall any chance of a placebo\neffect, observer bias, or conscious deception.\n\nBlinding can be imposed on researchers, technicians, subjects, funders, or any\ncombination of them. The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. Blind\nexperiments are an important tool of the scientific method, in many fields of\nresearchâmedicine, psychology and the social sciences, natural sciences such as\nphysics and biology, applied sciences such as market research, and many others.\nIn some disciplines, such as drug testing, blind experiments are considered\nessential. In other disciplines, blind experiments would be very useful, but\nthey are totally impractical or unethical. An oft-cited example is in the field\nof developmental psychology. Although it would be scientifically expedient to\nraise children under arbitrary experimental conditions, such as on a remote\nisland with a fabricated enculturation, it is obviously a violation of ethics\nand human rights.\n\nThe terms 'blind' (adjective) or 'to blind' (transitive verb) when used in this\nsense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone.\nThe terms 'masked' or 'to mask' may be used for the same concept. (This is\ncommonly the case in ophthalmology, where the word 'blind' is often used in the\nliteral sense.)\n","linknr":580,"url":"Double-blind_trial","recorded":1362511121,"links":33,"instances":["psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Design of experiments","Pharmacology","Clinical research","Scientific method"],"headings":["History","Single-blind trials","Double-blind trials","Triple-blind trials","Usage","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["observer_effect","psychology"]],"members":["observer_effect"],"related":["Scientific_experiment","Cognitive_bias","Clinical_trial","Placebo_effect","Observer_bias","Open-label_trial","Scientific_method","Medicine","Psychology","Social_sciences","Natural_sciences","Physics","Biology","Applied_science","Market_research","Developmental_psychology","Ethics","Adjective","Transitive_verb","Blindfold","Ophthalmology","French_Academy_of_Sciences","Animal_magnetism","Franz_Mesmer","Benjamin_Franklin","Antoine_Lavoisier","Mesmerism","Placebo_effect","Humphry_Davy","Nitrous_oxide","Stradivarius","Claude_Bernard","Age_of_Enlightenment","Experiment","Randomized_controlled_trial","Experimenter's_bias","Observer-expectancy_effect","Pepsi_challenge","Conflict_of_interest","Experiment","Control_group","Placebo_effect","Observer_effect_(psychology)","Experimenter's_bias","Random_sample","Bias","ABX_test","Placebo","Sham_surgery","Clinical_protocol","Evidence-based_medicine","Randomized_controlled_trial","Meta_analysis","Nuclear_physics","Particle_physics","Systematic_error","Observer_bias","Neutrino","Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory","B_meson","BaBar","CDF","MiniBooNE","Super-Kamiokande","Police_lineup"]}
