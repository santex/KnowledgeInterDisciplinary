In order to investigate how individuals understand\nmorality, it is essential to measure their beliefs, emotions, attitudes, and\nbehaviors that contribute to moral understanding. The field of moral development\nstudies the role of peers and parents in facilitating moral development, the\nrole of conscience and values, socialization and cultural influences, empathy\nand altruism, and positive development. The interest in morality spans many\ndisciplines (e.g., philosophy, economics, biology, and political science) and\nspecializations within psychology (e.g., social, cognitive, and cultural). Moral\ndevelopmental psychology research focuses on questions of origins and change in\nmorality across the lifespan.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Moral_development","recorded":1362373679,"links":19,"instances":["social","emotion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Morality|Development","Life skills","Moral psychology"],"headings":["Introductory works/historical background","Interpersonal influences on moral development","Morality and cognition: intentionality","Morality and intergroup attitudes","Moral development and social exclusion","Moral emotions","Morality and culture","Morality and the allocation of resources","Moral neuroscience","Morality and Society","Morality Effect on Adaptability","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","social"],["guilt","emotion"]],"members":["norm","guilt"],"related":["Morality","Justice","Rights","Philosophy","Economics","Biology","Political_science","Social_psychology","Cognitive_psychology","Cultural_psychology","Freud","B._F._Skinner","Jean_Piaget","Lawrence_Kohlberg","Elliot_Turiel","Prejudice","Aggression","Theory_of_mind","Emotions","Empathy","Melanie_Killen","Temperament","Theory_of_mind","Amanda_Woodward","Michael_Tomasello","Stereotypes","Prejudice","Discrimination","Social_identity_theory","Norm_(social)","Contact_hypothesis","Psychoanalytic_theory","Prosocial_behavior","Guilt_(emotion)","Shame","Empathy","Sympathy","Culture","Richard_Shweder","Religion","Behavioral_economics","Jean_Decety"]}
