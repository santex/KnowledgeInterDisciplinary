{"cursor":"52764","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is an algebraic surface of degree five. The picture represents a portion of its\n real locus]]\n\n'Algebraic geometry' is a branch of mathematics, classically studying properties\nof the sets of zeros of polynomial equations. Modern algebraic geometry is based\non more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra,\nwith the language and the problems of geometry.\n\nThe fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties,\nwhich are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial\nequations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are:\nplane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses,\nhyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like\nlemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic\ncurve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions\ninvolve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points,\nthe inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions\ninvolve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by\ndifferent equations.\n\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has\nmultiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis,\ntopology and number theory. Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations\nin several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation\nsolving leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the\nintrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than\nto find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of\nmathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
