Reaping is\nthe cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or\nreaper. The harvest marks the end of the growing season, or the\ngrowing cycle for a particular crop, and social importance of this event makes\nit the focus of seasonal celebrations such as a harvest festival, found in many\nreligions. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting is the most\nlabor-intensive activity of the growing season. On large, mechanized farms,\nharvesting utilizes the most expensive and sophisticated farm machinery, like\nthe combine harvester. Harvesting in general usage includes an immediate post-\nharvest handling, all of the actions taken immediately after removing the\ncropâcooling, sorting, cleaning, packingâup to the point of further on-farm\nprocessing, or shipping to the wholesale or consumer market.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Harvesting","recorded":1372152251,"links":[],"instances":["wine","legume","agriculture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Harvest"],"headings":["Other uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["field","agriculture"],["pulse","legume"],["harvest","wine"],["harvest","wine"]],"members":["harvest","pulse","field"],"related":["Volgograd_Oblast","Russia","Crops","Field_(agriculture)","Grain","Pulse_(legume)","Scythe","Sickle","Reaper","Season","Harvest_festival","Farm","Mechanization","Manual_labour","Farm_machinery","Combine_harvester","Post-harvest_handling","Crop","Cereal","Fish","Timber","Harvest_(wine)","Wine","Irrigation","Energy","Anatomy","Combine_Harvester","Harvest_(wine)","Harvest_festival","Overharvesting","Threshing","Winnowing"]}
