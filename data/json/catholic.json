It insisted that \"the universal Church cannot be conceived\nas the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churche-\ns\".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_co-\nn_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html Letter on Some Aspects of the\nChurch Understood as Communion]</ref>\n\nAccording to McBrien, Catholicism is distinguished from other forms of\nChristianity in its particular understanding and commitment to tradition, the\nsacraments, the mediation between God, communion, and the See of Rome.<ref\nname=\"McBrien\"></ref> According to Orthodox leaders like Bishop Kallistos Ware,\nthe Orthodox Church has these things as well, though the primacy of the See of\nRome is only honorific, showing non-jurisdictional respect for the Bishop of\nRome as the \"first among equals\" and \"Patriarch of the West\".<ref>Timothy Ware,\nThe Orthodox Church (Oxford: Penguin Books, 1993), 214–217.</ref> Catholicism,\naccording to McBrien's paradigm, includes a monastic life, religious institutes,\na religious appreciation of the arts, a communal understanding of sin and\nredemption, and missionary activity.<ref>In his book, Catholicism, he notes (on\npage 19) that his book was \"written in the midst of yet another major crisis in\nthe history of the Roman Catholic Church....\" Never once does he indicate in his\nbook that Catholicism refers to churches not in communion with the See of Rome.\nMcBrien, 19–20.</ref>\n",
