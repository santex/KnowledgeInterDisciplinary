{"cursor":"35818","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Behaviorism' (or 'behaviourism'), is an approach to psychology that combines\nelements of philosophy, methodology, and\ntheory. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ It emerged in\nthe early twentieth century as a reaction to \"mentalistic\" psychology, which\noften had difficulty making predictions that could be tested using rigorous\nexperimental methods. The primary tenet of behaviorism, as expressed in the\nwritings of John B. Watson, B. F. Skinner, and others, is that psychology should\nconcern itself with the observable behavior of people and animals, not with\nunobservable events that take place in their minds.\nThe behaviorist school of thought maintains that behaviors as such can be\ndescribed scientifically without recourse either to internal physiological\nevents or to hypothetical constructs such as thoughts and beliefs.\n\nFrom early psychology in the 19th century, the behaviorist school of thought ran\nconcurrently and shared commonalities with the psychoanalytic and Gestalt\nmovements in psychology into the 20th century; but also differed from the mental\nphilosophy of the Gestalt psychologists in critical ways. Its main\ninfluences were Ivan Pavlov, who investigated classical conditioning although he\ndid not necessarily agree with behaviorism or behaviorists, Edward Lee\nThorndike, John B. Watson who rejected introspective methods and sought to\nrestrict psychology to experimental methods, and B.F. Skinner who conducted\nresearch on operant conditioning.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a\nresult of the cognitive revolution. Friesen, N. (2005).

The Dream Machine: JCR\nLicklider and the revolution that made computing personal. New York: Penguin\nBooks. (pp. 139â40). While behaviorism and cognitive schools of\npsychological thought may not agree theoretically, they have complemented each\nother in practical therapeutic applications, such as in cognitiveâbehavioral\ntherapy that has demonstrable utility in treating certain pathologies, such as\nsimple phobias, PTSD, and addiction. In addition, behaviorism sought to create a\ncomprehensive model of the stream of behavior from the birth of the human to his\ndeath (see Behavior analysis of child development).\n","linknr":764,"url":"Behaviorism","recorded":1362901255,"links":145,"instances":["psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100702230825/http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf","http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf","http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_2.pdf","http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100702230825/http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf","http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf"],"categories":["Behaviorism|","Mind–body problem","Philosophy of psychology","Psychological theories","Theories of mind"],"headings":["Versions","Behaviourism and education","Operant conditioning","Classical conditioning","Molar versus molecular behaviorism","Behaviorism in philosophy","21st-century behavior analysis","Behavior analysis and culture","List of notable behaviorists","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["punishment","psychology"]],"members":["punishment"],"related":["Psychology","John_B._Watson","B._F._Skinner","Physiology","Psychology","Psychoanalytic","Gestalt_psychology","Mental_philosophy","Ivan_Pavlov","Classical_conditioning","Edward_Lee_Thorndike","John_B._Watson","Introspection","Experimental_psychology","B.F._Skinner","Operant_conditioning","Cognitive_revolution","Cognitive–behavioral_therapy","Phobia","Posttraumatic_stress_disorder","Addiction","Behavior_analysis_of_child_development","John_B._Watson","Covert","Radical_behaviorism","B.F._Skinner","Willard_Van_Orman_Quine","Microeconomics","Eclecticism","Parsimony","Psychological_behaviorism","Clark_L._Hull","Edward_C._Tolman","Dualistic","S–R_theory","Trial-and-error","Society_for_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Behavior","Noam_Chomsky","Innate_theory","Behaviorist_theory","Language_acquisition","Relational_Frame_Theory","Operant_conditioning","B.F_Skinner","Behaviour_modification","Reinforcement","Punishment_(psychology)","Operant_conditioning_chamber","Operant_conditioning","Classical_conditioning","Biology","Natural_selection","Phylogeny","Culture","Melioration_theory","Hyperbolic_discounting","Howard_Rachlin","Richard_Herrnstein","Rate_of_reinforcement","Love","Philosophy_of_mind","Natural_science","Chemistry","Physics","Edmund_Fantino","Philosophy_of_language","Analytic_philosophy","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Alan_Turing","Rudolf_Carnap","Carl_Hempel","W.V._Quine","Gilbert_Ryle","Category_mistake","Daniel_Dennett","Organizational_Behavior_Management","Behavior_analysis","Relational_Frame_Theory","Acceptance_and_Commitment_Therapy","Association_for_Contextual_Behavioral_Science","Marvin_Harris","Game_development","Vladimir_Bekhterev","Ivan_Pavlov","Alan_E._Kazdin","Albert_Bandura","Sidney_W._Bijou","Edwin_Ray_Guthrie","Richard_J._Herrnstein","Clark_L._Hull","Fred_S._Keller","Neal_E._Miller","Marsha_M._Linehan","O._Hobart_Mowrer","Charles_E._Osgood","Kenneth_W._Spence","B.F._Skinner","Edward_Lee_Thorndike","Edward_C._Tolman","Murray_Sidman","John_B._Watson","Ole_Ivar_Lovaas","Steven_C._Hayes","Donald_Baer","Dermot_Barnes-Holmes","Animal_training","Applied_behavior_analysis","Behavior_modification","Behavior_therapy","Behavioral_change_theories","Behaviouralism","Professional_practice_of_behavior_analysis","Behavior_analysis_of_child_development","Classical_conditioning","Cognition","Cognitive_revolution","Dog_behaviorist","Experimental_analysis_of_behavior","Models_of_abnormality","Operationalization","Psychological_behaviorism"]}
