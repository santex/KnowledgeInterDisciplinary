Connectedness is one of the principal\ntopological properties that is used to distinguish topological spaces. A\nstronger notion is that of a 'path-connected space', which is a space where any\ntwo points can be joined by a path.\n\nA subset of a topological space X is a 'connected set' if it is a connected\nspace when viewed as a subspace of X.\n\nAs an example of a space that is not connected, one can delete an infinite line\nfrom the plane. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are\nnot connected) include the plane with a closed annulus removed, as well as the\nunion of two disjoint open disks in two-dimensional Euclidean space.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Path-connected_space","recorded":1362898899,"links":37,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","topology","topology","topology","graph_theory","topology","topology","mathematics","mathematics","topology","topology","topology","topology","topology","set_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.math.shimane-u.ac.jp/memoir/39/D.Buhagiar.pdf","http://www.math.shimane-u.ac.jp/memoir/39/D.Buhagiar.pdf"],"categories":["General
