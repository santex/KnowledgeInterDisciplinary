A bit can have only two values: either 1 or 0.\nA bit can be implemented in hardware by means of a two state device. Eight bits\nform a byte.\n\nIn computing, a bit can be defined as a variable or computed quantity that can\nhave only two possible values. These two values are often interpreted as binary\ndigits and are usually denoted by the numerical digits 0 and 1. The two\nvalues can also be interpreted as logical values (true/false, yes/no), algebraic\nsigns (+/−), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued\nattribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of\nthe underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different\nassignments may be used even within the same device or program. The length of a\nbinary number may be referred to as its \"bit-length\".\n\nIn information theory, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a\nbinary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, John B.\nAnderson, Rolf Johnnesson (2006) Understanding Information Transmission.\nor the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes\nknown.
