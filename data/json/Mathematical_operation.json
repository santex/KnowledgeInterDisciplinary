For a\nnotion in elementary mathematics, see [[arithmetic operation]].\n\nIn its simplest meaning in mathematics and logic, an 'operation' is an action or\nprocedure which produces a new value from one or more input values, called\n\"operands\". There are two common types of operations: unary and binary. Unary\noperations involve only one value, such as negation and trigonometric functions.\nBinary operations, on the other hand, take two values, and include addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n\nOperations can involve mathematical objects other than numbers. The logical\nvalues true and false can be combined using logic operations, such as and, or,\nand not. Vectors can be added and subtracted. Rotations can be combined using\nthe function composition operation, performing the first rotation and then the\nsecond. Operations on sets include the binary operations [[union\n(mathematics)|union]] and [[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]] and the\nunary operation of [[complementation (mathematics)|complementation]]. Operations\non functions include composition and convolution.\n\nOperations may not be defined for every possible value. For example, in the real\nnumbers one cannot divide by zero or take square roots of negative numbers. The\nvalues for which an operation is defined form a set called its [[domain\n(mathematics)|domain]]. The set which contains the values produced is called the\n[[codomain]], but the set of actual values attained by the operation is its\n[[range (mathematics)|range]]. For example, in the real numbers, the squaring\noperation only produces nonnegative numbers; the codomain is the set of real\nnumbers but the range is the nonnegative numbers.\n\nOperations can involve dissimilar objects. A vector can be multiplied by a\nscalar to form another vector. And the inner product operation on two\nvectors produces a scalar. An operation may or may not have certain\nproperties, for example it may be associative, commutative, anticommutative,\nidempotent, and so on.\n\nThe values combined are called operands, arguments, or inputs, and the value\nproduced is called the value, result, or output. Operations can have fewer or\nmore than two inputs.\n\nAn operation is like an operator, but the point of view is different. For\ninstance, one often speaks of \"the operation of addition\" or \"addition\noperation\" when focusing on the operands and result, but one says \"addition\noperator\" (rarely \"operator of addition\") when focusing on the process, or from\nthe more abstract viewpoint, the function +: SÃS â S.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Mathematical_operation","recorded":1362374531,"links":40,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary mathematics","Abstract algebra"],"headings":["General definition","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/PlusMinusTimesDivide.png/220px-PlusMinusTimesDivide.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/6/b/26b17225b626fb9238849fd60eabdf60.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/3/6/336d5ebc5436534e61d16e63ddfca327.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/e/9eedd61e32f7a8e70e171028a7e5dc08.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/9/a3933e4fee514b1dfa4cea09af6ae53e.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["division","mathematics"],["vector","geometric"],["set","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["scalar","mathematics"],["operator","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["domain","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["operator","mathematics"]],"members":["operator","scalar","domain","function","division","set","vector"],"related":["Mathematics","Logic","Operands","Unary_operation","Binary_operation","Negation","Trigonometric_function","Addition","Subtraction","Multiplication","Division_(mathematics)","Exponentiation","Truth_value","Logic_operation","Vector_(geometric)","Rotation","Function_composition","Set_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Function_composition","Convolution","Scalar_(mathematics)","Inner_product","Associative","Commutative","Anticommutative","Idempotent","Operator_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Unary_operation","Binary_operation","Finitary_relation","Ordinal_number","Cardinal_number","Cartesian_product","Algebra","Unicode_Mathematical_Operators","Unary_operation","Binary_operation","Arity","Binary_relation","Domain_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Multigrade_operator","Operator_(mathematics)","Parametric_operator","Finitary_relation","Triadic_relation","Arithmetic"]}
