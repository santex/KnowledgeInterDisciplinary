{"cursor":"11319","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn particle physics, 'bosons' ( {{cite book |title=Longman pronunciation\ndictionary |first=John C. |last= Wells |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow,\nEngland |year=1990 |isbn=0582053838 }} entry \"Boson\" ), {{cite book\n|title= Collins Dictionary http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/-\nboson?showCookiePolicy=true}} ) are one of two classes of elementary\nparticles, the other being fermions. Two bosons with identical properties can be\nin the same place at the same time, but two fermions cannot. Matter is made of\nfermions whereas bosons are the force carriers, that function as the 'glue'\nholding matter together.\n\nBosons are particles that are governed by BoseâEinstein statistics. There is a\ndeep relationship between this property and integer spin (s = 0, 1, 2 etc.) The\nname boson was coined by Paul Dirac Notes on Dirac's lecture Developments in\nAtomic Theory at Le Palais de la DÃ©couverte, 6 December 1945, UKNATARCHI Dirac\nPapers BW83/2/257889. See note 64 to p. 331 in \"The Strangest Man\" by Graham\nFarmelo commemorative of the contribution of Indian physicist Satyendra\nNath Bose, along\nwith Albert Einstein, in the formation of BoseâEinstein statisticsâthe governing\ntheory in this case. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boson title = boson\n| (dictionary entry) publisher = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary accessdate\n| = 2010-03-21\n}} Examples of bosons include fundamental particles (Higgs\nboson and the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model, and the\nhypothetical graviton of quantum gravity); composite particles (mesons, stable\nnuclei of even mass number, e.g., deuterium, helium-4, lead-208 Even-mass-\nnumber nuclides, which comprise 152/255 = ~ 60% of all stable nuclides, are\nbosons, i.e. they have integerspin. Almost all (148 of the 152) are even-proton,\neven-neutron (EE) nuclides, which necessarily have spin 0 because of pairing.\nThe remainder of the stable bosonic nuclides are 5 odd-proton, odd-neutron\nstable nuclides (see isotope under \"odd proton-odd proton nuclei\"); these odd-\nodd bosons are: , ,, and {{Nuclide2). All have nonzero integer spin. ); and\nquasiparticles (Cooper pairs). Bosons differ significantly from a group of\nsubatomic particles known as fermions in that there is no limit to the number\nthat can occupy the same quantum state. This behaviour gives rise, for example,\nto the remarkable properties of helium-4 when it is cooled to become a\nsuperfluid. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boson title = boson work = Merriam-\n| Webster Online Dictionary accessdate = 2010-03-21\n}}\n","linknr":532,"url":"Bosons","recorded":1362892168,"links":93,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quantum field theory","Atomic physics","Bosons","Concepts in physics","Condensed matter physics"],"headings":["Properties of bosons","Definition and basic properties","Elementary bosons","Composite bosons","See also","Notes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg/250px-CERN_LHC_Tunnel1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"]],"members":["spin"],"related":["Particle_physics","Elementary_particle","Fermion","Bose–Einstein_statistics","Spin_(physics)","Paul_Dirac","Satyendra_Nath_Bose","Albert_Einstein","Bose–Einstein_statistics","Higgs_boson","Gauge_boson","Standard_Model","Graviton","Meson","Mass_number","Deuterium","Helium-4","Lead-208","Spin_(physics)","Isotope","Tantalum-180m","Quasiparticles","Cooper_pairs","Fermions","Quantum_state","Superfluid","Fermions","Fermi–Dirac_statistics","Pauli_exclusion_principle","Force_carrier","Matter","Quantum_physics","Elementary_particle","Photon","Composite_particle","Meson","Integer","Spin_(physics)","Half-integer","Spin-statistics_theorem","Theory_of_relativity","Quantum_field_theory","Standard_Model","Gauge_boson","Graviton","Superfluidity","Bose–Einstein_condensate","Wavefunction","Quantum_state","Radiation","Quantum_field","Bosonic_field","Canonical_commutation_relation","Laser","Masers","Superfluid","Helium","Planck_spectrum","Black-body","Microwave_background_radiation","Fundamental_interaction","Virtual_particle","Force","Quantum_mechanic","Maxwell–Boltzmann_statistics","Classical_mechanics","W_and_Z_bosons","Electromagnetic_field","Weak_interaction","Strong_force","Higgs_boson","Higgs_mechanism","LHC","Scalar_field","Spin_(physics)","Antiparticle","CP-symmetry","Electric_charge","Color_charge","Graviton","Hadron","Atomic_nucleus","Atom","Quark","Carbon-12","Helium-4","Liquid","Anyon","Bose_gas","Identical_particles","Parastatistics","Cooper_pairs"]}
