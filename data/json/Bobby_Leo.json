[http://www.pro-football-\nreference.com/players/L/LeoxBo00.htm Bobby Leo NFL & AFL Football Statistics -\nPro-Football-Reference.com]\n\nHe was a prominent figure on the high school gridiron in Everett, Massachusetts.\nIn 1999, the Boston Globe ranked the 10 best Massachusetts High School football\nplayers of all time, and Leo ranked 3rd on the list, behind only Charlie\nBrickley also of Everett and Harry Agganis of Lynn Classical. Given that both of\nthose two died before Leo played his high school ball, he can lay claim to being\nthe best living high school football player in Massachusetts history for the\npast 50 years, ahead of various other prominent football players from\nMassachusetts ranked behind him in the Globe analysis, including Heisman winners\nDoug Flutie and Joe Bellino.\n\nHis play at Everett caught the attention of scouts from all the big name schools\nat the time, and Leo was offered scholarships to Notre Dame, Michigan, and\nothers after his Everett squad lost a one-point game to Miami Senior High in the\n\"National Championship\" game his senior year, when his team captured one of\ntheir many state titles.\n\nLeo chose to attend Harvard, where he won awards and he became the first and\nonly player to score the winning touchdown in the Harvard-Yale game in each of\nhis three varsity seasons (freshman were not eligible to play varsity in the Ivy\nLeague at the time). He also starred in baseball and track at Harvard as he had\nat Everett High School. A Sports Illustrated article in its 10/31/1966 issue\npraised Leo and featured a photo and quotations from an interview with him after\nan important Harvard victory against Dartmouth.\n\nLeo earned All-Ivy honors, was named the top back in New England (the so-called\n\"New England Heismann\" trophy), and was an honorable mention All-American. He is\na member of the Harvard Hall of Fame.\n\nLeo's 6.3 yards per carry during his senior year were enough to place him second\nin the history of Ivy League football at the time, and remains a Harvard single\nseason record.\n\nHe went on to be drafted by the Boston Patriots and, after serving a stint in\nthe military, was finally able to join the team toward the end of the season in\n1967. His first game was a memorable one. On national television against the\nBuffalo Bills, Leo was the primary kick and punt returner for the Patriots, and\nhe electrified the crowd at Fenway Park with one of the 10 longest punt returns\nin the AFL that season, a 50 yard sprint past the entire Bills coverage team,\nbefore gettting tripped up inside the ten yard line. Later in the game, he took\nhis first professional handoff from the running back slot for 7 yards. Late in\nthe game he lined up a wide receiver. His first professional reception was a 25-\nyard touchdown in the final moments of the game. He continued to play a primary\nrole on the Patriots' return team, effectively returning punts and kickoffs the\nfollowing week at the Orange Bowl against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe following season he was slotted to be one of the Patriots' primary tail\nbacks, and was listed as second of five players on the depth chart in the team's\nofficial media guide. During the long preseason (which was 6 games at the time),\nthe coaching staff decided to move him back to receiver, with great success. He\nhad a strong preseason that year. Against a the Jets in a preseason game in\nRichmond, Virginia, he caught four passes and was moved to the starting lineup\nthe following week against the Dolphins. He concluded his successful preseason\nat flanker by scoring in an AFL v. NFL exhibition game against the Philadelphia\nEagles at his old stomping grounds, Harvard Stadium, and serving as the team's\nprimary kick returner during that time. After returning kicks in the first game\nof the regular season, Leo suffered a serious injury in an ensuing practice\nbefore the next regular season game, during the two week layoff as a result of a\nbye week for the Patriots in week 2 of the regular season. The Patrios were\nrequired to make a roster move because their primary punter was hurt as well,\nand asked Leo to accept a temporary assignment to the taxi squad after he\nrecovered from his injury. Leo refused, and retired from the game.\n\nHe amassed over 300 total yards during his tenure for the Patriots.\n\nAfter the 1968 season, Bobby decided to return to academics, attending law\nschool in the Boston area and practicing law for many years thereafter.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Bobby_Leo","recorded":1375056800,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Everett,_Massachusetts","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Running_back","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/NFL_Draft","/wiki/1967_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LeoxBo00.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&oldid=556045527","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1945_births","/wiki/Category:American_football_wide_receivers","/wiki/Category:Boston_Patriots_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Harvard_Crimson_football_players","/wiki/Category:People_from_Everett,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bobby+Leo&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bobby+Leo","/wiki/Bobby_Leo","/wiki/Talk:Bobby_Leo","#","/wiki/Bobby_Leo","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bobby_Leo","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bobby_Leo","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&oldid=556045527","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4935282","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bobby_Leo&id=556045527","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bobby+Leo","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bobby+Leo&oldid=556045527&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Leo&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4935282#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Leo","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1945
