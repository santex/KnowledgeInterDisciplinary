This\nenergy is always associated with a certain amount of mass according to mass-\nenergy equivalence. Energy, in turn, may be defined in the usual way in physics,\nas the ability to acomplish work, which is to apply a force through a distance\nor physical length.\n\nBesides its equivalence to energy, several types of observable and measurable\nphenomena arise from mass. All have been shown to be equivalent and agree with\neach other when they are used to measure mass.\n\n'Inertial mass' is a quantitative measure of an object's resistance to changes\nin uniform velocity, (acceleration).\n\n'Gravitational mass' is a quantitative measure that is proportional to the\nmagnitude of the gravitational force which is\n# exerted by an object (active gravitational mass), or experienced by an object\n# (passive gravitational force) when interacting with a second object.\n\nIn the above second instance mass induces changes in motion; such as when\nearth's gravitational force induces changes in motion in daily life, such as\nNewton's falling apple or the cause behind the arc of a baseball. This applies\nto all earth-bound objects, from feathers and ants to mountain boulders and\nelephants.<ref name=kane> {{cite news\n | last = Kane first = Gordon title = The Mysteries of Mass newspaper =\n | Scientific American location = pages = 32â€“39 language = publisher = Nature\n | America, Inc. date = September 4, 2008 url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysteries-of-\n | mass accessdate =2013-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nMass is often measured using a mass balance or scale.
