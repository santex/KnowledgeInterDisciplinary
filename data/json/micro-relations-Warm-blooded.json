{"cursor":"7292","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term 'warm-blooded' is a colloquial term to describe animal species which\nhave a relatively higher blood temperature, and maintain thermal homeostasis\nprimarily through internal metabolic processes. These are characteristics of\nmammals and birds.\n\nBoth the terms \"warm-blooded\" and \"cold-blooded\" have fallen out of favour with\nscientists because of the vagueness of the terms and an increased understanding\nof the field. Body temperature types are not discrete categories. Each term may\nbe replaced with one or more variants (see the next section for examples). Body\ntemperature maintenance (thermoregulation) incorporates a wide range of\ndifferent techniques that result in a body temperature continuum.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Warm-blooded","recorded":1362672739,"links":47,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal physiology"],"headings":["Characteristics of warm-bloodedness","Reasons for term falling into disuse","Heat generation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Wiki_snake_eats_mouse.jpg/220px-Wiki_snake_eats_mouse.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Wiki_tarantula.jpg/120px-Wiki_tarantula.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Animal","Species","Homeostasis","Metabolism","Mammal","Bird","Cold-blooded","Temperature","Thermoregulation","Thermoregulation","Endotherm","Metabolism","Ectothermy","Homeotherm","Poikilothermy","Tachymetabolism","Bradymetabolism","Mammal","Bird","Bat","Poikilothermic","Bradymetabolism","Heterothermy","Cold-blooded","Ectothermic","Poikilothermy","Bradymetabolism","Fish","Swordfish","Shark","Circulatory_system","Brain","Eye","Predation","Metabolism","Cell_(biology)","Glucose","Carbon_dioxide","Adenosine_triphosphate","Homeotherms","Feather"]}
