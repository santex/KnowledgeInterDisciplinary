Consequently, such materials have\nelectronic properties intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and\nthose of discrete molecules. They were\ndiscovered at the beginning of the 1980s by Alexei Ekimov in a glass\nmatrix and by Louis E. Brus in colloidal solutions. The term \"quantum dot\" was\ncoined by Mark Reed.\n(1988).[http://www.eng.yale.edu/reedlab/publications/26%20QDot%20PRL.pdf]\n\nResearchers have studied quantum dots in transistors, solar cells, LEDs, and\ndiode lasers. They have also investigated quantum dots as agents for medical\nimaging and hope to use them as qubits in quantum computing.\n\nStated simply, quantum dots are semiconductors whose electronic characteristics\nare closely related to the size and shape of the individual crystal. Generally,\nthe smaller the size of the crystal, the larger the band gap, the greater the\ndifference in energy between the highest valence band and the lowest conduction\nband becomes, therefore more energy is needed to excite the dot, and\nconcurrently, more energy is released when the crystal returns to its resting\nstate. For example, in fluorescent dye applications, this equates to higher\nfrequencies of light emitted after excitation of the dot as the crystal size\ngrows smaller, resulting in a color shift from red to blue in the light emitted.\nIn addition to such tuning, a main advantage with quantum dots is that, because\nof the high level of control possible over the size of the crystals produced, it\nis possible to have very precise control over the conductive properties of the\nmaterial. Quantum dots of different sizes can be assembled into a\ngradient multi-layer nanofilm.
