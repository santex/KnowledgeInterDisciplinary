{"cursor":"11128","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'motion of no confidence' is primarily a statement or vote which states that a\nperson in a superior position - be it government, managerial, etc. - is no\nlonger deemed fit to hold that position. This may be based on said person\nfalling short in some respect, failing to carry out obligations, or making\nchoices that other members feel are detrimental.\n\nIn law, a 'motion of no confidence' (alternatively 'vote of no confidence',\n'censure motion', 'no-confidence motion', or (unsuccessful) 'confidence motion')\nis a parliamentary motion which when passed would demonstrate to the head of\nstate that the elected parliament no longer has confidence in (one or more\nmembers of) the appointed government.\n\nA censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion. \"No Confidence\" leads\nto compulsory resignation of the council of ministers whereas \"Censure\" is meant\nto show disapproval and does not result in the resignation of ministers. The\ncensure motion can be against an individual minister or a group of ministers,\nbut the no-confidence motion is directed against the entire council of\nministers. Censure motions need to state the reasons for the motion while no-\nconfidence motions do not require reasons to be specified.\n\nSometimes, the government will choose to declare that one of its bills is a\n\"motion of confidence\". This may be used to prevent dissident members of\nparliament from voting against it.\n\nIn the Westminster system, the defeat of a supply bill (one that concerns the\nspending of money) automatically requires the resignation of the government or\ndissolution of Parliament, much like a non-confidence vote, since a government\nthat cannot spend money is hamstrung. This is called loss of supply.\n\nWhen the upper house of a Westminster system country has the right to refuse\nsupply, such as in Australia during the events of 1975, the convention is in a\ngrey area as Westminster governments are not normally expected to maintain the\nconfidence of the upper house.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Motion_of_no_confidence","recorded":1362685668,"links":48,"instances":["federal_republic","political_custom","government"],"pdf":["https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m07.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m07.pdf"],"categories":["Confidence motions|"],"headings":["Variations","History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["executive","government"],["chancellor_of_germany","federal_republic"],["constitutional_convention","political_custom"]],"members":["chancellor_of_germany","constitutional_convention","executive"],"related":["Parliamentary_motion","Head_of_state","Executive_(government)","Westminster_system","Supply_bill","Loss_of_supply","1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis","Germany","Spain","Israel","Head_of_state","Constructive_vote_of_no_confidence","Weimar_Republic","Head_of_government","Chancellor_of_Germany_(Federal_Republic)","President_of_Germany","Prime_Minister","Spain","Consensus_government","Northwest_Territories","Nunavut","Canada","Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","Early_day_motion","Speech_from_the_Throne","Presidential_system","United_States_Congress","United_States_Secretary_of_State","Dean_Acheson","United_States_Attorney_General","Alberto_Gonzales","Impeachment","United_States","Venezuela","Recall_election","Russia","State_Duma","Majority","Government_of_Russia","President_of_Russia","State_Duma","President_of_Russia","Russia","Siege_of_Yorktown","American_Revolutionary_War","Parliament_of_Great_Britain","Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom","Frederick_North,_Lord_North","George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)","Robert_Peel","1979_vote_of_no_confidence_in_the_government_of_James_Callaghan","James_Callaghan","Party_discipline","By-election","1979_vote_of_no_confidence_in_the_government_of_James_Callaghan","Margaret_Thatcher","Coalition_government","French_Fourth_Republic","Weimar_Republic","Italy","Israel","Politics_of_Japan","President_of_France","Stephen_Harper","Prorogation_in_Canada","2008â€“2009_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute","Motions_of_no_confidence_in_the_United_Kingdom"]}
