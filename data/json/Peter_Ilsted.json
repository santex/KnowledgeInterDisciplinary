{"cursor":"3412","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in black, Vess Collection]] 'Peter Ilsted' (1861â1933) was a leading Danish\n artist and printmaker. Ilsted, Carl Holsoe and Ilstedâs brother-in-law, Vilhelm\n HammershÃ¸i, were the leading artists in early 20th century Denmark. All three\n artists were members of âThe Free Exhibitionâ, a progressive art society\n created around 1890. They are famous for painting images of \"Sunshine and\n Silent Rooms\", all in subtle colors. Their works reflects the orderliness of a\n tranquil life â- similar to the earlier works of Vermeer. Their art was later\n referred to as the âCopenhagen Interior Schoolâ. These interiors evoke at once\n a sense of calm, as well as a sense of mystery. The orderly rooms are often\n viewed from behindâcausing one to wonder if the scenes are really tranquil or\n something else. James McNeill Whistler, Duret and important art critics were\n early admirers and collectors of Ilstedâs work.\n\nIlsted was HammershÃ¸i's brother-in-law. While at first glance their work appears\nsimilar, it is in fact quite different. HammershÃ¸iâs work has an aloof\nausterity, in contrast to Ilsted's scenes of common life. Though sometimes\nHammershÃ¸iâs colorful early pictures are reminiscent of James Tissot, his work\nis quintessentially Danish. However, Ilsted was more of a technician, and he\nmade considerable contributions in the field of graphic art. Ilstedâs mezzotints\n(colored Ã  la poupeÃ©) were very popular and important in his day. They were an\ninnovation in the media. Ilsted exhibited his work all over Europe, in London in\n1907, in Germany and at the Paris Salon. It is there that his work was first\nexposed to Europeâs art community.\n\nIlsted was a great success in his lifetime and won many awards and accolades for\nhis work. He was the only member of the group to also focus on printmaking.\nIlstedâs achievements in mezzotints were revolutionary. Some of his mezzotints,\nmost of which were created in black as well as color editions, are considered\namong the greatest ever made. His greatest contribution which T.F. Simon, Manuel\nRobbe, and others seemingly adopted was that of inking the plate Ã  la poupeÃ©.\nSome art historians have argued that these 3 men created the technique at about\nthe same time but without consultation. This belief is not certain.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) held an important exhibition on the\nwork of Ilsted, HammershÃ¸i, and Vermeer in 2001.\n\n\n","linknr":99,"url":"Peter_Ilsted","recorded":1375068672,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:SunshineV.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/SunshineV.jpg/220px-SunshineV.jpg","/wiki/File:SunshineV.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mezzotint","/wiki/Printmaker","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Holsoe&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Vilhelm_Hammersh%C3%B8i","/wiki/Vermeer","/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler","/wiki/Duret","/wiki/James_Tissot","/wiki/Paris_Salon","/wiki/Mezzotint","/wiki/T.F._Simon","/w/index.php?title=Manuel_Robbe&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=%C3%80_la_poupe%C3%A9&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=edit&section=2","http://www.artsignaturedictionary.com/artist.php?id=2037","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/56883710","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&oldid=541727678","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Danish_painters","/wiki/Category:1861_births","/wiki/Category:1933_deaths","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Ilsted&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Peter+Ilsted","/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","/wiki/Talk:Peter_Ilsted","#","/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Peter_Ilsted","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Peter_Ilsted","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&oldid=541727678","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1840505","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Peter_Ilsted&id=541727678","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Peter+Ilsted","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Peter+Ilsted&oldid=541727678&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Peter_Ilsted&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1840505#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ilsted","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Danish
