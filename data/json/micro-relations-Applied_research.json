It accesses and uses some part of the research\ncommunities' (the academy's) accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and\ntechniques, for a specific, often state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.\nApplied research is compared to pure research (basic research) in discussion\nabout research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.\n\nApplied research deals with solving practical problems and generally\nemploys empirical methodologies. Because applied research resides in the messy\nreal world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it\nmay be impossible to use a random sample. Thus, transparency in the methodology\nis crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing\nan otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.\n\nThe OECD's Frascati Manual describes Applied Research as one of the\nthree forms of research, along with Basic research & Experimental Development.\n\nDue to its practical focus, applied research information will be found in the\nliterature associated with individual disciplines.\n","recorded":1362123914,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"61","instances":["polity"],"pdf":["http://www2.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/projects/CoreResearchProjects/ContingencyDissentInScience/DP/DPRoll-HansenOnline0409.pdf","http://www2.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/projects/CoreResearchProjects/ContingencyDissentInScience/DP/DPRoll-HansenOnline0409.pdf","http://browse.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/pdfs/free/9202081e.pdf","http://browse.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/pdfs/free/9202081e.pdf"],"categories":["Research"],"headings":["See also","References"],"tags":[["state","polity"],["state","polity"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Science-symbol-2.svg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Scientific_method","Science","Academy","State_(polity)","Commerce","Customer","Pure_research","Empirical","Random_sample","Methodology","OECD","Frascati_Manual","Basic_research","Research_and_development","Applied_science","Basic_research","Frascati_Manual","Pasteur's_quadrant","Research"],"members":["state"],"book":[]}
