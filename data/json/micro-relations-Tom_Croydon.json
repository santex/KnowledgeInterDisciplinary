We see him in the first few seasons as the Sergeant of\nMount Thomas Police Station, who later is promoted to Senior Sergeant.\n\nHe has been married twice; first, to Nell (who died in the Second Season). She\nwas mentioned in nearly every episode, yet we only see her left eye and her hand\nin the episode in which she died. Tom and Nell had two daughters, Susan and\nAnna; Anna by whom Tom has two grandchildren - Samuel Thomas Croydon (more known\nas Sam) and Daisy Alcroft.\n\nHis second wife was the local reverend of the Mount Thomas Anglican Parish,\nReverend Grace Curtis. He married her in the ninth season. Upon marrying her, he\ntook on the role of becoming a stepfather to Grace's two sons, Daniel and\nNelson. Grace died in the eleventh season after being raped and murdered by town-\nterror Troy Baxter (who later died in unknown circumstances). Her death occurred\nin the episode in which the original station was bombed, killing Jo Parrish and\nClancy Freeman, although we don't find out that she is dead until the next\nepisode. His stepsons moved from Mount Thomas to live with their grandparents\nafter Daniel was accused of raping a local girl.\n\nTom later reconnects with his youngest daughter, Anna, (with whom he had had\nminimal contact since the birth of her son) when while visiting Mount Thomas,\nher car (with daughter Daisy inside) is stolen. When Daisy is found, all seems\nto go well, until she is kidnapped for different reasons along with her brother,\nand buried alive. Once recovered, Anna blames the happenings on Tom and they\nbecome estranged.\n\nIn the final season, (season thirteen), we see Tom, who has since \"changed\"\nsince the bombing (becoming a cold, hard-hearted man) form an almost father-\ndaughter relationship with colleague, Senior Detective Amy Fox. We see him\nexperience immense pain and having to take many medications before Amy finally\nconvinces him to go to see the doctor. His pain ends up being the result of\nprostate cancer. He secretly goes to Melbourne (only letting Amy know) to have\nsurgery, but his \"adopted\" daughter, Constable Kelly O'Rourke (Tom and his\nfamily were family friends of the O'Rourkes and became Kelly's father figure\nafter her own policeman father was shot and killed when she was ten), finds out\nand visits him one night. Kelly, upon arrival back to Mount Thomas, accidentally\nleaks the information to Tom's superior and enemy, Inspector Russell Falcon-\nPrice, of Tom having prostate cancer. Falcon-Price then takes this as an\nopportunity to try to get rid of Tom from Mount Thomas once and for all (a task\nwhich he has been trying to do for many years). Tom also has to go in for\nchemotherapy, this which happens in the series finale.\n\nAfter a numerous series of events, the station is closed down in the finale, and\nall seems doomed. But before long the station is re-opened, and Tom finally\ndecides (after much convincing from Amy and Kelly) to go to the Croydon Family\nReunion his daughter Susan has been trying to invite him too. Here, we see that\nhe makes amends with his daughters.\n\nDuring various episodes such as Series 1, Episode 14 (Reunion), Tom Croydon\ncan be seen wearing his medals he was awarded during his tour in the Vietnam\nWar. \n\n\n\n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| || Vietnam Medal ||\n|-\n| || National Medal || for 15 years National Service (Army and Police)\n|-\n| || Australian Defence Medal || 2006 -
