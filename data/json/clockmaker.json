      "text" : " of medieval clockmakers, 1568.]] .]] A 'clockmaker' is an artisan who makes and\n repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern\n clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by\n jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and\n watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for\n numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to\n modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade\n requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices\n with small gears and fine machinery.\n\nOriginally, clockmakers were master craftsmen who designed and built clocks by\nhand. Since modern clockmakers are required to repair antique, handmade or one-of-a-\nkind clocks for which parts are not available, they must have some of the design\nand fabrication abilities of the original craftsmen. A qualified clockmaker can\ntypically design and make a missing piece for a clock without access to the\noriginal component.\n\nClockmakers generally do not work on watches; the skills and tools required are\ndifferent enough that watchmaking is a separate field, handled by another\nspecialist, the watchmaker.\n",
