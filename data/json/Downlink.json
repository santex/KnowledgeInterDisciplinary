{"cursor":"6487","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn telecommunications a 'link' is the communications [[Channel\n(communications)|channel]] that connects two or more communicating devices. This\nlink may be an actual physical link or it may be a logical link that uses one or\nmore actual physical links. When the link is a logical link the type of physical\nlink should always be specified (e.g., data link, uplink, downlink, fiber optic\nlink, point-to-point link, etc.) This term is widely used in computer networking\n(see Data link) to refer to the communications facilities that connect nodes of\na network.\n\nA telecommunications link is generally one of several types of information\ntransmission paths such as those provided by communication satellites,\nterrestrial radio communications infrastructure and computer networks to connect\ntwo or more points.\n","linknr":188,"url":"Downlink","recorded":1362485376,"links":20,"instances":["telecommunications","networking","telecommunications","telecommunications","networking","telecommunications","networking"],"pdf":["http://www.scatmag.com/technical/techarticle-mar05.pdf","http://www.scatmag.com/technical/techarticle-mar05.pdf"],"categories":["Computer networking","Telecommunications engineering","Communication circuits","Broadcast engineering","Telecommunications infrastructure"],"headings":["Types of links","Direction","Sources","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point-to-point","telecommunications"],["node","networking"],["point-to-multipoint_communication","telecommunications"],["upstream","networking"],["downstream","networking"],["hop","telecommunications"],["link","telecommunications"]],"members":["link","upstream","hop","downstream","node"],"related":["Telecommunications","Data_link","Uplink","Downlink","Fiber_optic","Computer_networking","Data_link","Communication_satellite","Computer_networks","Packet","Point-to-point_(telecommunications)","Node_(networking)","Ethernet","Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","Frame_Relay","X.25","Internet_Protocol","Point-to-multipoint_communication_(telecommunications)","Public_switched_telephone_network","Earth_terminal","Satellite","Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications","Mobile_station","Base_transceiver_station","Base_Station_Subsystem","Network_and_Switching_Subsystem","Data_communications_equipment","Network_core","Upstream_(networking)","Base_station_subsystem","Network_switching_subsystem","Data_terminal_equipment","Downstream_(networking)","Base_station","Communications_satellite","Uplink","Communication_satellite","Uplink","Downlink","Hop_(telecommunications)","Data_link","Data_transmission","Link_(telecommunications)","Telecommunications_network"]}
