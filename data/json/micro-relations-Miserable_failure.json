Two of the first were the \"miserable failure\" Google bomb linked to\n George W. Bush's White House biography and the \"waffles\" Google bomb linked to\n John Kerry's website. Supporters and detractors of the candidates were able to\n manipulate search engine rankings so that searches for \"miserable failure\" and\n \"waffles\" returned links to the targets' sites.

[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/01/quick-word-\nabout-googlebombs.html Google Webmaster Central Blog: A quick word about\nGooglebombs]\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama's official White House web site also appeared on\nthe first few results for \"miserable failure\" on Live Search and Yahoo, and on\nthe first page of results for the word \"failure\" on Google. The cause of this is\ndisputed, with some claiming it to be the result of a similar\ncampaign. Others believe it to be a result of URL redirection\n from the old White House site (under President Bush) to the site for\nPresident Barack Obama. Because the HTTP301 redirect indicates that the old page\nis permanently replaced by the new one, it also inherits all links to it and\ntherefore the ranking for the same keywords. http://searchengineland.com/bush-fix-your-miserable-failure-\nlegacy-16036\n","linknr":184,"url":"Miserable_failure","recorded":1362485827,"links":12,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English phrases","Google","Internet memes"],"headings":["First political Google bomb of George W.
