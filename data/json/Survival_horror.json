{"cursor":"49768","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Survival horror' is a subgenre of action-adventure video games inspired by\nhorror fiction. Although combat can be a part of the gameplay, the player is\nmade to feel less powerful than in typical action games, because of limited\nammunition, health, speed, or other limitations. The player is also challenged\nto find items that unlock the path to new areas, and solve puzzles at certain\nlocations. Games make use of strong horror themes, and the player is often\nchallenged to navigate dark maze-like environments, and react to unexpected\nattacks from enemies.\n\nThe term \"survival horror\" was first used for the original Japanese release of\n[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]] in 1996, which was influenced by\nearlier games with a horror theme such as 1989's [[Sweet Home (video game)|Sweet\nHome]]. The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay, and\nhas been retroactively applied to games as old as [[Haunted House (video\ngame)|Haunted House]] from 1982. Starting with the release of [[Resident Evil\n4]] in 2005, the genre began to incorporate more features from action games,\nwhich has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror\nfranchises have abandoned the genre. Still, the survival horror genre has\npersisted in one form or another, though with [[Resident Evil 6]], Capcom has\ncalled this departure \"dramatic horror.\"\n","linknr":1107,"url":"Survival_horror","recorded":1362539568,"links":49,"instances":["video_games","company","video_games","video_games","fiction","game_developer","computer_graphics","video_games","series"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Action-adventure
