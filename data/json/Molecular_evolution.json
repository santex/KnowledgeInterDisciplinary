Molecular evolution emerged as a scientific field in the\n1960s as researchers from molecular biology, evolutionary biology and population\ngenetics sought to understand recent discoveries on the structure and function\nof nucleic acids and protein. Some of the key topics that spurred development of\nthe field have been the evolution of enzyme function, the use of nucleic acid\ndivergence as a \"molecular clock\" to study species divergence, and the origin of\nnoncoding DNA.\n\nRecent advances in genomics, including whole-genome sequencing, high-throughput\nprotein characterization, and bioinformatics have led to a dramatic increase in\nstudies on the topic. In the 2000s, some of the active topics have been the role\nof gene duplication in the emergence of novel gene function, the extent of\nadaptive molecular evolution versus neutral processes of mutation and drift, and\nthe identification of molecular changes responsible for various human\ncharacteristics especially those pertaining to infection, disease, and\ncognition.\n","linknr":487,"url":"Molecular_evolution","recorded":1362483007,"links":37,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www2.hawaii.edu/~khayes/Journal_Club/fall2006/Kimura_1968_Nature.pdf","http://www2.hawaii.edu/~khayes/Journal_Club/fall2006/Kimura_1968_Nature.pdf","http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/king.pdf","http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/king.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular evolution|"],"headings":["Principles of molecular evolution","The driving forces of evolution","History of the science","Genome evolution","Origins of new genes","Related fields","Key researchers in molecular evolution","Journals and societies","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["virus","biology"]],"members":["virus","cell"],"related":["DNA","RNA","Protein","Molecular_biology","Evolutionary_biology","Population_genetics","Molecular_clock","Noncoding_DNA","Bioinformatics","Gene_duplication","Infection","Disease","Cognition","Genetic_material","DNA","RNA","Cell_(biology)","Cell_division","Radiation","Virus_(biology)","Meiosis","Hypermutation","Evolution","Natural_selection","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Punctuated_equilibrium","Allele","Gene","Genetic_drift","Gene_flow","Selection","Natural_selection","Sexual_selection","Systematics","Molecular_genetics","DNA","RNA","Scientific_classification","Taxonomy","Evolutionary_biology","DNA_sequencing","Nucleotide","Genome","Chromosome","Base_pair","Adaptationism","Motoo_Kimura","Jack_L._King","Thomas_H._Jukes","Neodarwinism","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Natural_selection","Genetic_drift","Molecular_biology","Protein_sequencing","Molecular_clock","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Panselectionism","Natural_selection","Ribosomal_RNA","History_of_life","Emile_Zuckerkandl","Emanuel_Margoliash","Linus_Pauling","Walter_M._Fitch","Charles_Sibley","Bird","Herbert_C._Dessauer","Herpetology","Morris_Goodman","Primate","Allan_Wilson","Robert_K._Selander","John_C._Avise","Protein_electrophoresis","Bird","DNA-DNA_hybridization","Genome","Gene","Polyploidy","Comparative_genomics","Molecular_systematics","Biological_classification","Genomics","Motoo_Kimura","Masatoshi_Nei","Walter_M._Fitch","Walter_Gilbert","Joe_Felsenstein","Susumu_Ohno","John_H._Gillespie","Dan_Graur","Wen-Hsiung_Li","Genetics","Molecular_biology","Genomics","Systematics","Evolutionary_biology","History_of_molecular_evolution","Abiogenesis","Evolution","Genetic_drift","E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment","Evolutionary_physiology","Genomic_organization","Heterotachy","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Human_evolution","Evolution_of_dietary_antioxidants","Molecular_clock","Comparative_phylogenetics","Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Nucleotide_diversity","Parsimony","Population_genetics","Selection"]}
