Typical uses of GC include testing the purity\nof a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture\n(the relative amounts of such components can also be determined). In some\nsituations, GC may help in identifying a compound. In preparative\nchromatography, GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture.\n\nIn gas chromatography, the mobile phase (or \"moving phase\") is a carrier gas,\nusually an inert gas such as helium or an unreactive gas such as nitrogen. The\nstationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer on an inert solid\nsupport, inside a piece of glass or metal tubing called a column (a homage to\nthe fractionating column used in distillation). The instrument used to perform\ngas chromatography is called a gas chromatograph (or \"aerograph\", \"gas\nseparator\").\n\nThe gaseous compounds being analyzed interact with the walls of the column,\nwhich is coated with a stationary phase. This causes each compound to elute at a\ndifferent time, known as the retention time of the compound. The comparison of\nretention times is what gives GC its analytical usefulness.\n\nGas chromatography is in principle similar to column chromatography (as well as\nother forms of chromatography, such as HPLC, TLC), but has several notable\ndifferences. Firstly, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is\ncarried out between a liquid stationary phase and a gas mobile phase, whereas in\ncolumn chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the mobile phase is a\nliquid. (Hence the full name of the procedure is \"Gasâliquid chromatography\",\nreferring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively.) Secondly, the\ncolumn through which the gas phase passes is located in an oven where the\ntemperature of the gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography\n(typically) has no such temperature control. Thirdly, the concentration of a\ncompound in the gas phase is solely a function of the vapor pressure of the\ngas.\n\nGas chromatography is also similar to fractional distillation, since both\nprocesses separate the components of a mixture primarily based on boiling point\n(or vapor pressure) differences. However, fractional distillation is typically\nused to separate components of a mixture on a large scale, whereas GC can be\nused on a much smaller scale (i.e. microscale).\n\nGas chromatography is also sometimes known as 'vapor-phase chromatography'\n(VPC), or 'gasâliquid partition chromatography' (GLPC). These alternative names,\nas well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently used in scientific\nliterature. Strictly speaking, GLPC is the most correct terminology, and is thus\npreferred by many authors.\n","linknr":407,"url":"Gas-liquid_chromatography","recorded":1362901435,"links":42,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","mathematics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gas chromatography|","Chromatography","Laboratory techniques","Scientific techniques","Separation processes","Measuring instruments"],"headings":["History","GC analysis","Physical components","Methods","Data reduction and analysis","Application","GCs in popular culture","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Gaschromatograph.jpg/220px-Gaschromatograph.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gas_chromatograph.png/350px-Gas_chromatograph.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/GeoStrataEclipse.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/GCruleof10.jpg/350px-GCruleof10.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/GC_Oven_inside.jpg/300px-GC_Oven_inside.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"],["reactivity","chemistry"],["function","mathematics"],["stationary_phase","chemistry"]],"members":["volatility","stationary_phase","function","reactivity"],"related":["Chromatography","Organic_compound","Inorganic_compound","Volatility_(chemistry)","Agilent","Bruker","HTA","PerkinElmer","Shimadzu","Thermo_Fisher_Scientific","LECO_Corporation","Vernier_Software_&_Technology","Thin_layer_chromatography","High_performance_liquid_chromatography","Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","Chromatography","Analytical_chemistry","Separation_process","Vaporized","Chemical_decomposition","Preparative_chromatography","Gas","Inert","Helium","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Nitrogen","Liquid","Polymer","Solid","Glass","Metal","Fractionating_column","Elution","Column_chromatography","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Thin_layer_chromatography","Function_(mathematics)","Vapor_pressure","Fractional_distillation","Boiling_point","Chromatography","Mikhail_Semenovich_Tswett","Germany","Fritz_Prior","Archer_John_Porter_Martin","Nobel_Prize","Erika_Cremer","Stationary_phase_(chemistry)","Analyte","Syringe","Adsorption","Molecule","Adsorption","Solid_phase_microextraction","Volatilization","Flame_ionization_detector","Thermal_conductivity_detector","Catalytic_combustion","Discharge_ionization_detector","Beta_particle","Helium_ionization_detector","Nitrogen–phosphorus_detector","Infrared_detector","Mass_spectrometer","Photo-ionization_detector","Pulsed_discharge_ionization_detector","Mass_spectrometer","GC-MS","GC-MS","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy","GC-MS-NMR","GC-MS-NMR","Infrared_spectroscopy","Helium","Nitrogen","Argon","Hydrogen","Air","Discharge_ionization_detector","Chemical_polarity","Chemical_polarity","Functional_groups","Analyte","Mass_spectrometry","Calibration_curve","Response_factor","Internal_standard","External_standard","GC-MS","Chromatography_software","Mass_spectrometry","Salt","Ion","Reference_standard","Picomole","Parts_per_notation","Lavender","Ethylene","Thermal_conductivity_detector","Hydrocarbon","Flame_ionization_detector","Gasoline","Chevron_Corporation","Statistical_significance","GC-MS","Mass_spectrometer","Push-button","Analytical_chemistry","Chromatography","Gas_chromatography–mass_spectrometry","Inverse_gas_chromatography","Standard_addition","Thin_layer_chromatography","Unresolved_complex_mixture"]}
