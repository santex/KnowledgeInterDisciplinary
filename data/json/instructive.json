It is a comparatively rarely used case, though\nit is found in some commonly used expressions, such as omin silmin → \"with one's\nown eyes\".\n\nIn modern Finnish, many of its instrumental uses are being superseded by the\nadessive case, as in \"minä matkustin junalla\" → \"I travelled by train.\"\n\nIt is also used with Finnish verbal second infinitives to mean \"by ...ing\", e.g.\n\"lentäen\" → \"by flying\", \"by air\" (\"lentää\" = \"to fly\").\n\nIn Turkish, the suffix -le is used for this purpose. Ex: Trenle geldim \"I came\nvia train\".\n","title":"Instructive%20case","headings":[]},"micro-relation":["1: Finnish_language","1: Estonian_language","1: Declension","1: Instrumental_case","1: Adessive_case","1: Infinitive","1: Turkish_language"]}
