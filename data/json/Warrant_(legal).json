{"cursor":"4539","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nMost often, the term 'warrant' refers to a specific type of authorization; a\nwrit issued by a competent officer, usually a judge or magistrate, which permits\nan otherwise illegal act that would violate individual rights and affords the\nperson executing the writ protection from damages if the act is performed.\n\nA warrant is usually issued by a court and is directed to a sheriff, constable\nor a police officer. Warrants normally issued by a court include search\nwarrants, arrest warrants, and execution warrants. A typical arrest warrant in\nthe United States will take the approximate form of: \"This Court orders the\nSheriff or Constable to find the named person, wherever he may be found, and\ndeliver said person to the custody of the Court.\"\n\nWarrants are also issued by other government entities, particularly\nlegislatures, since most have the power to compel the attendance of their\nmembers. This is called a call of the house.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, senior public appointments are made by warrant under the\n[[Royal sign-manual]], the personal signature of the monarch, on the\nrecommendation of the government. In an interesting survival from medieval\ntimes, these warrants abate (lose their force) on the death of the sovereign if\nthey have not already been executed. This particularly applied to death warrants\nin the days when England authorized capital punishment. Perhaps the most\ncelebrated example of this occurred on 17 November 1558 when several Protestant\nheretics were tied to their stakes in Smithfield, and the firewood bundles were\nabout to be lit when a royal messenger rode up to announce that Queen Mary had\ndied and that the warrants had lost their force. The first formal act of Mary's\nsuccessor, Elizabeth I, was to decline to re-issue the warrants, and the\nheretics were released a few weeks later.\n\nFor many years, the English government had used a \"general warrant\" to enforce\nits laws. These warrants were broad in nature and did not have specifics as to\nwhy they were issued or what the arrest was being made for. A general warrant\nplaced almost no limitations on the search or arresting authority of a soldier\nor sheriff. This concept had become a serious problem when those in power issued\ngeneral warrants to have their enemies arrested when no wrongdoing had been\ndone. During the mid-18th century, the English government outlawed all general\nwarrants. This study of the history of England made the American Founding\nFathers ensure that general warrants would be illegal in the United States as\nwell when the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1791.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Warrant_(legal)","recorded":1372152604,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Warrant_(law)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(legal)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Authorization","/wiki/Writ","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/Magistrate","/wiki/Individual_rights","/wiki/Damages","/wiki/Court","/wiki/Sheriff","/wiki/Constable","/wiki/Police","/wiki/Search_warrant","/wiki/Arrest_warrant","/wiki/Execution_warrant","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Sheriff","/wiki/Government","/wiki/Legislature","/wiki/Political_power","/wiki/Call_of_the_house","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Royal_sign-manual","/wiki/Signature","/wiki/British_monarchy","/wiki/England","/wiki/Capital_punishment","/wiki/Protestant","/wiki/Heresy","/wiki/Smithfield,_London","/wiki/Mary_I_of_England","/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Arrest_warrant","/wiki/Warrant_of_committal","/wiki/Warrant_of_delivery","/wiki/Warrant_of_execution","/wiki/Execution_warrant","/wiki/Warrant_of_possession","/wiki/Possessory_warrant","/wiki/Search_warrant","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Case_Concerning_the_Arrest_Warrant_of_11_April_2000_(Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_v._Belgium)","/wiki/Warrant_canary","/wiki/Quo_warranto","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit&section=3","http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/browseresults.aspx?geotype=London&categorydocids=89","/wiki/London_Gazette","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&oldid=541334611","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Law_enforcement_terminology","/wiki/Category:Warrants","/wiki/Category:Writs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_August_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Warrant+%28law%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Warrant+%28law%29","/wiki/Warrant_(law)","/wiki/Talk:Warrant_(law)","#","/wiki/Warrant_(law)","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Warrant_(law)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Warrant_(law)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&oldid=541334611","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Warrant_%28law%29&id=541334611","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Warrant+%28law%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Warrant+%28law%29&oldid=541334611&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Warrant_(law)&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resoluci%C3%B3_judicial","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resoluci%C3%B3n_judicial","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provvedimento_giurisdizionale","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwangbevel","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%A4%E7%8A%B6","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandado","//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2574873#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Us
