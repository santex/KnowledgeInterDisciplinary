It\nbegan operation in the United States in 1946. Weinstein,\nDavid (2004). The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American\nTelevision, p. 16. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. ISBN 1-59213-499-\n8. It was owned by DuMont Laboratories, a television equipment and set\nmanufacturer. The network was hindered by the prohibitive cost of broadcasting,\nby Federal Communications Commission regulations which restricted the company's\ngrowth, and even by the company's partner, Paramount Pictures. Despite several\ninnovations in broadcasting and the creation of one of television's biggest\nstars of the 1950s, the network never found itself on solid financial ground.\nForced to expand on UHF channels during an era when UHF was not profitable,\nDuMont ceased broadcasting in 1956.\n\nDuMont's latter-day obscurity has prompted at least one notable TV historian to\nrefer to it as the \"Forgotten Network\".
