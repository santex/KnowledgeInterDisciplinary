{"cursor":"28281","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'solvent' (from the Latin [[wikt:solvo#Latin|solvÅ]], \"I loosen, untie, I\nsolve\") is a substance that dissolves a solute (a chemically different liquid,\nsolid or gas), resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but can\nalso be a solid or a gas. The maximum quantity of solute that can dissolve in a\nspecific volume of solvent varies with temperature. Common uses for organic\nsolvents are in dry cleaning (e.g., tetrachloroethylene), as paint thinners\n(e.g., toluene, turpentine), as nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone,\nmethyl acetate, ethyl acetate), in spot removers (e.g., hexane, petrol ether),\nin detergents (citrus terpenes), in perfumes (ethanol), nail polish and in\nchemical synthesis. The use of inorganic solvents (other than water) is\ntypically limited to research chemistry and some technological processes.\n\nThe global solvent market is expected to earn revenues of about US$33 billion in\n2019. The dynamic economic development in emerging markets like China, India,\nBrazil, or Russia will especially continue to boost demand for solvents.\nSpecialists expect the worldwide solvent consumption to increase at an average\nannual rate of 2.5% over the next years. Accordingly, the growth rate seen\nduring the past eight years will be surpassed. [http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-\nstudies/chemicals/solvents Market Study on Solvents].
