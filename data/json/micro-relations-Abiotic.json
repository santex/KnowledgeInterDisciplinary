{"cursor":"2135","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In ecology and biology, 'abiotic components' (also called 'abiotic factors') are\nnon-living chemical and physical factors in the environment, which affect\necosystems. Abiotic phenomena underlie all of biology.\n\nIn biology, abiotic factors can be classified as light or more generally\nradiation, temperature, water, atmospheric gases, or soil. The macroscopic\nclimate often influences each of the above. Pressure and sound waves may also be\nconsidered in the context of marine or sub-terrestrial environments.\n\nAll of these factors affect different organisms to different extents. If there\nis little or no sunlight then plants may wither and die from not being able to\nget enough sunlight to do photosynthesis. Many archaebacteria require very high\ntemperatures, or pressures, or unusual concentrations of chemical substances\nsuch as sulfur, because of their specialization into extreme conditions. Certain\nfungi have evolved to survive mostly at the temperature, the humidity, and\nstability of their environment.\n\nFor example, there is a significant difference in access to water as well as\nhumidity between temperate rainforests and deserts. This difference in water\naccess causes a diversity in the types of plants and animals that grow in these\nareas. A rock is an example of an Abiotic component.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Abiotic","recorded":1362483344,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Environmental science"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ecology","Biology","Chemical","Physical_property","Natural_environment","Ecosystem","Light","Radiation","Temperature","Humidity","Atmosphere","Soil","Climate","Pressure","Sound_waves","Organism","Archaebacteria","Temperate_rainforest","Desert"]}
