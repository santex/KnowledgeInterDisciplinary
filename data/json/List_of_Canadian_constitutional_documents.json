{"cursor":"30005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe '[[Constitution of Canada]]' is a large number of documents that have been\nentrenched in the constitution by various means. Regardless of how documents\nbecame entrenched, together those documents form the supreme law of Canada; no\nnon-constitutional law may conflict with them, and none of them may be changed\nwithout following the amending formula given in Part V of the Constitution\nAct, 1982.\n\nThe constitution includes legislation that was specifically written as\nconstitutional documents, statutes that have become entrenched since their\noriginal creation, some ancient treaties and royal proclamations, unwritten\nprocedures adopted from the British parliamentary system of government, and\nunwritten underlying values.\n\nThe oldest Canadian constitutional documents were enacted before Confederation,\nand originated from the English or British government. Those documents were\nreceived—along with many subconstitutional laws—into the law of\nCanada and its provinces by means of section 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867\n(then called the British North America Act, 1867). Between Confederation in 1867\nand patriation in 1982, the United Kingdom enacted some Canadian constitutional\ndocuments by means of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and the Statute of\nWestminster, 1931, most notably the British North America Acts. During this\ntime, Canada also passed a small number of constitutional documents for itself.\nAfter patriation, all new constitutional documents were passed by the Parliament\nof Canada and the Legislatures of its provinces.\n\nAfter patriation, there are five general methods of constitutional entrenchment:\n#specific mention as a constitutional document in section 52(2) of the\nConstitution Act, 1982; #amendments to constitutional documents using the\namending formula in Part V the Constitution Act, 1982; #constitutional\nentrenchment of a statutory document because its subject matter concerns a topic\nthat can only be changed by the amending formula in Part V the Constitution Act,\n1982; #reference by an entrenched document; or #ruling by a court that a\npractice is part of Canada's unwritten constitution.\n\nThe list of documents for the first two methods is well-established. For the\nnext three, however, there is debate about which documents, or which parts of\nthose documents, are included in the constitution. In some cases, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada has made definitive rulings regarding whether a given documents\nforms part of the constitution, but in many cases the question is still unclear.\n","linknr":333,"url":"List_of_Canadian_constitutional_documents","recorded":1375065337,"links":["/w/index.php?title=List_of_Canadian_constitutional_documents&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Canadian_constitutional_documents&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Constitution_of_Canada","/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Arms_of_Canada.svg/75px-Arms_of_Canada.svg.png","/wiki/Constitutional_history_of_Canada","/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701","/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)","/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763","/wiki/Quebec_Act","/wiki/Constitutional_Act_of_1791","/wiki/Act_of_Union_(1840)","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867","/wiki/British_North_America_Acts","/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931","/wiki/Succession_to_the_Throne_Act_1937","/wiki/Letters_Patent,_1947","/wiki/Canada_Act_1982","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982","/wiki/Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada","/wiki/Unsuccessful_attempts_to_amend_the_Canadian_Constitution","/wiki/Canadian_constitutional_law","/wiki/Constitutional_debate_in_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms","/wiki/Canadian_federalism","/wiki/Law_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights","/wiki/Implied_Bill_of_Rights","/wiki/Canadian_Human_Rights_Act","/wiki/Portal:Canadian_politics","/wiki/Template:Constitutional_history_of_Canada","/wiki/Template_talk:Constitutional_history_of_Canada","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Constitutional_history_of_Canada&action=edit","/wiki/Constitution_of_Canada","/wiki/Supreme_law","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982","/wiki/Statutes","/wiki/Royal_proclamation","/wiki/Parliamentary_system_of_government","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867","/wiki/Colonial_Laws_Validity_Act_1865","/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster,_1931","/wiki/British_North_America_Acts","/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada","/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982","/wiki/Unwritten_constitution","#List_of_documents","#Legislation_mentioned_in_.C2.A752.282.29","#Amendments_using_the_1982_amending_formula","#Statutes_concerning_subject_matter_of_the_1982_amending_formula","#Statutes_referenced_by_other_entrenched_documents","#Unwritten_constitutional_rules","#Repealed_constitutional_documents","#Repealed_before_1982","#Repealed_by_.C2.A752.282.29","#Repealed_after_1982","#References","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Canadian_constitutional_documents&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=List_of_Canadian_constitutional_documents&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/British_North_America_Acts","/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster,_1931","/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1867","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/British_North_America_Act,_1867","/wiki/Manitoba_Act,_1870","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Manitoba_Act,_1870","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rupert%27s_Land_and_North-Western_Territory_Order","/wiki/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Terms_of_Union","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1871","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island_Terms_of_Union","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada_Act,_1875","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Adjacent_Territories_Order","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1886","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Canada_(Ontario_Boundary)_Act_1889","/wiki/Alberta_Act","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Alberta_Act","/wiki/Alberta","/wiki/Saskatchewan_Act","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Act","/wiki/Saskatchewan","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1907","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1915","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1930","/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster,_1931","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster,_1931","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1940","/wiki/Newfoundland_Act","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Newfoundland_Act","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1960","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1964","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1965","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1974","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act_(No._1),_1975","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act_(No._2),_1975","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Canada_Act_1982","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_198
