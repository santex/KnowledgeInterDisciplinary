There\ncould be cytology exam of aspirate (cell specimen evaluation, FNAC) or\nhistological (biopsy - tissue specimen evaluation, FNAB). http://www.indepreviews.com/article/2011/vol-13-no-1/006-084-FINE-\nNEEDLE-ASPIRATION-CYTOLOGY-%28F-N-A-C%29.pdf Fine-needle aspiration\nbiopsies are very safe, minor surgical procedures. Often, a major surgical\n(excisional or open) biopsy can be avoided by performing a needle aspiration\nbiopsy instead. In 1981, the first fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the United\nStates was done at Maimonides Medical Center, eliminating the need for surgery\nand hospitalization. Today, this procedure is widely used in the diagnosis of\ncancer. http://www.maimonidesmed.org/Main/CultureofInnovation.aspx, First US\nProcedure\n\nA needle aspiration biopsy is safer and less traumatic than an open surgical\nbiopsy, and significant complications are usually rare, depending on the body\nsite. Common complications include bruising and soreness. There is a risk,\nbecause the biopsy is very small (only a few cells), that the problematic cells\nwill be missed, resulting in a false negative result. There is also a risk that\nthe cells taken will not enable a definitive diagnosis.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Needle_aspiration_biopsy","recorded":1362510681,"links":24,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.indepreviews.com/article/2011/vol-13-no-1/006-084-FINE-NEEDLE-ASPIRATION-CYTOLOGY-%28F-N-A-C%29.pdf","http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/needle.pdf"],"categories":["Biopsy","Breast surgery"],"headings":["Applications","Preparation","Procedure","Post-operative care and complications","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma_cytology.jpg/220px-Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma_cytology.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Needle_biopsy.jpg/220px-Needle_biopsy.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampling","medicine"]],"members":["sampling"],"related":["Micrograph","Salivary_gland","Adenoid_cystic_carcinoma","Pap_stain","Hypodermic_needle","Sampling_(medicine)","Microscope","Biopsy","Surgery","Maimonides_Medical_Center","Cytopathologist","Surgeon","Radiologist","X-ray","Ultrasound","Chorionic_villus_sampling","Royal_College_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynaecologists","Body_fluid_sampling","Aspirin","Ibuprofen","Naproxen","Clotting","Anticoagulant","Antibiotic","Prophylaxis","Pulse","Blood_pressure","Intravenous_line","Valium","Skin","Antiseptic","Fat_tissue","Muscle","Local_anesthetic","Palpation","Syringe","Infection","Antibiotics","Bleeding","Lung","Kidney","Sputum","Urine","Pneumothorax","Abdomen","Chest_tube","Liver_biopsy","Bile","Pancreatitis","Pancreas","National_Institutes_of_Health"]}
