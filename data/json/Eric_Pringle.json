{"cursor":"3443","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Eric Pringle' (born in Morpeth, Northumberland, England) is a British writer\nfor radio and television. He has also written three novels for children.\n\nHe was one of the writers of the 1972 television series [[Pretenders\n(television)|Pretenders]], and of the 1974 series [[The Carnforth Practice]].\n\nIn 1975, he was commissioned by then-[[Doctor Who]] script editor Robert Holmes\nto pen a two-part serial entitled The Angurth for the programme's thirteenth\nseason. This was eventually abandoned, but in 1981, Pringle was encouraged by\nhis agent, former Who producer Peter Bryant, to submit new material for the\nshow. Pringle delivered two proposals for four-part stories to the production\noffice in August, one called The Darkness (possibly featuring the Daleks) and\nanother entitled War Game. Script editor Eric Saward finally responded to\nPringle, and in 1982, Pringle was asked to put together a scene breakdown for\nWar Game. \n\nBy 1983, War Game had been rechristened [[The Awakening (Doctor Who)|The\nAwakening]] (and may also have been called Poltergeist at some point). Saward\nand producer John Nathan-Turner had also come to the realisation that the story\ndid not merit four episodes, and so Pringle was asked to condense it down to fit\nthe two-part slot for Season Twenty-One. Pringle concurred and performed the\nnecessary rewrites by April. Saward was still not satisfied with Pringle's\nmodifications; consequently, he elected to heavily rewrite The Awakening.\nPringle was not particularly pleased with Saward's rewrites, believing they made\nthe story confusing and rushed. The Awakening would be his only contribution to\nDoctor Who. \n\nMuch of Pringle's more recent work has been for the radio including an\nadaptations of [[The Wolves of Willoughby Chase]] and J. B. Priestley's [[The\nGood Companions]]. His 2001 BBC Radio 4 play Hymus Paradisi about the life of\ncomposer Herbert Howells won a Sony Award. That year also saw the publication of\nhis children's novel Big George. This has been followed by two sequels Big\nGeorge and the Seventh Knight and Big George and the Winter King. The Big George\nbooks are a retelling of the Saint George and the Dragon myth with a science\nfiction twist.
