Its advantages compared to more complex shapes arise because its\nperformance is not as affected by changes in the height of the roadbed\nduring repaving.\n\nThe Texas Constant-Slope Barrier is high and has a constant slope face that\nmakes an angle of 10.8 degrees with respect to the vertical. California has\ndeveloped a constant slope barrier with an angle of 9.1 degrees with respect to\nthe vertical. The Texas Constant-Slope barrier has performed similarly in crash\ntests to the Jersey barrier. The California design compared similarly to the F-\nShape barrier in crash tests.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Constant_slope_barrier","recorded":1362890057,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Road safety","Road transport"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Constant_Slope_Barrier.png/150px-Constant_Slope_Barrier.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Traffic_barrier","Jersey_barrier","F-Shape_barrier","Jersey_barrier"]}
