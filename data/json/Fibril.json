Cellulose, the most abundant organic compound on Earth,\nforms cable-like strings, known as fibrils in the tough walls that enclose plant\ncells. While cellulose is a compilation of glucose monomers, they form\nunbranched, long strands instead of coils like starch or glycogen. These are\narranged in parallel lines which form on top of each other in an intricate layer\nthrough hydrogen bonding.\n\nInsect flight muscle is said to be fibrillar, in that it contracts in response\nto being stretched by antagonistic muscle, so as to allow very rapid (up to 1000\nHz) contraction.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Fibril","recorded":1362889671,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fibers"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fiber","Myofibril","Neurofibril","The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language","Nanometer","Cytoplasmic","Protoplasm","Spirochetal","Species","Polysaccharides","Monosaccharides","Cellulose","Plant_cell","Glucose","Monomer","Starch","Glycogen","Parallel_line","Hydrogen_bond","Insect","Flight","Muscle","Hertz","Fibre","Microfibril","Myofibril","Neurofibril","Fibrillogenesis","Protein_filament"]}
