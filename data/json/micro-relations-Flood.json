The European Union (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering\nby water of land not normally covered by water.

In the sense of \"flowing water\", the word may also be applied to the\ninflow of the tide. Flooding may result from the volume of water within a body\nof water, such as a river or lake, which overflows or breaks levees, with the\nresult that some of the water escapes its usual boundaries, Glossary of\nMeteorology (June 2000).\n[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=flood1 Flood.] Retrieved\non 2009-01-09. or may be due to accumulation of rainwater on saturated\nground in an areal flood.\n\nWhile the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes\nin precipitation and snow melt, it is unlikely to be considered significant\nunless it floods property or drowns domestic animals.\n\nFloods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the\nriver channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often\ncause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of\nrivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers\nand other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers\nbecause the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy\ntravel and access to commerce and industry.\n\nSome floods develop slowly, while others such as flash floods, can develop in\njust a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can\nbe local, impacting a neighbourhood or community, or very large, affecting\nentire river basins.\n","linknr":648,"url":"Flood","recorded":1362371970,"links":129,"instances":["water","hydrology_software","huang_he_flood","satellite","1975","meteorology","soil","huang_he_flood"],"pdf":["http://www.apfm.info/pdf/ifm_environmental_aspects.pdf","http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/volltexte/2009/7515/pdf/2008_Wantzen_etal_An_extension_of_the_floodpulse.pdf"],"categories":["Basic
