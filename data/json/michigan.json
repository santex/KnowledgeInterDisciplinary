The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa,\nmeaning \"large water\" or \"large lake\".<ref name=\"MiB-pdf\"></ref><ref group=lower-\nalpha></ref> Michigan is the 9th most populous of the 50 United States, with\nthe 11th most extensive total area. Its capital is Lansing, and the largest\ncity is Detroit. Michigan was admitted into the Union on January 26, 1837, as\nthe 26th state.\n\nMichigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in\nthe world, being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint\nClair.<ref name=\"NOAA-CRM\"></ref> Michigan is one of the leading U.S. states for\nrecreational boating.<ref></ref> The state has 64,980 inland lakes and\nponds.<ref></ref> A person in the state is never more than from a natural water\nsource or more than from a Great Lakes shoreline.<ref></ref> It is the largest\nstate by total area east of the Mississippi River.<ref group=lower-alpha>I.e.,\nincluding water that is part of state territory. Georgia is the largest state by\nland area east of the Mississippi.</ref>\n\nMichigan is the only state to consist of two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula, to\nwhich the name Michigan was originally applied, is often noted to be shaped like\na mitten. The Upper Peninsula (often referred to as \"the U.P.\") is separated\nfrom the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a channel that joins Lake\nHuron to Lake Michigan. The two peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge.\nWhile sparsely populated, the Upper Peninsula is economically important due to\nits status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of natural\nresources.\n","title":"michigan","headings":["History","Government","Geography","Demographics","Economy","Transportation","Important cities, townships, and metropolitan
