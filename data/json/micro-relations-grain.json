Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and\nprovide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop; they are\ntherefore staple crops.\n\nIn their natural form (as in [[whole grain]]), they are a rich source of\nvitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, oils, and protein. However, when\nrefined by the removal of the bran and germ, the remaining endosperm is mostly\ncarbohydrate and lacks the majority of the other nutrients. In some developing\nnations, grain in the form of rice, wheat, millet, or maize constitutes a\nmajority of daily sustenance. In developed nations, cereal consumption is\nmoderate and varied but still substantial.\n\nThe word cereal derives from [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the name of the\nRoman goddess of harvest and agriculture.\n","linknr":598,"url":"grain","recorded":1362564741,"links":106,"instances":["grain","food","grain","grains","biology","legume"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cereals|","Crops"],"headings":["History","Production","Farming","Nutritional facts","Standardization","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Various_grains_edit2.jpg/250px-Various_grains_edit2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/040719_172_dorset_marnhull.jpg/220px-040719_172_dorset_marnhull.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/3-piantagione%2CTaccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg/180px-3-piantagione%2CTaccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Foods.jpg/19px-Foods.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["groat","grain"],["farina","food"],["cradle","grain"],["post-harvest_losses","grains"],["pulse","legume"]],"members":["groat","farina","cradle","hybrid","pulse"],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Monocots","Commelinids","Poales","Poaceae","Poaceae","Monocotyledon","Poaceae","Buckwheat","Food_grain","Fruit","Caryopsis","Endosperm","Cereal_germ","Bran","Staple_food","Vitamin","Mineral","Carbohydrate","Fat","Protein","Bran","Cereal_germ","Endosperm","Carbohydrate","Developing_nation","Rice","Wheat","Millet","Maize","Developed_nations","Domesticated","Fertile_Crescent","Emmer","Einkorn_wheat","Barley","Neolithic_founder_crops","Agriculture","FAO","Buckwheat","Quinoa","Million","Metric_ton","Maize","Livestock","Rice","Staple_food","India","Brazil","Korea","Japan","China","Wheat","Barley","Malt","Livestock","Commercial_sorghum","Millet","Oat","Triticale","Hybrid_(biology)","Rye","Rye","Buckwheat","Polygonaceae","Eurasia","Groat_(grain)","Fonio","Quinoa","Andes","FAO","Teff","Ethiopia","Injera","Farina_(food)","Wild_rice","Amaranth_grain","Aztec_Empire","Kañiwa","Quinoa","Spelt","Einkorn","Emmer","Fertile_Crescent","Durum","Tetraploid","Semolina","Kamut","Annual_plant","Subarctic","Siberia","Perennial","The_Land_Institute","Sorghum","Dormancy","Vernalization","Biological_life_cycle","Combine_harvester","Threshing","Winnowing","Scythe","Cradle_(grain)","Grain_elevator","Essential_amino_acid","Lysine","Legumes","Methionine","Food_grain","Dal","Rice","South_India","Bengali_people","Pakistan","North_India","Beans","Tofu","Peanut_butter","Crude_protein","International_Organization_of_Standardization","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Chillcuring","Food_price_crisis","Food_quality","Food_safety","Pescetarianism","Post-harvest_losses_(grains)","Pulse_(legume)","Push–pull_technology","Threshing","Winnowing","Zadoks_scale","Breakfast_cereal","Vegetarian_Society"]}
