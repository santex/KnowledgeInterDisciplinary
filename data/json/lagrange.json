On the recommendation of Euler and\nd'Alembert, in 1766 Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at\nthe Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he stayed for over twenty\nyears, producing a large body of work and winning several prizes of the French\nAcademy of Sciences. Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics (Mécanique\nAnalytique, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1888–89), written\nin Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment\nof classical mechanics since Newton and formed a basis for the development of\nmathematical physics in the nineteenth century.\n\nLagrange's parents were Italian, although his paternal great grandfather was\nFrench. In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to France and became a member\nof the French Academy. He remained in France until the end of his life.\nTherefore, Lagrange is alternatively considered a French and an Italian\nscientist. Lagrange survived the French Revolution and became the first\nprofessor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794.\nLagrange was appointed Senator in 1799, and Napoleon named him to the Legion of\nHonour in 1803 and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808.<ref name=laei/> He is\nburied in the Panthéon and his name appears as one of the 72 names inscribed on\nthe Eiffel Tower.\n","title":"Joseph-Louis%20Lagrange","headings":["Scientific contribution","Biography","Work in Berlin","Work in France","Prizes and distinctions","Incidental","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Turin","4: France","4: Leonhard_Euler","4: Lagrange_multipliers","3: Kingdom_of_Sardinia","3: Prussia","3: Italy","3: Ãcole_Polytechnique","3: Jean_le_Rond_d'Alembert","3: French_Academy_of_Sciences","3: Calculus_of_variations","3: W._W._Rouse_Ball","2: Paris","2: Piedmont","2: Joseph_Fourier","2: List_of_things_named_after_Joseph-Louis_Lagrange","2: Analytical_mechanics","2: Celestial_mechanics","2: Mathematical_analysis","2: Number_theory","2: Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences","2: Isaac_Newton","2: Napoleon","2: Legion_of_Honour","2: EulerâLagrange_equation","2: Differential_equation","2: Differential_calculus","2: Algebraic_equation","2: Lagrange's_four-square_theorem","2: Three-body_problem","2: Lagrangian_point","2: Lagrangian_mechanics","2: Principle_of_least_action","2: Libration","2: Astronomy","2: Continued_fraction","1: Greater_French_Empire","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_physics","1: Giovanni_Battista_Beccaria","1: Giovanni_Antonio_Amedeo_Plana","1: SimÃ©on_Denis_Poisson","1: Roman_Catholic","1: Agnostic","1: Italians","1: Mathematician","1: Astronomer","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Berlin","1: French_Revolution","1: Count","1: PanthÃ©on,_Paris","1: List_of_the_72_names_on_the_Eiffel_Tower","1: Method_of_variation_of_parameters","1: Probability_theory","1: Group_theory","1: Ãvariste_Galois","1: Calculus","1: Lagrange_interpolation","1: Taylor_series","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Edmund_Halley","1: Tautochrone","1: Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis","1: Turin_Academy_of_Sciences","1: Vibrating_string","1: Brook_Taylor","1: Recurrence_relation","1: Probability","1: Integral_calculus","1: Pierre_de_Fermat","1: Square_number","1: N-body_problem","1: Moon","1: Virtual_work","1: Frederick_the_Great","1: Saint_Petersburg","1: Louis_XVI_of_France","1: Spain","1: Naples","1: French_Institute","1: French_revolution","1: Bureau_des_Longitudes","1: Napoleon_I_of_France","1: SÃ©nat_conservateur","1: SÃ©natus-consulte","1: Ãcole_Normale_SupÃ©rieure","1: Order_of_the_Reunion","1: Infinite_series","1: Jupiter","1: Secular_equation","1: AcadÃ©mie_franÃ§aise","1: Algebra","1: Quadratic_form","1: Elimination_theory","1: Galois_theory","1: Functional_determinant","1: Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant","1: Volume","1: Tetrahedron","1: Absolute_value","1: Determinant","1: Pell's_equation","1: Bachet","1: Wilson's_theorem","1: List_of_important_publications_in_mathematics#Recherches_d'ArithmÃ©tique","1: Quadratic_forms","1: Analytical_geometry","1: Quadric","1: Canonical_form","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Colin_Maclaurin","1: Orbit","1: Comet","1: Orbital_elements","1: Urbain_Le_Verrier","1: Mechanics","1: William_Rowan_Hamilton","1: Pure_mathematics","1: Adrien-Marie_Legendre","1: Generality_of_algebra","1: John_Landen","1: Taylor's_theorem","1: Augustin_Louis_Cauchy","1: Carl_Gustav_Jakob_Jacobi","1: Karl_Weierstrass","1: Infinitesimal","1: Fermat's_little_theorem","1: Planetary_motion","1: Simeon_Poisson","1: Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh","1: Royal_Society","1: Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","1: Comte","1: Ordre_ImpÃ©rial_de_la_RÃ©union","1: Satellites_of_Jupiter","1: Eiffel_Tower","1: Lunar_crater","1: Public_domain","1: Ivor_Grattan-Guinness","1: Cambridge_University_Press"]}
