{"cursor":"47145","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Locus of control' is a theory in personality psychology referring to the extent\nto which individuals believe that they can control events that affect them.\nUnderstanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has\nsince become an aspect of personality studies. A person's \"locus\" (Latin for\n\"place\" or \"location\") is conceptualised as either internal (the person believes\nthey can control their life) or external (meaning they believe that their\ndecisions and life are controlled by environmental factors which they cannot\ninfluence).\n\nIndividuals with a high internal locus of control believe that events in their\nlife derive primarily from their own actions; for example, if a person with an\ninternal locus of control does not perform as well as they wanted to on a test,\nthey would blame it on lack of preparedness on their part. If they performed\nwell on a test, they would attribute this to ability to study. Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science\nof Behaviour - 4th Canadian ed.. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada. In\nthe test-performance example, if a person with a high external locus of control\ndoes poorly on a test, they might attribute this to the difficulty of the test\nquestions. If they performed well on a test, they might think the teacher was\nlenient or that they were lucky.\n\n\nLocus of control has generated much research in a variety of areas in\npsychology. The construct is applicable to fields such as educational\npsychology, health psychology or clinical psychology. There will probably\ncontinue to be debate about whether specific or more global measures of locus of\ncontrol will prove to be more useful. Careful distinctions should also be made\nbetween locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future)\nand attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes),\nor between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy. The importance\nof locus of control as a topic in psychology is likely to remain quite central\nfor many years.\n\nLocus of control has also been included as one of four dimensions of core self-\nevaluations â one's fundamental appraisal of oneself â along with neuroticism,\nself-efficacy, and self-esteem.  In a follow-up study,\nJudge et al. (2002) argued the concepts of locus of control, neuroticism, self-\nefficacy and self-esteem measured the same, single factor.  The\nconcept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham\n(1997), and since has proven to have the ability to predict several work\noutcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. \n","linknr":405,"url":"Locus_of_control","recorded":1362477621,"links":34,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Veer-Pervan-Marketing-Letters.pdf","http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-Veer-Pervan-Marketing-Letters.pdf","http://mres.gmu.edu/readings/PSYC557/Rotter1990.pdf","http://mres.gmu.edu/readings/PSYC557/Rotter1990.pdf"],"categories":["Social psychology","Cognitive biases","Personal life","Motivation"],"headings":["{{anchor|History of concept}}History","{{anchor|Locus of control personality orientations}}Personality orientation","{{anchor|Scales to measure locus of control}}Measuring scales","{{anchor|Related area: attributional style}}Attributional style","{{anchor|Applications of locus of control theory}}Applications","Familial origins","{{anchor|Locus of control and age}}Age","{{anchor|Gender-based differences in locus of control}}Gender-based differences","{{anchor|Cross-cultural issues in locus of control}}Cross-cultural issues","Self-efficacy","Stress","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Personality_psychology","Julian_Rotter","Educational_psychology","Health_psychology","Clinical_psychology","Core_self-evaluations","Neuroticism","Self-efficacy","Self-esteem","Alfred_Adler","Ohio_State_University","William_James","Bernard_Weiner","Need_for_achievement","Clinical_depression","Orthogonality","Likert_scale","Health_psychology","Industrial_and_organizational_psychology","Social_desirability","Factor_analysis","Gratification","Cronbach's_alpha","Lyn_Yvonne_Abramson","Martin_Seligman","John_D._Teasdale","Attribution_theory","Fritz_Heider","Social_psychology","Bernard_Weiner","Health_psychology","Obesity","Diabetes_mellitus","Jogging","Breast_self-examination","Alcoholism","Smoking_cessation","Moderator_variable","Quality_of_life","HIV","Migraines","Diabetes","Kidney_disease","Epilepsy","Cassandra_B._Whyte","Industrial_and_organizational_psychology","Sports_psychology","Educational_psychology","Psychology_of_religion","Industrial_and_organizational_psychology","Socioeconomic_status","African_American","White_American","Cross-cultural_psychology","Albert_Bandura","Self-esteem","Aging","Explanatory_style","Fundamental_Attribution_Error","Industrial_Organizational_Psychology","Learned_helplessness","Optimism","Pessimism"]}
