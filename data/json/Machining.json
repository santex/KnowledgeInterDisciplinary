{"cursor":"18235","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Machining' is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut\ninto a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process.\nThe many processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are\ntoday collectively known as subtractive manufacturing, in distinction from\nprocesses of controlled material addition, which are known as additive\nmanufacturing.\n\nThe precise meaning of the term \"machining\" has evolved over the past two\ncenturies as technology has advanced. During the Machine Age, it referred to\n(what we today might call) the \"traditional\" machining processes, such as\nturning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing,\nreaming, and\ntapping. [http://www.efunda.com/processes/machining/machin_intro.cfm\nMachining: An Introduction] In these \"traditional\" or \"conventional\"\nmachining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill\npresses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to\nachieve a desired geometry. [http://www.americanmachinist.com/304/Issue/Art-\nicle/False/66356/Issue Additive Manufacturing Advances Another Step] Since\nthe advent of new technologies such as electrical discharge machining,\nelectrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and\nultrasonic machining, the retronym \"conventional machining\" can be used to\ndifferentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage,\nthe term \"machining\" without qualification usually implies the traditional\nmachining processes.\n\nMachining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also\nbe used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and\ncomposites. [http://www.mfg.mtu.edu/cyberman/machining.html Machining\nPage] A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A\nroom, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop.\nMachining can be a business, a hobby, or\nboth. [http://www.janellestudio.com/metal/ Machining and Metalworking at\nHome] Much of modern day machining is carried out by computer numerical\ncontrol (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and\noperation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Machining","recorded":1362551871,"links":44,"instances":["tool","metalwork","machining","manufacturing","tool","metalworking","machining","metal","metalworking"],"pdf":["http://www.wtec.org/additive/report/additive-report.pdf","http://www.vistatek.com/pdfs/Choosing-Between-Additive-and-Subtractive-Prototyping-manufacturing.pdf"],"categories":["Machining|"],"headings":["Machining operations","Overview of machining technology","Cutting conditions","Stages in metal cutting","Relationship of subtractive and additive techniques","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Mobile_Machine_Shop_US_Army_1943.jpg/220px-Mobile_Machine_Shop_US_Army_1943.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/US_Navy_081008-N-9610C-039_Hull_Technician_3rd_Class_Robert_Paasch%2C_from_Parkdale%2C_Ore.%2C_makes_a_shipboard_manhole_cover_in_the_engineering_department_machine_shop_aboard_the_Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier_USS_John_C._Stennis_%28C.jpg/220px-thumbnail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Metal_Cut_diag.svg/350px-Metal_Cut_diag.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Orbital-drilling.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/B1_machining.jpg/260px-B1_machining.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/4/ee4110825eada0db76e3d32868ab3d62.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/a/b/bab44c01cf596f8f7bee485a24171c7c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/8/e/78e5b690a2281690cf20f3ce49f2caab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/4/ec4e9dfbb8e117197c3d4727c19b1a62.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/f/a3fd7097926ade7405b7390b2e5ec4af.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["boring","manufacturing"],["milling","machining"],["broach","metalwork"],["planer","metalworking"],["lathe","tool"],["cutting_tool","machining"],["burnishing","metalworking"],["clamp","tool"],["burr","metal"],["boring","manufacturing"]],"members":["lathe","broach","milling","boring","clamp","burnishing","cutting_tool","burr","planer"],"related":["Subtractive_manufacturing","Additive_manufacturing","Machine_Age","Turning","Boring_(manufacturing)","Drilling","Milling_(machining)","Broach_(metalwork)","Sawing","Shaper","Planer_(metalworking)","Reamer","Tap_and_die","Machine_tool","Lathe_(tool)","Milling_machine","Drill_press","Cutting_tool_(machining)","Electrical_discharge_machining","Electrochemical_machining","Electron_beam_machining","Photochemical_machining","Ultrasonic_machining","Retronym","Manufacture","Metal","Wood","Plastic","Ceramic","Composite_material","Machinist","Business","Hobby","Numerical_control","USS_John_C._Stennis","Swarf","Burnishing_(metalworking)","Engineering_drawings","Blueprints","Grinding_machine","Woodworking","Electrical_discharge_machining","Laser_cutting","Water_jet_cutter","Clamp_(tool)","Cutting_tool","Burr_(metal)","Composite_material","Delamination","Turning","Drilling","Boring_(manufacturing)","Milling_machine","Cutting_speed","United_States_customary_units","Engineering_tolerance","Cutting_fluid","Additive_manufacturing","Retronym","Subtractive_manufacturing","Abrasive_flow_machining","Abrasive_jet_machining","Biomachining","Design_for_manufacturability_for_CNC_machining","Machinability","Machining_vibrations","Unimat","Tool_management"]}
