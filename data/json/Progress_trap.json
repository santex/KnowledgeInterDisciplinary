{"cursor":"7669","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'progress trap' is the condition human societies experience when, in pursuing\nprogress through human ingenuity, they inadvertently introduce problems they do\nnot have the resources or political will to solve, for fear of short-term losses\nin status, stability or quality of life. This prevents further progress and\nsometimes leads to collapse.\n\nThe term gained attention following the historian and novelist Ronald Wright's\n2004 book and Massey Lecture series [[A Short History of Progress]], in which he\nsketches world history so far as a succession of progress traps. Daniel B.\nO'Leary's book Escaping the Progress Trap appeared in 2006, born in 1990 as a\npresentation at Montreal's Concordia University entitled \"The Progress Trap -\nScience, Humanity and Environment\". With the documentary film version of\nWright's book \"Surviving Progress,\" backed by Martin Scorsese, the syndrome has\nachieved wider recognition.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Progress_trap","recorded":1362890215,"links":10,"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theories of history"],"headings":["Overview","Root causes","Art and the progress trap","See also","References","External links","Sources"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resilience","ecology"]],"members":["resilience"],"related":["Historian","Novelist","Ronald_Wright","Massey_Lecture","Daniel_B._O'Leary","Diminishing_returns","Overpopulation","Erosion","Greenhouse_gas","Stone_age","Agriculture","Technology","Medicine","Factory_farming","Weapon","Technology","Lateralization_of_brain_function","Desertification","Irrigation","Sumer","Seymour_Cray","Control_Data_Corporation","Roger_Bacon","Oil_consumption","Climate_change","Sustainable_development","Technocratic","Creativity","Escalation_of_commitment","Resilience_(ecology)","Societal_collapse","System_justification","Ronald_Wright","Joseph_Tainter","Larry_Laudan"]}
