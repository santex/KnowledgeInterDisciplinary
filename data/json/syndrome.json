In recent decades,\nthe term has been used outside medicine to refer to a combination of phenomena\nseen in association.\n\nSome syndromes, such as Down syndrome, have only one cause; others, such as\nParkinsonian syndrome, have multiple possible causes. In other cases, the cause\nof the syndrome is unknown.\n\nThe term syndrome derives from the Greek ÏÏÎ½Î´ÏÎ¿Î¼Î® (sundromÄ) and means\n\"concurrence of symptoms, concourse\", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/-\ntext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsundromh%2F ÏÏÎ½Î´ÏÎ¿Î¼Î®], Henry\nGeorge Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from ÏÏÎ½\n(syn), \"along with, together\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc-\n=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsu%2Fn ÏÏÎ½], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus + Î´ÏÏÎ¼Î¿Ï (dromos),\namongst others \"course\".
