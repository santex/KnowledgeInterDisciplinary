{"cursor":"5532","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'three-domain system' is a biological classification introduced by Carl\nWoese in 1977 that divides cellular life\nforms into '[[archaea]]', '[[bacteria]]', and '[[eukaryote]]' domains. In\nparticular, it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups,\noriginally called Eubacteria (now Bacteria) and Archaebacteria (now Archaea).\nWoese argued that, on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes, these two\ngroups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly\ndeveloped genetic machinery, often called a progenote. To reflect these primary\nlines of descent, he treated each as a domain, divided into several different\nkingdoms. Woese initially used the term \"kingdom\" to refer to the three primary\nphylogenic groupings now referred to as \"domains,\" until the latter term was\ncoined in 1990.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Three-domain_system","recorded":1362505027,"links":23,"instances":["biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific classification","Classification systems"],"headings":["Classification","Niches","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Phylogenetic_tree.svg/450px-Phylogenetic_tree.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["domain","kingdom","cell"],"related":["Biological_classification","Carl_Woese","Cell_(biology)","Domain_(biology)","Prokaryote","16S_ribosomal_RNA","Gene","Genetics","Progenote","Kingdom_(biology)","Six-kingdom_system","Prokaryotic","Archaea","Methanogens","Halophiles","Thermoacidophiles","Prokaryotic","Bacteria","Cyanobacteria","Spirochaete","Gram-negative","Firmicutes","Gram-positive","Eukaryotes","Fungi","Saccharomycotina","Basidiomycota","Kingdom_Plantae","Bryophyta","Magnoliophyta","Kingdom_Animalia","Arthropoda","Chordata","Kingdom_Protista","Paraphyletic","Rhodophyta","Chromalveolata","Organelle","Five-kingdom_system","Monera","Phylogenetic_tree","Taxonomy","Two-empire_system","Bacterial_phyla"]}
