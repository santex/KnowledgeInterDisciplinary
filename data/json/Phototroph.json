{"cursor":"4440","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Phototrophs' ([[Ancient Greek language|Gr]]: Ïá¿¶Ï, ÏÏÏÏÏ = light, ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ® =\nnourishment) are the organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy.\nThey use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic\nprocesses. It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily\nphotosynthetic. Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they\nanabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized\nstructurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g.\nin the form of starches, sugars and fats). All phototrophs either use electron\ntransport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electro-chemical\ngradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy\ncurrency for the cell.\n\nMost of the well-recognized phototrophs are autotrophs, also known as\nphotoautotrophs, and can fix carbon. They can be contrasted with chemotrophs\nthat obtain their energy by the oxidation of electron donors in their\nenvironments. Photoheterotrophs produce ATP through photophosphorylation but use\nenvironmentally obtained organic compounds to build structures and other bio-\nmolecules. {{Cite book| title=Biology| last1=Campbell|\nlast2=Reece| last3=Urry| last4=Cain| last5=Wasserman| last6=Minorsky|\nlast7=Jackson| first1=Neil A.| first2=Jane B.| first3=Lisa A.| first4=Michael\nL.| first5=Steven A.| first6=Peter V.| first7=Robert B.| edition=8th| isbn=978-0-8053-6844-\n4| page=564| year=2008}} Photoautotrophic organisms are sometimes referred\nto as 'holophytic'.\n\nIn an ecological context, phototrophs are often the food source for neighboring\nheterotrophic life. In terrestrial environments, plants are the predominant\nvariety, while aquatic environments include a range of phototrophic organisms\nsuch as algae (e.g., kelp), other protists (such as euglena), phytoplankton, and\nbacteria (such as cyanobacteria).\n\nOxygenic photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll for light-energy capture and\noxidize water, \"splitting\" it into molecular oxygen. In contrast, anoxygenic\nphotosynthetic bacteria have a substance called bacteriochlorophyll - which\nabsorbs predominantly at non-optical wavelengths - for light-energy capture,\nlive in aquatic environments, and will, using light, oxidize chemical substances\nsuch as hydrogen sulfide rather than water.\n\nCyanobacteria, which are prokaryotic organisms which carry out oxygenic\nphotosynthesis, occupy many environmental conditions, including fresh water,\nseas, soil, and lichen. Cyanobacteria carry out plant-like photosynthesis\nbecause the organelle in plants that carries out photosynthesis is actually\nderived from an endosymbiosis cyanobacteria.\n\nA photolithoautotroph is an autotrophic organism that uses light energy, and an\ninorganic electron donor (e.g., H 2O, H 2, H 2S),\nand CO 2 as its carbon source. Examples include plants.\n\nThe depth to which sunlight or artificial light can penetrate into water, so\nthat photosynthesis may occur, is known as the photic zone.\n","linknr":421,"url":"Phototroph","recorded":1362505866,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photosynthesis","Trophic ecology","Microbial growth and nutrition","Biology terminology"],"headings":["Flowchart","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Dead_tree_river.jpg/220px-Dead_tree_river.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Troph_flowchart.svg/400px-Troph_flowchart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organism","Energy","Light","Photosynthetic","Anabolism","Carbon_dioxide","Catabolism","Electron_transport_chain","ATP_synthase","Autotroph","Carbon_fixation","Chemotroph","Oxidation","Electron_donor","Adenosine_triphosphate","Photophosphorylation","Organic_compound","Ecology","Plant","Algae","Kelp","Protist","Euglena","Phytoplankton","Bacteria","Cyanobacteria","Chlorophyll","Oxygen-evolving_complex","Bacteriochlorophyll","Hydrogen_sulfide","Soil","Lichen","Chloroplast","Endosymbiosed","Autotrophic","Inorganic_compound","Electron_donor","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon","Photic_zone","Autotroph","Chemoautotroph","Heterotroph","Chemoheterotroph","Photoheterotroph","Primary_nutritional_groups","Prototroph"]}
