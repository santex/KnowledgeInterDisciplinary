Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcoholism, hepatitis B and\nhepatitis C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some\ncases are idiopathic (i.e., of unknown cause).\n\nAscites (fluid retention in the abdominal cavity) is the most common\ncomplication of cirrhosis, and is associated with a poor quality of life,\nincreased risk of infection, and a poor long-term outcome. Other potentially life-\nthreatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and\nbleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible, and\ntreatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In\nadvanced stages of cirrhosis the only option is a liver transplant.\n\nThe word \"cirrhosis\" derives from Greek ÎºÎ¹ÏÏÏÏ [kirrhÃ³s] meaning yellowish,\ntawny (the orange-yellow colour of the diseased liver) + Eng. med. suff. -osis.\nWhile the clinical entity was known before, it was RenÃ© Laennec who gave it the\nname \"cirrhosis\" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the\nstethoscope.\n","linknr":912,"url":"Cirrhosis","recorded":1362510818,"links":74,"instances":["test","medicine","biology","biology","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diseases of
