{"cursor":"1770","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'sherwan' or 'union council' in Pakistan is an elected local government body\nconsisting of 21 councillors, and headed by a nazim (which is equivalent to a\nmayor) and a naib nazim (deputy). Union councils are the fifth tier of\ngovernment in Pakistan and are often known as 'village councils' in rural areas,\nthe territory represented by a village council usually comprises a large village\nand surrounding areas, often including nearby small villages. The term \"union\ncouncil\" may be used for localities that are part of cities.\n\nHeaded by a union nazim, each union council has 13 elected members or\ncouncillors. In addition to four male and two female members elected directly,\nthere are two male and two female representatives of the labour, a minority\nmember, a union nazim and his deputy known as union naib nazim. Beside elected\nmembers, there are several government employees and functionaries in every union\ncouncil, who report to the secretary of the union council. The latter is a civil\nservant appointed by the state.\n\nThe territory of a union council or village council is usually part of a tehsil\n(a district subdivision). Less commonly, a union council may be part of a city\ndistrict.
