Glass bakeware is often made of\ntempered soda-lime glass.\n\nSoda-lime glass is prepared by melting the raw materials, such as sodium\ncarbonate (soda), lime, dolomite, silicon dioxide (silica), aluminium oxide\n(alumina), and small quantities of fining agents (e.g., sodium sulfate, sodium\nchloride) in a glass furnace at temperatures locally up to 1675 Â°C.

The temperature is only limited by\nthe quality of the furnace superstructure material and by the glass composition.\nRelatively inexpensive minerals such as trona, sand, and feldspar are usually\nused instead of pure chemicals. Green and brown bottles are obtained from raw\nmaterials containing iron oxide. The mix of raw materials is termed [[glass\ncontainer industry#Batch house|batch]].\n\nSoda-lime glass is divided technically into glass used for windows, called\n[[flat glass]], and glass for containers, called [[container glass]]. The two\ntypes differ in the application, production method (float process for windows,\nblowing and pressing for containers), and chemical composition. Float glass has\na higher magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than container glass, and a\nlower silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. \"High\ntemperature glass melt property database for process modeling\"; Eds.: Thomas P.\nSeward III and Terese Vascott; The American Ceramic Society, Westerville, Ohio,\n2005, ISBN 1-57498-225-7 From this follows the slightly higher quality of\ncontainer glass for chemical durability against water, which is required\nespecially for storage of beverages and food.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Soda-lime_glass","recorded":1362481686,"links":20,"instances":["optics","material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass compositions","Transparent materials"],"headings":["Typical compositions and properties","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Glass_milk_bottles.jpg/200px-Glass_milk_bottles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4f/Windownofloat.jpg/200px-Windownofloat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Soda_Lime.jpg/350px-Soda_Lime.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lime","material"],["iron(iii_oxide"],["dispersion","optics"]],"members":["dispersion","lime"],"related":["Jena","Germany","Float_glass","Glass","Cookware_and_bakeware","Toughened_glass","Sodium_carbonate","Lime_(material)","Dolomite","Silicon_dioxide","Aluminium_oxide","Sodium_sulfate","Sodium_chloride","Trona","Sand","Feldspar","Iron_oxide","Float_glass","Glassblowing","Magnesium_oxide","Sodium_oxide","Calcium_oxide","Aluminium_oxide","Chemical_durability","Calculation_of_glass_properties","Container_glass","Window","Silicon_dioxide","Sodium_oxide","Calcium_oxide","Aluminium_oxide","Potassium_oxide","Sulfur_trioxide","Magnesium_oxide","Iron(III)_oxide","Titanium_dioxide","Viscosity","Glass_transition_temperature","Glass_transition_temperature","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Density","Refractive_index","Dispersion_(optics)","Young's_modulus","Shear_modulus","Liquidus_temperature","Liquidus_temperature","Heat_capacity","Heat_capacity","Surface_tension","Chemical_durability","Critical_stress_intensity_factor","Critical_stress_intensity_factor","Coefficient_of_restitution","Thermal_conductivity","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Knoop_hardness_test","Glass","Glass_batch_calculation"]}
