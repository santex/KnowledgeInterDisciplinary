{"cursor":"7601","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" type and two geostationary satellites]]The 'Satellite Data System' ('SDS') is a\n system of United States military communications satellites. At least three\n generations have been used: 'SDS-1' from 1976 to 1987; 'SDS-2' from 1989 to\n 1996; 'SDS-3' from 1998 to the present. SDS satellites have a highly elliptical\n orbit, going from about 300 kilometers at perigee to roughly 39,000 km at\n apogee in order to allow communications with polar stations that cannot contact\n geosynchronous satellites. The high apogee meant that the polar regions were\n visible for long amounts of time, and only two satellites were required in\n order to achieve constant communications ability. In addition, two\n geostationary satellites appear to be part of the system. The SDS satellites\n were constructed by Hughes Aircraft.\n\nThe primary purpose of the SDS satellites is to relay imagery from low-flying\nreconnaissance satellites, notably the Keyhole optic reconnaissance and\nLacrosse/Onyx radar reconnaissance satellites to ground stations in the United\nStates.

Westview press, Boulder\n\n Each SDS-1 satellite had 12 channels available for ultra-high frequency\n communication. They were cylindrical in shape, roughly long. 980 watts of\n electrical power were available from solar panels and batteries. The SDS-1 had\n a mass of 1385 pounds (630 kilograms) and was launched on Titan-3B rockets. The\n SDS-1 satellites had similar orbits to the Air Force's Jumpseat ELINT\n satellites.

The solar arrays generate 1238 watts of power. It is\nbelieved that the Space Shuttle has been used to launch several satellites,\npossibly on missions STS-28, STS-38, and STS-53. Other launches have used\nthe Titan-4 rocket.\n\nQuasar is the rumored code name for the communications satellite.\n\n\n","linknr":211,"url":"Satellite_Data_System","recorded":1362557121,"links":14,"instances":["electricity","geometry","satellite","satellite","unit","rocket_family","mass","satellite","satellite"],"pdf":["http://www.zianet.com/jpage/black/NRO%20Brochure.pdf"],"categories":["Communications satellites","Hughes Aircraft Company"],"headings":["Satellites","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/SDS3_const.png/220px-SDS3_const.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/NRO_comm_satellite.PNG/220px-NRO_comm_satellite.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/USA179_SDS_3_4.jpg/220px-USA179_SDS_3_4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lacrosse","satellite"],["cylinder","geometry"],["battery","electricity"],["pound","mass"],["titan","rocket_family"],["jumpseat","satellite"],["foot","unit"],["prowler","satellite"],["magnum","satellite"]],"members":["battery","cylinder","lacrosse","magnum","foot","titan","pound","jumpseat","prowler"],"related":["United_States_military","Communications_satellite","Orbit","Perigee","Apogee","Geographical_pole","Geosynchronous","Hughes_Aircraft","Reconnaissance_satellites","Key_Hole","Lacrosse_(satellite)","UHF","Cylinder_(geometry)","Watt","Photovoltaic_module","Battery_(electricity)","Pound_(mass)","Kilogram","Titan_(rocket_family)","Jumpseat_(satellite)","ELINT","K_band","Foot_(unit)","Space_Shuttle_program","STS-28","STS-38","STS-53","International_Designator","List_of_NRO_Launches","Perigee","Apogee","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","OPS_7940","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","OPS_7310","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","OPS_5805","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","USA-4","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","USA-9","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","USA-21","Titan_IIIB","Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base","Vandenberg_AFB_Space_Launch_Complex_4","USA-40","STS-28","Orbus-21S","Kennedy_Space_Center","Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39","USA-67","STS-38","Orbus-21S","Kennedy_Space_Center","Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39","Prowler_(satellite)","Magnum_(satellite)","USA-89","STS-53","Orbus-21S","Kennedy_Space_Center","Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39","USA-125","Titan_IV","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_40","USA-137","Atlas_II","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Spaceport_Florida_Launch_Complex_36","USA-155","Atlas_II","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Spaceport_Florida_Launch_Complex_36","USA-162","Atlas_II","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Spaceport_Florida_Launch_Complex_36","USA-179","Atlas_II","USA-198","Atlas_V","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_41","USA-227","Delta_IV","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_37","USA-236","Atlas_V","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_41"]}
