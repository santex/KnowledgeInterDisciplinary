{"cursor":"45608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn poetry, 'metre' ('meter' in American English) is the basic rhythmic structure\nof a verse or lines in verse. Many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific\nverse metre, or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order. The\nstudy of metres and forms of versification is known as 'prosody'. (Within\nlinguistics, \"prosody\" is used in a more general sense that includes not only\npoetical metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose, whether formal or\ninformal, which vary from language to language, and sometimes between poetic\ntraditions.)\n","linknr":503,"url":"Meter_(poetry)","recorded":1362540022,"links":53,"instances":["metre","latin","linguistics","linguistics","poetry","metre","writer","poetry","poetry","prosody","music","foot","poetry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Poetic
