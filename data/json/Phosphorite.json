Phosphate rich sedimentary rocks can occur in dark brown\nto black beds, ranging from centimeter sized laminae to beds that are several\nmeteres in thickness. Although these thick beds can exist they are rarely only\ncomposed of phosphatic sedimentary rocks. Phosphatic sedimentary rocks are\ncommonly accompanied by or interbedded with shales, cherts, limestone, dolomites\nand sometimes sandstone. These layers contain the same\ntextures and structures as fine grained limestones and may represent diagenetic\nreplacements of carbonate minerals by phosphates. They also can\nbe composed of peloids, ooids, fossils, and clasts that are made up of apatite.\nThere are some phosphorites that are very small and have no distinctive granular\ntextures. This means that their textures are similar to that of collophane, or\nfine micrite-like texture. Phosphatic grains may be accompanied by organic\nmatter, clay minerals, silt sized detrial grains, and pyrite. Peloidal or\npelletal phosphorites occur normally; whereas oolitic phosphorites are not\ncommon.\n\nPhosphorites are known from Proterozoic banded iron formations in Australia, but\nare more common from Paleozoic and Cenozoic sediments. The Permian Phosphoria\nFormation of the western United States represents some 15 million years of\nsedimentation reaches a thickness of 420 metres and covers an area of\n350,000 km 2. Commercially mined phosphorites\noccur in France, Belgium, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. In the United\nStates phosphorites have been mined in Florida, Tennessee, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho\nand Kansas. Klein, Cornelis and Cornelius S.
