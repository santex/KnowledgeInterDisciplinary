{"cursor":"5762","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn stereochemistry, the 'specific rotation' of a chemical compound [Î±] is\ndefined as the observed angle of optical rotation Î± when plane-polarized light\nis passed through a sample with a path length of 1 decimeter and a sample\nconcentration of 1 gram per 1 millilitre. It is the main property used to\nquantify the chirality of a molecular species or a mineral. The specific\nrotation of a pure material is an intrinsic property of that material at a given\nwavelength and temperature. Values should always be accompanied by the\ntemperature at which the measurement was performed and the solvent in which the\nmaterial was dissolved. Often the temperature is not specified; in these cases\nit is assumed to be room temperature. The formal unit for specific rotation\nvalues is deg dm â1 cm 3 g â1 but scientific\nliterature uses just degrees. A negative value means\nlevorotatory rotation and a positive value means dextrorotatory rotation.\nDextrorotatory means that the plane of polarization is turned clockwise when the\nlight comes through the sample to the observer.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Specific_rotation","recorded":1362375140,"links":24,"instances":["angle","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties"],"headings":["Measurement","Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/b/c/2bcae22100d426c8e4eddd4e53bba023.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/6/f46625469036b8b4006491b01cbaee54.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/9/199b59c75a53c00cec02fb7064027fe1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/6/f46625469036b8b4006491b01cbaee54.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chirality","chemistry"],["degree","angle"]],"members":["degree","chirality"],"related":["Stereochemistry","Chemical_compound","Optical_rotation","Polarized_light","Decimetre","Gram","Millilitre","Chirality_(chemistry)","Degree_(angle)","Levorotatory","Dextrorotatory","Polarimeter","Optically_active_compound","Nanometer","Nanometer","Enantiomer","Racemic","Enantiomeric_excess","Gas_chromatography","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","2-Bromobutane","2-Bromobutane","Fructose","Glucose","Sucrose","Lactose","Camphor","Cholesterol","Paclitaxel","Penicillin_V","Cavicularin"]}
