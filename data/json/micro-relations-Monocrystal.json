{"cursor":"6816","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n crystal grown from a seed crystal in a supersaturated aqueous solution at LLNL\n which is to be cut into slices and used on the National Ignition Facility for\n frequency doubling and tripling.]]\n\nA 'single crystal' or 'monocrystalline' solid is a material in which the crystal\nlattice of the entire sample is continuous and unbroken to the edges of the\nsample, with no grain boundaries. The absence of the defects associated with\ngrain boundaries can give monocrystals unique properties, particularly\nmechanical, optical and electrical, which can also be anisotropic, depending on\nthe type of crystallographic structure. These properties, in addition to making\nthem precious in some gems, are industrially used in technological applications,\nespecially in optics and electronics.\n\nBecause entropic effects favor the presence of some imperfections in the\nmicrostructure of solids, such as impurities, inhomogeneous strain and\ncrystallographic defects such as dislocations, perfect single crystals of\nmeaningful size are exceedingly rare in nature, and are also difficult to\nproduce in the laboratory, though they can be made under controlled conditions.\nOn the other hand, imperfect single crystals can reach enormous sizes in nature:\nseveral mineral species such as beryl, gypsum and feldspars are known to have\nproduced crystals several metres across.\n\nThe opposite of a single crystal is an amorphous structure where the atomic\nposition is limited to short range order only. In between the two extremes exist\n[[polycrystalline]], which is made up of a number of smaller crystals known as\n[[crystallite]]s, and [[paracrystalline]] phases.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Monocrystal","recorded":1362482348,"links":39,"instances":["semiconductor","chemistry","metallurgy","chemistry","crystal","engineering_aspects"],"pdf":["http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kadem/Rolls%20Royce.pdf","http://acaschool.iit.edu/lectures04/JLiangXtal.pdf"],"categories":["Crystals","Semiconductor growth"],"headings":["Uses","Manufacture","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Snow_crystallization_in_Akureyri_2005-02-26_19-03-37.jpeg/200px-Snow_crystallization_in_Akureyri_2005-02-26_19-03-37.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/KDP_crystal.jpg/220px-KDP_crystal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Synthetic_quartz_crystal.jpg/220px-Synthetic_quartz_crystal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fabrication","semiconductor"],["boule","crystal"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["recrystallization","chemistry"],["crystallization","engineering_aspects"],["fractional_crystallization","chemistry"],["recrystallization","metallurgy"]],"members":["fabrication","fractional_crystallization","recrystallization","sublimation","boule","crystallization"],"related":["Seed_crystal","Supersaturated","LLNL","National_Ignition_Facility","Frequency_doubling","Solid","Crystal_lattice","Grain_boundaries","Anisotropic","Crystallography","Entropy","Impurity","Crystallographic_defect","Dislocation","Mineral","Beryl","Gypsum","Feldspar","Monocrystalline_silicon","Fabrication_(semiconductor)","Quantum_mechanics","Microprocessor","Field_effect_transistor","Hydrothermal_synthesis","Sapphire","Laser","Nonlinear_optics","Fluorite","Apochromat","Refractor","Condensed_Matter_Physics","Materials_science","Crystal_structure","Bragg_diffraction","Helium_atom_scattering","Superconductivity","Polycrystalline","Crystallisation","Boule_(crystal)","Czochralski_process","Bridgman_technique","Hydrothermal_synthesis","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Recrystallization_(chemistry)","Epitaxy","Crystallization_(engineering_aspects)","Fractional_crystallization_(chemistry)","Laser_Heated_Pedestal_Growth","Micro-Pulling-Down","Recrystallization_(metallurgy)","Seed_crystal","PDF","Illinois_Institute_of_Technology"]}
