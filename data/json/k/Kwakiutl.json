There are only about 700 living Kwakiutls.\nLike other Pacific Northwest tribes, they are known for the potlatch, a ritual\ngift-giving ceremony.\n\nAnthropologist Franz Boas used the name Kwakiutl to refer to an ethno-linguistic\ngroup of 28 tribes. It came from the name of the tribe that Boas did most of his\nwork with, the Kwagu'Å or Kwagyeulth, at Fort Rupert. The name was widely used\ninto the 1970s and remains current in languages other than English. However, it\nis now considered a misnomer by most of the peoples it is applied to; they\nprefer to be called the Kwakwaka'wakw, which means [[Kwak'wala]]-speaking-\npeoples. One exception is the Laich-kwil-tach at Campbell River; they are known\nas the Southern Kwakiutl, and the tribal council they are in is the Kwakiutl\nDistrict Council.\n\nThe Kwakiutls participated in dances in which people would wear masks and\ncostumes and tell ancient stories. {{cite\nweb|url=http://cjtm.icaap.org/content/19/v19art3.html|title=Cannibal Dances in\nthe Kwakiutl World - Canadian Journal for Traditional Music ||date= |accessdate=2013-01-\n05}}\n\nThe novel I Heard The Owl Call My Name by Margaret Craven focuses on a real\nSouthern Kwakiutl village, Kingcome, British Columbia.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Kwakiutl","recorded":1362480946,"links":25,"instances":["writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kwakwaka'wakw"],"headings":["Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Kwakiutl-Woman.jpg/86px-Kwakiutl-Woman.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Edward_Curtis_image_8.jpg/120px-Edward_Curtis_image_8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Kwakwaka%27wakw_figure_anagoria.JPG/35px-Kwakwaka%27wakw_figure_anagoria.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Wawadit%27la%28Mungo_Martin_House%29_a_Kwakwaka%27wakw_big_house.jpg/40px-Wawadit%27la%28Mungo_Martin_House%29_a_Kwakwaka%27wakw_big_house.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Flag_of_British_Columbia.svg/30px-Flag_of_British_Columbia.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["margaret_craven","writer"]],"members":["margaret_craven"],"related":["British_Columbia","Potlatch","Franz_Boas","Kwagu'ł","Fort_Rupert,_British_Columbia","Kwakwaka'wakw","Laich-kwil-tach","Kwakiutl_District_Council","Margaret_Craven_(writer)","Kingcome,_British_Columbia","'Nak'waxda'xw","Hamatsa","Edward_S._Curtis","British_Columbia"]}
