He lived and studied at the Gymnasium in NÄmeckÃ½ Brod (today\nHavlÃ­ÄkÅ¯v Brod), and his house on the main square is today the HavlÃ­Äek Museum.\nIn 1838 he moved to Prague to study philosophy at Charles University and,\ninfluenced by the revolutionary atmosphere before the 1848, decided on the\nobjective of becoming a patriotic writer. He devoted himself to studying Czech\nand literature. After graduating he began studying theology because he thought\nthe best way to serve the nation would be as a priest. He was expelled, however,\nafter one year for \"showing too little indication for spiritual ministry\".\n\nAfter failing to find a teacher's job in Bohemia, he left for Moscow becoming a\ntutor in a Russian teacher's family: he was recommended by Pavel Josef Å afaÅÃ­k.\nHe became a Russophile and a Pan-Slav, but after recognizing the true reality of\nthe Russian society he took the pessimistic view that \"Pan-Slavism is a great,\nattractive but feckless idea\". His memories on the Russian stay were published\nfirst in magazines and then as a book Obrazy z Rus (Pictures from Russia).\n\nAfter he returned to Bohemia in 1844, he used his writing skill to criticize the\npublic habit of embracing everything written in the recently reborn Czech\nlanguage. His attack was aimed specifically at a novel by Josef KajetÃ¡n Tyl.\nFrantiÅ¡ek PalackÃ½ helped HavlÃ­Äek get a job as Editor of the PraÅ¾skÃ© noviny\nnewspaper in 1846.\n\nIn April 1848 he changed the name of the newspaper to NÃ¡rodnÃ­ noviny (National\nNews). This paper became one of the first newspapers of the Revolutionary-era\nCzech liberals. He was concerned with the preparations of the Congress of the\nSlavs in Prague. In July he was elected a member of Austrian Empire Constituent\nAssembly in Vienna and later in KromÄÅÃ­Å¾. He finally gave up the seat to focus\non his journalism. NÃ¡rodnÃ­ noviny became popular especially for his sharp-\ntongued epigrams and his wit.\n\nHavlÃ­Äek was, politically, a \"liberal nationalist.\" However, he refused to\nallow a \"party line\" to inform his opinions. Often, he would criticize those\nthat agreed with him as much as those that disagreed. He exoriated\nrevolutionaries for their radicalism, but also advocated ideas like universal\nsuffrage-a concept altogether too radical for most of his fellow liberals. He\nwas a pragmatist, and had little patience for those that spent their time\nromanticizing the Czech nationality without helping it achieve political or\ncultural independence. He used much of the space in his newspapers to educate\nthe people on important issues-stressing areas like economics, which were\nsorely neglected by other nationalist writers.\n\n where HavlÃ­Äek was interned (1851-1855)]]\n\nThe Revolution in the Austro-Bohemian portion of the Habsburg monarchy was\ndefeated in March 1849 with dissolution of the KromÄÅÃ­Å¾ assembly, but HavlÃ­Äek\ncontinued to criticize the new regime. He was brought to court for his criticism\n(there was no freedom of the press in the Habsburg's territory) but he was found\nnot guilty by a sympathetic jury. NÃ¡rodnÃ­ noviny had to cease publication in\nJanuary 1850, but HavlÃ­Äek did not end his activities. In May 1850 he began\npublishing the magazine Slovan in KutnÃ¡ Hora. The magazine was a target of\ncensorship from its start. It had to stop publication in August 1851, and\nHavlÃ­Äek stood again at the court to answer on charges of dissent. Again, he was\nfound not guilty by a sympathetic jury of Czech commoners.\n\nHavlÃ­Äek translated and introduced some satirical and critical authors into the\nCzech language culture including Nikolai Gogol (1842) and Voltaire\n(1851). Otakar Zachar, introduction to Listy Amabedovy, 1908.\n\nAgainst the law he was arrested by the police on the night of December 16, 1851,\nand forced into exile in Brixen, Austria (present-day Italy). He was depressed\nfrom the exile, but continued writing. While in exile, he wrote some of his best\nwork: 'TyrolskÃ© elegie' (Tirol Laments), 'KÅest svatÃ©ho VladimÃ­ra' (Baptism of\nSt.Vladimir) and 'KrÃ¡l LÃ¡vra' (King Lavra). When he returned from Brixen in\n1855, he learned that his wife had died a few days earlier. Most of his former\nfriends, afraid of the Bach system, stood aloof from him. Only a few publicly\ndeclared support for him. He died from tuberculosis, aged 35. BoÅ¾ena NÄmcovÃ¡ put\na crown of thorns on his head in the coffin. His funeral was attended by a\nprocession of about 5,000 Czechs.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Karel_Havlíček_Borovský","recorded":1375067778,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek.jpg/220px-Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek.jpg","/wiki/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dkova_Borov%C3%A1","/wiki/Bohemia","/wiki/Austrian_Empire","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Bohemia","/wiki/Austrian_Empire","/wiki/Czechs","/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)","/wiki/Literary_realism","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Czech_and_Slovak","/wiki/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dkova_Borov%C3%A1","/wiki/Czech_people","/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)","/wiki/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_Brod","/wiki/Philosophy","/wiki/Charles_University","/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848","/wiki/Theology","/wiki/Bohemia","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/Pavel_Jozef_%C5%A0af%C3%A1rik","/wiki/Russophile","/wiki/Pan-Slavism","/wiki/Czech_language","/wiki/Josef_Kajet%C3%A1n_Tyl","/wiki/Franti%C5%A1ek_Palack%C3%BD","/wiki/Liberalism","/w/index.php?title=Congress_of_the_Slavs&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Austrian_Empire","/wiki/Constituent_Assembly","/wiki/Vienna","/wiki/Krom%C4%9B%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BE","/wiki/Epigram","/wiki/Suffrage","/wiki/File:Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_domek.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_domek.jpg/220px-Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_domek.jpg","/wiki/File:Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_domek.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Brixen","/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy","/w/index.php?title=Krom%C4%9B%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BE_assembly&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kutn%C3%A1_Hora","/wiki/Censorship","/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol","/wiki/Voltaire","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Brixen","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Alexander_Bach","/wiki/Bo%C5%BEena_N%C4%9Bmcov%C3%A1","/wiki/Crown_of_Thorns","/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Czech_Bronze_Medal_Havel_Borovsk%C3%BD_150th_Anniversary.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Czech_Bronze_Medal_Havel_Borovsk%C3%BD_150th_Anniversary.jpg/220px-Czech_Bronze_Medal_Havel_Borovsk%C3%BD_150th_Anniversary.jpg","/wiki/File:Czech_Bronze_Medal_Havel_Borovsk%C3%BD_150th_Anniversary.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Chicago","/wiki/Douglas_Park_(Chicago)","/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Strachovsky&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Museum_Campus","/wiki/Adler_Planetarium","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD_(film)","/wiki/File:Karl_Havlicek.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Karl_Havlicek.JPG/220px-Karl_Havlicek.JPG","/wiki/File:Karl_Havlicek.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD","/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0738507164","/wiki/Columbia_University_Press","/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_Borovsk%C3%BD&action=edit&section=3","http://www.libri.cz/databaze/kdo18/search.php?zp=10&name=HAVL%CD%C8EK+BOROVSK%DD+KAREL","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/100277614","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dkova_Borov%C3%A1","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Austria","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karel_Havlíček_Borovský&oldid=565762455","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1821_births","/wiki/Category:1856_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Havl%C3%AD%C4%8Dk%C5%AFv_Brod_District","/wiki/Category:Czech_Roman_Catholics","/wiki/Category:Czech_journalists","/wiki/Category:Czech_satirists","/wiki/Category:Czech_writers","/wiki/Category:Czech_poets","/wiki/Category:Czech_politicians","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Catego
