However, even though\nthe people share a common language, each nation considers itself as a separate\nindependent nation. Today the Kwakwaka'wakw are organized politically into 13\nband governments. Their language, now spoken by less than 5% of the population\n(about 250 people), is [[Kwak'wala]]. The Kwakwaka'wakw are known for their\nhistory, culture and art. In recent years, the Kwakwaka'wakw have been active on\nthe revitalization of their culture and language.\n\nHistorically, the Kwakwaka'wakw economy was based primarily on fishing, with\nthe men also engaging in some hunting, and the women gathering wild fruits\nand berries. Ornate weaving and woodwork were important crafts, and wealth,\ndefined by slaves and material goods, was prominently displayed and traded\nat potlatch ceremonies. These customs were the subject of extensive study by\nthe anthropologist Franz Boas. In contrast to most other societies, wealth\nand status were not determined by how much you had, but by how much you had\nto give away. This act of giving away your wealth was one of the main acts\nin a potlatch.\n","linknr":459,"url":"Kwakwaka'wakw","recorded":1362480928,"links":45,"instances":["artist","artist","artist","ethnologist","mythology","canada","artist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kwakwaka'wakw|"],"headings":["Terminology","Origins","Colonization","Nations","Society","Culture","Notable
