It was\nthe home of Abby and Julia Evelina Smith, political activists involved in causes\nincluding abolitionism and women's suffrage. By contesting the assessment on\ntheir property and protesting against \"taxation without representation\" they\nbrought international attention to the cause of Women's rights.\n\nThe Smith family hosted abolitionist meetings and lectures at their home and on\ntheir lawn. They collected signatures for an anti-slavery petition and sent it\nto former president John Quincy Adams to present to Congress. |date=August 15, 1983|author=Robert C. Post|publisher=National Park\nService}} \n\nIn 1873, late in their lives, they became tax resisters when they began a two\nyear fight with local authorities over an inequitable property tax assessment on\ntheir property, Kimberly Farm. They owned the most valuable\nproperty in town and were being exploited by the town tax collector. In\nConnecticut at the time, women had no vote and therefore no voice in the\ndisposition of their taxes. They refused to pay their tax until they were given\nrepresentation. Abby took their concerns to the town council where she said:\n\nThe motto of our government is 'Proclaim liberty to all inhabitants\nof the land!' and here, where liberty is so highly extolled and glorified by\nevery man in it, one-half of the inhabitants are not put under her laws, but are\nruled over by the other half, who can take all they possess. How is Liberty\npleased with such worship?\n\nThe town responded by seizing their beloved Alderney cows, auctioning them off\nand attempting to auction their farm as well. The sisters were able to buy the\ncows back and fought the town in court, ultimately winning. The case brought\nattention to the sisters, their cows and the cause of womenâs suffrage.\n\nThe sisters came from an accomplished and nonconformist family. The sisters\nparent's were Zephaniah Smith, a lawyer and former Sandemanian minister and\nHannah Hickok, an amateur mathematician and poet. There were three other\nsisters: Hancy, an inventor; Laurilla, an artist and Cyrinthia, a poet. Julia also knew classical languages and in 1855, she finished the\nfirst complete translation of the Bible into English by a woman. \"Last of the Smith Girls\", New York Times, March 9, 1886. She\npublished the translation herself in 1876 as an example of the accomplishments\nthat women are capable of. E. G. Speare, \"Abby, Julia, and the\nCows\", American Heritage, Volume 8, Issue 4, June 1957.\n\nThe house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. The large wooden two-story farmhouse, also\nknown as the Smith Sisters House, was built in the early 18th century by the\nConnecticut politician, Eleazer Kimberly. Zephaniah Smith\nbought the house in 1790.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Kimberly_Mansion","recorded":1374766916,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Mansion&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Mansion&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark","/wiki/File:Kimberly_Mansion,_Glastonbury_(Hartford_County,_Connecticut).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Kimberly_Mansion%2C_Glastonbury_%28Hartford_County%2C_Connecticut%29.jpg/250px-Kimberly_Mansion%2C_Glastonbury_%28Hartford_County%2C_Connecticut%29.jpg","/wiki/File:USA_Connecticut_location_map.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/USA_Connecticut_location_map.svg/240px-USA_Connecticut_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/7px-Red_pog.svg.png","/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kimberly_Mansion&params=41_41_21.86_N_72_36_26.04_W_region:US-CT_type:landmark","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kimberly_Mansion&params=41_41_21.86_N_72_36_26.04_W_region:US-CT_type:landmark","#cite_note-nris-1","#cite_note-nhlsum-2","/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut","/wiki/Abby_Hadassah_Smith","/wiki/Julia_Evelina_Smith","/wiki/Abolitionism","/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage","/wiki/Taxation_without_representation","/wiki/Women%27s_rights","#cite_note-nhlsum-2","/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams","#cite_note-nrhpinv-3","/wiki/Tax_resisters","#cite_note-nhlsum-2","/wiki/History_of_women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Alderney_cattle","#cite_note-nhlsum-2","/wiki/Sandemanian","#cite_note-nrhpinv-3","/wiki/Julia_E._Smith_Parker_Translation","#cite_note-nytobit-4","#cite_note-ah-5","/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark","#cite_note-nhlsum-2","#cite_note-nrhpinv-3","/wiki/Eleazer_Kimberly","#cite_note-nrhpinv-3","/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Mansion&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-nris_1-0","http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natreg/docs/All_Data.html","/wiki/National_Park_Service","#cite_ref-nhlsum_2-0","#cite_ref-nhlsum_2-1","#cite_ref-nhlsum_2-2","#cite_ref-nhlsum_2-3","#cite_ref-nhlsum_2-4","http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1507&ResourceType=Building","#cite_ref-nrhpinv_3-0","#cite_ref-nrhpinv_3-1","#cite_ref-nrhpinv_3-2","#cite_ref-nrhpinv_3-3","http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/74002178.pdf","http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Photos/74002178.pdf","#cite_ref-nytobit_4-0","#cite_ref-ah_5-0","/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_Mansion&action=edit&section=2","http://town.glasct.org/hissoc/index.html","/wiki/Template:National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/Template_talk:National_Register_of_Historic_Places","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:National_Register_of_Historic_Places&action=edit","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_architectural_style_categories","/wiki/Contributing_property","/wiki/Historic_districts_in_the_United_States","/wiki/History_of_the_National_Register_of_Historic_Places","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Register","/wiki/National_Park_Service","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_property_types","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Alabama","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Alaska","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Arizona","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Arkansas","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_California","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Colorado","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Connecticut","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Delaware","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Florida","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Georgia","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Hawaii","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Idaho","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Illinois","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Indiana","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Iowa","/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_
