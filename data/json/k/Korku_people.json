{"cursor":"4160","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Maharashtra]] 'Korku' is a scheduled tribe (ST) community predominantly\nfound in the East Nimar (Khandwa and Burhanpur), Betul and Chhindwara\ndistricts of Madhya Pradesh and adjoining areas in Melghat region of\nMaharastra in India speaking the Korku language, which is a member of the\nAustroasiatic language family.\n\nKorkus have derived their name from the combination of the word âkoruâ meaning\nman and âkuâ which makes it plural meaning tribal men (Russell and Hiralal,\n1916). The Korkus are a branch of the great Munda tribes and are placed here in\nthe vicinity of the great tribe- the Gonds (Deogaonkar et al., 1990). Korkus are\ninitially believed to be a hunting gathering community dwelling in the forests\nof Satpura ranges on either sides of the river Tapti. The Korku tribe lives in\nsmall groups of huts made of grass and wood. Every household has elevated stage\nlike structure in the front side of the house. This elevated stage is used as a\nstorage space of farm produce such as cattle feed. They socially consume liquor\nmade from the flowers of the Mahua tree which is prepared in almost all the\nhouses. Predominantly, a rural-based community with 98.74 per cent living in\nrural areas, Korkus are primarily cultivators. Whilst they share the love of the\nforests with the Gonds, they are also excellent agriculturists and in Bhainsdehi\ntahsil of Betul district have pioneered the cultivation of potato and coffee.\nAccording to the 1981census, 46.42 percent of them are workers. Of these, 48.38\npercent are cultivators, 46.47 percent are agricultural labourers, 2.30 percent\nare engaged in rearing livestock, forestry, fishing, etc. The remaining 2.85\npercent are engaged in various other occupations such as mining and quarrying,\nhousehold industries, construction, trade and commerce, etc. They have achieved\na literacy rate of only 6.54 percent as recorded by the 1981 census. While 11.68\npercent of their males are literate, among females the literacy rate is 1.24\npercent. Women play significant roles in the economic life of the society as\nthey work as agriculturists and agricultural wage laborers. The community is the\nhome to a unique and distinct culture, possesses a rich heritage of age old\ntraditional systems more pertinently in terms of indigenous knowledge, beliefs,\ncustoms and social system. Traditional representative body of the society known\nas âKorku Panchayatâ is found in many villages. Headed by a chief known as\nPatel, other members in the Panchayat include Padihar (priest), Kotwar\n(Chaukidar) and ten to twelve older male members of the community known as\nPanch. It plays a decisive role during traditional occasions mainly in\nfestivals, marriages and intra and inter-village conflict resolutions.\nNotoriously known for many reasons like widespread poverty, hunger,\nmalnutrition, mass scale exploitations by moneylenders and traders, the\ncommunity confronts with numerous socio-economic challenges in the day-to-day\nlife partly due to the poor natural resource bases. Agriculture though the\nprimary source of livelihoods for most of the community members, many of them\nearn their livelihoods seasonally employed as agricultural labourers.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Korku_people","recorded":1375084495,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Family_of_a_Korku_tribal_in_Melghat,_Maharashtra_(1).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Family_of_a_Korku_tribal_in_Melghat%2C_Maharashtra_%281%29.jpg/220px-Family_of_a_Korku_tribal_in_Melghat%2C_Maharashtra_%281%29.jpg","/wiki/File:Family_of_a_Korku_tribal_in_Melghat,_Maharashtra_(1).jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Melghat","/wiki/Maharashtra","/wiki/Scheduled_tribe","/wiki/East_Nimar","/wiki/Khandwa","/wiki/Burhanpur","/wiki/Betul_district","/wiki/Chhindwara","/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh","/wiki/Maharastra","/wiki/India","/wiki/Korku_language","/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages","/wiki/Madhuca_longifolia","/wiki/Gondi_people","/w/index.php?title=Bhainsdehi_tahsil&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Potato","/wiki/Coffee","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/8170222974","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Korku_people","/wiki/Template:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Maharashtra","/wiki/Template_talk:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Maharashtra","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Maharashtra&action=edit","/wiki/Andh","/wiki/Barda_tribe","/wiki/Bhil","/wiki/Dhanka","/wiki/Dhodia","/wiki/Dubla","/wiki/Gavit","/wiki/Gondi_people","/wiki/Halbi","/wiki/Thakar_tribe","/wiki/Warli","/wiki/Template:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Madhya_Pradesh","/wiki/Template_talk:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Madhya_Pradesh","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scheduled_Tribes_in_Madhya_Pradesh&action=edit","/wiki/Tribals_in_Madhya_Pradesh","/wiki/Baiga_(tribe)","/wiki/Bharia_language","/wiki/Bhil","/wiki/Chero","/wiki/Gondi_people","/w/index.php?title=Majhi_tribe&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Khairwar&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kol_people","/w/index.php?title=Mawasi&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Pardhan_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Panika","/wiki/Saharia","/w/index.php?title=Saur_people&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&oldid=562770433","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Scheduled_Tribes_of_India","/wiki/Category:Social_groups_of_India","/wiki/Category:Social_groups_of_Madhya_Pradesh","/wiki/Category:Munda_languages","/wiki/Category:Social_groups_of_Maharashtra","/wiki/Category:Tribal_communities_of_Maharashtra","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Korku+people&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Korku+people","/wiki/Korku_people","/wiki/Talk:Korku_people","#","/wiki/Korku_people","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Korku_people","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Korku_people","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&oldid=562770433","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3595693","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Korku_people&id=562770433","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Korku+people","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Korku+people&oldid=562770433&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Korku_people&printable=yes","//ca.w
