{"cursor":"2726","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Kingdom of 'Kquoja' or 'Koya' or 'Koya Temne', or the 'Temne Kingdom' (1505-\n1896), was a pre-colonial African state in the north of present-day Sierra\nLeone. Its capital was at Cape Mount in what is now modern Liberia.\n\nThe kingdom was founded by the Temne ethnic group in or around 1505 by migrants\nfrom the north seeking trade with the coastal Portuguese in the south.\n\nThe kingdom was ruled by a king called a Bai or Obai. The sub-kingdoms within\nthe state were ruled by nobles titled \"Gbana\". The Koya Kingdom kept and\nmaintained diplomatic relations with the British and French in the 18th century.\nChildren of Temne nobles were allowed to seek western educations abroad. Koya\nalso traded with Islamic states to its north and had Muslims within its borders.\n\nUnder Nembanga's reign (1775-1793) the Koya kingdom signed a treaty, which made\nit possible for the establishment of British colony on the peninsula of Sierra\nLeone in 1788.\n\nKoya participated in the trans-atlantic slave trade, though sources state that\nsuch commerce was much more privatized than in other kingdoms. Subjects of Koya\ntraded in slaves on the coast even against the wishes of the state at times.\n\nFrom 1801 to 1807, Koya fought a war with British colonists and the Susu. Koya\nlost the northern shoreline of Sierra Leone to the British and Port Loko to the\nSusu. However, they remained a power in the region. In 1815, the Temne fought\nanother war with the Susu and regained the port. In 1841, the Temne defeated the\nLoko tribe of Kasona on the Mabaole River dispersing many of the people. in\nresponse to a British bombardment, the kingdom expelled the Church Missionary\nSociety missionaries operating at Magbela in 1860.\n\nThe kingdom became a British protectorate August 31, 1896 after which the Koya\nkings lost virtually all power. Revolts of the Temne and Mende in 1898 were\nfierce but futile. The British would govern the area of the former kingdom\nuntil 1961.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Kingdom_of_Koya","recorded":1375088072,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sierra_Leone","/wiki/Liberia","/wiki/Temne_people","/wiki/Portuguese_people","/wiki/Obai","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/France","/wiki/Century","/wiki/Muslim","/w/index.php?title=Nembanga&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Trans-atlantic_slave_tra&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Susu_people","/wiki/Port_Loko","/w/index.php?title=Mabaole_River&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Church_Missionary_Society","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Obai","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=edit&section=2","http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sierra_Leone_native.html","http://www.sierra-leone.org/heroes2.html","http://www.onwar.com/aced/nation/tap/temne/index.htm","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&oldid=556917639","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:States_of_pre-colonial_Africa","/wiki/Category:History_of_Sierra_Leone","/wiki/Category:Former_monarchies_of_Africa","/wiki/Category:States_and_territories_established_in_1505","/wiki/Category:States_and_territories_disestablished_in_1896","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kingdom+of+Koya&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kingdom+of+Koya","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Koya","/wiki/Talk:Kingdom_of_Koya","#","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Koya","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Kingdom_of_Koya","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Kingdom_of_Koya","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&oldid=556917639","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6412616","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Kingdom_of_Koya&id=556917639","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Kingdom+of+Koya","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Kingdom+of+Koya&oldid=556917639&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Kingdom_of_Koya&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6412616#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Koya","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["States
