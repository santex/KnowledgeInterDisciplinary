It is defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound\nneutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state, and has a value of . [http://physics.nist.gov/constants Fundamental Physical Constants\nfrom NIST ] One dalton is approximately equal\nto the mass of one nucleon and equivalent to 1g/mol. The CIPM has categorised it as a non-SI unit accepted for use with\nthe SI, and whose value in SI units must be obtained experimentally.\n\nThe 'amu' without the \"unified\" prefix is technically an obsolete unit based on\noxygen, which was replaced in 1961. However, some sources still use the amu but\nnow define it in the same way as u (based on carbon-12). In this sense, most\nuses of atomic mass units or amu today actually refer to unified atomic mass\nunits or u.\n\nAtomic mass unit does not stand for the unit of mass in the atomic units system,\nwhich is rather m e.\n","linknr":322,"url":"Kilodalton","recorded":1362898313,"links":77,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":["http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"],"categories":["Metrology","Nuclear chemistry","Units of chemical measurement","Units of mass"],"headings":["History","Terminology","Relationship to SI","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/b/48b9b28f46485f97f5ee1053122452d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/75px-SI_base_unit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Mass","John_Dalton","Unit_of_measurement","Mass","Atomic_mass","Carbon-12","Ground_state","Nucleon","Molar_mass","CIPM","International_System_of_Units","Atomic_units","Atomic_weight","John_Dalton","Wilhelm_Ostwald","Atomic_weight","Atomic_weight","Carbon-12","CIPM","SI","CIPM","New_SI_definitions","Mole_(unit)","SI_base_unit","CGPM","Avogadro_constant","Hydrogen","Carbon","Aspirin","Peptide_hormone","Insulin","Protein","Kendrick_mass","Mass-to-charge_ratio","Atomic_mass_constant"]}
