      "text" : "\n\n\n\n knighting a squire]]\n\n in 1346.]] A 'knight' is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a\n monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country,\n especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood has\n been conferred upon mounted warriors.<ref>Clark, p. 1.</ref> During the High\n Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late\n Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a\n code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Since the Early\n Modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a\n monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to\n the country.\n\nHistorically, the ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature,\nespecially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on\nGeoffrey of Monmouth's [[Historia Regum Britanniae]] (\"History of the Kings of\nBritain\"), written in the 1130s. Sir Thomas Malory's [[Le Morte d'Arthur]] (\"The\nDeath of Arthur\"), written in 1485, was important in defining the ideal of\nchivalry which is essential to the modern concept of the knight as an elite\nwarrior sworn to uphold the values of faith, loyalty, courage, and honour.\nDuring the Renaissance, the genre of chivalric romance became popular in\nliterature, growing ever more idealistic and eventually giving rise to a new\nform of realism in literature popularised by Miguel de Cervantes' [[Don\nQuixote]]. This novel explored the ideals of knighthood and their incongruity\nwith the reality of Cervantes' world. In the late medieval period, new methods\nof warfare began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles\nremained in many nations.\n\nSome orders of knighthood, such as the Knights Templar, have become the subject\nof legend; others have disappeared into obscurity. Today, a number of orders of\nknighthood continue to exist in several countries, such as the English Order of\nthe Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, and the Royal Norwegian\nOrder of St. Olav. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility,\nbut knighthood is generally granted by a head of state to selected persons to\nrecognise some meritorious achievement.\n\nKnighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and\nespecially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final\nflowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the\n15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of chivalry, cavalier\nand related terms (see Etymology section below). The special prestige given to\nmounted warriors finds a parallel in the [[furusiyya]] in the Muslim world, and\nthe Greek [[hippeus]] and the Roman [[Equestrian order|eques]] of Classical\nAntiquity.<ref></ref>\n",
