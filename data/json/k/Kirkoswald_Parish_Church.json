It is a parish church in the Church\nof Scotland.\n\nThe church is unusual in that its design was, at the very least, strongly\ninfluenced by Robert Adam, one of Scotland's outstanding architects. He was\nworking at the time on his masterpiece, Culzean Castle, and there are many\nAdam features about the church. It was built in 1777 and is essentially\nunchanged since. A fire in 1997 was confined within the ducted central heating\nsystem, and when that was being removed, wet rot, dry rot and plaster fungus\nwere discovered. The building underwent a substantial renovation at that time,\nbut the interior of the church was restored with only minor changes. The\nchurch was fortunate in being able to call on the architectural historians\nworking at Culzean, and the colour scheme is now as close to the original as\ncould be achieved.\n\nThis church was built as a replacement for an older churchâbuilt around 1220âthe\nruins of which are still visible in the village, in the middle of the old\ngraveyard ).}} The graveyard has a number of interesting graves, mainly because\nof the strong links with Robert Burns, whose mother (Agnes Broun) came from this\nvillage. The poet also spent around 9 months in the village in 1776, when he was\n17, and most of the characters in his poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" are based on local\npeople whose graves are in the old kirkyard and are suitably marked.\n\nThe present minister (since 2000) is the Rev Arrick Wilkinson.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Kirkoswald_Parish_Church","recorded":1375066453,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&params=55.3288_N_-4.7765_E_type:landmark_region:GB","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&params=55.3288_N_-4.7765_E_type:landmark_region:GB","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Churchmanship","/wiki/Ministers_and_elders_in_the_Church_of_Scotland","http://www.kirkoswald.net/","/wiki/Parish","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)","/wiki/Kirkoswald,_South_Ayrshire","/wiki/A77_road","/wiki/South_Ayrshire","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Parish_church","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Robert_Adam","/wiki/Culzean_Castle","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&params=55.3300_N_-4.7779_E_type:landmark_region:GB&title=Remains+of+Kirk+Oswald","/wiki/Robert_Burns","/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter_(Burns_poem)","/w/index.php?title=Kirkoswald_Parish_Church&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/wiki/Template:Carrick","/wiki/Template_talk:Carrick","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Carrick&action=edit","/wiki/Carrick,_Scotland","/wiki/Ballantrae","/wiki/Girvan","/wiki/Maybole","/w/index.php?title=Auchencrosh&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Balkissock&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bargany&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Barr,_Ayrshire","/wiki/Colmonell","/w/index.php?title=Crosshill,_South_Ayrshire&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dailly","/w/index.php?title=Drumshang&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dunure","/w/index.php?title=Greenan,_South_Ayrshire&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Kirkmichael","/wiki/Kirkoswald,_South_Ayrshire","/wiki/Maidens","/w/index.php?title=Minishant&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Old_Dailly","/wiki/Patna,_East_Ayrshire","/w/index.php?title=Pinmore&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Pinwherry&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Smyrton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Straiton","/wiki/Ayrshire_and_Arran","/wiki/Earl_of_Carrick","/wiki/Kyle_and_Carrick","/wiki/Ayrshire","/wiki/South_Ayrshire","/wiki/Carrick,_Cumnock_and_Doon_Valley_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/South_Ayrshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Carrick,_Cumnock_and_Doon_Valley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Ayr,_Carrick_and_Cumnock_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Galwegian_Gaelic","/wiki/Sawney_Bean","/wiki/Ailsa_Craig","/w/index.php?title=Craigdow_Loch&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Bradan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Loch_Doon","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Dornal&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Finloch&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Goosey&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Spaig&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Loch_Spallander&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Lochspouts","/wiki/River_Doon","/wiki/River_Stinchar","/w/index.php?title=Water_of_App&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Water_of_Girvan","/w/index.php?title=Water_of_Tig&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Blairquhan_Castle","/wiki/Crossraguel_Abbey","/wiki/Culzean_Castle","/w/index.php?title=Dinvin_Motte&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dunduff_Castle","/wiki/Dunure_Castle","/wiki/Glenapp_Castle","/wiki/Greenan_Castle","/w/index.php?title=Knockdolian&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Maybole_Collegiate_Church&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Penkill_Castle","/wiki/Turnberry_Castle","/wiki/Abbot_of_Crossraguel","/wiki/Clan_Kennedy","/wiki/Earl_of_Carrick","/wiki/Marquess_of_Ailsa","/wiki/Girvan_F.C.","/wiki/Maybole_F.C.","/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)","/wiki/Girvan_and_Portpatrick_Junction_Railway","/wiki/Maybole_and_Girvan_Railway","/wiki/Barrhill_railway_station","/wiki/Girvan_railway_station","/wiki/Maybole_railway_station","/wiki/A77_road","/w/index.php?title=A714_road&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=
