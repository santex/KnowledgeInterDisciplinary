Kinases are part of the larger family of\nphosphotransferases. Kinases are not to be confused with phosphorylases, which\ncarry out phosphorolysis, the breaking of a bond using an inorganic phosphate\ngroup; or with phosphatases, which remove phosphate groups.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Kinases","recorded":1362508352,"links":40,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.7.1"],"headings":["Types","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Phosphate_formula.svg/220px-Phosphate_formula.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate"],"related":["Biochemistry","Enzyme","Phosphate","High-energy_phosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Phosphotransferase","Phosphorylase","Phosphorolysis","Phosphatase","Protein_kinase","Signal_transduction","Lipid","Carbohydrate","Amino_acid","Nucleotide","Cyclin-dependent_kinase","Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase","Signal_transduction","G_protein-coupled_receptor"]}
