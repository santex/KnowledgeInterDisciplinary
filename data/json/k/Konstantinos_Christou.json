He was born in the village of Rulja\n(Greek Î¡Î¿ÏÎ»Î¹Î± / Roulia, Macedonian Slavic: Ð ÑÑÐ°, now known as Kottas in Florina\nregional unit) in 1863. He was president of Roulia, from 1893 to 1896. He\nrevolted against Ottomans, at 1898 and killed four local officers of the Ottoman\nEmpire. Later, he was one of the first leaders of the Macedonian struggle.\n\nKonstantinos Christou participated initially at the IMRO movement against the\nOttoman Empire. When he realised that he was deceived and he ascertained for the\nreal purposes of the Bulgarians (which directed the IMRO) \"Douglas Dakin,\nThe Greek Struggle in Macedonia 1897-1913 (Thessaloniki, 1966) relatively\nto the Macedonians (Greeks), he diversified. The day that Marko, in Greek:\nMemoirs of Germanos Karavangelis, diligence by V. Laourdas, Institute of Studies\nof Peninsula of Aemos (ISPA) p.26 (1959) ordered K. Christou to kill a\nGreek patriarchic priest, Konstantinos Christou decided to join the Greeks. That\nday, he loathed the Bulgarians and started to fight them. \"Douglas Dakin,\nThe Greek Struggle in Macedonia 1897-1913 (Thessaloniki, 1966) He was\nsentenced to death by IMRO twice - both times for murders of IMRO members. He\nhad been accused also with the pretence of theft. IMRO upended him twice, in\norder to murder him. Then he tried to communicate with bishop of Kastoria,\nGermanos Karavangelis, in order to organize the struggle against Internal\nMacedonian Revolutionary Organization. His mission was to kill the IMRO leader\nLazar Poptraykov and other leaders, in order to protect the Greek civilians.\nBishop funded his troop.

At the\ntime of the Ilinden Rising, when all old wrongs were forgiven and forgotten in\nthe name of the common struggle, Kottas, too, had been received back into the\nOrganization, ironically enough, mainly thanks to the insistence of the same\nvoivode â Lazar Poptraykov. During the Rising, Poptraikov had been wounded and\nhad taken refuge with Kottas, who had then repaid the voivodaâs magnanimity by\nmurdering him and presenting his head to the Greeks.

However the bishop was considered to be wary of him on\naccount of his mother tongue, which was Slavic and his hatred to the Ottomans.\nHis behavior towards the Ottomans was an obstruct to the Greek tactic, because\nmany times, it was necessary to co-operate with the Ottoman officers against the\nBulgarian enemy. \"Newer history of Macedonia 1830-1912\" K. Vakalopoulos,\nThessaloniki\"\n\nHowever Kottas, was a veteran [[klepht]]. In reality, the klephts or hajduks\nwere as much guerrilla fighters against the Ottoman rule, as they were bandits\nand highwaymen, who preyed also on local merchants and travellers. He kidnapped\nPetko Yanev, a Bulgarian recently returned from America, and tortured him and\nhis family until he had extracted all the savings, which Yanev had brought.\nYanev, however, complained vigorously to the vali, to Hilmi Pasha himself, and\nto the foreign consuls. The British consul pressed the vali to act, and\neventually Captain Kottas, was arrested by the\nOttomans. [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/mm/mm_9.htm#32. For freedom and\nperfection.

After his death, a lot of volunteers from free Greece came to Macedonia\nto participate in the struggle, beside the locals.

He used to\nsay: \"The difficult part is to kill the bear first, and then, it is easy to\nshare the skin.\"\n\nHis last words before hanging, in his native Lower Prespa dialect, were \"Zhivja\nGritsja.
