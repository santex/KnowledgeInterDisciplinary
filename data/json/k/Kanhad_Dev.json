He belonged to the Sonigara\nsect of the Chauhan clan of Rajputs.\n\nIn 1298, Ala ud din Khilji's Mongol general Ulugh Khan asked permission of\nKanhad Dev to march through Jalore to conquer Gujurat and destroy the temple at\nSomnath. When Kanhad Dev refused a war ensued. In 1299 Ala ud din\nsacked the temple and broke the Shiva lingam that had been worshipped there. He\nwas carrying the broken pieces back to Delhi when he was attacked and defeated\nby Kanhad Dev Sonigara's armies. Kanhad Dev's son Biramdeo (Viramdev) and\ntrusted general Jaitra Deora were in charge of his army. The broken pieces of\nthe Shiva lingam were recovered. Kanhad had them washed in water from the Ganges\nriver, which is regarded as sacred, and then placed within various Shiva temples\nin and around Jalore. This story is recounted in the 16th century ballads\nPadmanabhama and Kanhad Dev.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Kanhad_Dev","recorded":1362899340,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://panhwar.com/Adobe/Article116.pdf","http://panhwar.com/Adobe/Article116.pdf"],"categories":["Jalore district","Maharajas of Rajasthan","People from Jalore district"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Rajput","Jalore","Common_Era","India","Rajasthan","Sonigara","Chauhan","Ala_ud_din_Khilji","Gujurat","Somnath","Shiva","Lingam","Ganges","Ballad"]}
