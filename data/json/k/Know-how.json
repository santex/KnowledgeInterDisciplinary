Know-how\nis often tacit knowledge, which means that it is difficult to transfer to\nanother person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. The opposite of\ntacit knowledge is explicit knowledge.\n\nIn the context of industrial property (now generally viewed as intellectual\nproperty (IP)), know-how is a component in the transfer of technology in\nnational and international environments, co-existing with or separate from other\nIP rights such as patents, trademarks and copyright and is an economic\nasset.
