It is commonly\nused to store, transport, and serve beer. Other alcoholic or non-alcoholic\ndrinks, carbonated or non-carbonated, may be housed in a keg as well. Such\nliquids are generally kept under pressure.\n","linknr":409,"url":"Keg","recorded":1362675378,"links":31,"instances":["engineering","goods","profession","unit","material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Brewing","Beer vessels and serving","Liquid containers"],"headings":["Beer keg","Other types of kegs","UK and Irish keg supply structure","Keg laws","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Keg_geschnitten.jpg/250px-Keg_geschnitten.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Keg1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Giantcanofgrolsch.JPG/160px-Giantcanofgrolsch.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/IMG_Portlaoise4423w.jpg/220px-IMG_Portlaoise4423w.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cooper","profession"],["nail","engineering"],["tubing","material"],["gill","unit"],["case","goods"]],"members":["nail","case","cooper","gill","tubing"],"related":["Barrel","Cooper_(profession)","Nail_(engineering)","Powder_keg","Beer","Alcoholic_beverage","Stainless_steel","Aluminium","Tubing_(material)","Valve","Coupling","Carbon_dioxide","CRC_Press","Metrication","Unit_of_measure","Volume","Metric_system","U.S._gallon","Imperial_gallon","Liter","Pint","Gill_(unit)","Fluid_ounce","Case_(goods)","Gallon","Liter","Cornelius_kegs","Deutsches_Institut_f√ºr_Normung","Pneumatics","Anheuser-Busch","Soft_drink","Beer","Bag-In-Box","Molson","Genericized","Heineken","Grolsch","Bitburger","Ounce","Beer_tap","Deposit_account","Beer_tap","Republic_of_Ireland","Keg_beer","Barrel","Cask_ale","Draught_beer","Firkin","Keg_stand","WikiHow"]}
