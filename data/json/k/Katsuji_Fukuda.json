{"cursor":"12836","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"__NOTOC__ was a Japanese photographer known for his photographs of still lifes\nand nudes, and also a writer of practical books about photography. Where not\notherwise noted, the biographical facts are from the article by Moriyama and\nthat by Nihon no shashinka. Where the two disagree, it follows the latter (and\nlater).\n\nFukuda was born on 11 January 1899 in Nakanoseki (later part of HÅfu), Yamaguchi\n(Japan). He moved to Tokyo in 1920, and worked at Takachiho Seisakujo (later\nrenamed Olympus), where he worked making thermometers and developed an interest\nin photography, buying a Vest Pocket Kodak. The 1923 KantÅ earthquake impelled\nhim to leave the company and move to Kansai.\n\nFukuda ran a photographic studio in Sakai and Osaka, but this failed. He then\nworked as an editorial assistant on HakuyÅ Fuchikami's periodical HakuyÅ. A\nphotograph he took in 1925, shown in an exhibition (titled , Nihon Shashin\nBijutsutenrankai) at Daimaru department store (Osaka) and elsewhere, won the\nIlford Diamond Prize the following year. Fukuda then worked as a commercial\nphotographer in Sakai and Hiroshima.\n\nFukuda moved back to Tokyo in 1933, where, influenced by Modernist trends from\nEurope (particularly Moholy-Nagy), he pursued a successful career as an\nadvertising photographer. (Other than for a year at HÅfu toward the end of the\nwar, Fukuda stayed in Tokyo for the rest of his life.) A series of photographs\nin [[Asahi Camera]] starting in 1936 and including portraits of Setsuko Hara and\nTakako Irie was very popular, and the next year Fukuda turned this into a book\non photographing women that became a best-seller.\n\nAfter the war, Fukuda published collections of nude studies and more books on\nphotographic technique. He also experimented with color. According to\nHasegawa, he \"was the first to attempt color photography in Japan\". The\nvalue he placed on the expression of beauty rendered his work old fashioned with\nthe postwar wave of realism led by photographers such as Ken Domon, Hasegawa\nsays he was \"relegated to the 'rear guard'\". and the trends that followed\nthis. In 1974 he was not even among one hundred living photographers profiled in\na [[Camera Mainichi]] supplement. Shashinka 100nin: Kao to sakuhin () / 100\nphotographers, profiles and photographs, Special 20th anniversary supplement to\n[[Camera Mainichi]], 1974. However, he contributed one volume (ShÅka /\nPsalm) to the popular series \"Sonorama Shashin Sensho\" in 1979; in an afterword\nto this, Akira Hasegawa writes:\n\nThere are no photographers of women in Japan even today who have not\nbeen influenced by Fukuda in one way or another. Many techniques commonly used\ntoday were developed by Fukuda, a fact which has been forgotten.\n\nFukuda continued working in his old age. He died on 26 December 1991. The\nestimation of his work has since increased, and it is often anthologized in\ncollections of Modernist and mid-century works. A major exhibition of his work\nwas held in the Yamaguchi Prefectural Museum of Art in 1994.\n\nWorks by Fukuda are in the permanent collections of the National Museum of\nModern Art, Tokyo, Yokohama Museum of Art, and Yamaguchi Prefectural Museum of\nArt. National Museum of Modern Art, Yokohama Museum of Art, Yamaguchi\nPrefectural Museum of Art: Matsumoto, Nihon no bijutsukan to shashin korekushon,\npp. 39, 73, 160
