They are essential in the\nurinary system and also serve homeostatic functions such as the regulation of\nelectrolytes, maintenance of acidâbase balance, and regulation of blood pressure\n(via maintaining salt and water balance). They serve the body as a natural\nfilter of the blood, and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary\nbladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and\nammonium, and they are also responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose,\nand amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol,\nerythropoietin, and the enzyme renin.\n\nLocated at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys\nreceive blood from the paired renal arteries, and drain into the paired renal\nveins. Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that\nempties into the urinary bladder.\n\nRenal physiology is the study of kidney function, while nephrology is the\nmedical specialty concerned with kidney diseases. Diseases of the kidney are\ndiverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic\nclinical features. Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the\nnephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic\nkidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and urinary tract\nobstruction. Various cancers of the kidney exist; the\nmost common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma. Cancers, cysts, and some\nother renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney, or\nnephrectomy. When renal function, measured by glomerular filtration rate, is\npersistently poor, dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options.\nAlthough they are not severely harmful, kidney stones can be painful and a\nnuisance. The removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up\nthe stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract.\nOne common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp pain in the medial/lateral\nsegments of the lower back.\n","linknr":846,"url":"Kidneys","recorded":1362898667,"links":143,"instances":["anatomy","medical","condiment","disambiguation","anatomy","anatomy","anatomy","biology","kidney"],"pdf":["http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf","http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf"],"categories":["Kidney|"],"headings":["Anatomy","Functions","Development","Evolutionary
