For the foodstuff, see [[Khoa (food)]]\n\nThe 'Khowa', also known as 'Bugun' in their native tongue, [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft8r29p2r8&chunk.id=d0e638&toc.-\ndepth=1&toc.id=d0e638&brand=eschol Tribes of India] is a tribal group in\nIndia. They live mainly in the subtropical Tenga Velley or Singchung\nAdministrative Circle of West Kameng district with its whole native populations\nunder 6-Thrizino-Buragaon Assembly Constituency of the state of Arunachal\nPradesh. According to the native legend, they believed that they are\nthe descendants of the Achinphumphulua.\n\nThe Buguns are further subdivided into sections according to their specific\nlocality (Hakhongdua, Hajidua, Braidua, Khuchundua, Hayindua). Their populations\nare mainly concentrated in the villages namely - Wanghoo, Dikhiyang, Bichom,\nRamu, Lali, Situ, Sachida, Lichini, Ditching, Mangopam, Singchung, Namfri and\nKaspi. Their immediate neighbours are Aka (Hrusso), Miji (Sajalong/Dhammai),\nSherdukpen and Monpa.\n\nActing as a basis of their livelihood, shifting cultivation is practiced and\ndomestic animals such as cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, fowl and the mithun are\nreared. To enrich their diet, wild animals are hunted using simple spears,\ntraps, bows and arrows.\n\nTogether with the Miji and Aka, long hair is kept by some members of both sexes.\nWhile the both sexes adorn themselves with silver ornaments, the men wear a very\nlong white garment and a very high hat, resembling a Turkish Fez. The women wear\na skull cap, sometimes decorated with beautiful patterns. Purple and checkered\njackets are worn as well, usually accompanied by another singlet.\n\nTheir language is grouped with the neighboring Mey language as BugunâMey. It is\npossibly of Tibeto-Burman derivation.\n\nThe Khowa are followers of the Donyi-Polo religion and have come\nunder Tibetan Buddhist influence from the neighbouring ethnic group Sherdukpen.\nProfound Buddhist influence has led to the adoption of many Buddhist rituals and\nthe invitation of Buddhist lamas to participate in their communal rituals. As a result, many Khowa declared themselves as Buddhist\nin censuses. {{cite book|title=Life Style, Indian Tribes:\nLocational Practice|author=Shiva Tosh Das|publisher=Gian Pub. House| year=1987|isbn=81-212-0058-\nX|page=28}} However, animism is still profound with majority of them.\n\nEspecially in Sraiba (place or a ground for worship and related festive\ncelebration) of every major villages, Kshyatsowai/Dihing Kho and Pham Kho is\ncelebrated by the Bugun, in which the Phabi priest plays an important role in\nconducting the ceremony and religious rituals. Songs and dances such as Clown\nand Gasisiu have a close affiliation with their religion. Feasts during these\nfestivals mainly includes their traditional foods and Phua (local brew).\n\nThe traditional village council of the Bugun (Khowa) is known as Nimiyang\n(Council of Elders), which looks after every aspect of village life, may it be\ndecision-making, utilization of local resources, conflict resolution or\nregulating the society. Each family is represented in the Nimiang sessions by\nits head male member. The traditional village council of buguns are headed by\nThap-Bahow (Chief). The Thap-Bakhow is an accepted leader and selected\nunanimously and not hereditary. There is no strict criterion for selection of\nthe Thap-Bakhow, but a person with economic affluence, social stature, knowledge\nof customary laws, sound mentality, physical strength and generosity are taken\ninto consideration. He presides over the meetings and sittings of the Nimiyang\nsession. It is customary that only male member possessing above qualities can\nbecome Thap-Bakhow. Womenfolk is just a passive spectator and witnesses the\nproceedings of the Nimiyang sessions only. However, a female member is allowed\nto represent if its male member is absent.\n\nIn 2006 a rare bird Bugun Liocichla was named after the tribe.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Khowa","recorded":1375084483,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Khowa_people","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Khowa&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Khoa_(food)","#cite_note-Tribes_of_India-1","/wiki/India","/wiki/Subtropical","/wiki/West_Kameng","/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Shifting_cultivation","/wiki/Gayal","/wiki/Miji_people","/wiki/Aka_(tribe)","/wiki/Fez_(clothing)","/wiki/Khowa_language","/wiki/Mey_language","/wiki/Bugun%E2%80%93Mey","/wiki/Donyi-Polo","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhist","/wiki/Sherdukpen","#cite_note-Tribes_of_India-1","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Bugun_Liocichla","/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Tribes_of_India_1-0","#cite_ref-Tribes_of_India_1-1","http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft8r29p2r8&chunk.id=d0e638&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e638&brand=eschol","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/81-7433-019-4","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-87808-361-8","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/81-212-0058-X","/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=edit&section=2","http://www.kolkatabirds.com/hillbirdsofind/netripreportmw.htm","http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bgg","/wiki/Template:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Template_talk:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh&action=edit","/wiki/Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Adi_people","/wiki/Mishmi_people","/wiki/Hruso_people","/wiki/Apatani_people","/w/index.php?title=Asing_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Bori_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Chikum_Dui_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Deori_people","/w/index.php?title=Digaro_Mishmi_tribe&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Galo_tribe","/wiki/Hill_Miri_people","/wiki/Khamba_people","/wiki/Khamti_people","/wiki/Khamyang_people","/wiki/Lisu_people","/wiki/Padam_tribe","/w/index.php?title=Palibo_peole&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tai_Phake_people","/wiki/Memba_people","/wiki/Monpa_people","/wiki/Miji_people","/wiki/Karbi_people","/wiki/Minyong_tribe","/wiki/Miju_Mishmi_tribe","/wiki/Mising_people","/wiki/Nishi_people","/wiki/Nocte_people","/wiki/Nga_people","/w/index.php?title=Ran_people&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sherdukpen_people","/wiki/Singpho_people","/wiki/Sulung_people","/wiki/Takpa","/wiki/Tangsa_people","/wiki/Tutsa_people","/wiki/Wancho_people","/wiki/Zekhring_people","/wiki/Chugpa_tribe","/wiki/Lishipa_tribe","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&oldid=543613671","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Tribes_of_Arunachal_Pradesh","/wiki/Category:Buddhist_communities","/wiki/Category:Donyi-Polo_communities","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Khowa+people&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Khowa+people","/wiki/Khowa_people","/wiki/Talk:Khowa_people","#","/wiki/Khowa_people","/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Khowa_people&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Khowa_people","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Khowa_people","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=K
