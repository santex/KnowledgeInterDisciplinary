A photometer continually monitors the\nbrightness of over 145,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. â\nclick the itinerary builder to get to the abstract of \"Kepler Planet Detection\nMission: Introduction and First Results\". This data is transmitted to\nEarth, then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by extrasolar planets\nthat cross in front of their host star.\n\nKepler is part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost, focused\nprimary science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation\nwere managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Ball Aerospace\nresponsible for developing the Kepler flight system. The Ames Research Center is\nresponsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December\n2009, and science data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was 3.5 years, but greater than expected noise in both the stars and\nthe spacecraft means additional time will be needed to fulfill all mission\ngoals. Therefore, in 2012, the mission was extended to 2016, [http://www.space.com/15160-alien-planet-kepler-mission-\n2016.html \"NASA Extends Planet-Hunting Kepler Mission Through 2016\"].

On May 15, 2013, a second of four reaction wheels had\nfailed, threatening the continuation of the mission.\n\n, Kepler found 132 confirmed exoplanets in 76 stellar systems, along with a\nfurther 3,216 unconfirmed planet candidates. In\nJanuary 2013, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n(CfA) used Kepler's data to estimate that \"at least 17 billion\" Earth-sized\nexoplanets reside in the Milky Way Galaxy.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Kepler_(spacecraft)","recorded":1372155136,"links":[],"instances":["spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","constellation","astronomy","citizen_science_project","spacecraft","astronomy","journal","constellation","unit","constellation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kepler
