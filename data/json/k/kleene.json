Kleene's work grounds the study of\nwhich functions are computable. A number of mathematical concepts are named\nafter him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure),\nKleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixpoint theorem. He also invented\nregular expressions, and was a leading American advocate of mathematical\nintuitionism.\n\nKleene pronounced his last name .<!-- source: private correspondence with his\nson, Ken Kleene, with and his colleague H.J. Keisler (when did these\nconversations occur? who are you?) --> Commonplace mispronunciations include and\n. (His son, Ken Kleene, wrote: \"As far as I am aware this pronunciation is\nincorrect in all known languages. I believe that this novel pronunciation was\ninvented by my father.\")\n","title":"Stephen%20Cole%20Kleene","headings":["Biography","Important publications","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: United_States","3: Alonzo_Church","2: Madison,_Wisconsin","2: University_of_WisconsinâMadison","2: Princeton_University","2: National_Medal_of_Science","2: Mathematical_logic","2: Recursion_theory","2: Kleene_hierarchy","2: Kleene_star","2: Mathematical_intuitionism","1: Hartford,_Connecticut","1: Mathematics","1: Robert_Lee_Constable","1: Yiannis_Moschovakis","1: Nels_David_Nelson","1: Dick_de_Jongh","1: Mathematician","1: Computer_science","1: Alan_Turing","1: Emil_Post","1: Computable_function","1: Kleene_algebra","1: Kleene's_recursion_theorem","1: Kleene_fixpoint_theorem","1: Regular_expressions","1: Amherst_College","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Institute_for_Advanced_Study","1: World_War_II","1: United_States_Navy","1: New_York","1: Naval_Research_Laboratory","1: Washington,_D.C.","1: Wisconsin","1: Vietnam_War","1: GÃ¶del's_incompleteness_theorems","1: Intuitionist_logic","1: Association_for_Symbolic_Logic","1: Canoe","1: Nature","1: Conservation_movement","1: Claude_Shannon","1: Smn_theorem","1: Realizability","1: Intuitionism","1: KleeneâRosser_paradox","1: Saunders_Mac_Lane","1: John_Barkley_Rosser"]}
