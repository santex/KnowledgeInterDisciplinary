Kinematics is used in astrophysics to describe the motion of\ncelestial bodies and systems, and in mechanical engineering, robotics and\nbiomechanics<ref name= Biewener></ref> to describe the motion of systems\ncomposed of joined parts (multi-link systems) such as an engine, a robotic arm\nor the skeleton of the human body.\n\nThe study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical expressions.\nFor instance, rotation can be represented by elements of the unit circle in the\ncomplex plane. Other planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of\nclassical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the Lorentz\ntransformations of relativistic space and time. By using time as a parameter in\ngeometry, mathematicians have developed a science of kinematic geometry.\n\nThe use of geometric transformations, also called rigid transformations, to\ndescribe the movement of components of a mechanical system simplifies the\nderivation of its equations of motion, and is central to dynamic analysis.\n\nKinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to\ndescribe motion. In engineering, for instance, kinematic analysis may be used to\nfind the range of movement for a given mechanism, and, working in reverse,\nkinematic synthesis designs a mechanism for a desired range of motion.<ref\nname=McCarthy2010>J.
