{"cursor":"2670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'Key Stage' is a stage of the state education system in England, Wales,\nNorthern Ireland and the British Territory of Gibraltar setting the educational\nknowledge expected of students at various ages. The term is also used in some\nother countries such as Hong Kong and Australia (some states) although the ages\nat which each Key Stage applies differ from England.\n\nThe stages are as follows: {|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- Key Stage (KS) Ages School years (Y) Forms Final exams - 0 3â5 0 Nursery /\n|Reception (Early Years Foundation Stage)\n|\n|- 1 5â7 1â2 1stâ2nd form infants\n|\n|- 2 7â11 3â6 1stâ4th form juniors 11 plus (generally only for Grammar School\n|entry) - 3 11â14 7â9 1stâ3rd form secondary\n|\n|- 4 14â16 10â11 4thâ5th form secondary GCSEs\n|- 5 16â18 12â13 Sixth form secondary, also FE college A-Levels, AS-Levels,\n|  NVQs, National Diplomas }\n\nThe National Curriculum sets out targets to be achieved in various subject areas\nat each of the Key Stages.\n\nThe Key Stages were first defined in 1988 Education Reform Act to accompany the\nfirst introduction of the National Curriculum. The precise definition of each of\nthe main 4 Key Stages is age-related, incorporating all pupils of a particular\nage at the beginning of each academic year. The Key Stages were designed to fit\nwith the most prevalent structures which had already grown up in the education\nsystem over the previous 100 years of development.\n\nKey Stage 1 fits broadly with the first stage of primary education, often known\nas infant schools. This break had existed for some time, being acknowledged in\nthe 1931 Hadow report as 'axiomatic' by as early as\n1870.[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/hadow1931/3104.html]\n\nKey Stage 2 fits the later stage of primary education, often known as junior\nschools. Again, described by Sir William Henry Hadow, this took pupils up to the\nstandardised break at age 11.\n\nSecondary education was split between Key Stages 3 and 4 at age 14, to align\nwith long-existing two-year examination courses at GCSE level.\n\nKey Stages 0 and 5 have no legal definition, and are merely used as indicators\nto complement the defined Key Stages.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Key_Stage","recorded":1371246932,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/State_school","/wiki/Education","/wiki/England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Gibraltar","/wiki/Hong_Kong","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Early_Years_Foundation_Stage","/wiki/11_plus","/wiki/Grammar_School","/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education","/wiki/Sixth_form","/wiki/Further_education","/wiki/Advanced_Level_(UK)","/wiki/Advanced_Level_(UK)","/wiki/NVQ","/wiki/National_Diploma","/wiki/National_Curriculum_(England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland)","/wiki/Education_Reform_Act_1988","/wiki/Primary_education","/wiki/Infant_school","/w/index.php?title=Hadow_report&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/hadow1931/3104.html","/wiki/Junior_school","/wiki/William_Henry_Hadow","/wiki/GCSE","/wiki/Template:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/wiki/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Education_in_England","/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Education_in_Wales","/wiki/History_of_education_in_England","/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/History_of_education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Education_in_Wales","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_England","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Universities_in_Scotland","/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Wales","/wiki/Universities_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Academy_(English_school)","/wiki/Comprehensive_school","/wiki/English_medium_education","/wiki/Free_school_(England)","/wiki/Gaelic_medium_education_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Grammar_Schools","/wiki/Welsh_medium_education","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&oldid=543817676","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:School_terminology","/wiki/Category:Educational_stages","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Key+Stage&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Key+Stage","/wiki/Key_Stage","/wiki/Talk:Key_Stage","#","/wiki/Key_Stage","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Key_Stage","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Key_Stage","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&oldid=543817676","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Key_Stage&id=543817676","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Key+Stage","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Key+Stage&oldid=543817676&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Key_Stage&printable=yes","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%B3%E9%94%AE%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6398092#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikim
