It\nis similar to the asteroid belt, but it is far largerâ20 times as wide and 20 to\n200 times as massive. Like the asteroid belt,\nit consists mainly of small bodies, or remnants from the Solar System's\nformation. While most asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most\nKuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed \"ices\"),\nsuch as methane, ammonia and water. The classical belt is home to at least three\ndwarf planets:  Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake. Some of the Solar System's moons, such as\nNeptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, are also believed to have originated in\nthe region. Johnson, Torrence V.; and Lunine, Jonathan I.; Saturn's moon\nPhoebe as a captured body from the outer Solar System, Nature, Vol. 435, pp.\n69â71\n\nSince the belt was discovered in 1992, the number of known\nKuiper belt objects (KBOs) has increased to over a thousand, and more than\n100,000 KBOs over in diameter are believed to exist.

This choice means that, on Wikipedia, Eris, the\nlargest known trans-Neptunian object, is not part of the Kuiper belt, and so\nPluto becomes the largest Kuiper belt object.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThe Kuiper belt should not be confused with the hypothesized Oort cloud, which\nis a thousand times more distant. The objects within the Kuiper belt, together\nwith the members of the scattered disc and any potential Hills cloud or Oort\ncloud objects, are collectively referred to as trans-Neptunian objects\n(TNOs).\n\nPluto is the largest known member of the Kuiper belt, and the second largest\nknown TNO, after the scattered-disc object Eris. Originally considered a planet,\nPluto's status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it to be reclassified as a\n\"dwarf planet\" in 2006. It is compositionally similar to many other objects of\nthe Kuiper belt, and its orbital period is characteristic of a class of KBOs\nknown as \"plutinos\" which share the same 2:3 resonance with Neptune.\n","linknr":1305,"url":"Kuiper_belt","recorded":1362371906,"links":145,"instances":["physics","moon","dwarf_planet","chemistry","moon","chemistry","journal","dwarf_planet","dwarf_planet","planetoid","dwarf_planet","geology","journal"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070925203400/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf","http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070925203400/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/papers/2006/DJ06.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182809/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182809/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/51/5/711.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/51/5/711.pdf","http://www.obs-nice.fr/morby/papers/6166a.pdf","http://www.obs-nice.fr/morby/papers/6166a.pdf","http://www.gsmt.noao.edu/gsmt_swg/SWG_Apr03/The_Kuiper_Belt.pdf","http://www.gsmt.noao.edu/gsmt_swg/SWG_Apr03/The_Kuiper_Belt.pdf","http://occult.mit.edu/_assets/documents/publications/Elliot2005AJ129.1117.pdf","http://occult.mit.edu/_assets/documents/publications/Elliot2005AJ129.1117.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/kbodeep.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/kbodeep.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/bernstein.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/bernstein.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182808/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/papers/50000/Quaoar.pdf","http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/papers/50000/Quaoar.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182808/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~jewitt/papers/50000/Quaoar.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182809/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621182809/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~cagnor/papers_pdf/2006AgnorHamilton.pdf","http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf","http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf","http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/gab.pdf","http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/gab.pdf","http://www.astro.umd.edu/~hamilton/research/reprints/AgHam06.pdf","http://www.astro.umd.edu/~hamilton/research/reprints/AgHam06.pdf"],"categories":["Kuiper
