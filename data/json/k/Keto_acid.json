Franz Dietrich Klingler,\nWolfgang Ebertz \"Oxocarboxylic Acids\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial\nChemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  In several cases, the keto group is\nhydrated. The alpha-keto acids are especially important in biology as they are\ninvolved in the Krebs citric acid cycle and in glycolysis. Nelson, D. L.;\nCox, M. M. \"Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry\" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New\nYork, 2000. ISBN 1-57259-153-6.\n\nCommon types of keto acids include: *Alpha-keto acids, or 2-oxoacids, such as\npyruvic acid, have the keto group adjacent to the carboxylic acid. Other\nimportant member is oxaloacetic acid. \"Î±-Oxocarboxylic Acids\" Robert C.\nKerber, Marian S. Fernando J. Chem. Educ., 2010,  *Beta-keto acids, or 3-\noxoacids, such as acetoacetic acid, have the ketone group at the second carbon\nfrom the carboxylic acid *Gamma-keto acids, or 4-oxoacids, such as levulinic\nacid, have the ketone group at the third carbon from the carboxylic acid.\n\nWhen ingested sugars and carbohydrate levels are low, stored fats and\nproteins are the primary source of energy production. Glucogenic amino acids\nfrom proteins are converted to glucose and fats can be used to form ketone\nbodies. Ketogenic amino acids can be deaminated to produce alpha keto acids\nand ketone bodies.\n\nAlpha keto acids are used primarily as energy for liver cells and in fatty acid\nsynthesis, also in the liver.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Keto_acid","recorded":1362537810,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Keto acids|*"],"headings":["References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Ketocarboxylic_Acids_General_Formulae_V.1.svg/220px-Ketocarboxylic_Acids_General_Formulae_V.1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Benzene_balls.png/30px-Benzene_balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Acetoacetic_acid","Levulinic_acid","Organic_compound","Carboxylic_acid","Ketone","Krebs_citric_acid_cycle","Glycolysis","Pyruvic_acid","Oxaloacetic_acid","Acetoacetic_acid","Levulinic_acid","Sugar","Carbohydrate","Glucogenic_amino_acid","Glucose","Fat","Ketone_bodies","Ketogenic_amino_acid","Fatty_acid_synthesis","Ulosonic_acid"]}
