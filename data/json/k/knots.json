It may consist of a length of one or several segments of\nrope, string, webbing, twine, strap, or even chain interwoven such that the line\ncan bind to itself or to some other object (the \"load\"). Knots have been the\nsubject of interest for their ancient origins, their common uses, and the area\nof mathematics known as knot theory.\n","title":"Knot","headings":["Use","Properties","Components","Categories","Knot theory","Physical theory of friction knots","Knot tying","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Bowline","3: Overhand_knot","3: Rope","3: Whipping_knot","2: Figure-eight_knot","2: Reef_knot","2: Square_knot","2: Trucker's_hitch","2: Diamond_hitch","2: Rope_splicing","2: Stopper_knot","2: Rolling_hitch","2: Water_knot","2: Standing_end","2: List_of_binding_knots","2: Slip_knot","2: Monkey's_fist","2: Nylon_webbing","1: The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots","1: Manrope_knot","1: Granny_knot","1: Wall_and_crown_knot","1: Matthew_Walker_knot","1: Shroud_knot","1: Turk's_head_knot","1: Two_half-hitches","1: Webbing","1: Twine","1: Strap","1: Chain","1: Knot_theory","1: Sailors","1: Scouting","1: Climbing","1: Caving","1: Arborists","1: Firefighter#Rescue","1: Fishermen","1: Surgeons","1: Mechanical_advantage","1: Spelunking","1: Munter_hitch","1: Donkey","1: Mule","1: Lanyard","1: Ropework","1: Textile","1: Macrame","1: Knitting","1: Fiber","1: Rope#Styles_of_rope_construction","1: Factor_of_safety","1: Safe_working_load","1: Flagpole","1: Backup_knot","1: Bowline#Tying","1: Carrick_bend","1: Zeppelin_bend","1: Forecastle","1: List_of_knots","1: Round_turn","1: Miller's_knot","1: Bend_knot","1: List_of_bend_knots","1: Decorative_knot","1: List_of_decorative_knots","1: Hitch_knot","1: List_of_hitch_knots","1: Lashing_knot","1: List_of_loop_knots","1: Braid","1: List_of_plait_knots","1: List_of_slip_knots","1: Seizing","1: List_of_seizing_knots","1: Sennit","1: Chain_sinnet","1: List_of_splices","1: Alpine_butterfly_knot","1: Constrictor_knot","1: Prusik","1: Sheet_bend","1: Sheet_bend#Double_sheet_bend","1: Spanish_bowline","1: Versatackle_knot","1: Buntline_hitch","1: Taut-line_hitch","1: Timber_hitch","1: Magic_trick","1: Joke","1: Puzzle","1: Grief_knot","1: Parlor_trick","1: Tom_fool's_knot","1: Topology","1: Mathematics","1: Alexander_polynomial","1: Trefoil_knot","1: Unknot","1: Monofilament_line","1: Kernmantle_rope","1: Figure-eight_loop","1: Fid","1: Wire_rope","1: Sheepsfoot_blade","1: Laid_rope","1: Chinese_knot","1: Quipu","1: Round_turn_and_two_half-hitches","1: Gordian_Knot","1: Clifford_Ashley","1: Palo_Alto,_California"]}
