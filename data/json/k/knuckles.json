The word is cognate to similar\nwords in other Germanic languages, such as the Dutch \"Knokkel\" (knuckle) or\nGerman \"Knöchel\" (ankle), i.e., Knöchlein, the diminutive of the German word for\nbone (Knochen). Anatomically, it is said that the knuckles consist of the\nmetacarpophalangeal<ref name=\"UTMntn\">Utah Mountain Biking;\n[http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/firstaid/thumbspr.htm Thumb Sprain]; First as\nmetacarpo.</ref> and interphalangeal joints of the finger. The knuckles at the\nbase of the fingers may be referred to as the 1st<ref name=\"UTMntn\"/> or major\nknuckles while the knuckles at the midfinger are known as the\n2nd<ref>[http://www.polykarbon.com/tutorials/hands/hands.htm Second knuckle as\nthumb's interphalangeal, \"anchor knuckle\" as metacarpophalangeal]</ref> and 3rd,\nor minor, knuckles.
