{"cursor":"39596","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Kin selection' refers to apparent strategies in evolution that favour the\nreproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the\norganism's own survival and reproduction. Charles Darwin was the first to\ndiscuss the concept of kin \"group\" selection. In the \"The Origin of Species\", he\nwrote clearly about altruistic sterile social insects that\n\nThis difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the\nfamily, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end.\nBreeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together. An animal\nthus characterized has been slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with\nconfidence to the same stock and has succeeded\"\n[www.classicreader.com/book/107/59/]\n\nIn this passage \"the family\" and \"stock\" stand for a kin group. These passages\nand others by Darwin about \"kin selection\" are highlighted in D.J. Futuyma's\ntextbook of reference \"Evolutionary Biology\" [(3rd edit.p595) ] and in E.O\nWilson's \"Sociobiology\" [25th edit.p117-118].\n\nThe earliest mathematically formal treatments of kin selection were by R.A.\nFisher in 1930  and J. B. S. Haldane in 1932  and\n1955. Later on, in works published in 1963 andâmost\nimportantlyâin 1964, W. D. Hamilton\npopularized the concept and the more thorough mathematical treatment given to it\nby George Price. The term \"kin selection\" may first have been coined by John\nMaynard Smith in 1964:\n\nThese processes I will call kin selection and group selection\nrespectively. Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton. â¦ By\nkin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival\nof close relatives of the affected individual, by processes which do not require\nany discontinuities in the population breeding structure.\n\n\nKin selection refers to changes in gene frequency across generations that are\ndriven at least in part by interactions between related individuals, and this\ndynamic forms much of the conceptual basis of the theory of social evolution.\nIndeed, some cases of evolution by natural selection can only be understood by\nconsidering how biological relatives influence one another's fitness. Under\nnatural selection, a gene encoding a trait that enhances the fitness of each\nindividual carrying it should increase in frequency within the population; and\nconversely, a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be\neliminated. However, a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances\nthe fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the\nbehavior, may nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry\nthe same gene. According to this fundamental principle of kin selection theory,\nthe enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the\nfitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour. As such, this\nis a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness (in that\ninclusive fitness refers simply to gene copies in other individuals without\nrequiring that they be kin). However, the validity of this analysis has recently\nbeen challenged. Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita & EO Wilson \"The\nevolution of eusociality\" Nature '466' 1057â1062(26 August 2010)  Wilson\nwrites that \"the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on\nthe theory of kin selection have crumbled\"  and now relies on the\ntheory of eusociality and \"gene-culture co-evolution\" for the underlying\nmechanics of sociobiology.\n\n\"Kin selection\" should not be confused with the notion of \"group selection\"\naccording to which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because\nit benefits the group as a whole, regardless of any benefit to individual\norganisms. All known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an\nindividual behavior can be evolutionary successful only if the genes responsible\nfor this behavior conform to Hamilton's Rule, and hence must, on balance and in\nthe aggregate, benefit from the behavior.\n","linknr":446,"url":"Kin_selection","recorded":1362483517,"links":46,"instances":["biology","biological","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/coev/pdf/charpentier/Charpentier%20et%20al%2008%20Int%20J%20Primatol.pdf","http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/coev/pdf/charpentier/Charpentier%20et%20al%2008%20Int%20J%20Primatol.pdf","http://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/marine_biodiversity/publications/_pdf/Duffy_et_al_2002_BES.PDF","http://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/marine_biodiversity/publications/_pdf/Duffy_et_al_2002_BES.PDF","http://www.ruf.rice.edu/%7Eevolve/pdf/20002001/CurBio2002_12_R832.pdf","http://westgroup.biology.ed.ac.uk/pdf/West_etal_06_altruism.pdf"],"categories":["Selection","Theories of history","Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Hamilton's rule","Mechanisms","Kin selection and human social patterns","Examples","Human examples","Non-human examples","Criticism","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/e/45e04de892df03ebd5164afd12ca346a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Kin_selection.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["trait","biological"],["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["fitness","biology"]],"members":["fitness","trait","locus"],"related":["Altruistic","Social_insects","R.A._Fisher","J._B._S._Haldane","W._D._Hamilton","George_R._Price","John_Maynard_Smith","Gene","Social_evolution","Evolution","Natural_selection","Fitness_(biology)","Natural_selection","Trait_(biological)","Population","Inclusive_fitness","Martin_Nowak","EO_Wilson","Eusociality","Sociobiology","Group_selection","Locus_(genetics)","Altruistic","W._D._Hamilton","Evolution","Relatedness","Sewall_Wright","Coefficient_of_relationship","Probability","Locus_(genetics)","Allele","Identical_by_descent","Regression_analysis","Spite","J.B.S._Haldane","Cousin_chart","Diploid","Inbred","Altruism","Altruism","Kin_recognition","Protozoa","Green-beard_effect","Kin_recognition","Inclusive_fitness","Evolutionary_psychology","Darwinian_anthropology","Nurture_kinship","Eusociality","Eusociality","Haplodiploid_sex-determination_system","Fitness_(biology)","Eusociality","Sun-tailed_monkey","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Sea_rocket","McMaster_University","Canada","Wood_mouse","Hamilton's_rule","Vervet_monkey","Allomothering","Primates","Animal_Behaviour","Synalpheus_regalis","Allozyme","Martin_Nowak","E._O._Wilson","Group_selection","Altruism","Ethnic_nepotism","Darwinian_anthropology","Kinship","Group_selection","Price_equation","Inclusive_fitness","The_Selfish_Gene","The_kinship_theory_of_genomic_imprinting"]}
