The committee\nwas a direct successor of such preceding agencies as Cheka, NKGB, and MGB. It\nwas the chief government agency of \"union-republican jurisdiction\", acting as\ninternal security, intelligence, and secret police. Similar agencies were\ninstated in each of the republics of the Soviet Union aside from the Russian\nSFSR and consisted of many ministries, state committees and state commissions.\n\nThe KGB also has been considered a military service and was governed by army\nlaws and regulations, similar to the Soviet Army or MVD Internal Troops. While\nmost of the KGB archives remain classified, two on-line documentary sources are\navailable.

[http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html JHU.edu],\narchive of documents about Communist Party of the Soviet Union and KGB,\ncollected by Vladimir Bukovsky. Its main functions were foreign\nintelligence, counterintelligence, operative-investigatory activities, guarding\nthe State Border of the USSR, guarding the leadership of the Central Committee\nof the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government,\norganization and ensuring of government communications as well as fight against\nnationalism, dissent, and anti-Soviet activities.\n\nAfter breaking away from the Republic of Georgia in the early 1990s with Russian\nhelp, the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia established its own KGB\n(keeping this unreformed\nname).
