The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in\nGreater London.\n\nKensington High Street is the continuation of Kensington Road and part of the\nA315. It starts by the entrance to Kensington Palace and runs westward\nthrough central Kensington. Near Kensington (Olympia) station, where the\nRoyal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ends and Hammersmith begins, it ends\nand becomes Hammersmith Road. The street is served by High Street Kensington\nunderground station.\n\nKensington High Street is one of western London's most popular shopping streets,\nwith upmarket shops serving a wealthy area. From the late 19th century until the\nmid-1970s the street had three classic department stores: Barkers, Derry & Toms\nand Pontings. Barkers bought Pontings in 1906 and Derry & Toms in 1920, but\ncontinued to run all three as separate entities. In a big building project which\nstarted in 1930 and was not complete until 1958 (the Second World War halted the\nproject), the company made Derry & Toms and Barkers into Art Deco palaces. On\ntop of Derry & Toms, Europe's largest roof garden area () was created,\nconsisting of three different gardens with 500 species of plants, fountains, a\nstream, duck, flamingos and a restaurant - said to serve the best high tea in\nKensington.\n\nIn 1957 House of Fraser bought the Barkers Group and started to dismantle it.\nPontings was closed in 1971, Derry & Toms in 1973, and a much condensed Barkers\n(from over seven floors to on less than four floors) was allowed to continue\nuntil January 2006, when the 135 year old department store was closed for\ngood.\n\nPart of the Barker premises has now been taken over by American Whole Foods\nMarket, which has opened the UK's first organic superstore there in June\n2007. The rest was added to existing office space\nused by the headquarters of Associated Newspapers.\n\nKensington High Street was also the site of Biba in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nWhen Derry & Toms closed, the iconic store took the building and accentuated its\nArt Deco style further. But the 1970s recession, coupled with idealistic\nbusiness ideas, killed Biba in 1975. The Derry & Toms roof gardens still remain,\nnow known as the Kensington Roof Gardens and owned since 1981 by Richard\nBranson's Virgin.\n\nKensington High Street's future as a shopping street has been threatened by the\nlarge Westfield London, which opened a short distance away in Shepherd's Bush in\nlate 2008.\n\nHowever, these factors may be offset to some extent - or even outweighed - by\nrecent changes to the road layout, intended to make the street a more pleasant\nplace to shop. The local council (Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea)\ndecided to experiment with the concept of shared space, which deputy leader\nDaniel Moylan had studied abroad. Railings and pedestrian crossings were\nremoved, thereby enabling pedestrians to cross the street wherever they choose.\nBicycle racks were placed on the central reservation. The effect over two years\nwas a dramatic cut in accidents, down 44% against a London average of 17%.\n\nIt is also the site of the former Roman Catholic Pro-Cathedral of England, Our\nLady of Victories, Kensington, now a parish church.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Kensington_High_Street","recorded":1374766760,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Kensington_High_Street&params=51_30_03_N_0_11_38_W_region:GB_type:landmark","/wiki/File:Kensington_High_Street.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Kensington_High_Street.jpg/300px-Kensington_High_Street.jpg","/wiki/File:Kensington_High_Street.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Kensington_High_Street.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Kensington_High_Street.JPG/300px-Kensington_High_Street.JPG","/wiki/File:Kensington_High_Street.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Central_Kensington.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Central_Kensington.png/300px-Central_Kensington.png","/wiki/File:Central_Kensington.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Kensington","/wiki/London","/wiki/London_Plan","#cite_note-london_plan_f08-1","/wiki/Kensington_Road","/wiki/Kensington_Palace","/wiki/Kensington_(Olympia)_station","/wiki/Royal_Borough_of_Kensington_and_Chelsea","/wiki/London_Borough_of_Hammersmith_and_Fulham","/wiki/Hammersmith_Road","/wiki/High_Street_Kensington_tube_station","/wiki/Department_store","/wiki/Derry_%26_Toms","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Art_Deco","/wiki/Kensington_Roof_Gardens","/wiki/House_of_Fraser","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market","/wiki/Organic_food","#cite_note-Design_Week-3","/wiki/Associated_Newspapers","/wiki/Biba","/wiki/Kensington_Roof_Gardens","/wiki/Richard_Branson","/wiki/Virgin_Group","/wiki/Westfield_London","/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush","/wiki/Royal_Borough_of_Kensington_and_Chelsea","/wiki/Shared_space","/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Moylan&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-shared_space-4","/wiki/Roman_Catholic","/wiki/Pro-Cathedral","/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Victories,_Kensington","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-london_plan_f08_1-0","/wiki/Mayor_of_London","http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf","/wiki/Greater_London_Authority","#cite_ref-2","http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article557174.ece","/wiki/The_Times","#cite_ref-Design_Week_3-0","http://www.designweek.co.uk/Articles/135005/Whole+Foods+Market+opens+London+flagship.html","/wiki/Design_Week","/wiki/Ecotricity","/wiki/Compost","/wiki/Recycling","#cite_ref-shared_space_4-0","http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/29/guardiancolumnists","/wiki/The_Guardian","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit&section=2","http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_91174_en.pdf","http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/archives/exhibitions/barkersofkensington/","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Kensington-high-street-20060330-029.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Kensington-high-street-20060330-029.jpg/120px-Kensington-high-street-20060330-029.jpg","/wiki/File:Kensington_High_St.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Kensington_High_St.jpg/120px-Kensington_High_St.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&oldid=543515726","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Streets_in_Kensington_and_Chelsea","/wiki/Category:Shopping_streets_in_London","/wiki/Category:Art_Deco_architecture_in_London","/wiki/Category:Major_centres_of_London","/wiki/Category:Kensington","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kensington+High+Street&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kensington+High+Street","/wiki/Kensington_High_Street","/wiki/Talk:Kensington_High_Street","#","/wiki/Kensington_High_Street","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kensington_High_Street&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Pa
