These are important in protein-protein\ninteractions with blood coagulation factors. The name Kringle comes from the\nScandinavian pastry that these structures resemble.\n\nKringle domains have been found in plasminogen, hepatocyte growth factors,\nprothrombin, and apolipoprotein(a).\n\nKringles are found throughout the blood clotting and fibrinolytic proteins.\nKringle domains are believed to play a role in binding mediators (e.g.,\nmembranes, other proteins or phospholipids), and in the regulation of\nproteolytic activity.
