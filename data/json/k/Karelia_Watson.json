Advocates of Watson claim that Apple copied the features of Watson\nwithout permission, compensation, or attribution. Apple, however, claims that a\nWatson-like program was simply the natural evolution of Sherlock 2.\n\nAt Sun Microsystems JavaOne conference in June 2004, Sun announced that they had\nlicensed the Watson technology and were porting it to the Java programming\nlanguage under the name Project Alameda. On October 5, development of the Cocoa-\nbased version of Watson ceased. On November 24, Dan Wood, Karelia owner and\nWatson lead developer, made the last version of Watson available free of charge\nby posting a registration code on his weblog.\n[http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/WatsonStatus.html]\n","linknr":97,"url":"Karelia_Watson","recorded":1362675427,"links":11,"instances":["software","programming_language","software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mac OS-only software|Watson"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c2/Am_watson.png/250px-Am_watson.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cocoa","software"],["sherlock","software"],["sherlock","software"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["sherlock","java","cocoa"],"related":["Karelia_Software","Mac_OS_X","Web_service","Karelia_Software","Apple_Macintosh","Mac_OS_X","Objective-C","Cocoa_(software)","Operating_system","Apple_Computer","Sherlock_(software)","Mac_OS_X_v10.2","Sherlock_(software)","Sun_Microsystems","JavaOne","Java_(programming_language)","Project_Alameda","Site-specific_browser"]}
