Kilby, Meghan E.\nTurnis, and Drew L. Murphy 102 Journal of Chemical Education â¢ Vol. 85 No. 1\nJanuary '2008' :\n\n:\n\nBecause of the preference for the formation of one product over another, the\nreaction is selective. This reaction is regioselective because it selectively\ngenerates one constitutional isomer rather than the other.\n\nCertain examples of regioselectivity have been formulated as rules for certain\nclasses of compounds under certain conditions, many of which are named. Among\nthe first introduced to chemistry students are Markovnikov's rule for the\naddition of protic acids to alkenes, and the FÃ¼rst-Plattner rule for the\naddition of nucleophiles to derivatives of cyclohexene, especially epoxide\nderivatives.

FÃ¼rst, A.;\nPlattner, P. A. Helv. Chim. Acta 1949, 32, 275\n\nRegioselectivity in ring-closure reactions is subject to Baldwin's rules. If\nthere are two or more orientations that can be generated during a reaction, one\nof them is dominant (e.g., Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov addition across a\ndouble bond)\n\nRegioselectivity can also be applied to specific reactions such as addition to\npi ligands.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Regioselectivity","recorded":1362504736,"links":22,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stereochemistry"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/RegioselectivityInhalohydrinformation.svg/445px-RegioselectivityInhalohydrinformation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_bond","Proton","Base_(chemistry)","Benzene","Substituent","Halohydrin_formation_reaction","2-propenylbenzene","Journal_of_Chemical_Education","Constitutional_isomer","Markovnikov's_rule","Acid","Alkene","Fürst-Plattner_rule","Nucleophile","Cyclohexene","Epoxide","Ring-closure_reaction","Baldwin's_rules","Addition_to_pi_ligands","Cryptoregiochemistry","Chemoselectivity","Stereoselectivity"]}
