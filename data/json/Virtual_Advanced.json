It was a shareware\nbulletin board system (BBS) for DOS (and later OS/2) that was conceived by\nRoland De Graaf in 1990. Written from scratch in QuickBASIC, it developed a\nloyal following. Originally it was a door for WWIV, but quickly grew into an\noriginal BBS concept on its own. By 1993, there were thousands of computers\nrunning VBBS around the world. VirtualNET, the largest VBBS message network, had\nclose to 1500 members by version 6.14 in 1993.\n\nUp to this time, VBBS remained shareware, but in 1994 Roland released version\n7.0 as a commercial product. The lifetime registrations of prior versions were\nnot honored for this version and required anyone who wished to use this version\nto pay. While some did decide to pay again for the upgrade, others became\nunsatisfied and began looking for other alternatives. There would not be another\nrelease of VBBS.\n\nInstead, Roland switched gears again in 1995. He released 'Virtual Advanced'\n(VADV) as the successor to VBBS. VADV contained many improvements to the old\nsystem. One notable feature was a much more powerful scripting language. It was\na step forward for the software but once again SysOps were required to purchase\nthe new software.\n\nVirtual Advanced would finally reach version 2.10. This version along with its\ncompanion, the 'Virtual Internet Survivor Kit' (VISK) v1.30, would show that it\nindeed was \"advanced\" for its time. With the growing trend of the Internet, VADV\nnow supported features such as POP3, SMTP, NNTP, WWW and Finger.\n\nUltimately, with the rise of the Internet, costs of upgrades and tensions within\nthe support network, Virtual Advanced all but faded away.\n\nIn 1998, Roland, who was legally blind, suffered a detached retina in his good\neye and had to have immediate surgery to repair it. It would take years for him\nto recover and he never returned to the BBS scene.\n\nVirtual Advanced was frozen in its current state. Only a handful of systems\nsurvived with the disappearance of its creator. VirtualNET did not survive.\n\nIn late 1999, Steve Winn, a loyal VBBS supporter and script writer, began to\nhelp revive the dying software. He and other loyal supporters began to rekindle\ninterest in the software. A support site was born and from it grew AspectNet, a\nsupport network.\n\nIn 2002, Steve created the 'VADV-PHP' project. This was a web front-end for\nVirtual Advanced. Users could access the BBS functions using a familiar web\ninterface.\n\nIn 2003, a telnet server was developed by John Tipton called 'VADV32'. A version\n2.0 was released in 2005,.\n\nVirtualNET was reborn in early 2005. The six year old support network AspectNet\nwould surrender its existence to allow the rebirth.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Virtual_Advanced","recorded":1375059165,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Software_developer","/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle","/wiki/Operating_system","/wiki/MS-DOS","/wiki/OS/2","/wiki/List_of_software_categories","/wiki/Bulletin_board_system","/wiki/Software_license","/wiki/Proprietary_software","http://www.virtualc.com/","/wiki/Bulletin_board_system","/wiki/QuickBASIC","/wiki/WWIV","/wiki/Shareware","/wiki/POP3","/wiki/SMTP","/wiki/NNTP","/wiki/WWW","/wiki/Finger_(Unix)","/wiki/Internet","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=edit&section=1","http://www.vadvbbs.com","http://www.vadvphp.com","http://vadv32.at2k.org","http://web-bbs.at2k.org","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&oldid=524576330","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Bulletin_board_system_software","/wiki/Category:1990_introductions","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Virtual+Advanced&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Virtual+Advanced","/wiki/Virtual_Advanced","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Virtual_Advanced&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Virtual_Advanced","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Virtual_Advanced","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Virtual_Advanced","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&oldid=524576330","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7934924","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Virtual_Advanced&id=524576330","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Virtual+Advanced","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Virtual+Advanced&oldid=524576330&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Virtual_Advanced&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7934924#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Advanced","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["unix"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bulletin board system software","1990 introductions"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["finger","unix"]],"members":["finger"],"related":["MS-DOS","OS/2","Bulletin_board_system","Proprietary_software","Bulletin_board_system","QuickBASIC","WWIV","Shareware","POP3","SMTP","NNTP","WWW","Finger_(Unix)","Internet"]}
