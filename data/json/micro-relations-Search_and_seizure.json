This right is generally based on the premise that everyone is entitled\nto a reasonable right to privacy.\n\nThough interpretation may vary, this right sometimes requires law enforcement to\nobtain a search warrant before engaging in any form of search and seizure. In\ncases where evidence is seized in a search, that evidence might be rejected by\ncourt procedures, such as with a [[motion to suppress]] the evidence under the\n[[exclusionary rule]].\n","linknr":230,"url":"Search_and_seizure","recorded":1362554237,"links":29,"instances":["legal_system"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evidence law","Law enforcement agency powers","Searches and seizures|"],"headings":["United States","Figurative or constructive searches {{anchor|Figurative search|Constructive search}}","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Vehicle_drug_search_australia.jpg/250px-Vehicle_drug_search_australia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/DEA_Operation_Reciprocity_-_money_seizure.gif/220px-DEA_Operation_Reciprocity_-_money_seizure.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["civil_law","legal_system"]],"members":["civil_law"],"related":["Civil_law_(legal_system)","Common_law","Police","Crime","Constitution","Privacy","Search_warrant","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","United_States_Constitution","Consent_searches","Reasonable_expectation_of_privacy","Curtilage","Motor_vehicle_exception","Exigent_circumstances","Probable_cause","Probable_cause","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Exclusionary_rule","Administrative_law","Supreme_Court","Investigatory_power","Supreme_Court","Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr.","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Search_warrant","Probable_cause","Constructive_search","Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Corporations","Frisking","INTERPOL","KGB","Proactive_policing","Search_of_persons","Strip_search","Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms,_and_Explosives","No-knock_warrant","DEA","FBI","Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement","United_States_Border_Patrol","United_States_Customs_and_Border_Protection","United_States_Marshals_Service","United_States_Secret_Service","Minimally_intrusive_warrantless_search","Search_and_Seizure_Law_in_Pennsylvania"]}
