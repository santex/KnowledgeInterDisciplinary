{"cursor":"3392","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:\"Public morals\" redirects here. For the television series, see [[Public Morals\n:(TV series)]].\n'Public morality' refers to moral and ethical standards enforced in a society,\nby law or police work or social pressure, and applied to public life, to the\ncontent of the media, and to conduct in public places. A famous remark of Mrs\nPatrick Campbell, that she did not care what people did as long as they \"didn't\nfrighten the horses\" shows that in some sense even high tolerance expects a\npublic limitation on behaviour (sexual conduct is implied here). At the opposite\nextreme a theocracy may equate public morality with religious instruction, and\ngive both the equal force of law.\n\nPublic morality often means regulation of sexual matters, including prostitution\nand homosexuality, but also matters of dress and nudity, pornography,\nacceptability in social terms of cohabitation before marriage, and the\nprotection of children. It is a main justification for censorship; it can lead\nto campaigns against profanity, and so be at odds with freedom of speech.\nGambling is generally controlled: casinos have been considered much more of a\nthreat than large-scale lotteries or football pools. Public drunkenness is quite\nunacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of alcohol is\noften justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons\nor to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has\nsometimes followed on similar reasoning. Abortion is sometimes treated as an\naspect of public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical\nprofessionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. AIDS as a health\npolicy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.\n\nViews on public morality do change over time. For example, there have been\nproscriptions against eating in the street or allowing women to smoke in public.\nThese examples show that public views on which things which are acceptable often\nmove towards wider tolerance. Rapid shifts the other way are often characterised\nby moral panics, as in the shutting down of theatres a generation after\nShakespeare's death by the English Puritans.\n\nIt may also be applied to the morals of public life. Political corruption, or\nthe telling of lies in public statements, tarnish not only individual\npoliticians, but the entire conduct of political life, whether at local or\nnational level. These are fairly universally regarded as blots on reputations,\nthough in some cases there is a grey area between corruption and legitimate fund-\nraising. Whether the private lives of politicians are a public morals issue is\nnot a matter of agreement, internationally speaking; the existence of an\nextramarital relationship of a Prime Minister would in some countries be\nconsidered a revelation well within the sphere of the public interest, while in\nother countries it would be considered quite irrelevant.\n","linknr":116,"url":"public_morality","recorded":1372152566,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Public_Morals_(TV_series)","/wiki/Morality","/wiki/Mass_media","/wiki/Public_place","/wiki/Mrs_Patrick_Campbell","/wiki/Toleration","/wiki/Theocracy","/wiki/Prostitution","/wiki/Homosexuality","/wiki/Nudity","/wiki/Pornography","/wiki/Cohabitation","/wiki/Marriage","/wiki/Censorship","/wiki/Profanity","/wiki/Freedom_of_speech","/wiki/Gambling","/wiki/Casino","/wiki/Lotteries","/wiki/Football_pools","/wiki/Alcohol","/wiki/Abortion","/wiki/AIDS","/wiki/Moral_panic","/wiki/Puritan","/wiki/Political_corruption","/wiki/Public_interest","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mutaween","/wiki/Islamization_of_the_Gaza_Strip","/wiki/Victorian_morality","/wiki/Social_conservatism","/wiki/Religious_Organisations","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit&section=2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&oldid=540924716","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Morality","/wiki/Category:Sociological_terminology","/wiki/Category:Moral_communities","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Public+morality&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Public+morality","/wiki/Public_morality","/wiki/Talk:Public_morality","#","/wiki/Public_morality","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Public_morality","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Public_morality","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&oldid=540924716","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Public_morality&id=540924716","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Public+morality","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Public+morality&oldid=540924716&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Public_morality&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordre_moral","//hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javni_moral","//sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javni_moral","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julkinen_moraali","//th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%99","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3176693#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_morality","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?
