Retrieved September 7, 2012, from\n[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neanderthal?s=t link]. ) are a now-\nextinct species or subspecies of the genus [[Homo (genus)|Homo]] that is closely\nrelated to modern humans. They are known from fossil specimens, dating from the\nPleistocene period, that have been found in Europe and parts of western and\ncentral Asia. \"Neanderthal\" is German for \"Neander's Valley,\" which is the\nregion of Germany where the species was first discovered. (The species name is\nalso sometimes spelled Neandertal, because that is the modern German spelling of\nthe valley's name.)\n\nNeanderthals are classified either as a subspecies of [[Homo sapiens]] ('Homo\nsapiens neanderthalensis') or as a separate species of the same genus ('Homo\nneanderthalensis'). The first humans with proto-\nNeanderthal traits are believed to have existed in Europe as early as\n600,000â350,000 years ago. Specimens with proto-Neanderthal traits\nare occasionally grouped instead with another phenetic species, such as [[Homo\nheidelbergensis]], or a migrant form, [[Homo rhodesiensis]].\n\nWhen the Neanderthals went extinct is disputed. Fossils found in the Vindija\nCave in Croatia have been dated to between 33,000 and 32,000 years old, and\nNeanderthal artefacts from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are believed to be less\nthan 30,000 years ago, but a recent study has re-dated fossils at two Spanish\nsites as 45,000 years old, 10,000 years older than previously thought, and may\ncast doubt on recent dates at other sites. Cro-Magnon (early-modern-human)\nskeletal remains showing certain \"Neanderthal traits\" have been found in Lagar\nVelho (Portugal) and dated to 24,500 years ago, suggesting that there may have\nbeen an extensive admixture of the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal populations in\nthat region.\n\nSeveral cultural assemblages have been linked to the Neanderthals in Europe.\nThe earliest, the Mousterian stone tool culture, dates to about 300,000 years\nago. Skinner, A., B. Blackwell, R. Long, M.R. Seronie-Vivien, A.-M.\nTillier and\nJ. Blickstein; New ESR dates for a new bone-bearing layer at Pradayrol, Lot,\n   France; Paleoanthropology Society March 28, 2007 Late Mousterian\n   artifacts were found in Gorham's Cave on the south-facing coast of\n   Gibraltar. Outside Europe, Mousterian tools were made by both\n   Neanderthals and early modern homo sapiens. (Donald Johanson & Blake Edgar\n   (2006) From Lucy to Language, Simon & Schuster, p. 272) Other tool\n   cultures associated with the Neanderthals include the ChÃ¢telperronian, the\n   Aurignacian, and the Gravettian; their tool assemblages appear to have\n   developed gradually within their populations, rather than being introduced by\n   new population groups arriving in the region. {{Cite journal |author=R.G.\n   Bednarik |title=The Expulsion of Eve |journal=Developments in Primatology\n   |pages=25â55 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-9353-3_2 |url=http://www.spr-\n   inger.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781441993526-\n   c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1154940-p174101060 |accessdate=10 Nov 2011 |quote=\n   '>Timing it by the end of the fossils we choose to include with the\n   \"Neanderthals\", or the stone tools we call Middle Paleolithic, would be\n   another option, but the first end 28 ka ago, while the second marker could be\n   set anywhere from 40 to 10 ka ago in Europe, and even much later elsewhere'\n   page 45 |isbn=978-1-4419-9352-6 }}\n\nNeanderthal cranial capacity is thought to have been as large as that of modern\nhumans, perhaps larger, indicating that their brain size may have been\ncomparable, or larger, as well. In 2008, a group of scientists created a study\nusing three-dimensional computer-assisted reconstructions of Neanderthal infants\nbased on fossils found in Russia and Syria. The study showed Neanderthal and\nmodern human brains were the same size at birth, but by adulthood, the\nNeanderthal brain was larger than the modern human brain. They were\nmuch stronger than modern humans, having particularly strong arms and\nhands. Males stood and females about tall.\n\nGenetic evidence published in 2010 suggests that Neanderthals contributed to the\nDNA of anatomically modern humans, probably through interbreeding between 80,000\nand 50,000 years ago with the population of anatomically modern humans who had\nrecently migrated from Africa. According to the study, by the time that\npopulation began dispersing across Eurasia, Neanderthals genes constituted as\nmuch as 1â4% of its genome.\n","linknr":1398,"url":"Neanderthal","recorded":1362373280,"links":129,"instances":["archaeology","geneticist","archaeology","biology","surname","journal","cave","geologist","biology","german"],"pdf":["http://www.paleoanthro.org/journal/content/PA20090096.pdf","http://www.uni-greifswald.de/~histor/~ufg/mitarbeiter/terberger/Terberger1_LoRes.pdf","http://www.uni-greifswald.de/~histor/~ufg/mitarbeiter/terberger/Terberger1_LoRes.pdf","http://www.icp.inpg.fr/OHLL/lesPubliRapports/JPhonetics.pdf","http://www.icp.inpg.fr/OHLL/lesPubliRapports/JPhonetics.pdf"],"categories":["Neanderthals|","Fossil
