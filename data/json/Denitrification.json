The preferred nitrogen\nelectron acceptors in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include\nnitrate (NO 3â ), nitrite (NO 2â ),\nnitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2O) finally resulting in the\nproduction of dinitrogen (N 2) completing the nitrogen cycle.\n\nThe process is performed primarily by heterotrophic bacteria (such as\n[[Paracoccus denitrificans]] and various pseudomonads), Carlson, C. A., and\nJ. L. Ingraham. 1983. Comparison of denitrification by Pseudomonas stutzeri,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, and Paracoccus denitrificans. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.\n45:1247-1253. although autotrophic denitrifiers have also been identified\n(e.g., [[Thiobacillus]] denitrificans). Baalsrud, K., and K. S. Baalsrud.\n1954.

Generally several species of\nbacteria are involved in the complete reduction of nitrate to molecular\nnitrogen, and more than one enzymatic pathway have been identified in the\nreduction process.

Other genes known in microorganisms\nwhich denitrify include nir (nitrite reductase) and nos (nitrous oxide\nreductase) among others; Zumft, W. 1997.

Rev. 61:533-616. organisms\nidentified as having these genes include [[Alcaligenes faecalis]], Alcaligenes\nxylosoxidans, many in the Pseudomonas genus, [[Bradyrhizobium japonicum]], and\nBlastobacter denitrificans.
