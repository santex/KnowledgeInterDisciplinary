The\n temperature required to restore free rotation on the NMR timescale is a measure\n of the strength of the aurophilic interaction. ]]\n\nIn chemistry, 'aurophilicity' refers to the tendency of gold complexes to\naggregate via formation of weak gold-gold bonds.\n\nThe main evidence for aurophilicity is from the crystallographic analysis of\nAu(I) complexes. The 'aurophilic bond' is assigned a length of about 3.0 Ã and a\nstrength of about 7â12 kcal/mol, which is comparable to\nthe strength of a hydrogen bond. The aurophilic interaction is thought to result\nfrom electron correlation of the closed-shell components, which is unusual in\nlight of the fact that closed-shell atoms generally have negligible interaction\nwith one another at distances on the scale of the Au-Au bond. This is somewhat\nsimilar to van der Waals interactions, but is unusually strong due to\nrelativistic effects. Observations and theory show that, on average, 28% of the\nbinding energy in aurophilic interaction can be attributed to relativistic\nexpansion of the gold d orbitals.\n\nA manifestation of aurophilicity is the propensity of gold centres to aggregate.\nWhile both intra- and inter-molecular aurophilic interactions have been\nobserved, only intramolecular aggregation has been observed at such nucleation\nsites.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Aurophilicity","recorded":1362375648,"links":15,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gold","Chemical bonding"],"headings":["Role in self-assembly","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/P-steric.jpg/280px-P-steric.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Au-poly1.jpg/240px-Au-poly1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complex","chemistry"]],"members":["complex"],"related":["Phosphine","NMR_spectroscopy","Chemistry","Gold","Complex_(chemistry)","Crystallography","Angstrom","Kilocalorie","Hydrogen_bond","Electron_correlation","Closed-shell","Van_der_Waals_forces","Relativistic_quantum_chemistry","Electron_configuration","Hydrogen","Polymer","Solvent","Electromagnetic_spectrum"]}
