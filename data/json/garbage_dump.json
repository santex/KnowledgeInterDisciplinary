Historically,\nlandfills have been the most common methods of organized waste disposal and\nremain so in many places around the world. Some landfills are also used for\nwaste management purposes, such as the temporary storage, consolidation and\ntransfer, or processing of waste material (sorting, treatment, or recycling).\n\nA landfill also may refer to ground that has been filled in with rocks instead\nof waste materials, so that it can be used for a specific purpose, such as for\nbuilding houses. Unless they are stabilized, these areas may experience severe\nshaking or liquefaction of the ground in a large earthquake.\n",
