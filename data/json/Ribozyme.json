The 1981 discovery of ribozymes demonstrated that RNA can be both\ngenetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like protein enzymes),\nand contributed to the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that RNA may have\nbeen important in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems. Also\ntermed catalytic RNA, ribozymes function within the ribosome (as part of the\nlarge subunit ribosomal RNA) to link amino acids during protein synthesis, and\nin a variety of RNA processing reactions, including RNA splicing, viral\nreplication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. Examples of ribozymes include the\nhammerhead ribozyme, the VS ribozyme and the hairpin ribozyme.\n\nInvestigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the\nlaboratory that are capable of catalyzing their own synthesis under very\nspecific conditions, such as an RNA polymerase ribozyme. Mutagenesis and selection has been performed\nresulting in isolation of improved variants of the \"Round-18\" polymerase\nribozyme from 2001. \"B6.61\" is able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer\ntemplate in 24 hours, until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester\nbonds. The \"tC19Z\" ribozyme can add up to 95\nnucleotides with a fidelity of 0.0083 mutations/nucleotide.\n\nSome ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents, as enzymes\nwhich target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as biosensors, and for\napplications in functional genomics and gene discovery.\n","linknr":388,"url":"Ribozyme","recorded":1362508232,"links":47,"instances":["biochemistry","protein","genetics","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA","Ribozymes|","Catalysts","Biomolecules","Enzymes|*","Metabolism","Chemical kinetics","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Discovery","Activity","Known ribozymes","Artificial ribozymes","Applications","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Full_length_hammerhead_ribozyme.png/170px-Full_length_hammerhead_ribozyme.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Ribozyme.jpg/300px-Ribozyme.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["splicing","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["cell","biology"],["chaperone","protein"]],"members":["cofactor","chaperone","splicing","translation","cell"],"related":["RNA","Enzymes","DNA","RNA_world_hypothesis","Ribosome","Translation_(biology)","RNA_processing","RNA_splicing","Viral_replication","Transfer_RNA","Hammerhead_ribozyme","VS_ribozyme","Hairpin_ribozyme","Origin_of_life","Autocatalysis","RNA_polymerase","Nucleotides","Nucleotides","Biosensor","Functional_genomics","Enzyme","Protein","Catalysis","Carl_Woese","Francis_Crick","Leslie_Orgel","Secondary_structure","Thomas_R._Cech","Splicing_(genetics)","Cilia","Protozoan","Sidney_Altman","RNase_P","Intron","TRNA","Thomas_R._Cech","Sidney_Altman","Nobel_Prize","Chemistry","Thomas_R._Cech","Sidney_Altman","University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder","Introns","Phosphodiester","Yale_University","TRNA","Ribosome","Molecular_machine","Translation_(biology)","RNA_Tertiary_Structure","Mg2+","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Divalent","Cations","Phenylalanine","C3_ribozyme","Walter_Gilbert","Cell_(biology)","DNA","Protein","RNA_world_hypothesis","Origin_of_life","Living_fossil","Prion","Protein_folding","Chemical_conformation","Chaperone_(protein)","Concatemer","Ribosomal_RNA","RNase_P","Group_I_catalytic_intron","Group_II_intron","GIR1_branching_ribozyme","Leadzyme","Hairpin_ribozyme","Hammerhead_ribozyme","Hepatitis_delta_virus_ribozyme","Mammalian_CPEB3_ribozyme","VS_ribozyme","GlmS_glucosamine-6-phosphate_activated_ribozyme","Beta-globin_co-transcriptional_cleavage_ribozyme","Polymerase","Reverse_transcriptase","CDNA","Mutagenic_PCR","Ligase_ribozyme","Biotin","Covalent_bond","Ligase","Streptavidin","HIV","Deoxyribozyme","Spiegelman_Monster","Catalysis","Enzyme","RNA_world_hypothesis","Peptide_nucleic_acid","Nucleic_acid_analogues","PAH_world_hypothesis","Systematic_Evolution_of_Ligands_by_Exponential_Enrichment","OLE_RNA"]}
