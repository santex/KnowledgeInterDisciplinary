In ethics, integrity is regarded as the\nhonesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can be regarded\nas the opposite of hypocrisy,<ref>{{cite book|title=Contemporary rhetorical\ntheory: a reader|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-401-\n4|pages=92|author=John Louis Lucaites|coauthors=Celeste Michelle Condit, Sally\nCaudill|editor= }}</ref> in that integrity regards internal consistency as a\nvirtue, and suggests that parties holding apparently conflicting values should\naccount for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs.\n\nThe word \"integrity\" stems from the Latin adjective integer (whole,\ncomplete).<ref> {{cite encyclopedia\n | encyclopedia = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language title\n | = integrity url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/70/I0177000.html accessdate =\n | 2009-05-13 edition = 4th edition year = 2000 publisher = El- shaddai ØØØ\n | quote = ... from integer, whole, complete\n}} </ref> In this context, integrity is the inner sense of \"wholeness\" deriving\nfrom qualities such as honesty and consistency of character. As such, one may\njudge that others \"have integrity\" to the extent that they act according to the\nvalues, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.\n\nA value system's abstraction depth and range of applicable interaction may also\nfunction as significant factors in identifying integrity due to their congruence\nor lack of congruence with observation. A value system may evolve over time<ref>\nSee for example {{cite journal\n| last = Wiener first = Yoash year = 1988 month = October title = Forms of\n| Valubananae Systems: A Focus on Organizational Effectiveness and Cultural\n| Change and Maintenance journal = The Academy of Management Review volume = 13\n| issue = 4 pages = 534–545 publisher = Academy of Management jstor = 258373\n| quote = An organizational value system may change and evolve. The typology\n| offered above can be useful in analyzing such developments. Initial phases of\n| culture development most frequently are characterized by a charismatic value\n| system, either elitist or functional.\n}} </ref> while retaining integrity if those who espouse the values account for\nand resolve inconsistencies.<ref> Compare {{cite journal\n| last = Alee first = Verna authorlink = Verna Allee year = 2000 title = The\n| value evolution: Addressing larger implications of an intellectual capital and\n| intangibles perspective journal = Journal of Intellectual Capital volume = 1\n| issue = 1 pages = 19, 23 pages = 17–32 publisher = MCB University Press Ltd\n| issn = 1469-1930 doi = 10.1108/14691930010371627 url = http://www.openvaluenetworks.com/Articles/The_Value_Evolution-\n| VA.pdf format = PDF accessdate = 2010-05-28 quote = We must begin to evolve\n| our frameworks to an expanded view of potential value domains.
