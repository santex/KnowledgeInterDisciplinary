{"cursor":"3675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'structure' on a set, or more generally a type, consists of\nadditional mathematical objects that in some manner attach (or relate) to the\nset, making it easier to visualize or work with, or endowing the collection with\nmeaning or significance.\n\nA partial list of possible structures are measures, algebraic structures\n(groups, fields, etc.), topologies, metric structures (geometries), orders,\nequivalence relations, differential structures, and categories.\n\nSometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously; this\nenables mathematicians to study it more richly. For example, an order induces\na topology. As another example, if a set both has a topology and is a group,\nand the two structures are related in a certain way, the set becomes a\ntopological group.\n\nMappings between sets which preserve structures (so that structures in the\ndomain are mapped to equivalent structures in the codomain) are of special\ninterest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are homomorphisms, which\npreserve algebraic structures; homeomorphisms, which preserve topological\nstructures; and diffeomorphisms, which preserve differential structures.\n\nN. Bourbaki suggested an explication of the concept \"mathematical structure\" in\n   their book \"Theory of Sets\" (Chapter 4. Structures) and then defined on that\n   base, in particular, a very general concept of isomorphism.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Mathematical_structure","recorded":1362371499,"links":32,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","journal","mathematical_logic","category_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Type theory","Set theory","Mathematical structures"],"headings":["Example: the real numbers","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["category","category_theory"],["map","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["metric","mathematics"],["metric","mathematics"],["flatness","mathematics"],["structure","mathematical_logic"],["science","journal"]],"members":["metric","map","group","science","structure","category","flatness","set","field"],"related":["Mathematics","Set_(mathematics)","Intuitionistic_type_theory","Mathematical_object","Measure_theory","Algebraic_structure","Group_(mathematics)","Field_(mathematics)","Topology","Metric_space","Geometry","Order_theory","Equivalence_relation","Differential_structure","Category_(category_theory)","Topological_group","Map_(mathematics)","Homomorphism","Homeomorphism","Diffeomorphism","Nicolas_Bourbaki","Real_number","Field_(mathematics)","Length","Lebesgue_measure","Metric_(mathematics)","Metric_(mathematics)","Flatness_(mathematics)","Ordered_field","Lie_group","Topological_group","Abstract_algebra","Abstract_structure","Algebraic_structure","Structure_(mathematical_logic)","Science_(journal)","Educational_Studies_in_Mathematics","Cambridge_University_Press"]}
