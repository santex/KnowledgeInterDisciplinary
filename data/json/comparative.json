The\ncomparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these\nwords take the -er suffix or modifying word more or less (e.g. fast<u>er</u>,\n<u>more</u> intelligent, <u>less</u> wasteful); it can also, however, appear\nwhen no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g. more men\nthan women). The syntax of comparative constructions is poorly understood due to\nthe complexity of the data. In particular, the comparative frequently occurs\nwith independent mechanisms of syntax such as coordination and forms of ellipsis\n(gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, verb phrase\nellipsis). The interaction of the various mechanisms complicates the analysis.\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although\nthese means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n","title":"comparative","headings":["Examples","''-er'' vs. ''more''","Comparatives without ''than''","Comparative coordination vs. comparative subordination","Comparative deletion and subdeletion","Independent ellipsis mechanisms in ''than''-clauses","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Gapping","3: Pseudogapping","3: Verb_phrase_ellipsis","2: Superlative","1: Comparison_in_English","1: Advertising","1: Glasgow's_miles_better","1: Greater_celandine","1: Lesser_celandine","1: Lesser_panda","1: Giant_panda","1: Lesser_Antilles","1: Greater_Antilles","1: Metropolitan_area","1: Suburb","1: Greater_London","1: City_of_London","1: New_York","1: New_York_City","1: Coordination","1: Degree_of_comparison","1: Fewer_vs._less","1: Subordination"]}
