The character is introduced in\nthe first episode as the newly married wife of Gary Ewing, the son of oil barons\nJock and Miss Ellie Ewing. Initially a recurring character in Dallas, Van Ark's\nrole in the franchise grew much more prominent when she was transferred to Knots\nLanding and promoted to a starring role, though she continued to make small\nappearances in Dallas before she left the show completely. Van Ark appeared in\nKnots Landing for thirteen of its fourteen seasons, which made her one of the\nshow's longest running stars. The character made her last television appearance\nin 1997, when she appeared in the Knots Landing reunion series [[Knots Landing:\nBack to the Cul-de-Sac]], and was reunited with several former cast members. In\n2013, Van Ark will reprise her character for the new, updated version of\n[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]].\n\nValene's storyline in the first season of Dallas focuses on the rebuilding of\nher former marriage to estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in\nTexas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into the drama of\nthe Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly\nfalls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs\ncreated a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and\nGary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her\ncharacter outline. She recalled, \"I remember going to wardrobe and getting a\npeachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that\nTexas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by\nlayer.\"\n\nVan Ark received positive reviews for her portrayal of Valene, and received two\n[[Soap Opera Digest]] award nominations in the category \"Outstanding Actress in\na Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial\". Greg Hernandez said, \"Her character of\nValene was a best-selling author, but her personal life was always a mess. She\nhad her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman, then got pregnant by him, her\ntwin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at\ngunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give\nElizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford)\nmade for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped\nrooting for them to get back together.\"\n","linknr":417,"url":"Valene_Ewing","recorded":1362685460,"links":31,"instances":["actor","writer","2012_tv_series","media"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dallas (TV franchise) characters|Ewing, Valene","Fictional characters introduced in 1978|Ewing, Valene","Fictional writers|Ewing, Valene"],"headings":["Development","Character Arc","Reception","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/82/Valene_Ewing.jpg/235px-Valene_Ewing.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Donna_Mills_at_Air_America_premier2.jpg/150px-Donna_Mills_at_Air_America_premier2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Joan_Van_Ark.jpg/150px-Joan_Van_Ark.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_jacobs","writer"],["spin-off","media"],["david_jacobs","writer"],["david_jacobs","writer"],["jim_davis","actor"],["dallas","2012_tv_series"]],"members":["jim_davis","david_jacobs","dallas"],"related":["Joan_Van_Ark","Joan_Van_Ark","David_Jacobs_(writer)","California","Lilimae_Clements","Joshua_Rush","Bobby_Ewing_II","Lucy_Ewing","Joan_Van_Ark","Fictional_character","CBS","Soap_opera","Spin-off_(media)","Gary_Ewing","Jock_Ewing","Miss_Ellie_Ewing","Lucy_Ewing","David_Jacobs_(writer)","Dallas,_Texas","Lucy_Ewing","Charlene_Tilton","David_Jacobs_(writer)","Estée_Lauder_Companies","David_Ackroyd","NBC","Gary_Ewing","Abby_Cunningham","Ted_Shackelford","J.R._Ewing","Larry_Hagman","Julie_Harris","Jock_Ewing","Jim_Davis_(actor)","Miss_Ellie_Ewing","Barbara_Bel_Geddes","Bobby_Ewing","Patrick_Duffy","Pamela_Barnes","Victoria_Principal","Michele_Lee","Donna_Mills","Doug_Sheehan","Sam_Behrens","Stillbirth","Karen_MacKenzie","William_Devane","Dallas_(2012_TV_series)","Larry_Hagman","Pamela_Ewing","TV_Guide"]}
