Fibrinogen is\nsynthesized in the liver by the hepatocytes. The concentration of fibrin in the\nblood plasma is 200-400 mg/dL (normally measured using the Clauss method.\n\nDuring normal blood coagulation, a coagulation cascade activates the zymogen\nprothrombin by converting it into the serine protease thrombin. Thrombin then\nconverts the soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin strands. These strands are\nthen cross-linked by factor XIII to form a blood clot. FXIIIa stabilizes fibrin\nfurther by incorporation of the fibrinolysis inhibitors alpha-2-antiplasmin and\nTAFI (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, procarboxypeptidase B), and\nbinding to several adhesive proteins of various cells.\nBoth the activation of Factor XIII by thrombin and plasminogen activator (t-PA)\nare catalyzed by fibrin. Fibrin specifically binds the\nactivated coagulation factors factor Xa and thrombin and entraps them in the\nnetwork of fibers, thus functioning as a temporary inhibitor of these enzymes,\nwhich stay active and can be released during fibrinolysis. Recent research has shown that fibrin plays a key\nrole in the inflammatory response and development of rheumatoid arthritis.\n","linknr":472,"url":"Fibrinogen","recorded":1362890699,"links":44,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coagulation system","Blood proteins","Acute phase proteins"],"headings":["Fibrinogen deficiency","Diagnostic use","Physiology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Fibrinandligand.png/220px-Fibrinandligand.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/PDB_1m1j_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1m1j_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/PDB_1m1j_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1m1j_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fibrinogen_alpha_chain","Fibrin","Fibrinogen_alpha_chain","Fibrinogen_beta_chain","Fibrinogen_beta_chain","FGG","FGG","KDa","Blood_plasma","Glycoprotein","Thrombin","Fibrin","Coagulation","Liver","Hepatocyte","Clauss_method","Zymogen","Prothrombin","Serine_protease","Thrombin","Factor_XIII","Thrombus","Fibrinolysis","TAFI","Thrombin","T-PA","Factor_Xa","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Whole_blood","Physical_trauma","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Sepsis","Fresh_frozen_plasma","Cryoprecipitate","Vein","Cytochalasin_D","Cardiovascular_disease","Inflammation","Acute-phase_protein","Gingiva","Pregnancy","Veterinary_medicine","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Prothrombin_time","Partial_thromboplastin_time","Sepsis","Viscoelastic","Platelet","Glycoprotein_IIb/IIIa","Protein","Hexamer","Disulfide","N-terminus","Cysteine","C-terminus","Amino_acid","Angiopoietin","Lectin","Mammal","Ficolin","Tachylectin_5A","Carbohydrate","Peptide","Fibrinopeptide","Polymer","PROSITE","N-terminus"]}
