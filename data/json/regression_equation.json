      "text" : "\nIn statistics, 'regression analysis' is a statistical process for estimating the\nrelationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and\nanalyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a\ndependent variable and one or more independent variables. More specifically,\nregression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent\nvariable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the\nother independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis\nestimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the\nindependent variables – that is, the average value of the dependent variable\nwhen the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a\nquantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the\ndependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation\ntarget is a function of the independent variables called the 'regression\nfunction'. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the\nvariation of the dependent variable around the regression function, which can be\ndescribed by a probability distribution.\n\nRegression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use\nhas substantial overlap with the field of machine learning. Regression analysis\nis also used to understand which among the independent variables are related to\nthe dependent variable, and to explore the forms of these relationships. In\nrestricted circumstances, regression analysis can be used to infer causal\nrelationships between the independent and dependent variables. However this can\nlead to illusions or false relationships, so caution is advisable;<ref></ref>\nfor example, correlation does not imply causation.\n\nA large body of techniques for carrying out regression analysis has been\ndeveloped. Familiar methods such as linear regression and ordinary least squares\nregression are parametric, in that the regression function is defined in terms\nof a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data.\nNonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function\nto lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe performance of regression analysis methods in practice depends on the form\nof the data generating process, and how it relates to the regression approach\nbeing used. Since the true form of the data-generating process is generally not\nknown, regression analysis often depends to some extent on making assumptions\nabout this process. These assumptions are sometimes testable if many data are\navailable. Regression models for prediction are often useful even when the\nassumptions are moderately violated, although they may not perform optimally.\nHowever, in many applications, especially with small effects or questions of\ncausality based on observational data, regression methods can give misleading\nresults.<ref>David A.
