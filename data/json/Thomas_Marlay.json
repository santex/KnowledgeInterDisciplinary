{"cursor":"3896","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Thomas Marlay' (1691â1756) was an Irish judge, remembered now as the builder of\nCelbridge Abbey and as the grandfather of the statesman Henry Grattan.\n\nHis mother Elizabeth Morgan was from County Sligo; his father Anthony was a\nrecent arrival from Newcastle-upon-Tyne where his own father Sir John Marlay\nhad been a leading local politician. He was educated at the University of\nDublin, and unlike most barristers of his time was a considerable scholar,\nbeing awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Laws. He rapidly\nbuilt up a large practice at the Bar and was appointed Solicitor-General for\nIreland in 1720 and Attorney-General for Ireland in 1727. He was elevated to\nthe Bench as Lord Chief Baron in 1730 and became Lord Chief Justice of the\nKing's Bench in Ireland in 1741.\n\nHis most notable trial as Lord Chief Justice was the so-called Annesley perjury\ncase; one of several trials arising from the celebrated legal battle between\nJames Annesley and Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey as to which of them\nwas the rightful holder of the Anglesey title and estates. The trial was notable\nfor lasting twenty-two hours without a break and Marlay, who would normally have\nhad 2 or 3 colleagues to support him conducted it virtually singlehanded.\n\nA workload so heavy soon affected his health and from 1749 he was too unwell to\ngo on circuit; he retired on health grounds in 1751. He died in Drogheda on a\nvisit to his colleague Henry Singleton. He was a popular figure and his death\nseems to have been genuinely mourned: a Dublin paper published verses praising\nhis gentleness, perfect manners and scholarship (the last being rather unusual\namong Irish judges of the time).
