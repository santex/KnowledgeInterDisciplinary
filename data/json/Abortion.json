An abortion can occur\nspontaneously, in which case it is usually called a miscarriage, or it can be\npurposely induced. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced\nabortion of a human pregnancy.\n\nAbortion, when induced in the developed world in accordance with local law, is\namong the safest procedures in medicine. However,\nunsafe abortions result in approximately 70,000 maternal deaths and 5 million\nhospital admissions per year globally. An estimated 44\nmillion abortions are performed globally each year, with slightly under half of\nthose performed unsafely. The incidence of abortion has\nstabilized in recent years, having previously spent\ndecades declining as access to family planning education and contraceptive\nservices increased. Forty percent of the\nworld's women have access to induced abortions (within gestational limits).\n\nInduced abortion has a long history and has been facilitated by various methods\nincluding herbal abortifacients, the use of sharpened tools, physical trauma,\nand other traditional methods. Contemporary medicine utilizes medications and\nsurgical procedures to induce abortion. The legality, prevalence, cultural and\nreligious status of abortion vary substantially around the world. Its legality\ncan depend on specific conditions such as incest, rape, severe fetal defects or\nthe mother's health being at risk. In many parts of the world there is prominent\nand divisive public controversy over the ethical and legal issues of abortion.\n\n","linknr":1897,"url":"Abortion","recorded":1362486673,"links":183,"instances":["doctor","doctor","mammals","human","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/lancet_4.pdf","http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/general/lancet_4.pdf","http://www.sogc.org/jogc/abstracts/full/200912_WomensHealth_1.pdf","http://www.sogc.org/jogc/abstracts/full/200912_WomensHealth_1.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/Sedgh-Lancet-2012-01.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/Sedgh-Lancet-2012-01.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf","https://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/green_journal/2004/v103n4p729.pdf","https://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/green_journal/2004/v103n4p729.pdf","http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/89168.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241594845_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241594845_eng.pdf","http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/er765.pdf","http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/er765.pdf","http://www.stakes.fi/tilastot/tilastotiedotteet/2011/Tr09_11.pdf","http://www.stakes.fi/tilastot/tilastotiedotteet/2011/Tr09_11.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4304111.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4304111.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1992/WHO_MSM_92.5.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20100530072310/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1992/WHO_MSM_92.5.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1992/WHO_MSM_92.5.pdf","http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/NEBAbortionSummary.pdf","http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/NEBAbortionSummary.pdf","http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/mental-health.pdf","http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/mental-health.pdf","http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf","http://www.jogc.org/abstracts/full/200611_WomensHealth_1.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596121_eng.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20110216141018/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596121_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596121_eng.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-AIU-summary.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-AIU-summary.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-AIU-summary.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-AIU-summary.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3429402.pdf","http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3429402.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/62/14051769/1405176962.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/62/14051769/1405176962.pdf","http://www.prb.org/pdf08/MENAabortion.pdf","http://www.prb.org/pdf08/MENAabortion.pdf","http://www.prb.org/pdf08/MENAabortion.pdf","http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2011abortion/2011wallchart.pdf","http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf","http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2011/Preventing_gender-biased_sex_selection.pdf","http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2011/Preventing_gender-biased_sex_selection.pdf","http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12715.pdf","http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12715.pdf","http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf","http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf","http://www.painthorsejournal.com/pastissues/pdfs/byahair-mar04.pdf","http://www.painthorsejournal.com/pastissues/pdfs/byahair-mar04.pdf","http://af.czu.cz/~bartos/publications/pdf/Pluhacek_Bartos_2000_AB.pdf","http://af.czu.cz/~bartos/publications/pdf/Pluhacek_Bartos_2000_AB.pdf","http://www.ivb.cz/folia/54/3/258-262.pdf","http://www.ivb.cz/folia/54/3/258-262.pdf","http://economics-files.pomona.edu/colloquium/joannalahey.pdf","http://economics-files.pomona.edu/colloquium/joannalahey.pdf"],"categories":["Abortion|","Core
