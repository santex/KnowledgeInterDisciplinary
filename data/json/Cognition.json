Various disciplines, such as psychology,\nphilosophy, linguistics, and computer science all study cognition. However, the\nterm's usage varies across disciplines; for example, in psychology and cognitive\nscience, \"cognition\" usually refers to an information processing view of an\nindividual's psychological functions. It is also used in a branch of social\npsychology called social cognition to explain attitudes, attribution, and groups\ndynamics. Sternberg, R. J., & Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology\n(6th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. In cognitive\npsychology and cognitive engineering, cognition is typically assumed to be\ninformation processing in a participantâs or operatorâs mind or\nbrain. Blomberg, O. (2011). Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering.\nThe international journal of aviation psychology, 21(1), 85-104. doi:\n10.1080/10508414.2011.537561\n\nCognition is a faculty for the processing of information, applying knowledge,\nand changing preferences. Cognition, or cognitive processes, can be natural or\nartificial, conscious or unconscious. These processes are analyzed from\ndifferent perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of\nlinguistics, anesthesia, neurology and psychiatry, psychology, philosophy,\nanthropology, systemics, and computer science. Within psychology or\nphilosophy, the concept of cognition is closely related to abstract concepts\nsuch as mind, intelligence. It encompasses the mental functions, mental\nprocesses (thoughts), and states of intelligent entities (humans, collaborative\ngroups, human organizations, highly autonomous machines, and artificial\nintelligences).
