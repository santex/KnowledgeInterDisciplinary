{"cursor":"28351","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Solubility' is the property of a solid, liquid, or gaseous chemical substance\ncalled [[solution|solute]] to dissolve in a solid, liquid, or gaseous solvent to\nform a homogeneous solution of the solute in the solvent. The solubility of a\nsubstance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the\nused solute and solvent as well as on temperature , pressure and the pH of the\nsolution. The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is\nmeasured as the saturation concentration, where adding more solute does not\nincrease the concentration of the solution and begin to precipitate the excess\namount of solute.\n\nMost often, the solvent is a liquid, which can be a pure substance or a mixture.\nOne may also speak of solid solution, but rarely of solution in a gas (see vapor-\nliquid equilibrium instead).\n\nThe extent of solubility ranges widely, from infinitely soluble (without limit)\n(fully miscible ) such as ethanol in water, to poorly soluble, such as\nsilver chloride in water. The term insoluble is often applied to poorly or very\npoorly soluble compounds.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a\nso-called supersaturated solution, which is metastable.\n\nSolubility is not to be confused with the ability to dissolve or liquefy a\nsubstance, because the solution might occur not only because of dissolution but\nalso because of a chemical reaction. For example zinc, which is insoluble in\nhydrochloric acid, does dissolve in hydrochloric acid but by chemical reaction\ninto hydrogen gas and zinc chloride, which in turn is soluble in the acid.\nSolubility does not also depend on particle size or other kinetic factors; given\nenough time, even large particles will eventually dissolve.\n","linknr":665,"url":"Solubility","recorded":1362504863,"links":65,"instances":["chemistry","materials_science","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","unit","element","matter","chemistry","unit","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solutions","Physical
