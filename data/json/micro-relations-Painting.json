{"cursor":"45784","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'', by the Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most recognizable paintings in\nthe world.]]\n\n'Painting' is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/paint%5B1%5D Merriam-Webster Online] to a surface\n(support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but\nother implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. In art,\nthe term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. However,\npainting is also used outside of art as a common trade among craftsmen and\nbuilders. Paintings may have for their support such surfaces as walls, paper,\ncanvas, wood, glass, lacquer, clay, leaf, copper or concrete, and may\nincorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, gold leaf as\nwell as objects.\n\nPainting is a mode of creative expression, and the forms are numerous. Drawing,\ncomposition or abstraction and other aesthetics may serve to manifest the\nexpressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Paintings can be\nnaturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting),\nphotographic, abstract, be loaded with narrative content, symbolism, emotion or\nbe political in nature.\n\nA portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is\ndominated by spiritual motifs and ideas; examples of this kind of painting range\nfrom artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to Biblical scenes\nrendered on the interior walls and ceiling of The Sistine Chapel, to scenes from\nthe life of Buddha or other images of eastern religious origin.\n","linknr":1053,"url":"Painting","recorded":1362565665,"links":146,"instances":["humor","material","painting","literature","artist","art","painting","painting","graphical","paint","artist","art_form","visual_arts","music","philosophy","art_movement","arts","personification","food","music","art","art","art","video_performance_artist","musical_note","western_australia","painting","musical_note"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Painting|","Painting
