Generally, this occurs when a region receives\nconsistently below average precipitation. It can have a substantial impact on\nthe ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region. Although droughts can\npersist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant\ndamage [http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml Living With\nDrought ] and harm the local economy. [http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/environmental/Australian-\nDrought.html Australian Drought and Climate Change], retrieved on June 7th\n2007.\n\n\nMany plant species, such as cacti, have adaptations such as reduced leaf area\nand waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others\nsurvive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes\nsuch as deserts and grasslands. Keddy, P.A. 2007.

Most arid\necosystems have inherently low productivity.\n\nThis global phenomenon has a widespread impact on agriculture. Lengthy periods\nof drought have long been a key trigger for mass migration and played a key role\nin a number of ongoing migrations and other humanitarian crises in the Horn of\nAfrica and the Sahel.\n","linknr":799,"url":"Drought","recorded":1362503774,"links":100,"instances":["hebrew_bible","biology","climatology","meteorology"],"pdf":["https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon/ChristopherMonckton08-d/Vicente-SerranoCuadrat07-NAOonNESpainDroughts.pdf","https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon/ChristopherMonckton08-d/Vicente-SerranoCuadrat07-NAOonNESpainDroughts.pdf","http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/climate/Drought.pdf"],"categories":["Basic
