Tactile sensors are useful in\na wide variety of applications for robotics and computer hardware and even\nsecurity systems.\n\nA sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the\nmeasured quantity changes. The term tactile refers to the somatosensory system\nor more commonly the sense of touch. A tactile sensor is a device which receives\nand responds to a signal or stimulus having to do with force.\n\nTactile sensors are generally known and can be grouped into a number of\ndifferent types depending upon their construction; the most common groups are\npiezoresistive, piezoelectric, capacitive and elastoresistive sensors.
