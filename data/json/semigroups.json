A semigroup generalizes a monoid\nin that a semigroup need not have an identity element. It also (originally)\ngeneralized a group (a monoid with all inverses) to a type where every element\ndid not have to have an inverse, thus the name 'semigroup'.\n\nThe binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted multiplicatively:\n<math>x \\cdot y</math>, or simply <math>xy</math>, denotes the result of\napplying the semigroup operation to the ordered pair <math>(x,y)</math>. The\noperation is required to be associative so that <math>(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x\n\\cdot (y \\cdot z)</math> for all x, y and z, but need not be commutative so that\n<math>x \\cdot y</math> does not have to equal <math>y \\cdot x</math> (contrast\nto the standard multiplication operator on real numbers, where yx}}).\n\nBy definition, a semigroup is an associative magma. A semigroup with an identity\nelement is called a monoid. A group is then a monoid in which every element has\nan inverse element. Semigroups must not be confused with quasigroups which are\nsets with a not necessarily associative binary operation such that division is\nalways possible.\n\nThe formal study of semigroups began in the early 20th century. Semigroups are\nimportant in many areas of mathematics because they are the abstract algebraic\nunderpinning of \"memoryless\" systems: time-dependent systems that start from\nscratch at each iteration. In applied mathematics, semigroups are fundamental\nmodels for linear time-invariant systems. In partial differential equations, a\nsemigroup is associated to any equation whose spatial evolution is independent\nof time. The theory of finite semigroups has been of particular importance in\ntheoretical computer science since the 1950s because of the natural link between\nfinite semigroups and finite automata<!-- (, 1976)-->. In probability theory,\nsemigroups are associated with Markov processes .\n","title":"semigroup","headings":["Definition","Examples of semigroups","Basic concepts","Structure of semigroups","Special classes of semigroups","Group of fractions","Semigroup methods in partial differential equations","History","Generalizations","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["5: Monoid","4: Identity_element","3: Binary_operation","2: Inverse_element","2: Commutativity","2: Partial_differential_equations","2: Empty_semigroup","2: Integer","2: Free_semigroup","2: Transformation_semigroup","2: Absorbing_element","2: Green's_relations","2: Equivalence_relation","2: Idempotent","2: Cancellation_property","2: Inverse_semigroup","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Associative","1: Quasigroup","1: Applied_mathematics","1: Linear_time-invariant_system","1: Theoretical_computer_science","1: Finite_automata","1: Probability_theory","1: Markov_process","1: Associative_property","1: Semigroup_with_one_element","1: Semigroup_with_two_elements","1: Nonnegative_matrix","1: Ring_ideal","1: Free_monoid","1: Transformation_monoid","1: Embedding","1: Complete_lattice","1: Commutative","1: Principal_ideal","1: Monoid_homomorphism","1: Surjective","1: Isomorphism","1: Bijection","1: Equivalence_class","1: Isomorphism_theorems#First_Isomorphism_Theorem_4","1: String_rewriting_system","1: Zorn's_lemma","1: Ascending_chain_condition","1: Rees_factor_semigroup","1: Monogenic_semigroup","1: Cyclic_semigroup","1: Krohnâ€“Rhodes_theory","1: Subset","1: Cancellative_semigroup","1: Semilattice","1: 0-simple","1: Function_composition","1: Automaton","1: Finite_state_machine","1: Bicyclic_semigroup","1: C0-semigroup","1: Regular_semigroup","1: Commutative_algebra","1: Set-theoretic_intersection","1: Trivial_group","1: Grothendieck_group","1: Anatoly_Maltsev","1: Ordinary_differential_equation","1: Heat_equation","1: Lp_space","1: Exponentiation","1: C0_semigroup#Infinitesimal_generator","1: Anton_Suschkewitsch","1: Simple_semigroup","1: James_Alexander_Green","1: Evgenii_Sergeevich_Lyapin","1: Alfred_H._Clifford","1: Gordon_Preston","1: Springer_Verlag","1: Algebraic_automata_theory","1: Functional_analysis","1: Arity","1: N-ary_group","1: Semigroupoid","1: Biordered_set","1: Light's_associativity_test","1: Weak_inverse"]}
