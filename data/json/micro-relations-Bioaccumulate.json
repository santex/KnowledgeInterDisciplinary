[http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/bioaccumulation.html] USGS\nToxic Substances Hydrology Program: Bioaccumulation Bioaccumulation occurs\nwhen an organism absorbs a toxic substance at a rate greater than that at which\nthe substance is lost. Thus, the longer the biological half-life of the\nsubstance the greater the risk of chronic poisoning, even if environmental\nlevels of the toxin are not very high.

By contrast, bioaccumulation\nrefers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air,\netc.) http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/bioconcentration.html\n","linknr":475,"url":"Bioaccumulate","recorded":1362507203,"links":40,"instances":["element","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biodegradation","Biodegradable waste management","Pollution","Toxicology"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"]],"members":["mercury","heavy_metal"],"related":["Toxin","Biological_half-life","Mercury_(element)","Methylmercury","Mercury_poisoning","Soluble","Tetraethyllead","Lead","Petrol","DDT","Fat","Adipose_tissue","Strontium-90","Nuclear_fallout","Atomic_bomb","Osteogenesis","Algal_bloom","Red_tide","Mussel","Oyster","Ciguatera","Ciguatoxin","Manduca_sexta","Nicotine","Tobacco","Vitamin_A","Carnivore","Liver","Polar_bear","Explorer","Hypervitaminosis_A","Xavier_Mertz","Husky","Dog","Mawson","Coastal_fish","Smooth_toadfish","Seabird","Atlantic_Puffin","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Biodilution","Bioconcentration_factor","Biomagnification","Trophic_level","Chelation_therapy","International_POPs_Elimination_Network","Phytoremediation","List_of_environment_topics"]}
