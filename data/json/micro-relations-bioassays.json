{"cursor":"7815","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Bioassay' (commonly used shorthand for 'biological assay'), or 'biological\nstandardization' is a type of scientific experiment. Bioassays are typically\nconducted to measure the effects of a substance on a living organism and are\nessential in the development of new drugs and in monitoring environmental\npollutants. Both are procedures by which the potency or the nature of a\nsubstance is estimated by studying its effects on living matter. Bioassay is a\nprocedure for the determination of the concentration of a particular\nconstitution of a mixture.\n","linknr":152,"url":"bioassays","recorded":1362510325,"links":21,"instances":["medicine","pharmacology","pharmacology"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/wet/disk2/atx.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Environmental science","Pharmacology","Water pollution"],"headings":["Use","Definition","Purpose","Types","Techniques","Environmental bioassays","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["potency","pharmacology"],["adverse_effect","medicine"],["effective_dose","pharmacology"]],"members":["adverse_effect","effective_dose","potency"],"related":["Experiment","Organism","Drugs","Pollutant","Potency_(pharmacology)","Living_matter","Deformity","Arnold_Adolph_Berthold","Biostatistics","Pharmacology","Endogenous_mediator","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","Drug_toxicity","Wastewater","Urban_area","Surface_runoff","Effective_dose_(pharmacology)","Median_lethal_dose","Toxicity","Toxicant","Radioimmunoassay","Water_pollution","United_States","Sewage_treatment","Whole_effluent_toxicity","Dilution_assay","Drug_discovery","Pharmacodynamics","Pharmacokinetics","Water_quality","Bioassay-directed_fractionation"]}
