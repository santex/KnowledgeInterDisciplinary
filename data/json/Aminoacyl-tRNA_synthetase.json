In other words, aminoacyl\ntRNA synthetase simply attaches the accurate amino acid onto the corresponding\ntRNA. This is sometimes called \"charging\" or \"loading\" the tRNA with the amino\nacid. Once the tRNA is charged, a ribosome can transfer the amino acid from the\ntRNA onto a growing peptide, according to the genetic code.\n","linknr":596,"url":"Aminoacyl-tRNA_synthetase","recorded":1362484161,"links":28,"instances":["gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 6.1","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Mechanism","Reaction","Classes","Structures","Evolution","Expanding the genetic code via mutant aminoacyl tRNA synthetases","Prediction Servers","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/PDB_1obc_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1obc_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/PDB_1iq0_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1iq0_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/PDB_1u0b_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1u0b_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tars","gene"]],"members":["tars"],"related":["Enzyme","Esterification","Amino_acid","TRNA","Aminoacyl-tRNA","Ribosome","Genetic_code","Adenosine_triphosphate","Pyrophosphate","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetases,_class_I","Aminoacylation","Adenosine","Nucleotide","Monomeric","Protein_dimer","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetases,_class_II","Aminoacylation","Tetrameric_protein","Phenylalanine-tRNA_synthetase","Hydroxyl","Carboxyl","Transesterification","Rossmann_fold","Alpha_helix","Anticodon","Conserved_sequence","Amino_acids","Amber_codon","Stop_codon","Peter_G._Schultz","GPS_Raghava","GPS_Raghava","TARS_(gene)"]}
