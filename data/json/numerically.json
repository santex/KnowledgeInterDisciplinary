Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to\ncompute square roots) is extremely important, for instance, in carpentry and\nconstruction.<ref>The New Zealand Qualification authority specifically mentions\nthis skill in document 13004 version 2, dated 17 October 2003 titled\n[http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/13004.pdf CARPENTRY THEORY:\nDemonstrate knowledge of setting out a building]</ref>\n\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical\ncalculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>,\nmodern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are\noften impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is\nconcerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable\nbounds on errors.\n\nNumerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering\nand the physical sciences, but in the 21st&nbsp;century, the life sciences and\neven the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary\ndifferential equations appear in celestial mechanics (planets, stars and\ngalaxies); numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic\ndifferential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living\ncells for medicine and biology.\n\nBefore the advent of modern computers numerical methods often depended on hand\ninterpolation in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers\ncalculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas\nnevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving\ndifferential equations.\n","title":"Numerical%20analysis","headings":["General introduction","Generation and propagation of errors","Areas of study","Software","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Newton's_method","3: Gaussian_elimination","2: Ordinary_differential_equation","2: Interpolation","2: Partial_differential_equation","2: Bisection_method","2: Integral","2: Simplex_method","2: Linear_programming","2: Floating_point","2: Iterative_method","2: Conjugate_gradient_method","2: Differential_equation","2: Round-off_error","1: Sexagesimal","1: Decimal","1: Algorithm","1: Approximation","1: Symbolic_computation","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Discrete_mathematics","1: Celestial_mechanics","1: Numerical_linear_algebra","1: Stochastic_differential_equation","1: Markov_chain","1: Algorithms","1: Differential_equations","1: Numerical_weather_prediction","1: Hedge_fund","1: Operations_research","1: Actuary","1: Linear_interpolation","1: Lagrange_polynomial","1: Euler's_method","1: NIST","1: Abramowitz_and_Stegun","1: Mechanical_calculator","1: Riemann_sum","1: Computer_numbering_formats","1: QR_algorithm","1: Numerically_stable","1: Limit_of_a_sequence","1: Convergence_test","1: Jacobi_iteration","1: GMRES","1: Real_number","1: Digital_computer","1: Truncation","1: Discretization_error","1: Numerical_stability","1: Babylonian_method","1: Fixed_point_iteration","1: Gross_domestic_product","1: Lemonade_stand","1: Euler_method","1: Horner_scheme","1: Extrapolation","1: Regression_analysis","1: Least_squares","1: Systems_of_linear_equations","1: Matrix_decomposition","1: LU_decomposition","1: Cholesky_decomposition","1: Symmetric_matrix","1: Hermitian_matrix","1: Positive-definite_matrix","1: QR_decomposition","1: Jacobi_method","1: Gauss–Seidel_method","1: Successive_over-relaxation","1: Matrix_splitting","1: Root-finding_algorithm","1: Derivative","1: Linearization","1: Eigenvalue_decomposition","1: Singular_value_decomposition","1: Image_compression","1: Principal_component_analysis","1: Lagrange_multipliers","1: Newton–Cotes_formulas","1: Simpson's_rule","1: Gaussian_quadrature","1: Monte_Carlo_method","1: Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method","1: Monte_Carlo_integration","1: Sparse_grid","1: Finite_element_method","1: Finite_difference","1: Finite_volume_method","1: Functional_analysis","1: Netlib","1: Fortran","1: IMSL_Numerical_Libraries","1: Numerical_Algorithms_Group","1: GNU_Scientific_Library","1: MATLAB","1: S-PLUS","1: LabVIEW","1: FreeMat","1: Scilab","1: GNU_Octave","1: IT++","1: Computer_algebra_system","1: Mathematica","1: Arbitrary_precision_arithmetic","1: Spreadsheet","1: Scientific_computing","1: List_of_numerical_analysis_topics","1: Numerical_differentiation","1: Symbolic-numeric_computation","1: Analysis_of_algorithms","1: Numerical_Recipes","1: Lloyd_N._Trefethen","1: U.S._Department_of_Energy","1: University_of_Cambridge","1: University_of_Pennsylvania","1: University_of_Karlsruhe","1: University_of_South_Florida","1: California_State_University,_Fullerton","1: Jerusalem_College_of_Technology","1: Oxford_University","1: Mahidol_University","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology"]}
