{"cursor":"17167","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'chemical nomenclature' is a set of rules to generate systematic names for\nchemical compounds. The nomenclature used most frequently worldwide is the\none created and developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC).\n\nThe IUPAC's rules for naming organic and inorganic compounds are contained in\ntwo publications, known as the [[Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry|Blue\nBook]] .. . . and the [[Nomenclature of\nInorganic Chemistry|Red Book]], . respectively. A third\npublication, known as the [[Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical\nChemistry|Green Book]], . describes the\nrecommendations for the use of symbols for physical quantities (in association\nwith the IUPAP), while a fourth, the [[Compendium of Chemical Terminology|Gold\nBook]], Compendium of Chemical Terminology, IMPACT\nRecommendations (2nd Ed.), Oxford:Blackwell Scientific Publications.\n(1997) contains the definitions of a large number of technical terms used\nin chemistry. Similar compendia exist for biochemistry Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents, London:Portland Press,\n1992. (the White Book, in association with the IUBMB), analytical\nchemistry . (the [[Compendium of Analytical\nNomenclature|Orange Book]]), macromolecular chemistry Compendium of Macromolecular Nomenclature, Oxford:Blackwell\nScientific Publications, 1991. (the Purple Book) and clinical\nchemistry . (the Silver Book). These \"color books\" are supplemented by\nshorter recommendations for specific circumstances that are published from time\nto time in the journal [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]].\n","linknr":296,"url":"IUPAC_nomenclature","recorded":1362565961,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical nomenclature"],"headings":["Aims of chemical nomenclature","Differing aims of chemical nomenclature and lexicography","History","Types of nomenclature","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Lavoisier_Nomenclature01.gif/220px-Lavoisier_Nomenclature01.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tin(ii_chloride"]],"members":[],"related":["Systematic_name","Chemical_compound","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Organic_compound","Inorganic_compound","Symbol","Physical_quantity","IUPAP","Biochemistry","IUBMB","Analytical_chemistry","Macromolecular_chemistry","Clinical_chemistry","Scientific_journal","CAS_number","Chemical_formula","Chemical_Abstracts_Service","International_Chemical_Identifier","Allotropes","Rapamycin","Lexicography","IUPAC","Resveratrol","Cis-isomer","Omega-3_fatty_acids","Polyphenol","Structure–activity_relationship","Polyphenol","Bioactivity","Alchemy","Antoine_Lavoisier","Chemical_element","Chemical_compound","France","Louis-Bernard_Guyton_de_Morveau","Berthollet","Antoine_François,_comte_de_Fourcroy","Antoine_Lavoisier","Guillotine","Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius","Geneva","World_War_I","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Hantzsch–Widman_nomenclature","Phosphorus_pentachloride","Dinitrogen_tetraoxide","Oxidation_state","Tin(II)_chloride","Stock_nomenclature","International_nomenclature","Ionic_compounds","Hydrides","Borane","Boron","Hydrogen","Oxidane","Oxygen","Phosphane","Phosphorus","Hydrogen","Phosphine","Ligands","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry_2005","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry","Preferred_IUPAC_name","IUPAC_numerical_multiplier","IUPAC_nomenclature_for_organic_transformations","International_Chemical_Identifier","List_of_chemical_compounds_with_unusual_names"]}
