{"cursor":"1477","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'call transfer' is a telecommunications mechanism that enables a user to\nrelocate an existing telephone call to another phone or attendant console, using\na transfer button or a switchhook flash and dialing the required location. The\ntransferred call is either announced or unannounced.\n\nIf the transferred call is 'announced', the desired party/extension is notified\nof the impending transfer. This is typically done by putting the caller on hold\nand dialing the desired party/extension; they are then notified and, if they\nchoose to accept the call, it is transferred over to them. Other terms commonly\nused for an announced transfer include \"attended\",\"consult\", \"full-consult\",\n\"supervised\" and \"conference\" transfer.\n\nOn the other hand, an 'unannounced' transfer is self-explanatory: it is\ntransferred without notifying the desired party/extension of the impending call.\nIt is simply transferred to their line by way of a \"transfer\" key on the\noperator's phone or by keying in a string of digits which achieves the same\nfunction. Other terms commonly used for an unannounced transfer include\n\"unsupervised\" and \"blind\". Unsupervised call transfer can be either 'warm' or\n'cold' - depending on moment when B-leg is disconnected.
