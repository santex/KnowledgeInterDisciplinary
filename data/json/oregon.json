It is located on\nthe Pacific coast, with Washington to the north, California to the south, Nevada\non the southeast and Idaho to the east. The Columbia and Snake rivers delineate\nmuch of Oregon's northern and eastern boundaries, respectively. The area was\ninhabited by many indigenous tribes before the arrival of traders, explorers,\nand settlers who formed an autonomous government in Oregon Country in 1843. The\nOregon Territory was created in 1848, and Oregon became the 33rd state on\nFebruary 14, 1859.\n\nOregon is the 9th most expansive and the 27th most populous of the 50 United\nStates. Salem is the state's capital and third-most-populous city; Portland is\nthe most populous. Portland is the 29th-largest U.S. city, with a population of\n603,106 (2012 estimate) and a metro population of 2,262,605 (2011 estimate), the\n23rd-largest U.S. metro area. The valley of the Willamette River in western\nOregon is the state's most densely populated area and is home to eight of the\nten most populous cities.\n\nOregon contains a diverse landscape including the windswept Pacific coastline,\nthe volcanoes of the rugged and glaciated Cascade Mountain Range, many\nwaterfalls (including Multnomah Falls), dense evergreen forests, mixed forests\nand deciduous forests at lower elevations, and high desert across much of the\neastern portion of the state, extending into the Great Basin. The tall Douglas\nfirs and redwoods along the rainy Western Oregon coast contrast with the lower\ndensity and fire-prone pine tree and juniper forests covering portions of the\neastern half of the state. Alder trees are common in the west and fix nitrogen\nfor the conifers; aspen groves are common in eastern Oregon. Stretching east\nfrom Central Oregon, the state also includes semi-arid shrublands, prairies,\ndeserts, steppes, and meadows. Mount Hood is the highest point in the state at .\nCrater Lake National Park is the only national park in Oregon.\n","title":"oregon","headings":["Etymology","History","Geography","Governance","Economy","Demographics","Education","Sports","State symbols","Sister states","See also","References","Further
