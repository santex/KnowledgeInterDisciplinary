Courant, Richard, Herbert Robbins, and Ian Stewart. What Is\nMathematics?: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods. New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1996. [http://books.google.com/books?id=_kYBqLc5QoQC&pg=PA344-\n&vq=%22contour+line%22&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1&sig=ACfU3U2wWEkaeLRCYtZiHbjh-\n_OH7eKgnJQ p. 344.] In cartography, a contour line (often just called a\n\"contour\") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as\nmean sea level. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/contour%20line][http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/c-\nontour%20line contour line] A 'contour map' is a map illustrated with\ncontour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and\nhills, and the steepness of slopes. [http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/contour%20map][http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/co-\nntour%20map contour map] The 'contour interval' of a contour map is the\ndifference in elevation between successive contour lines. Tracy, John C.\nPlane Surveying; A Text-Book and Pocket Manual. New York: J. Wiley & Sons, 1907.\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=lp0NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA337&dq=%22contour+interval%-\n22 p. 337.]\n\nMore generally, a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve\nconnecting points where the function has the same particular value. The gradient\nof the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. When the lines are\nclose together the magnitude of the gradient is large: the variation is steep. A\nlevel set is a generalization of a contour line for functions of any number of\nvariables.\n\nContour lines are curved or straight lines on a map describing the\nintersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal\nplanes. The configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer\nrelative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific\nplaces. Contour lines may be either traced on a visible three-dimensional\nmodel of the surface, as when a photogrammetrist viewing a stereo-model plots\nelevation contours, or interpolated from estimated surface elevations, as when\na computer program threads contours through a network of observation points of\narea centroids. In the latter case, the method of interpolation affects the\nreliability of individual isolines and their portrayal of slope, pits and\npeaks.
