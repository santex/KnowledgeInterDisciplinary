{"cursor":"32985","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Climate' encompasses the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric\npressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other\nmeteorological elemental measurements in a given region over long periods.\nClimate can be contrasted to weather, which is the present condition of these\nelements and their variations over shorter periods.\n\nA region's climate is generated by the 'climate system', which has five\ncomponents: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and\nbiosphere. [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html AR4\nSYR Synthesis Report Annexes]. Ipcc.ch. Retrieved on 2011-06-28.\n\nThe climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as\nwell as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified\naccording to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most\ncommonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification\nscheme was originally developed by Wladimir KÃ¶ppen. The Thornthwaite\nsystem, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with\ntemperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species\ndiversity and potential effects of climate changes. The Bergeron and Spatial\nSynoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define\nthe climate of a region.\n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of\nclimate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred\nfrom proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in\nlake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral.\nClimate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates.\nClimate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of\nfactors; recent warming is discussed in global warming.\n","linknr":1158,"url":"Climate","recorded":1362510521,"links":137,"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf","http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf","http://www.enhr2007rotterdam.nl/documents/W15_paper_DeWerk_Mulder.pdf","http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/118516.pdf","http://caos.iisc.ernet.in/faculty/bng/IWM-III-BNG_overview.pdf","http://www.slabongrade.net/DesignSeminars/SeminarDownloads/Science_of_Expansive_Clay.pdf","http://www.soilvision.com/subdomains/unsaturatedsoil.com/Docs/chapter1UST.pdf","http://www.soilvision.com/subdomains/unsaturatedsoil.com/Docs/chapter1UST.pdf","http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0048-PDF/gto_0048_69887.pdf"],"categories":["Basic
