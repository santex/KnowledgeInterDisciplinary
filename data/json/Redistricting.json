{"cursor":"8398","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Redistricting' is the process of drawing United States electoral district\nboundaries, often in response to population changes determined by the results of\nthe decennial census. {{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/rdo/\n|title=Redistricting Data main page - U.S. Census Bureau\n|publisher=www.census.gov |accessdate=2009-08-25}}  In 34 states, the\nstate legislature has primary responsibility for creating a redistricting plan,\nin many cases subject to approval by the state governor. To reduce the role that\nlegislative politics might play, six states (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho,\nNew Jersey and Washington), carry out congressional redistricting by an\nindependent or bipartisan commission. Three states, Florida, Iowa and Maine,\ngive independent bodies authority to propose redistricting plans, but preserve\nthe role of legislatures to approve them. Seven states have only a single\nrepresentative for the entire state because of their low populations; these are\nAlaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming.\n\nState constitutions and laws also mandate which body has responsibility over\ndrawing the state legislature boundaries. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.lib.purdue.edu/govdocs/redistricting.html |title=Government\nRedistricting Web Sites |publisher=Purdue University Libraries |accessdate=2009-08-\n25 |last=Blake |first=Aaron }}  In addition, those municipal governments\nthat are elected on a district basis (as opposed to at-large) also redistrict.\n\nEach state has its own standards for creating Congressional and legislative\ndistricts. {{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/redistricting-looms-over-2010-election-\nlandscape-2009-06-13.html |title=TheHill.com - Redistricting looms over 2010\nlandscape |publisher=thehill.com |accessdate=2009-08-25 |last= |first= }} \nIn addition to equalizing the population of districts and complying with Federal\nrequirements, criteria may include attempting to create compact, contiguous\ndistricts, trying to keep political units and communities within a single\ndistrict, and avoiding the drawing of boundaries for purposes of partisan\nadvantage or incumbent protection. Miller, Jason\nC.,[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635614 Community as a Redistricting Principle:\nConsulting Media Markets in Drawing District Lines] (July 6, 2010). Indiana Law\nJournal Supplement, Vol. 5, 2010. In the states where the legislature (or\nanother body where a partisan majority is possible) is in charge of\nredistricting, the possibility of gerrymandering (the deliberate manipulation of\npolitical boundaries for electoral advantage, usually of incumbents or a\nspecific political party) often makes the process very politically contentious,\nespecially when the majorities of the two houses of the legislature, or the\nlegislature and the governor, are from different parties. The state and federal\ncourt systems are often involved in resolving disputes over Congressional and\nlegislative redistricting when gridlock prevents redistricting in a timely\nmanner. In addition, the losers to an adopted redistricting plan often challenge\nit in state and federal courts. Justice Department approval (which is known as\npreclearance) is required under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in\ncertain states that have had a history of racial barriers to voting.\n\nPartisan domination of state legislatures and improved technology to design\ncontiguous districts that pack opponents into as few districts as possible have\nled to district maps which are skewed towards one party. Consequently many\nstates including Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas\nhave succeeded in reducing or effectively eliminating competition for most House\nseats in those states. In 2003 Republicans in Texas increased their\nrepresentation in the U.S. House through an exceptional out-of-cycle\nredistricting that made national news.\n\nOther states including California, New Jersey and New York have opted to protect\nincumbents of both parties, again reducing the number of competitive districts.\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on the Pennsylvania gerrymander {{cite web |url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-\n1580.ZS.html |title=Vieth v. Jubelirer |publisher=supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2009-08-\n25 }}  effectively cemented the right of elected officials to select their\nconstituents by eliminating most of the grounds for disenfranchised constituents\nto challenge gerrymandered lines.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Redistricting","recorded":1374858371,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Category:Politics","/wiki/Election","/wiki/Sortition","/wiki/By-election","/wiki/Electoral_fraud","/wiki/Show_election","/wiki/Fixed-term_election","/wiki/General_election","/wiki/Midterm_election","/wiki/Primary_election","/wiki/Open_primary","/wiki/Closed_primary","/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary","/wiki/Two-round_system","/wiki/Direct_election","/wiki/Indirect_election","/wiki/Local_election","/wiki/Referendum","/wiki/Initiative","/wiki/Recall_election","/wiki/Criticisms_of_electoralism","/wiki/Anonymous_elector","/wiki/Apportionment_(politics)","/wiki/Boundary_delimitation","/wiki/Crossover_voting","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/wiki/Election_silence","/wiki/Majority-minority_district","/wiki/Nesting_(voting_districts)","/wiki/Secret_ballot","/wiki/Suffrage","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/Voting","/wiki/Voting_system","/wiki/Elections_by_country","/wiki/List_of_the_most_recent_elections_by_country","/wiki/Supranational_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/National_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/Local_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Elections","/wiki/Template_talk:Elections","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Elections&action=edit","/wiki/Redistribution_(election)","/wiki/Electoral_district","/wiki/United_States_Census","#cite_note-1","/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)","/wiki/Governor_(United_States)","/wiki/Arizona","/wiki/California","/wiki/Hawaii","/wiki/Idaho","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/Washington_(U.S._state)","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/Iowa","/wiki/Maine","/wiki/Alaska","/wiki/Delaware","/wiki/Montana","/wiki/North_Dakota","/wiki/South_Dakota","/wiki/Vermont","/wiki/Wyoming","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States#Municipal_governments","/wiki/At-large","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/wiki/Incumbent","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice","/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act","/wiki/Florida","/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)","/wiki/Maryland","/wiki/Michigan","/wiki/Pennsylvania","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/2003_Texas_redistricting","/wiki/California","/wiki/New_Jersey","/wiki/New_York","#cite_note-5","#Public_schools","#Gerrymandering","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/School_district","/wiki/Attendance_zone","/wiki/Occupancy","/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)","/wiki/Education","/wiki/School_bus","/wiki/Elementary_school","/wiki/Middle_school","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Parent","/wiki/Child","/wiki/School_board","/wiki/Protest","/wiki/Resale","/wiki/Value_(economics)","/wiki/Home","/wiki/Real_estate","/wiki/For_sale_by_owner","/wiki/Marketing","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Apportionment_(politics)","/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.census.gov/rdo/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.lib.purdue.edu/govdocs/redistricting.html","#cite_ref-3","http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/redistricting-looms-over-2010-election-landscape-2009-06-13.html","#cite_ref-4","http://ssrn.com/abstract=1635614","#cite_ref-5","http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZS.html","/w/index.php?title=Redistricting&action=edit&section=5","http://www.redistrictinginamerica.org","http://www.rosereport.org","http://www.caliper.com/News/RedistrictingNews.htm","http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/congApp/","/wiki/Office_of_the_Clerk","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","http://ww
