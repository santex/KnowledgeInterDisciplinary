It is the second-oldest university in the English-\nspeaking world (after the University of Oxford), and the third-oldest surviving\nuniversity in the world. In post-nominals the university's name is abbreviated\nas Cantab, a shortened form of Cantabrigiensis (an adjective derived from\nCantabrigia, the Latinised form of Cambridge). The university is considered to\nbe one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the United\nKingdom and the world. web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-\nnews/cambridge-named-as-best-university-in-the-world-\n2349326.html|title=Cambridge named as best university in the world\n\nThe university grew out of an association of scholars that was formed in 1209,\nearly records suggest, by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute with\ntownsfolk. The two \"ancient universities\" have many common features\nand are often jointly referred to as [[Oxbridge]]. In addition to cultural and\npractical associations as a historic part of British society, they have a long\nhistory of rivalry with each other. Today, Cambridge is a collegiate university\nwith a student population in excess of 18,000. Its faculties, departments and 31\ncolleges occupy different locations in town including purposely-built sites and\nthe student life thrives with numerous opportunities in the arts, sport clubs\nand societies.\n\nCambridge has performed consistently in various league tables over the years,\nachieving the top spot in the world according to the QS World University\nRankings in both 2010 and 2011; in 2012, the same editors ranked\nCambridge second. Other results include a sixth place in the world in\nthe 2011 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], and a fifth\nposition in the world (and first in Europe) in the 2011 [[Academic Ranking of\nWorld Universities]]. Furthermore, Cambridge regularly contends with Oxford for\nfirst place in UK league tables. In 2011, Cambridge ranked\nthird, after Harvard and MIT, in the Times Higher Education World Reputation\nRankings. Graduates of the university have won a total of 65 Nobel\nPrizes, the most of any university in the world.\n\nCambridge is a member of the Coimbra Group, the G5, the International Alliance\nof Research Universities, the League of European Research Universities and the\nRussell Group of research-led British universities. It forms part of the 'golden\ntriangle' of British universities.\n","linknr":2594,"url":"University_of_Cambridge","recorded":1362480866,"links":203,"instances":["uk_parliament_constituency","physicist","academia","boat","sport","dramatist","martyr","university","newspaper_format","disease","university_of_cambridge","philosopher","playwright","director","star_trek","novelist","uk","scottish_actor","oxbridge_and_dublin","clergyman","director","puritan","award","playwright","playing_company","university_of_cambridge","university_sport","literature","mathematician","comedian","professor","actor","education","universities","novelist","canterbury","political_science"],"pdf":["http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/planning/information/statistics/facts/poster2012.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/planning/information/statistics/facts/poster2012.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/communications/services/identityguidelines/guidelines-colour.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/communications/services/identityguidelines/guidelines-colour.pdf","http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/3B0B3A7B-E448-4D61-A853-0B5A1A467969/0/CambridgeCityDistrictReport2011.pdf","http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/3B0B3A7B-E448-4D61-A853-0B5A1A467969/0/CambridgeCityDistrictReport2011.pdf","http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/alternativeprospectus.pdf","http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/alternativeprospectus.pdf","http://www.hepi.ac.uk/downloads/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf","http://www.hepi.ac.uk/downloads/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf","http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/44%20Oxford%20and%20Cambridge%20summary.pdf","http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/44%20Oxford%20and%20Cambridge%20summary.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2011-12/weekly/6246/i.pdf","http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/interviews.pdf","http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/interviews.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table3_1.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table3_1.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080624211305/http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf","http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080624211305/http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table1-1.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table1-1.pdf","http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/stug2006/stug2006.pdf","http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/stug2006/stug2006.pdf","http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/pdfs/univ07ten.pdf","http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/pdfs/univ07ten.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/pdfs/ordinance02.pdf","http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/pdfs/ordinance02.pdf","http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C.pdf","http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C.pdf"],"categories":["University
