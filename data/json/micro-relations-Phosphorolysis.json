{"cursor":"1037","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Phosphorolysis' is the cleavage of a compound in which inorganic phosphate is\nthe attacking group. It is analogous to hydrolysis.\n\nAn example of this is glycogen breakdown by glycogen phosphorylase, which\ncatalyzes attack by inorganic phosphate on the terminal glycosyl residue at the\nnonreducing end of a glycogen molecule. The result is glucose 1-phosphate and\nglycogen (or starch) (n-1) glucose units.\n\nIn addition, sometimes phosphorolysis is preferable to hydrolysis (like in the\nbreakdown of glycogen or starch, as in the example above) because glucose 1-\nphosphate yields more ATP than does free glucose when subsequently catabolized\nto pyruvate.\n\nAnother example of phosphorolysis is seen in the conversion of glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis. The mechanism involves\nphosphorolysis.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Phosphorolysis","recorded":1362666713,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical processes"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bond_cleavage","Phosphate","Hydrolysis","Glycogen","Glycogen","Glucose","Starch","Catabolize","Pyruvate","Phosphorylase"]}
