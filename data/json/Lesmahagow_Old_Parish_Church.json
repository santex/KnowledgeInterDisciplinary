It is the largest church in the South\nLanarkshire town of Lesmahagow.\n\nA Culdee settlement of Celtic monks existed prior to the 12th Century. The\nchurch was dedicated in the name of St. Machutus (St. Malo). This dedication was\nretained when King David I of Scotland granted \"the Church and lands of\nLesmahagow\" to the Tironensian Order of monks who had already established an\nKelso Abbey at Kelso.\n\nThe Priory Church was burnt in 1335 by troops under the command of John of\nEltham, brother of King Edward I of England. Many people had sought sanctuary\nwithin the church at the time of the burning and are thought to have perished.\nThereafter a new church was constructed and lasted until the early 19th century.\nThe present church was constructed in 1804 on the original site. Originally\nbuilt as a plain, rectangular church, an apse was constructed later in the 19th\ncentury and an organ (in the West Gallery) was built by Brindley & Foster and\ninstalled in 1889. The Chapter House was added in 1934. After serious damage by\nfire in 1981 the apse was restored and the entire church redecorated.\n\nThe church contains some notable stained glass. The centre panel of the East\nWindow, \"The Descent from the Cross\" is a copy from the centre panel of the\ntriptych painted by Rubens for an altar in Antwerp Cathedral in 1614.\n\nThe current minister (since 2003) is the Revd Aileen Robson. Recent former\nministers were the Revd Sheila Mitchell 1995-2002 (now a hospital chaplain in\nAyr), preceded by the Revd William Niven 1969-1994 (who died in December 2004).\n\nLesmahagow Old Parish Church is linked with neighbouring Coalburn Parish Church\n(i.e. sharing the same minister).\n\n[View of Church
