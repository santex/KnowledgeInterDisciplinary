Most frequently, the term refers\nto sexual abstinence, or abstinence from alcohol or food. The practice can arise\nfrom religious prohibitions and practical considerations. Abstinence may also\nrefer to drugs. For example you can abstain from smoking. Abstinence has diverse\nforms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in\nfasting. In the twelve-step program of Overeaters Anonymous abstinence is the\nterm for refraining from compulsive eating, akin in meaning to sobriety for\nalcoholics. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen\nto enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological\nmechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy\nconsequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more\nculturally or socially acceptable activities, \"sublimation\".\n","linknr":394,"url":"Abstinence","recorded":1362559664,"links":48,"instances":["biological","establishment","virtue","food","psychology","psychological","food"],"pdf":["http://www.khouryplasticsurgery.com/download/Smoking_and_Plastic_Surgery.pdf","http://www.khouryplasticsurgery.com/download/Smoking_and_Plastic_Surgery.pdf"],"categories":["Asceticism","Human sexuality","Drug rehabilitation","Twelve-step programs"],"headings":["Abstinence in religion","In medicine","Types of abstinence","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Womans-Holy-War.jpg/220px-Womans-Holy-War.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["repression","psychological"],["sublimation","psychology"],["game","food"],["egg","food"],["bar","establishment"],["stress","biological"],["temperance","virtue"]],"members":["stress","bar","temperance","game","sublimation","repression","egg"],"related":["Pleasure","Sexual_abstinence","Alcohol","Food","Fasting","Twelve-step_program","Overeaters_Anonymous","Repression_(psychological)","Freud","Sublimation_(psychology)","Ascetic","Jew","Yom_Kippur","Muslim","Ramadan","Pork","Pre-marital_sex","Catholic","Holy_Communion","Ash_Wednesday","Lent","Traditionalist_Catholics","Fasting_and_abstinence_in_the_Roman_Catholic_Church","Protestant","Mormons","Seventh-day_Adventist_Church","Leviticus","Narcotics","India","Buddhist","Jain","Sikhs","Hinduism","Hinduism","Bhikkhu","Theravada","Discontinuation","Drug_addiction","Withdrawal_syndromes","Nicotine","Cosmetic_surgery","Drink","Meat","Game_(food)","Poultry","Fish","Shellfish","Egg_(food)","Dairy_product","Honey","Cannabis_smoking","Alcoholic_beverage","Religion","Health","Family","Philosophical","Society","Bar_(establishment)","Soft_drink","Colloquial","Intoxicants","Controlled_substances","Leisure","Career","Drug_addiction","Stress_(biological)","Work-life_balance","Alcoholics_Anonymous","Narcotics_Anonymous","Pagans_In_Recovery","Rehabilitation_for_Addicted_Prisoners_Trust","Anatta","Asceticism","Temperance_(virtue)"]}
