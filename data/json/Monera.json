The kingdom is considered\nsuperseded.\n\nThe taxon Monera was first proposed as a phylum by Ernst Haeckel in 1866.\nSubsequently, the taxon was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1925 by\nÃdouard Chatton. The last commonly accepted mega-classification with the\ntaxon Monera was the five-kingdom classification system established by Robert\nWhittaker in 1969.\n\nUnder the three-domain system of taxonomy, which was introduced by Carl Woese in\n1977 and reflects the evolutionary history of life as currently understood, the\norganisms found in kingdom Monera have been divided into two domains, Archaea\nand Bacteria (with Eukarya as the third domain). Furthermore the taxon Monera is\nparaphyletic. The term \"moneran\" is the informal name of members of this group\nand is still sometimes used (as is the term \"prokaryote\") to denote a member of\neither domain.\n\nDespite the fact that most bacteria were classified under Monera, the bacterial\nphylum Cyanobacteria (the blue-green algae) was not initially classified under\nMonera, but under Plantae because of the ability of its members to\nphotosynthesise.\n","linknr":429,"url":"Monera","recorded":1362483882,"links":38,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","genus","genus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Prokaryotes","Obsolete taxonomic groups"],"headings":["History","Blue-green algae","Summary","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg/210px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Haeckel_arbol_bn.png/220px-Haeckel_arbol_bn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kingdom","biology"],["cell","biology"],["kingdom","biology#five_kingdoms"],["domain","biology"],["monas","genus"],["monas","genus"],["bacterium","genus"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["domain","kingdom","cell","bacterium","monas"],"related":["Hadean","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryotes","Kingdom_(biology)","Prokaryote","Cell_(biology)","Ernst_Haeckel","Édouard_Chatton","Robert_Whittaker","Three-domain_system","Taxonomy","Carl_Woese","Domain_(biology)","Archaea","Bacteria","Eukarya","Common_name","Cyanobacteria","Systema_Naturae","Microscope","Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek","Ernst_Haeckel","Vibrio","Cyanobacteria","Algae","Monas_(genus)","Monas_(genus)","C._Von_Nägeli","Ferdinand_Cohn","Bacterium_(genus)","Christian_Gottfried_Ehrenberg","Robert_Whittaker","Cyanobacteria","Myxobacteria","Eubacterium","Actinomycota","Spirochaetae","Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Carl_Woese","George_E._Fox","Archaea","Bacteria","Eukaryote","Bacteria","Archaea","Thomas_Cavalier-Smith","Cell_nucleus","Mitosis","Binary_fission","Monophyly","Phylogeny","Édouard_Chatton","Roger_Stanier","C._B._van_Niel","Blue-green_algae","Ernst_Pringsheim,_Jr.","Bacterial_cell_structure","Endosymbiont","Kingdom_(biology)","Prokaryote","Symbiogenesis"]}
