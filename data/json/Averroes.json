The 13th-century philosophical movement based on\nAverroes' work is called Averroism.\n\nAverroes was a defender of Aristotelian philosophy against Ash'ari theologians\nled by Al-Ghazali. Averroes' philosophy was considered controversial in Muslim\ncircles. Averroes had a greater impact\non Western European circles and he has been described as the \"founding father of\nsecular thought in Western Europe\". The detailed commentaries on Aristotle earned\nAverroes the title \"The Commentator\". Latin translations of Averroes' work led\nthe way to the popularization of Aristotle and were responsible for the\ndevelopment of scholasticism in medieval Europe.\n","linknr":1685,"url":"Averroes","recorded":1362485245,"links":113,"instances":["literature","aristotle","1997_film","bbc_radio_4","plato"],"pdf":["http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47472/1/2008_HMD_Ahmed.pdf","http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47472/1/2008_HMD_Ahmed.pdf","http://www.idosi.org/hssj/hssj2(1)07/10.pdf","http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_Rushd_BEA.pdf"],"categories":["1126
