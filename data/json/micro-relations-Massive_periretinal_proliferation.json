PVR occurs in\nabout 8â10% of patients undergoing primary retinal detachment surgery and\nprevents the successful surgical repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.\nPVR can be treated with surgery to reattach the detached retina but the visual\noutcome of the surgery is very poor. {{cite journal |author=Leaver PK\n|title=Proliferative vitreoretinopathy |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology\n|year=1995 |volume=79 |pages=871â872 |doi=10.1136/bjo.79.10.871 |pmid=7488570\n|issue=10 |pmc=505283 }} {{cite web |author=\n|url=http://www.retinatexas.com/vitreoretinopathy.html |title=Proliferative\nVitreoretinopathy |publisher=Retina and Vitreous of Texas |year= |accessdate=2009-05-\n28 }}\n\nPVR was originally referred to as 'massive vitreous retraction' and then as\n'massive periretinal proliferation'. The name Proliferative vitreo retinopathy\nwas provided in 1989 by the Silicone Oil Study group. The name is derived from\nproliferation (by the retinal pigment epithelial and glial cells) and vitreo\nretinopathy to include the tissues which are affected, namely the vitreous humor\n(or simply vitreous) and the retina. {{cite journal |author=Ceron OM and\nArroyo JG |title=Better Outcomes May Be Ahead for PVR\n|url=http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_14133.htm |journal=Review of\nOphthalmology |volume=16 |page=1 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-29 }}\n","linknr":192,"url":"Massive_periretinal_proliferation","recorded":1362560249,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diseases of the eye and adnexa"],"headings":["Pathology","Retinal membranes","Cytokines involved in PVR","Predisposing factors","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Retinal_detachment","Retina","British_Journal_of_Ophthalmology","Silicone_Oil_Study_group","Retinal_pigment_epithelium","Glial_cell","Vitreous_humor","Retina","Review_of_Ophthalmology","Vitreous_humor","Retinal_pigmented_epithelium","Epithelial-mesenchymal_transition","Extracellular_matrix","Retina_Society_Terminology_Committee","Epiretinal_membrane","Preretinal_membrane","Subretinal_membrane","Retroretinal_membrane","Macrophage","Fibrocyte","British_Journal_of_Ophthalmology","Investigative_Ophthalmology_&_Visual_Science","Tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha","Transforming_growth_factor","Platelet_derived_growth_factor","Interleukins","Isoform","Peptide","Ciliary_body","Lens_epithelium","Muller_cell","The_Journal_of_Clinical_Investigation","Investigative_Ophthalmology_&_Visual_Science","Hepatocyte_growth_factor","Investigative_Ophthalmology_&_Visual_Science","Aphakia","British_Journal_of_Ophthalmology","Uveitis","Springer_Berlin_Heidelberg"]}
