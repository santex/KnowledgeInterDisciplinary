While a choice can be made between imagined options\n(\"what would I do if ...?\"), often a choice is made between real options and\nfollowed by the corresponding action. For example, a route for a journey is\nchosen based on the preference of arriving at a given destination as soon as\npossible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route is then derived from\ninformation about how long each of the possible routes take. This can be done by\na route planner. If the preference is more complex, such as involving the\nscenery of the route, cognition and feeling are more intertwined, and the choice\nis less easy to delegate to a computer program or assistant.\n\nMore complex examples (often decisions that affect what a person thinks or\ntheir core beliefs) include choosing a lifestyle, religious affiliation, or\npolitical position.\n\nMost people regard having choices as a good thing, though a severely limited\nor artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing and\npossibly, an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively\nnumerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not\ntaken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;<ref>Barry Schwartz,\nThe Paradox of Choice</ref> and the illusion that choosing an object or a\ncourse leads necessarily to control of that object or course can cause\npsychological problems.\n","title":"Choice","headings":["Types of choices","Choice and evaluability in economics","Number of options and the paradox of choice","Relationship to identity","Other uses","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Preference","2: Choice_architecture","1: Mental_function","1: Judging","1: Route_planner","1: Cognition","1: Feeling","1: The_Paradox_of_Choice","1: Psychological","1: Brian_Tracy","1: Color_of_the_bike_shed","1: Collaborative","1: Pilot_in_command","1: Magic_8-Ball","1: Ouija","1: Robert_Gates","1: George_Loewenstein","1: Ethnic_heritage","1: Tradition","1: Social_pressure","1: Emotion","1: Availability","1: Convenience","1: Economy","1: Image","1: Medical_conditions","1: Nutrition","1: Self-identity","1: Fire_extinguisher","1: Binomial_coefficient","1: United_States","1: United_Kingdom","1: Abortion","1: Pro-choice","1: Decision_making_software","1: Example_Choice","1: Hobson's_choice","1: Neuroscience_of_free_will","1: Public_choice_theory","1: Social_choice_theory","1: Sudbury_Valley_School","1: Two-alternative_forced_choice"]}
