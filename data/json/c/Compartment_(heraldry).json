Woodcock, Thomas and Robinson, John\nMartin, The Oxford Guide to Heraldry (1990), p106 Care must be taken to\ndistinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely\nresting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration\nunder the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases\nsuch as the coat of arms of Belize, in which what may be taken to be a crest,\nthe mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment. It\nis sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer. As an official part\nof the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from\nthe need to have different supporters for different families or entities,\nalthough sometimes the compartment is treated in the blazon separately from the\nsupporters.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Compartment_(heraldry)","recorded":1362568283,"links":27,"instances":["heraldry","heraldry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heraldry"],"headings":["Background","Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Elementy_herbu.jpg/250px-Elementy_herbu.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Coat_of_arms_of_Malta_1964-1975.svg/180px-Coat_of_arms_of_Malta_1964-1975.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Coat_of_Arms_of_Anne%2C_the_Princess_Royal.svg/180px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Anne%2C_the_Princess_Royal.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Wappen_%C3%96sterreichische_L%C3%A4nder_1915_%28Mittel%29.png/180px-Wappen_%C3%96sterreichische_L%C3%A4nder_1915_%28Mittel%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_Reichswappen_%28Mittleres%29.svg/152px-Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_-_Reichswappen_%28Mittleres%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg/106px-Grand_Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_France.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Coat_of_arms_of_Iceland.svg/142px-Coat_of_arms_of_Iceland.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shield","heraldry"],["augmentation","heraldry"]],"members":["augmentation","shield"],"related":["Heraldry","Shield_(heraldry)","Supporters","Coat_of_arms_of_Belize","Blazon","Royal_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom","Commonwealth_of_Australia","Acacia_pycnantha","Heraldic_art","Whale","Zaanstad","Noord_Holland","Netherlands","Michigan","New_Jersey","Augmentation_(heraldry)","Coat_of_Arms_of_South_Australia","Canada","University_of_Northern_British_Columbia","Female","Kermode_Bear","Woodland_caribou","Forest","Mountain","Wheat","Orca","Ron_Sebastian","Kenya","Mount_Kenya","Arbel√°ez","Cundinamarca_Department","Cumberland_County_Council,_England","Canadian_Academy_of_Engineering","Clan_Robertson","Gisborne,_New_Zealand","Malta","Anne,_Princess_Royal","Austria","German_Emperor","Kingdom_of_France","Iceland"]}
