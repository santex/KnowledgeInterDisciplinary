For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements,\nand therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality\n&ndash; one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and\nanother which uses cardinal numbers.<ref></ref>\n\nThe cardinality of a set A is usually denoted |&thinsp;A&thinsp;|, with a\nvertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the\nmeaning depends on context.
