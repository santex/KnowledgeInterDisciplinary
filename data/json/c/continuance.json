In response to delays in\nbringing cases to trial, some states have adopted \"fast-track\" rules that\nsharply limit the ability of judges to grant continuances. However, a motion for\ncontinuance may be granted when necessitated by unforeseeable events, or for\nother reasonable cause articulated by the movant (the person seeking the\ncontinuance), especially when the court deems it necessary and prudent in the\n\"interest of justice.\"\n",
