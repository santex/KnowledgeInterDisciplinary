There can be several causes of co-channel\nradio interference; four examples are listed here.\n\n*'Cellular Mobile Networks': In cellular mobile communication (GSM & LTE\nSystems, for instance), frequency spectrum is a precious resource which is\ndivided into non-overlapping spectrum bands which are assigned to different\ncells (In cellular communications, a cell refers to the hexagonal/circular area\naround the base station antenna). However, after certain geographical distance,\nthe frequency bands are re-used, i.e. the same spectrum bands are re-assigned to\nother distant cells. The co-channel interference arises in the cellular mobile\nnetworks owing to this phenomenon of Frequency reuse. Thus, besides the intended\nsignal from within the cell, signals at the same frequencies (co-channel\nsignals) arrive at the receiver from the undesired transmitters located (far\naway) in some other cells and lead to deterioration in receiver performance.\n\n*'Adverse weather conditions': During periods of uniquely high-pressure weather,\nVHF signals which would normally exit through the atmosphere can instead be\nreflected by the troposphere. This tropospheric ducting will cause the signal to\ntravel much further than intended; often causing interference to local\ntransmitters in the areas affected by the increased range of the distant\ntransmitter.\n\n*'Poor frequency planning': Poor planning of frequencies by broadcasters can\ncause CCI, although this is rare. A very localised example is Listowel in the\nsouth-west of Ireland. The RTÃNL UHF television transmitter systems in Listowel\nand Knockmoyle (near Tralee) are on the same frequencies but with opposite\npolarisation. However in some outskirts of Listowel town, both transmitters can\nbe picked up causing heavy CCI. This problem forces residents in these areas to\nuse alternative transmitters to receive RTÃ programming. Another example is the\nsurrounding area of viewers that can receive mainly Gunung Ledang transmitter in\nMalaysia. Examples are TV1 and TV2 from Bukit Tinggi and Bukit Tampin, who are\nusing both Channel 6 and Channel 9. Moreover, Negeri FM from Bukit Tampin and\nAsyik FM from Gunung Ledang, which frequencies are 95.7MHz and 95.6MHz\nrespectively. TV3 and TV1 from Gunung Ledang and Suria and Channel U from\nSingapore also using same frequency, who are using both Channel 12 and Channel\n28. That Channel 12 from Ledang can also goes to a very long distance, causing\ninterference in most of Johor area, but viewers are still able to receive TV\nstation from Gunung Pulai (Johor Bahru). This causing difficulty for viewers who\nwatching using analogue, and needs to using alternate transmitter, or force them\nto subscribe Astro/buying NJOI satellite service. In addition, Minnal FM from\nGunung Kledang, Ipoh which transmits to Central Perak and 988FM from Gunung Ulu\nKali which transmits to Klang Valley and South Perak, which are on 98.9 MHz and\n98.8 MHz respectively. The 98.9MHz can transmits to most of Perak area, causing\ninterference in most of Perak area, but listeners are still able to tune to\nMinnal FM on 96.3 MHz from Gunung Ulu Kali (Klang Valley, South Perak and Tapah)\nor 107.9 MHz from Maxwell Hill, Taiping, and 988 on 99.8 MHz from Gunung\nKledang, Ipoh.\n\n*'Overly-crowded radio spectrum': In many populated areas, there just isn't much\nroom in the radio spectrum. Stations will be jam-packed in, sometimes to the\npoint that one can hear loud and clear two, three, or more stations on the same\nfrequency, at once. In the USA, the FCC propagation models used to space\nstations on the same frequency are not always accurate in prediction of signals\nand interference. An example of this situation is in some parts of Fayetteville,\nArkansas the local 99.5 FM KAKS is displaced by KXBL 99.5 FM in Tulsa,\nparticularly on the west side of significant hills. Another example would be of\nCleveland's WKKY 104.7 having interference from Toledo's WIOT 104.7 FM on the\nOntario shore of Lake Erie, as well as Woodstock's CIHR-FM (on rare occasions),\nwhich is also on 104.7 FM, due to the signals travelling very far across Lake\nErie. The interference to WIOT from the operation of W284BQ, translator, has\nbeen resolved by the FCC. Effective October 18, 2011 it must cease operation.\n\n*'Daytime vs Nighttime': In the Medium frequency portion of the radio spectrum\nwhere most AM broadcasting is allocated, signals propagate full-time via\ngroundwave and, at nighttime, via skywave as well. This means that during the\nnighttime hours, co-channel interference exists on many AM radio frequencies due\nto the medium waves reflecting off the ionosphere and being bounced back down to\nearth. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas, there are\ninternational agreements on certain frequencies which allocate \"clear-channel\"\nbroadcasting for certain stations to either have their respective frequencies to\nthemselves at night, or to share their respective frequencies with other\nstations located over hundreds or even thousands of miles away. On other\nfrequencies, there are \"Regional Channels\" where most stations on these\nfrequencies either reduce power or change to a directional antenna system at\nnighttime to help reduce co-channel interference to each other's signals. In the\nUnited States, there are six \"Local Channel\" frequencies, also known as\n\"graveyarders\" where nearly every station on those frequencies has the same\npower and antenna pattern both day and night and, as a result of skywave\npropagation, there is normally massive co-channel interference in rural areas on\nthese frequencies, often making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand\nwhat's being said on the nearest local station on the respective channel, or the\nother distant stations which are bouncing on the same channel, during the\nnighttime hours. Skywave has been used for long distance AM radio reception\nsince radio's inception and should not be construed as a negative aspect of AM\nradio. FCC deregulation allowed many new AM radio stations on the former clear\nand regional channel designations; this is the principal cause of overcrowding\non the AM band at night. A new source of interference on the AM broadcast band\nis the new digital broadcast system called HD, any AM station that broadcasts HD\nsuperimposes digital \"hash\" on its adjacent channels. This is especially\napparent at night as some stations, for example WBZ transmits its 30 kHz\nwide signal for hundreds of miles at night causing documented interference and\ncovering another station on an adjoining frequency (WYSL 1040) as far as 400\nmiles away, The FCC refuses to do anything about interference to the AM band\nignoring HD and many other man made causes of interference to AM radio including\nmany electronic devices. Although there are FCC rules against interference they\nroutinely ignore them. *'Cancellation of signal': In addition, many AM stations,\nincluding but not limited to the clear channel stations, often experience\ncancellation of their own signals within the inner and outer fringes of their\nnormal groundwave coverage areas at nighttime due to the stations' individual\nskywave signals reaching the listeners' receivers at or near equal strength to\nthe stations' individual groundwave signals; this phenomenon is very similar to\nthe multipath interference experienced on FM Radio in the VHF band within\nmountainous regions and urban areas due to signals bouncing off of mountains,\nbuildings, and other structures, except that the groundwave-skywave cancellation\noccurs almost exclusively at nighttime when skywave propagation is present.\n\nCo-channel interference may be controlled by various radio resource\nmanagement schemes.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Co-channel_interference","recorded":1362567187,"links":12,"instances":["malaysia","communications","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Interference","Radio frequency propagation","Radio resource management"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["channel","communications"],["tv3","malaysia"],["crosstalk","electronics"]],"members":["tv3","channel","crosstalk"],"related":["Crosstalk","Radio_transmitter","Frequency","Channel_(communications)","Radio_interference","Cellular_network","GSM","3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution","Frequency_reuse","Anticyclone","Weather","VHF","Atmosphere","Troposphere","Tropospheric_ducting","Listowel","Ireland","RTÉ_Network_Limited","Tralee","Malaysia","RTM_TV1","RTM_TV2","TV3_(Malaysia)","RTM_TV1","MediaCorp_Suria","Mediacorp_Channel_U","Astro","NJOI","Minnal_FM","KAKS","KXBL","Cleveland,_Ohio","WKKY","Toledo,_Ohio","WIOT","Ontario","Woodstock,_Ontario","CIHR-FM","Lake_Erie","Medium_frequency","AM_broadcasting","Surface_wave","Skywave","Medium_wave","United_States","Canada","Mexico","The_Bahamas","North_American_Radio_Broadcasting_Agreement","Clear-channel_station","Phased_array","United_States","Multipath_interference","FM_broadcasting","Very_high_frequency","Radio_resource_management","Adjacent-channel_interference","Crosstalk_(electronics)","Signal-to-interference_ratio","Carrier-to-interference_ratio","Frequency_coordination"]}
