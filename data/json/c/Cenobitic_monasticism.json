Often in the West, the community belongs\nto a religious order and the life of the cenobitic monk is regulated by a\nreligious rule, a collection of precepts. The older style of monasticism, to\nlive as a hermit, is called eremitic; and a third form of monasticism, found\nprimarily in the East, is the skete.\n\nThe English words \"cenobite\" and \"cenobitic\" are derived, via Latin, from the\nGreek words koinos (ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½ÏÏ), \"common\", and bios (Î²Î¯Î¿Ï), \"life\". The adjective\ncan also be 'cenobiac' (ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½Î¿Î²Î¹Î±ÎºÏÏ, koinobiakos). A group of monks living in\ncommunity is often referred to as a \"cenobium\".\n\nCenobitic monasticism exists in various religions, though Buddhist and Christian\ncenobitic monasticism are the most prominent.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Cenobitic_monasticism","recorded":1362371298,"links":34,"instances":["prophet","country"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Christian monasteries","Asceticism","Christian terms"],"headings":["Origins","Saint Pachomius","Melitians and Manichaeans","Later cenobitic communities","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/StPakhom.jpg/220px-StPakhom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Saint_Gall_planta.PNG/220px-Saint_Gall_planta.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mani","prophet"],["georgia","country"]],"members":["mani","georgia"],"related":["Icon","Pachomius_the_Great","Monasticism","Monastery","Religious_order","Monastic_rule","Eremitic","Skete","Latin","Greek_language","Buddhist","Christian","Egypt","Hermit","Middle_East","Aramean","Late_Middle_Ages","Monasteries","Bohairic","Tabenna","Monastery","Pachomius","Palladius_of_Galatia","Abbey_of_St._Gall","Manichaeans","Meletius_of_Lycopolis","Mani_(prophet)","Buddhist","Elkasites","Mar_Awgin","Mt._Izla","Nisibis","Mesopotamia","Persian_Empire","Armenia","Georgia_(country)","India","China","Mar_Saba","Bethlehem","Eastern_Orthodox","Benedict_of_Nursia","Monte_Cassino","Italy","Roman_Catholic","Bruno_of_Cologne","Cenodoxus","Paris","Bernard_of_Clairvaux","Nil_Sorsky","Sheneset-Chenoboskion"]}
