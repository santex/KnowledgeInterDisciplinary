{"cursor":"3671","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Chinese jump rope' (Chinese: ; pinyin: tiÃ opÃ­jÄ«n) is a Chinese game resembling\nthe western game of hopscotch.\n\nThe game is typically played by three players (although more can participate)\nwith a rope (or, more frequently, a string of rubber bands) of about 5â6 feet in\nlength that has been tied into a circle. Two of the participants (holders) face\neach other about 3 feet apart, with their feet together, and position the rope\naround their ankles so that it is taut. The third player (the jumper) then\nstands between the two sides of the rope and must accomplish a specific series\nof moves without making an error or pausing.\n\nThe game begins with choosing the jump pattern to follow and with the holders\nholding the rubberband around their ankles. There are many jump patterns and\nmost are accompanied by a song. This is sometimes called the \"first level\". The\njumper tries to complete the chosen pattern. If the moves are completed\nsuccessfully, then the rope is moved farther up and the series is repeated. When\nthe rope gets too high for a normal person to jump over it, the player then\nkneels and uses his or her hands instead. Some people just stop the game at this\npoint, as the game is much easier when using hands. If the jumper makes a\nmistake, players rotate their positions and the next player becomes the jumper.\nOnce the player is finished, that person switches with one of the other people,\nand so on much, until everyone has been able to play.\n\nThe moves involve jumping and repositioning the feet in some manner. Some of the\nmore common moves are jumping so that both feet land outside the rope, both are\ninside the rope, one is inside and one is outside, or both are on top of the\nrope. These moves are called \"out\", \"in\", \"side\", and \"on\" respectively, which\nthe two other participants chant as the player executes them. Some other, less\ncommon, moves involve manipulating the rope. One of these moves, called\n\"scissors\", is executed by starting with both feet outside the rope and then\ncrossing the legs, with the ropes in tow, so that a formation resembling a pair\nof scissors is formed.\n\nThere are many variations of the game that are played. Sometimes the rope is criss-\ncrossed so that it makes an X, and the player must move his or her feet into\ndifferent sections of the X in some pattern. Instead of simply raising the rope,\nsome players create a procession of \"levels\", similar to a video game, that the\nplayer must complete before winning the game. When a player returns to jumping,\nthey continue the game from the last uncompleted level. The player that first\ncompletes the levels (usually five to nine, up to neck height) wins the game.\nThese levels often have specific names, such as the \"roller coaster,\" which is a\ncriss-crossed rope that is higher at one end than the other.\n\nChinese Jump Rope is a universal game. It has been popular for many years,\ncertainly since the 1960s, in the United States. German speaking children call\nChinese Jump Rope 'Gummitwist', and it is popular among young girls in Germany,\nAustria, Italy, Turkey and countries of ex-Yugoslavia. In New Zealand, Australia\nand Great Britain children refer to the game as \"'Elastics'\". It is also known\nas skip-tape. Estonians call this game \"kummikeks\", the meaning of which is most\nsimilar to skip-tape. In ex-Yugoslavia children commonly refer to the game as\n'LastiÅ¡' (a rubber band).\n","linknr":95,"url":"Chinese_jump_rope","recorded":1363437455,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Gummitwist-1998Kinder1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Gummitwist-1998Kinder1.jpg/300px-Gummitwist-1998Kinder1.jpg","/wiki/File:Gummitwist-1998Kinder1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B7%B3%E7%9A%AE%E7%AD%8B","/wiki/Hopscotch","/wiki/Rubber_band","/wiki/Roller_coaster","/wiki/Yugoslavia","/wiki/Yugoslavia","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Jumpsies","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&oldid=540833742","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Children%27s_games","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_February_2011","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_January_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chinese+jump+rope&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chinese+jump+rope","/wiki/Chinese_jump_rope","/wiki/Talk:Chinese_jump_rope","#","/wiki/Chinese_jump_rope","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chinese_jump_rope","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chinese_jump_rope","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&oldid=540833742","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chinese_jump_rope&id=540833742","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chinese+jump+rope","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chinese+jump+rope&oldid=540833742&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Chinese_jump_rope&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gummitwist","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_goma_(juego)","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99_(%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D)","//ln.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca_cola","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastieken","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoppe_strikk","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Chinese
