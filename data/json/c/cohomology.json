That is, cohomology is defined as the abstract study of\n'cochains', cocycles, and coboundaries. Cohomology can be viewed as a method of\nassigning algebraic invariants to a topological space that has a more refined\nalgebraic structure than does homology. Cohomology arises from the algebraic\ndualization of the construction of homology. In less abstract language, cochains\nin the fundamental sense should assign 'quantities' to the [[chain (algebraic\ntopology)|chains]] of homology theory.\n\nFrom its beginning in topology, this idea became a dominant method in the\nmathematics of the second half of the twentieth century; from the initial idea\nof homology as a topologically invariant relation on chains, the range of\napplications of homology and cohomology theories has spread out over geometry\nand abstract algebra. The terminology tends to mask the fact that in many\napplications cohomology, a contravariant theory, is more natural than homology.\nAt a basic level this has to do with functions and pullbacks in geometric\nsituations: given spaces X and Y, and some kind of function F on Y, for any\nmapping f : X → Y composition with f gives rise to a function F o f on X.\nCohomology groups often also have a natural product, the cup product, which\ngives them a ring structure. Because of this feature, cohomology is a stronger\ninvariant than homology, as it can differentiate between certain algebraic\nobjects that homology cannot.\n","title":"cohomology","headings":["Definition","History","Cohomology theories","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Algebraic_topology","3: Singular_homology","2: Abelian_group","2: Chain_complex","2: Cup_product","2: Simplicial_homology","2: PoincarÃ©_duality","2: James_Waddell_Alexander_II","2: Äech_cohomology","2: EilenbergâSteenrod_axioms","2: CW_complex","1: Mathematics","1: Homology_theory","1: Sequence","1: Coboundary","1: Algebraic_invariant","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Topology","1: Geometry","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors","1: Dual_space","1: Dual_space#Transpose_of_a_linear_map","1: Homological_algebra","1: Cohomology#Cohomology_theories","1: Henri_PoincarÃ©","1: J.W._Alexander","1: Solomon_Lefschetz","1: Intersection_theory","1: Manifold","1: Dimension","1: General_position","1: Diagonal","1: Georges_de_Rham","1: Differential_form","1: De_Rham's_theorem","1: Lev_Pontryagin","1: Pontryagin_duality","1: Topological_group","1: Alexander_duality","1: Moscow","1: Andrey_Kolmogorov","1: Norman_Steenrod","1: Äech_homology","1: Hassler_Whitney","1: Eduard_Äech","1: Cap_product","1: Samuel_Eilenberg","1: Edwin_Spanier","1: AlexanderâSpanier_cohomology","1: Functor","1: Topological_space","1: Continuous_function","1: Subcategory","1: Homomorphism","1: Singular_cohomology","1: De_Rham_cohomology","1: Sheaf_cohomology","1: K-theory","1: Cobordism_theory","1: Stable_homotopy_theory","1: AtiyahâHirzebruch_spectral_sequence","1: Representable_functor","1: AndrÃ©âQuillen_cohomology","1: BRST_cohomology","1: BonarâClaven_cohomology","1: Bounded_cohomology","1: Coherent_cohomology","1: Crystalline_cohomology","1: Cyclic_cohomology","1: Deligne_cohomology","1: Dirac_cohomology","1: Ãtale_cohomology","1: Flat_cohomology","1: Galois_cohomology","1: Gel'fandâFuks_cohomology","1: Group_cohomology","1: Harrison_cohomology","1: Hochschild_cohomology","1: Intersection_cohomology","1: Khovanov_Homology","1: Lie_algebra_cohomology","1: Local_cohomology","1: Motivic_cohomology","1: Non-abelian_cohomology","1: Perverse_cohomology","1: Quantum_cohomology","1: Schur_cohomology","1: Spencer_cohomology","1: Topological_AndrÃ©âQuillen_cohomology","1: Topological_cyclic_cohomology","1: Topological_Hochschild_cohomology","1: Î_cohomology","1: List_of_cohomology_theories","1: Allen_Hatcher"]}
