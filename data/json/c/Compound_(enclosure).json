Refuse food & excreta\nacummulation. - Bathurst, Gambia - December 1910]]\n\n'Compound' when applied to a human habitat refers to a cluster of buildings in\nan enclosure, having a shared or associated purpose, such as the houses of an\nextended family (e.g. the Kennedy Compound for the Kennedy family). The\nenclosure may be a wall, a fence, a hedge or some other structure, or it may be\nformed by the buildings themselves, when they are built around an open area or\njoined together.\n\nCompound is etymologically derived from Portuguese or Dutch word from\n\"kampoeng\", which in turn originates from the Malay word \"kampung\" or \"kampung\"\n(spelling may differ according to region). The word \"kampung\" means a\nsettlement, a group of houses or a village.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"compound\" is not generally used in the sense of an\nunfortified enclosure, and not for homes. There, as in North American English,\nif used for a place, it is most likely to be taken to mean a fortified military\ncompound. The unfortified enclosure usage was developed by the British Empire in\nAsia and Africa. Now it has slightly different meanings among English-speaking\npeople in those continents: *In Asia it refers to a collection of business\nestablishments or living quarters, especially those used by Europeans. *In\nAfrica it used to mean a collection of workers' houses, but is now used for any\ncluster of related or linked homes, especially residences for members of the\nsame family or those working for the same employer, or those belonging to a\nfarm, or the cluster of houses known in Africa as a homestead. The term can also\nbe applied to an establishment such as a school or business, as in \"the school\ncompound\" or \"the factory compound\". In the English dialects of some African\ncountries, \"compound\" may refer to a much larger collection of dwellings, as a\nsynonym for a homogeneous township or suburb comprising homes of similar\ncharacter usually built as public housing projects, or for a shantytown. An\nexample is Chawama Compound, Lusaka, Zambia.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Compound_(enclosure)","recorded":1363180459,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:The_National_Archives_UK_-_CO_1069-26-22.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/The_National_Archives_UK_-_CO_1069-26-22.jpg/220px-The_National_Archives_UK_-_CO_1069-26-22.jpg","/wiki/File:The_National_Archives_UK_-_CO_1069-26-22.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Banjul","/wiki/Gambia","/wiki/Habitat","/wiki/Building","/wiki/Kennedy_Compound","/wiki/Kennedy_family","/wiki/Enclosure_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wall","/wiki/Fence","/wiki/Hedge_(barrier)","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/North_American_English","/wiki/Compound_(fortification)","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Asia","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/English-speaking","/wiki/Asia","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/Homestead_(small_African_settlement)","/wiki/School","/wiki/Business","/wiki/English_language_in_Africa","/wiki/Township","/wiki/Suburb","/wiki/Public_housing","/wiki/Shantytown","/wiki/Lusaka","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Compound_(fortification)","/wiki/Boma_(enclosure)","/wiki/Kraal","/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden%27s_hideout_compound","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&oldid=530835279","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Human_habitats","/wiki/Category:Fences","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_November_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Compound+%28enclosure%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Compound+%28enclosure%29","/wiki/Compound_(enclosure)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Compound_(enclosure)","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Compound_(enclosure)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Compound_(enclosure)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&oldid=530835279","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Compound_%28enclosure%29&id=530835279","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Compound+%28enclosure%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Compound+%28enclosure%29&oldid=530835279&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Compound_(enclosure)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(enclosure)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php
