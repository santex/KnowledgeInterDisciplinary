{"cursor":"30488","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'culture of [[Europe]]' might better be described as a series of multiple\ncultures, often competing; geographical regions opposing one another, Orthodoxy\nas opposed to Catholicism as opposed to Protestantism as opposed to Judaism as\nopposed to Secularism as opposed to Islam; many have claimed to identify\ncultural fault lines across the continent. There are many cultural innovations\nand movements, often at odds with each other, such as Christian proselytism or\nHumanism. Thus the question of \"common culture\" or \"common values\" is far more\ncomplex than it seems to be.\n\nUpon the pagan cultures of aboriginal Europe, the foundations of modern European\ncultures Sailen Debnath, Secularism: Western and Indian, ISBN 9788126913664,\nAtlantic Publishers, New Delhi were laid by the Greeks, strengthened by\nthe Romans, stabilized by Christianity, added to by the rest of Europe, reformed\nand modernized by the fifteenth-century Renaissance and Reformation, and\nglobalized by successive European empires between the sixteenth and twentieth\ncenturies. Thus the European Culture developed into a very complex phenomenon of\nwider range of philosophy, Judeo-Christian and secular humanism, rational ways\nof life and logical thinking developed through a long age of change and\nformation with the experiments of enlightenment, naturalism, romanticism,\nscience, democracy, fascism, communism, and socialism. Because of its global\nconnection, the European culture grew with an all-inclusive urge to adopt, adapt\nand ultimately influence other trends of culture. As a matter of fact,\ntherefore, from the middle of the nineteenth century with the expansion of\nEuropean education and the spread of Christianity, European culture and way of\nlife, to a great extent, turned into \"global culture,\" if anything has to be so\nnamed.
