{"cursor":"9943","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n showing a thrombus (center of image) within a blood vessel of the placenta.\n H&E stain.]]\n\nA 'thrombus' (), or 'blood clot', is the final product of the blood coagulation\nstep in hemostasis. It is achieved via the aggregation of platelets that form a\nplatelet plug, and the activation of the humoral coagulation system (i.e.\nclotting factors). A thrombus is normal in cases of injury, but pathologic in\ninstances of thrombosis.\n\nMural thrombi are thrombi adherent to the vessel wall. They are not occlusive\nand affect large vessels, such as heart and aorta. Grossly they appear grey-red\nwith alternating light and dark lines (lines of Zahn) which represent bands of\nfibrin (lighter) with entrapped white blood cells and red blood cells (darker).\n","linknr":278,"url":"Clot","recorded":1362565491,"links":41,"instances":["medicine","circulatory","fruit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hematology"],"headings":["Pathophysiology","Formation","Treatment","Presentation","Prognosis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Fetal_thrombotic_vasculopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg/220px-Fetal_thrombotic_vasculopathy_-_very_high_mag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Blood_clot_diagram.png/300px-Blood_clot_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["orange","fruit"],["stasis","medicine"],["shock","circulatory"]],"members":["stasis","shock","orange"],"related":["Placenta","H&E_stain","Blood_coagulation","Hemostasis","Platelets","Coagulation","Injury","Pathology","Thrombosis","Aorta","Lines_of_Zahn","Embolism","Atrial_fibrillation","Cardiac_arrhythmia","Myocardial_infarction","Myocardial_infarction","Deep_venous_thrombosis","Collagen","Tissue_factor","Stroke","Myocardial_infarction","Pulmonary_embolism","Heparin","Warfarin","Antithrombin","Vitamin_K_epoxide_reductase","Streptokinase","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Haementeria_ghilianii","Hementin","Onions","Apples","Orange_(fruit)","Rutin","Virchow's_triad","Atheroma","Laminar_flow","Stasis_(medicine)","Turbulence","Valvulitis","Aneurysm","Leukaemia","Leiden","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Fibrinolysis","Platelets","Septicaemia","Leukaemia","Shock_(circulatory)","Atherosclerotic","Aneurysm","Embolism","Deep_venous_thrombosis","Smooth_muscle","Fibroblast","Endothelium","Embolism","Thrombolysis","Thrombogenicity","National_Blood_Clot_Alliance"]}
