{"cursor":"54540","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Civilization' (or 'civilisation') is a sometimes controversial term that has\nbeen used in several related ways. Primarily, the term has been used to refer to\nthe material and instrumental side of human cultures that are complex in terms\nof technology, science, and division of labor. Such civilizations are generally\nhierarchical and urbanized. In a classical context, people were called\n\"civilized\" to set them apart from barbarians, savages, and primitive peoples\nwhile in a modern-day context, \"civilized peoples\" have been contrasted with\nindigenous peoples or tribal societies.\n\nThere is a tendency to use the term in a less strict way, to mean approximately\nthe same thing as \"culture\" and therefore, the term can more broadly refer to\nany important and clearly defined human society. Still, even when\nused in this second sense, the word is often restricted to apply only to\nsocieties that have attained a particular level of advancementâespecially the\nfounding of cities.\n\nThe level of advancement of a civilization is often measured by its progress in\nagriculture, long-distance trade, occupational specialization, a special\ngoverning class, and urbanism. Aside from these core elements, a civilization is\noften marked by any combination of a number of secondary elements, including a\ndeveloped transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency,\ncontractual and tort-based legal systems, characteristic art and architecture,\nmathematics, enhanced scientific understanding, metallurgy, political\nstructures, and organized religion.\n\n's map of major
