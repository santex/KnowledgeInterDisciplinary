The\ncompany's proprietary databases are curated by CAS scientists and recognized by\nchemical and pharmaceutical companies, universities, government organizations,\nand patent offices around the world as an important source of chemical\ninformation. By combining these databases with advanced search and analysis\ntechnologies, CAS databases are said to deliver a current, complete, and cross-\nlinked digital information environment for scientific discovery.\n\nCAS is located in Columbus, Ohio, United States.\n\nIn 2007 the Chemical Abstracts Service was designated an ACS National Historic\nChemical Landmark in recognition of its significance as the most comprehensive\nrepository of research in chemistry and related sciences.
