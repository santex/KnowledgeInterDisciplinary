{"cursor":"21692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]] 'Cellular respiration' is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes\nthat take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from\nnutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste\nproducts. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic\nreactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in\nthe process as they break high-energy bonds. Respiration is one of the key\nways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular\nrespiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction. The overall reaction\nis broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body, most of which are\nredox reactions themselves. Although technically, cellular respiration is a\ncombustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a\nliving cell. This difference is because it occurs in many separate steps.\nWhile the overall reaction is a combustion, no single reaction that comprises\nit is a combustion reaction.\n\nNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration\ninclude sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and a common oxidizing agent\n(electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O 2). The energy stored in\nATP can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including\nbiosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.\n","linknr":460,"url":"Cellular_respiration","recorded":1362505023,"links":58,"instances":["running","biochemistry","chemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular respiration|","Metabolism","Plant physiology"],"headings":["Aerobic respiration","Efficiency of ATP production","Fermentation","Anaerobic respiration","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Padlock-olive.svg/20px-Padlock-olive.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/CellRespiration.svg/300px-CellRespiration.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Auto-and_heterotrophs.png/220px-Auto-and_heterotrophs.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Respiration_diagram.png/220px-Respiration_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Cellular_respiration.gif/220px-Cellular_respiration.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["motion","physics#cells"],["reduction","chemistry"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["sprint","running"]],"members":["sprint","motion","fermentation","reduction","cell"],"related":["Metabolism","Cell_(biology)","Organism","Adenosine_triphosphate","Catabolism","Exothermic_reaction","Redox","Combustion_reaction","Sugar","Amino_acids","Fatty_acids","Oxidizing_agent","Electron_acceptor","Oxygen","Biosynthesis","Cell_membrane","Oxygen","Adenosine_triphosphate","Carbohydrates","Fat","Proteins","Pyruvate","Glycolysis","Mitochondrion","Citric_acid_cycle","Adenosine_triphosphate","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","NADH","FADH2","Electron_transport_chain","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Chemiosmotic_potential","Proton","Adenosine_diphosphate","Glycolysis","Eukaryote","Cytoplasm","Prokaryote","Metabolic_pathway","Cytosol","Pyruvate","Lactate","Glucose","Pyruvate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Phosphorylation","Pyruvate","Aldolase","Phosphate","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Pyruvate","Pyruvate","Pyruvate_dehydrogenase_complex","Mitochondrial_matrix","Acetyl-CoA","Acetyl-CoA","Citric_acid_cycle","Carbon_dioxide","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","NADH","NADH","Electron_transport_chain","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cellular_waste_product","Crista","Proton_gradient","Reduction_(chemistry)","Coenzyme","Electrochemical_gradient","Antiporter","Symporter","Adenine_nucleotide_translocator","Antiporter","Inner_membrane","Thermogenin","Electron_transport_chain","ATP_synthase","Brown_adipose_tissue","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Eucaryota","Glucose","Carbon_dioxide","Mitochondrion","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","ATP_synthase","ATPâ€“ADP_translocase","SLC25A3","Electron_transport_chain","Proton_pump","Glycerol_phosphate_shuttle","Malate-aspartate_shuttle","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Glycolysis","Krebs_cycle","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Pyruvate_decarboxylation","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Glycolysis","Mitochondrion","Ethanol_fermentation","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Cytoplasm","Electron_transport_chain","Cellular_waste_product","Lactic_acid","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Ethanol","Carbon_dioxide","Ethanol_fermentation","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Cellular_waste_product","Ethanol","Sprint_(running)","Sulfate","Nitrate","Tetrazolium_chloride","Maintenance_respiration","Pasteur_point","Respirometry"]}
