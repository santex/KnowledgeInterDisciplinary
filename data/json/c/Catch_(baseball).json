{"cursor":"3347","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nIn baseball, a 'catch' occurs when a fielder gains secure possession of a batted\nball in flight, and maintains possession until he voluntarily or negligently\nreleases the ball. [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/0-\n2_definition_of_terms.pdf Official Baseball Rules] When a catch occurs,\nthe batter is out, and runners, once they properly tag up (retouch their time-of-\npitch base), may attempt to advance at risk of being tagged out.\n\nUnlike in American football and other sports, neither secure possession for a\ntime nor for a number of steps is enough to demonstrate that a catch has\noccurred. A fielder may, for example, appear to catch and hold a batted ball\nsecurely, take a few more steps, collide with a wall or another player, and drop\nthe ball. This is not a catch.\n\nUmpires signal a catch with the out signal: a fist raised into the air, often\nwith a hammering motion; if there is doubt about it, the umpire will likely\nshout \"That's a catch!\" On a close no-catch, the umpire will signal with the\nsafe signal, which is both arms swept to the side and extended, accompanied by\nthe call \"No catch, no catch!\" with an emphasis on the word \"no\".\n\nThe fielder must catch the ball with his hand or glove. If the fielder chooses\nto use his cap, protector, pocket or any other part of his uniform in getting\npossession, it is not a catch. Therefore, a foul ball which directly becomes\nlodged in the equipment of the catcher (other than his or her glove) is not\nconsidered a catch and hence not a foul tip.\n\nIt is not a catch if the batted ball hits a fielder, then hits a member of the\noffensive team or an umpire, and then is caught by another defensive player.\n\nA catch is legal if the ball is finally held by any fielder before it touches\nthe ground. Runners may leave their bases the instant the first fielder touches\nthe ball. A fielder may reach over a fence, a railing, a rope, or a line of\ndemarcation to make a catch. He may jump on top of a railing or a canvas that\nmay be in foul ground. Interference should not be called in cases where a\nspectator comes into contact with a fielder and a catch is not made if the\nfielder reaches over a fence, a railing, a rope. The runner does so at his or\nher own risk.\n\nIf a fielder, attempting a catch at the edge of the dugout, is âheld upâ and\nkept from an apparent fall by a player or players of either team and the catch\nis made, it shall be allowed.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity with the common term catch meaning any action that gains\npossession of a ball, some may say that a fielder 'gloved' a thrown ball or a\nbatted, bouncing ball.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Catch_(baseball)","recorded":1374540899,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Catch_(baseball)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(baseball)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Catch_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catch_(baseball)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Baseball_rules","/wiki/Fielder_(baseball)","/wiki/In_flight","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Tag_up","/wiki/Time-of-pitch","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)","/wiki/Out_(baseball)","/wiki/Safe_(baseball)","/wiki/Foul_tip","/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(baseball)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf","/wiki/Template:Baseball","/wiki/Template_talk:Baseball","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baseball&action=edit","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Backstop_(baseball)","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Batter%27s_box","/wiki/Batter%27s_eye","/wiki/Bullpen","/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)","/wiki/Foul_territory","/wiki/Foul_pole","/wiki/Infield","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Outfield","/wiki/Strike_zone","/wiki/Warning_track","/wiki/Baseball_clothing_and_equipment","/wiki/Baseball_bat","/wiki/Baseball_(ball)","/wiki/Baseball_glove","/wiki/Batting_glove","/wiki/Batting_helmet","/wiki/Baseball_cap","/wiki/Baseball_doughnut","/wiki/Baseball_stirrups","/wiki/Baseball_uniform","/wiki/Uniform_number_(Major_League_Baseball)","/wiki/Shin_guard","/wiki/Jockstrap#Protective_cup","/wiki/Batting_cage","/wiki/Pitching_machine","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Extra_innings","/wiki/Out_(baseball)","/wiki/Seventh-inning_stretch","/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Plate_appearance","/wiki/Hit_and_run_(baseball)","/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt","/wiki/Sacrifice_fly","/wiki/Slap_bunt","/wiki/Baltimore_chop","/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Foul_ball","/wiki/Foul_tip","/wiki/Checked_swing","/wiki/Ground_rule_double","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Infield_hit","/wiki/Hit_by_pitch","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Single_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)","/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run","/wiki/Walk-off_home_run","/wiki/Lefty-righty_switch","/wiki/Double_switch_(baseball)","/wiki/Line_drive","/wiki/Count_(baseball)","/wiki/Sweet_spot_(sports)","/wiki/Pull_hitter","/wiki/Hitting_for_the_cycle","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Beanball","/wiki/Breaking_ball","/wiki/Brushback_pitch","/wiki/Changeup","/wiki/Curveball","/wiki/Fastball","/wiki/Full_count","/wiki/Inside_pitching","/wiki/Knuckleball","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Pitch_count","/wiki/Pitchout","/wiki/Quick_pitch","/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball","/wiki/Slider","/wiki/Spitball","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Striking_out_the_side","/wiki/Wild_pitch","/wiki/Time_of_pitch","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Perfect_game","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Bases_loaded","/wiki/Caught_stealing","/wiki/Left_on_base","/wiki/Safe_(baseball)","/wiki/Scoring_position","/wiki/Small_ball","/wiki/Squeeze_play_(baseball)","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Tag_up","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Contact_play","/wiki/Double_play","/wiki/Force_play","/wiki/Hidden_ball_trick","/wiki/In-between_hop","/wiki/Triple_play","/wiki/Unassisted_triple_play","/wiki/Pickoff","/wiki/Wheel_play","/wiki/Fourth_out","/wiki/Rundown","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Appeal_play","/wiki/Assist_(baseball)","/wiki/Infield_shift","/wiki/Wall_climb","/wiki/Fielder%27s_choice","/wiki/Defensive_indifference","/wiki/In_flight","/wiki/Infield_fly_rule","/wiki/Bench-clearing_brawl","/wiki/Pepper_(baseball)","/wiki/Shagging_(baseball)","/wiki/Uncaught_third_strike","/wiki/Interference_(baseball)","/wiki/Golden_sombrero","/wiki/Ground_rules_(baseball)","/wiki/Instant_replay_in_baseball","/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball","/wiki/Slump_(sports)","/wiki/Bench_jockey","/wiki/D
