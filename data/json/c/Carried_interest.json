{"cursor":"12389","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Carried interest' or 'carry', in finance, specifically in alternative\ninvestments (i.e., private equity and hedge funds), is a share of the profits of\nan investment or investment fund that is paid to the investment manager in\nexcess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership.\n\nIn private equity, in order to receive carried interest, the manager must first\nreturn all capital contributed by the investors, and, in certain cases, the fund\nmust also return a previously agreed-upon rate of return (the \"hurdle rate\" or\n\"preferred return\") to investors. \"Hurdle Rate\" explained by [http://www.mergers-\nacquisitions.org/glossary/term/105/ mergers-acquisitions.org]. Private\nequity funds only distribute carried interest to the manager upon successfully\nexiting an investment, which may take years. The customary hurdle rate in\nprivate equity is 7â8% per annum.\n\nIn a hedge fund environment, carried interest is usually referred to as a\n\"performance fee\". Hedge funds, because they invest in liquid investments, often\nare able to pay carried interest annually, if the fund has generated a profit\nfor its investors.\n\nThe manager's carried-interest allocation will vary depending upon the type of\ninvestment fund and the demand for the fund from investors. In private equity,\nthe standard carried-interest allocation historically has been 20% for funds\nmaking buyout and venture investments. Notable examples of private equity\nfirms with carried interest of 25% to 30% include Bain Capital and Providence\nEquity Partners. Carried-interest rates â performance fees â among hedge\nfunds have historically also centered around 20%, but have had greater\nvariability than those of private equity funds, in extreme cases reaching as\nhigh as 50% of a fund's profits, although usually it is between 15% and 20%.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Carried_interest","recorded":1362666954,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h2834ih.txt.pdf","http://finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/071107testes1.pdf","http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1935ih.txt.pdf","http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/shareschemes/bvca_and_fb2003_carried_interest.pdf","http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2007/pbrn17.pdf","http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/83xx/doc8306/07-11-CarriedInterest_Testimony.pdf"],"categories":["Financial terminology","Hedge funds","Private equity","Venture capital"],"headings":["Carried interest and management fees","Taxation of carried interest","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg/28px-Emblem-money.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/United_States_penny%2C_obverse%2C_2002.jpg/28px-United_States_penny%2C_obverse%2C_2002.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Chicklet-currency.jpg/90px-Chicklet-currency.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Alternative_investment","Private_equity","Hedge_fund","Investment_manager","Private_equity","Private_equity_firm","Bain_Capital","Providence_Equity_Partners","Initial_public_offering","Blackstone_Group","Capital_gain","Present_value","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eighth_Circuit","Internal_Revenue_Service","United_States_Congress","United_States_House_of_Representatives","Sander_M._Levin","Portable_Document_Format","Adobe_Acrobat","Henry_Paulson","Bloomberg_L.P.","United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury","United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Finance","Charles_B._Rangel","Presidency_of_Barack_Obama","Portable_Document_Format","Adobe_Acrobat","Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012","Mitt_Romney","Finance_Act_1972","Inland_Revenue","Finance_Act_2003","Portable_Document_Format","Adobe_Acrobat","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","BBC_News","BBC_News","Portable_Document_Format","Adobe_Acrobat","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","Performance_fee","Taxation_of_private_equity_and_hedge_funds","Peter_R._Orszag","Chris_William_Sanchirico"]}
