{"cursor":"14578","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":This article largely discusses complex systems as'a subject of mathematics' and\nthe attempts to emulate physical complex systems with emergent properties. For\nother scientific and professional disciplines addressing complexity in their\nfields see the [[complex systems]] article and references.\n\nA 'complex system' is a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole\nexhibit one or more properties (behavior among the possible properties) not\nobvious from the properties of the individual parts. Joslyn, C. and Rocha,\nL. (2000).Complex system may also be considered as any system which involves a\nnumber of elements, arranged in structure which can exist in any scales.These go\nthrough the processes of change that are not describable by a single rule nor\nare reducible to only one level of explanation. Towards semiotic agent-based\nmodels of socio-technical organizations, Proc. AI, Simulation and Planning in\nHigh Autonomy Systems (AIS 2000) Conference, Tucson, Arizona, pp. 70-79. A\nsystemâs complexity may be of one of two forms: disorganized complexity and\norganized complexity. In essence, disorganized complexity is a matter\nof a very large number of parts, and organized complexity is a matter of the\nsubject system (quite possibly with only a limited number of parts) exhibiting\nemergent properties.\n\nExamples of complex systems for which complexity models have been developed\ninclude ant colonies, human economies and social structures, climate, nervous\nsystems, cells and living things, including human beings, as well as modern\nenergy or telecommunication infrastructures. Indeed, many systems of interest to\nhumans are complex systems. Complex systems are studied by many areas of natural\nscience, mathematics, and social science. Fields that specialize in the\ninterdisciplinary study of complex systems include systems theory, complexity\ntheory, systems ecology, and cybernetics.\n","linknr":367,"url":"Complex_system","recorded":1362476965,"links":36,"instances":["systems_theory","disambiguation","disambiguation","haken","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dfc/site/mypublications/againstSystems.pdf"],"categories":["Complex dynamics","Complex systems theory","Systems"],"headings":["Overview","History","Types of complex systems","Topics on complex systems","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Club_Lambda.png/220px-Club_Lambda.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["open_system","systems_theory"],["synergetics","haken"],["cell","biology"],["complex","disambiguation"],["complexity","disambiguation"]],"members":["open_system","complexity","complex","synergetics","cell"],"related":["System","Agent-based_model","Complexity","Emergence","System","Ant_colony","Complexity_economics","Sociology_and_complexity_science","Climate","Nervous_system","Cell_(biology)","Telecommunication","Natural_science","Mathematics","Social_science","Systems_theory","Systems_ecology","Cybernetics","System","Complexity","Science","Paradigm","Leo_Kadanoff","George_M._Whitesides","W._Brian_Arthur","Physics","Chemistry","Mathematics","Chaos_theory","Deterministic","Dynamical_systems","Nonlinearity","Neural_networks","Self-organizing","Nonequilibrium_thermodynamics","Chemist","Nobel_laureate","Ilya_Prigogine","Dissipative_structures","Chaos_theory","Topological_mixing","Periodic_orbit","Dense_set","Complex_adaptive_system","Complexity","Adaptive","Stock_market","Ant","Biosphere","Ecosystem","Human_brain","Immune_system","Cell_(biology)","Embryo","Manufacturing","Social_system","Political_party","Community","Social_bookmarking","Superposition_principle","Linear_systems","Nonlinearity","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Thermodynamic","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Pattern_stability","Synergetics_(Haken)","Dynamical_systems","Hysteresis","Economics","Organisation","Person","Cell_(biology)","Small-world_network","Scale-free_network","Cerebral_cortex","Axonal","Emergence","Termites","Social_behavior","Butterfly_effect","Nonlinearity","Feedback","Biological_organisation","Complex_(disambiguation)","Complexity_(disambiguation)","Dissipative_system","Fractal","Innovation_butterfly","Mixed_reality","System_equivalence","Ignazio_Licata","World_Scientific","Imperial_College_Press"]}
