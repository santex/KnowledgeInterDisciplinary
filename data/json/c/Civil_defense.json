{"cursor":"24985","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n and to be used as a protective sign]]\n\n'Civil defense' ('civil defence'), (see spelling differences) or 'civil\nprotection' is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally non-\ncombatants) from military attack. It uses the principles of emergency\noperations: prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, or emergency\nevacuation, and recovery. Programmes of this sort were initially discussed at\nleast as early as the 1920s and were implemented in many countries, but only\nbecame widespread after the threat of nuclear weapons was realized.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the focus of civil defense has largely shifted\nfrom military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. The new concept is\ndescribed by a number of terms, each of which has its own specific shade of\nmeaning, such as '[[crisis management]]', '[[emergency management]]', 'emergency\npreparedness', 'contingency planning', 'emergency services', and 'civil\nprotection'.\n\nIn some countries, civil defense is seen as a key part of \"total defense\". For\nexample in Sweden, the Swedish word totalfÃ¶rsvar refers to the commitment of a\nwide range of resources of the nation to its defense - including to civil\nprotection. Respectively, some countries (notably the Soviet Union) may have military-\norganized civil defense units (Civil Defense Troops) as part of their armed\nforces or as a paramilitary service.\n","linknr":394,"url":"Civil_defense","recorded":1362546687,"links":47,"instances":["san_marino","information_gathering","nerve_agent"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.or/irp/offdocs/prm/prm32.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pd/pd41.pdf"],"categories":["Civil
