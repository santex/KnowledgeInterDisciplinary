{"cursor":"2583","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Creatures of statute' (also known as 'creatures of the state') are legal\nentities, such as corporations, created by statute. Creatures of statute may\ninclude municipalities and other artificial legal entities or\nrelationships. [http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm Creature of the State --\nQuaqua Society ] Thus, when a statute in some\nfashion requires the formation of a corporate bodyâoften for governmental\npurposesâsuch bodies when formed are known as \"creatures of statute.\" The same\nconcept is also expressed with the phrase \"creature of the\nstate.\" [http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm Creature of the State -- Quaqua\nSociety ]\n\nThe term \"creature of statute\" is most common to the United States. In the\nUnited Kingdom, these bodies are simply called statutory corporations (or\nstatutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The United\nKingdom Atomic Energy Authority is an example. In a wider sense, most companies\nin the UK are created under statute since the Companies Act 1985 specifies how a\ncompany may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not\ncalled 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents\nthat speak of governing bodies (e.g., a board that governs small businesses in\nChina) these bodies are described as \"creatures of statute\" to inform readers of\ntheir origins and format although the national governments that created them may\nnot term them as creatures of statute. Australia also uses the term \"creature of\nstatute\" to describe some governmental bodies.\n\nThe importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such\na body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within\nthe scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the\ncreature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work\ndescribed by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of\nstatute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws\nthat created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of\nstatute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Creature_of_statute","recorded":1364126028,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Corporation","/wiki/Statute","/wiki/Municipality","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Statutory_corporation","/wiki/United_Kingdom_Atomic_Energy_Authority","/wiki/Companies_Act_1985","/wiki/Australia","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Competition_regulator","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.quaqua.org/creature.htm","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Law-term-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Law-term-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Law-term-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&oldid=498279595","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Administrative_law","/wiki/Category:Corporations_law","/wiki/Category:Statutory_law","/wiki/Category:Legal_fictions","/wiki/Category:Legal_term_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Creature+of+statute&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Creature+of+statute","/wiki/Creature_of_statute","/wiki/Talk:Creature_of_statute","#","/wiki/Creature_of_statute","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Creature_of_statute","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Creature_of_statute","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&oldid=498279595","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Creature_of_statute&id=498279595","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Creature+of+statute","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Creature+of+statute&oldid=498279595&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Creature_of_statute&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_of_statute","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&
