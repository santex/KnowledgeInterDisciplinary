{"cursor":"4048","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn graphic design and advertising, a 'comprehensive layout' or 'comprehensive,'\nusually shortened to 'comp', is the page layout of a proposed design as\ninitially presented by the designer to a client, showing the relative positions\nof text and illustrations before the final content of those elements has been\ndecided upon. The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if\napproved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately,\nproduction.\n\nTraditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art\ncreation (e.g., advertisement) are:\n* Sketch â the initial idea roughly \"sketched out\" in order to quickly transfer\n  the idea on to a physical substrate\n* Layout â the idea laid out in relative position for further development\n* Comp â the idea created in such a way as to closely mimic the final creation,\n  usually as a step toward approval by decision-makers\n* Finish â the idea rendered in the appropriate medium for sale, display, or\n  reproduction\n\nFor traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is\nmore clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the\ndistinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and\npresentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because\nof this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or\nillustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper\ncould be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually\nappear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp\ncould be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece\nfor a client's approval.\n\nWith computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become\nblurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely\nsegmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-\ngenerated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-\nstage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly\nthe same as with traditional media. Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing\nsoftware, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials\nto avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the\nidea, depending on the complexity of the production task. A hand-rendered comp\nmay be useful in helping the client refrain from \"nitpicking\" the production\nquality and focus on the design idea.\n\nIn the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish\nrender and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final\nrendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the\nfinal rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many\nrenderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the\nfinal version is created.\n\nThe illustration element may incorporate stock photography, clip art, or other\nfound material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated,\nbefore entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image\nfor the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the\nhope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a \"positional\" image) will\nend up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes\nmistakenly believed that \"comp\" is short for \"complimentary,\" as it is in some\nother promotional contexts.\n\nThe word \"comp\" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may \"comp\nsomething up\"; that is, they will create a comp. \"Comp\" may also stand for\n\"composition\" or \"composite layout\".\n","linknr":92,"url":"Comprehensive_layout","recorded":1374543416,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Graphic_design","/wiki/Advertising","/wiki/Page_layout","/wiki/Typography","/wiki/Illustration","/wiki/Nitpicking_(pastime)","/wiki/Stock_photography","/wiki/Clip_art","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Animatic","/wiki/Previsualization","/wiki/Communication_design","/wiki/Website_wireframe","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&oldid=559437830","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Advertising_terminology","/wiki/Category:Communication_design","/wiki/Category:Design","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Comprehensive+layout&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Comprehensive+layout","/wiki/Comprehensive_layout","/wiki/Talk:Comprehensive_layout","#","/wiki/Comprehensive_layout","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Comprehensive_layout","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Comprehensive_layout","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&oldid=559437830","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5157009","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Comprehensive_layout&id=559437830","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Comprehensive+layout","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Comprehensive+layout&oldid=559437830&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_layout&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5157009#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_layout","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["pastime"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Advertising
