{"cursor":"4429","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cyclic form' is a technique of musical construction, involving multiple\nsections or movements, in which a theme, melody, or thematic material occurs in\nmore than one movement as a unifying device. Sometimes a theme may occur at the\nbeginning and end (for example, in the Brahms Symphony No. 3); other times a\ntheme occurs in a different guise in every part (Berlioz, [[Symphonie\nFantastique]]).\n\nThe technique has a complex history, having apparently fallen into disuse in the\nBaroque and Classical eras and become common again only after the start of\nRomanticism.\n\nThe Renaissance cyclic mass, which incorporates a usually well-known portion of\nplainsong as a cantus firmus in each of its sections, is an early use of this\nprinciple of unity in a multiple-section form. Examples can also be found in\nseventeenth century instrumental music, for instance in the suites of dances by\nSamuel Scheidt in which a ground bass recurs in each movement. When the\nmovements are short enough and begin to be heard as a single entity rather than\nmany, the boundaries begin to blur between cyclic form and variation form.\n\nIn the Baroque and 'high classical' eras, cyclic technique is typically not\nfound. Mozart, for example, does not recall one movement's theme in any later\nmovenent anywhere in his quartets, quintets, symphonies or concertos. Haydn\nuses the technique on only a few occasions -- such as at the end of the\nSymphony No.31, where the music recalls the horn call heard at the very opening\nof the work.\n\nIt is with Beethoven that cyclic technique re-enters the musical mainstream. In\nthe Fifth Symphony a large part of the scherzo movement is recalled to end the\nfinale's development section and lead into the recapitulation; and the Ninth\nSymphony's finale rapidly presents explicit reminiscences of the three preceding\nmovements before discovering the idea that is to be its own principal theme.\n\nMany composers in the nineteenth century followed Beethoven's lead, most\nfamously including the CÃ©sar Franck Symphony in D Minor, the Symphonie\nFantastique, and numerous works by Franz Liszt. These works include the B minor\nPiano Sonata (Liszt) (1853), which also serves as a double-function form.\nLisztâs sonata begins with a clear statement of several thematic units and each\nunit is extensively used and developed throughout the piece. By late in the\ncentury, cyclic form had become an extremely common principle of construction,\nmost likely because the increasing length and complexity of multiple-movement\nworks demanded a unifying method stronger than mere key relation.\n\nThe term is more debatable in cases where the resemblance is less clear,\nparticularly in the works of Beethoven, who used very basic fragments.\nBeethoven's Symphony No. 5 is an example of cyclic form in which a theme is used\nthroughout the symphony, but with different orchestration. They all have the \"short-short-short-\nlong\" four-note motive embedded into each movement.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Cyclic_form","recorded":1362477307,"links":18,"instances":["music","music","brahms","music","franck","liszt","beethoven","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical form"],"headings":["Examples","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["section","music"],["movement","music"],["theme","music"],["symphony_no._3","brahms"],["classical_period","music"],["symphony_in_d_minor","franck"],["piano_sonata","liszt"],["symphony_no._5","beethoven"]],"members":["classical_period","movement","section","symphony_in_d_minor","piano_sonata","theme"],"related":["Musical_form","Section_(music)","Movement_(music)","Theme_(music)","Melody","Johannes_Brahms","Symphony_No._3_(Brahms)","Berlioz","Baroque","Classical_period_(music)","Romanticism","Renaissance_music","Cyclic_mass","Plainsong","Cantus_firmus","Samuel_Scheidt","Ground_bass","Variation_form","César_Franck","Symphony_in_D_minor_(Franck)","Franz_Liszt","Piano_Sonata_(Liszt)","Double-Function_Form","Ludwig_van_Beethoven","Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)"]}
