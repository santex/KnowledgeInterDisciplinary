Camp\nChesterfield offers Spiritualist Church services, seminary, and mediumship,\nfaith healing, and spiritual development classes, as well as psychic readings\nfor patrons.\n\nIn 2002, the camp was designated a historic district, the \"Chesterfield\nSpiritualist Camp District\", and listed on the National Register of Historic\nPlaces.\n\nIn August 1925, 14 Camp Chesterfield mediums were arrested on charges of\nobtaining money under false pretences. The charges were filed by a news service\nreporter who had spent time investigating the camp. \"Night news summary,\"\nKokomo (IN) Tribune, 24 August 1925, p.15.\n\nIn the 1950s, Don Kemp, later to become one of Indiana's most popular mediums\nand Spiritualism teachers, began visiting Camp Chesterfield in his quest to\nlearn more about the philosophy of Spiritualism and experience the various\nforms of spirit communication. He reported having had several experiences of\nspirit visitation in his younger life and continued his search to understand\nthe phenomenon. Camp Chesterfield had become a hot topic of discussion among\nthe citizens of Indianapolis, both positively supported by those who had\nattended the camp and criticized by doubters. Kemp's great-aunt, Bertha Jessup\nof West Virginia, made seasonal pilgrimages to the camp throughout her adult\nlife and invited Don to the camp to come to his own conclusions. They attended\na seance where Kemp received five materializations: \"I felt the first three\nvisitations weren't authentic but then my brother materialized followed by my\nGrandma. I knew they were authentic.\" Kemp's convincing detail was his\nbrother's reference to Don's actual birth date which had always been in dispute\nwith the date printed on his birth certificate. Roby, Jeff (2011),\nSpiritual Truth & Life Journeys: Biography of Don Kemp, Western Printing, ISBN\n978-0-9847783-0-0, p. 51\n\nIn 1960, psychic investigator Andrija Puharich and Tom O'Neill, publisher of the\nSpiritualist magazine Psychic Observer, arranged to film two seances at Camp\nChesterfield using infrared film, intending to procure scientific proof of\nspirit materializations. The medium was shown the camera beforehand, and was\naware that she was being filmed. However, the film revealed obvious fraud on the\npart of the medium and her cabinet assistant. The expose was published in the 10\nJuly 1960 issue of the Psychic Observer. Allen Spraggett, The\nUnexplained, (New York: New American Library, 1967).\n\nWell-known writer on paranormal topics Allen Spraggett visited the camp in 1965,\nand was negatively impressed with spirit materializations during seances:\n\n:\"They were all barely visible. Most appeared to be swathed in white drapery,\n:and all were the same height as the medium, and sounded exactly like her. They\n:also exhibited abysmal ignorance of who they were supposed to be, when they had\n:died, and other relevant details.\"\n\n:\"This was a fraud so crude that it was an insult to the intelligence.\"\n\nIn 1976, M. Lamar Keene, a former medium in Florida and at Camp Chesterfield,\nconfessed to defrauding the public in his book [[The Psychic Mafia]] \"as told\nto\" Allen Spragett. The book was also provided with a forward by the writer\nWilliam V. Rauscher. In the text Spragett and Keene detailed a multitude of\ncommon techniques utilized by fraudulent mediums since the 19th century to\nconjure spirits. Spragett and Keene wrote that beneath the church is a\nstorehouse of personal data about Camp Chesterfield visitors which is collected\nduring church service when parishioners are asked to provide their full name,\nthe names of loved ones they wish to contact, and questions. A medium is\nblindfolded and claims to read the data through the help of spirit guides. The\npieces of paper are not returned to the parishioners; rather, Spragett and Keene\nwrote, the data is shared freely amongst Camp Chesterfield mediums as well as\nthose networked across the country for use in private hot readings. Keene,\nM. Lamar as told to Allen Spraggett (1997), The Psychic Mafia, Prometheus Books,\nISBN 1-57392-161-0 (Republication of 1976 edition by St. Martin's Press.) YouTube:\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLzwzYziubI Camp Chesterfield exposure - Lamar\nKeene] \n\nA regular contributor to [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]] magazine wrote about a\ngrieving couple who had recently lost their child, and went to Camp Chesterfield\nhoping to contact their child. However, when they were requested to write down\nthe names of those they wished to contact, they wrote down, along with their\nchild, the names of two fictitious relatives. Later in seances those two\nnonexistent relatives materialized and spoke to them. J. Gordon Melton,\nreview of \"The Psychic Mafia, Fate December 1976, v.29, n.12, p.95.\n\nIn March 2002, [[The Skeptical Inquirer]] published a sting operation performed\nby former magician and prominent skeptical paranormal investigator, Joe Nickell.\nNickell exposed further fraud on the part of mediums at Camp\nChesterfield.
