{"cursor":"4012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe band 'Chase' was created in 1970 by Bill Chase, Ted Piercefield, Alan Ware,\nand Jerry Van Blair, all veteran jazz trumpeters who were also adept at vocals\nand arranging. They were backed up by a rhythm section consisting of Phil Porter\non keyboards, Angel South (b. Lucian Gondron) on guitar, Dennis Johnson on bass,\nand Jay Burrid (b. Jay Mitthauer) on percussion. Rounding out the group was\nTerry Richards, who was featured as lead vocalist on the first album. In April\n1971, the band released their debut album, [[Chase (Chase album)|Chase]], which\ncontains Chase's best-known song, \"Get It On\", released as a single that spent\n13 weeks on the charts beginning in May 1971. The song features what Jim Szantor\nof Downbeat magazine called \"the hallmark of the Chase brassâcomplex cascading\nlines; a literal waterfall of trumpet timbre and technique\". The band received a\nBest New Artist Grammy nomination, but was edged out by rising star Carly Simon.\n\nChase released their second album,[[Ennea]], in March 1972; the album's title is\nthe Greek word for nine, a reference to the nine band members. The original\nlineup changed midway through the recording sessions, with Gary Smith taking\nover on drums and G. G. Shinn replacing Terry Richards on lead vocals. Although\nthe first Chase album sold nearly 400,000 copies, Ennea was not as well received\nby the public. One likely reason was a shift away from trumpet sections. As Bill\nChase put it in a Downbeat interview, \"I don't want people to be heavily\nconscious of a trumpet section. They should just hear good things, but not be\nclobbered over the head with brass.\" A single, \"So Many People\", received some\nradio play, but the side-two-filling \"Ennea\" suite, with its tightly chorded\njazz arrangements and lyrics based on Greek mythology, was less radio-friendly.\n\nFollowing an extended hiatus, Chase reemerged early in 1974 with the release of\n[[Pure Music]], their third album. Featuring a new lineup, yet keeping the four-\ntrumpet section headed by Bill Chase, the group moved further from the rock\nidiom, and became more focused on jazz. Variety magazine called Pure Music\n\"probably Chase's most commercial effort, and their brand of jazz could have a\ncommercial impact\". The songs were written by Jim Peterik of the Ides of March,\nwho also sings on two songs on the album, backing up singer and bassist\nDartanyan Brown.\n\nChase's work on a fourth studio album in mid-1974 came to an end on August 9,\n1974. {{cite book\n| first= John last= Tobler year= 1992 title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years edition=\n| 1st publisher= Reed International Books Ltd location= London pages= 267 id= CN\n| 5585}} While en route to a scheduled performance at the Jackson County\n| Fair in Minnesota, Bill Chase died at the age of 39 in the plane crash of a\n| chartered twin-engine Piper Twin Comanche Jackson, Minnesota, \"Plane\n| tragedy near Jackson ends career of Bill Chase\", Jackson County Pilot, 14\n| August 1974, Volume 84, Number 12, page 1. in Jackson, Minnesota.

original lineup, and\nadded Walt Johnson) recorded an album entitled Watch Closely Now.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Chase_(band)","recorded":1374541657,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Bill_Chase","/wiki/Chase_(Chase_album)","/wiki/Grammy","/wiki/Carly_Simon","/wiki/Ennea","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Pure_Music","/wiki/Ides_of_March_(band)","#cite_note-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years-1","/wiki/Plane_crash","/wiki/Piper_Twin_Comanche","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Jackson,_Minnesota","/wiki/Minnesota","#cite_note-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years-1","#cite_note-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years-1","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Chase_(Chase_album)","/wiki/Ennea","/wiki/Pure_Music","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years_1-0","#cite_ref-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years_1-1","#cite_ref-NME_Rock_.27N.27_Roll_Years_1-2","#cite_ref-2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&oldid=478817386","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1969","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_April_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chase+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chase+%28band%29","/wiki/Chase_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chase_(band)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Chase_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chase_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chase_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&oldid=478817386","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chase_%28band%29&id=478817386","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chase+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chase+%28band%29&oldid=478817386&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Chase_(band)&printable=yes","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B9_(%E3%83%90%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89)","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_(band)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical
