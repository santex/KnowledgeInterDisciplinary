{"cursor":"15557","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'cascading failure' is a failure in a system of interconnected parts in which\nthe failure of a part can trigger the failure of successive parts. Such a\nfailure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission,\ncomputer networking, finance and bridges.\n\nCascading failures usually begin when one part of the system fails. When this\nhappens, nearby nodes must then take up the slack for the failed component. This\noverloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes\nto fail in a vicious cycle.\n","linknr":198,"url":"Cascading_failure","recorded":1362485829,"links":18,"instances":["telecommunications","proverb","mechanical_process","computing"],"pdf":["http://empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf","http://empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf","http://www.jaist.ac.jp/library/thesis/ks-master-2005/abstract/tmiyazak/abstract.pdf","http://www.jaist.ac.jp/library/thesis/ks-master-2005/abstract/tmiyazak/abstract.pdf","http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~yclai/papers/PRE_02_ML_3.pdf","http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~dobson/PAPERS/dobsonPEIS05.pdf"],"categories":["Failure","Reliability engineering","Electric power transmission","Systemic risk"],"headings":["Cascading failure in power transmission","Cascading failure in computer networks","Other examples of cascading failure","Infrastructures","Mechanical Structural Failure","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Networkfailure.gif/220px-Networkfailure.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["router","computing"],["hop","telecommunications"],["implosion","mechanical_process"],["for_want_of_a_nail","proverb"]],"members":["hop","for_want_of_a_nail","implosion","router"],"related":["Vicious_cycle","Power_grid","High_voltage","Single_point_of_failure","Real-time_computing","Northeast_Blackout_of_1965","1999_Southern_Brazil_blackout","Northeast_Blackout_of_2003","2003_Italy_blackout","2003_London_blackout","2012_northern_India_power_grid_failure","Computer_network","Internet","Network_traffic_control","Router_(computing)","Routing","Packet_loss","Lag","Congestion_collapse","Hop_(telecommunications)","Domain_name_system","GMail","Biochemical_cascade","Ischemic_cascade","Ischemia","Toxin","Stroke","Cockcroftâ€“Walton_generator","Diode","Implosion_(mechanical_process)","Super-Kamiokande","Finance","Counterparties","Too_big_to_fail","Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse","Zipper","Factor_of_safety","Brittle_system","Butterfly_effect","Byzantine_failure","Cascading_rollback","Chain_reaction","Chaos_theory","Cache_stampede","Congestion_collapse","For_Want_of_a_Nail_(proverb)","Kessler_Syndrome","Progressive_collapse","Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle","Swissair_Flight_111"]}
