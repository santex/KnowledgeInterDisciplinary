{"cursor":"3523","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Carl Georg Brunius' (Tanum 23 March 1793âLund 12 November 1869 Rydbeck, p.\n506 ) was a classical scholar, art historian, archaeologist and architect\nworking in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden.\n\nBrunius was born on 23 March 1792 in Tanum parish (within the current Tanum\nMunicipality), son of the vicar Gomer Brunius and his wife Mariana Rodhe. He\nstudied at Lund University, where he became professor of Greek in 1824, served\nas rector in 1831 and 1841 and retired as professor emeritus in\n1858. Rydbeck, p. 506f\n\nThe focus in classical scholarship in the age in which Brunius worked was on the\npractical mastering of the languages, but beyond a few Latin poems, his\ncontributions within his academic discipline were insignificant and had mostly\nceased by the time he received his professorial chair. Rydbeck p. 508\nInstead, he spent most of his life as a student of art, architecture and\nantiquities and as a working architect. With J. G. Liljegren, Brunius co-\nauthored the first part of Nordiska fornlemningar (\"Scandinavian antiquities\"),\npublished in 1819 and a work on petroglyphs. Brunius later produced the first\nsystematic investigation of mediaeval art and architecture in current Sweden,\nwriting substantial works on the history of art in Scania, on the island of\nGotland and elsewhere. Rydbeck p. 512\n\nIn his architectural work, Brunius wanted to revive the mediaeval styles, the\nRomanesque as well as the more fashionable Gothic, while he detested the more\nrecent Baroque and Rococo styles. His career as an architect began with his work\non Lund Cathedral in collaboration with the Stockholm architect Axel NystrÃ¶m.\nThe Cathedral had for some time been in severe need for restoration, and NystrÃ¶m\nwas given the job in 1832. Rydbeck p. 509-510\n\nBrunius had been a keen draughtsman already as a child and, when on one occasion\nhe was threatened by his parents with being apprenticed to a mason rather than\nbe allowed to continue in school, he had rather relished the\nthought. Rydbeck p. 507 He had been elected a member of the Lund\nCathedral assembly (domkyrkorÃ¥d) in 1831 and was later elected chairman. As\nsuch, he was entrusted with the task of supervising the work on the Cathedral,\nwhich took more than 25 years to complete. On his own, Brunius designed or\nrestored a number of other buildings in Lund, including the Bishop's House and a\nhouse for himself, as well as a large number of parish churches and other\nbuildings in the surrounding province of Scania. Rydbeck p. 509-510\n","linknr":105,"url":"Carl_Georg_Brunius","recorded":1375086941,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:C_G_Brunius_2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/C_G_Brunius_2.jpg/220px-C_G_Brunius_2.jpg","/wiki/File:C_G_Brunius_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Kiliansgatan_17_i_Lund_1935.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Kiliansgatan_17_i_Lund_1935.jpg/220px-Kiliansgatan_17_i_Lund_1935.jpg","/wiki/File:Kiliansgatan_17_i_Lund_1935.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Lund","/wiki/Tanum_Municipality","/wiki/Lund_University","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Petroglyph","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Lund_Cathedral","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&oldid=546171846","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Swedish_art_historians","/wiki/Category:Swedish_archaeologists","/wiki/Category:Swedish_architects","/wiki/Category:Classical_philologists","/wiki/Category:1793_births","/wiki/Category:1869_deaths","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Carl+Georg+Brunius&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Carl+Georg+Brunius","/wiki/Carl_Georg_Brunius","/wiki/Talk:Carl_Georg_Brunius","#","/wiki/Carl_Georg_Brunius","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Carl_Georg_Brunius","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Carl_Georg_Brunius","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&oldid=546171846","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4992644","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Carl_Georg_Brunius&id=546171846","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Carl+Georg+Brunius","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Carl+Georg+Brunius&oldid=546171846&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Carl_Georg_Brunius&printable=yes","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Georg_Brunius","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Georg_Brunius","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4992644#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Georg_Brunius","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Swedish
