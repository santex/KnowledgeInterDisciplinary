{"cursor":"9945","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'CD single' (sometimes abbreviated to 'CDS') is a music single in the form of\na standard size Compact Disc, not to be confused with the Mini CD single, which\nuses a smaller form factor. The format was introduced in the mid-1980s, but did\nnot gain its place in the market until the early 1990s. With the rise in digital\ndownloads in the 2000s, sales of CD singles have decreased.\n\nCommercially released CD singles can vary in length from two songs (an A side\nand B side, in the tradition of 7\" 45rpm records) up to six songs like an EP.\nSome contain multiple mixes of one or more songs, in the tradition of 12\" vinyl\nsingles. Depending on the nation, there may be limits on the number of songs and\ntotal length for sales to count in singles charts.\n","linknr":186,"url":"CD_single","recorded":1362569092,"links":22,"instances":["who_loves_me","music","music_store","song","song","if_you_feel_love","delta_goodrem_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Compact Disc","Single types"],"headings":["History","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["single","music"],["brothers_in_arms","song"],["i_wanna_dance_with_somebody","who_loves_me"],["put_your_hands_up","if_you_feel_love"],["sitting_on_top_of_the_world","delta_goodrem_song"],["on_a_mission","song"],["sanity","music_store"],["single","music"],["single","music"]],"members":["i_wanna_dance_with_somebody","single","sanity","brothers_in_arms","on_a_mission","put_your_hands_up","sitting_on_top_of_the_world"],"related":["Single_(music)","Compact_Disc","Mini_CD_single","Extended_play","12-inch_single","Dire_Straits","Brothers_in_Arms_(song)","UK_Singles_Chart","I_Wanna_Dance_with_Somebody_(Who_Loves_Me)","Whitney_Houston","Mini_CD_single","Billboard_Hot_100","JB_Hi-Fi","Jessica_Mauboy","Kylie_Minogue","Delta_Goodrem","What_Happened_to_Us","Put_Your_Hands_Up_(If_You_Feel_Love)","Sitting_on_Top_of_the_World_(Delta_Goodrem_song)","ARIA_Charts","Australian_Recording_Industry_Association","On_a_Mission_(song)","Gabriella_Cilmi","Kmart","Target_Australia","Big_W","Sanity_(music_store)","Extended_play","IFPI_Greece","Single_(music)","Woolworths_Group","Florence_+_The_Machine","Mercury_Records","HMV","Single_(music)","Promotional_recording","A-side_and_B-side","Extended_play","Maxi_single","Music_download"]}
