{"cursor":"38670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'central bank', 'reserve bank', or 'monetary authority' is a public\ninstitution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates.\nCentral banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their\nrespective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank\npossesses a monopoly on increasing the nation's monetary base, and usually also\nprints the national currency, which usually serves as the nation's legal\ntender. {{cite book\n  | last = Sullivan first = arthur authorlink = Arthur O' Sullivan coauthors =\n  | Steven M.

Central\nbanks usually also have supervisory powers, intended to prevent bank runs and to\nreduce the risk that commercial banks and other financial institutions engage in\nreckless or fraudulent behavior. Central banks in most developed nations are\ninstitutionally designed to be independent from political interference.\n\nThe chief executive of a central bank is normally known as the Governor,\nPresident or Chairman especially the US Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.\n","linknr":788,"url":"Central_bank","recorded":1362668575,"links":86,"instances":["business","finance","finance","banker","finance","economics","polity"],"pdf":["http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap09a.pdf"],"categories":["Central
