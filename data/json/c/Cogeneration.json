This can be released into the natural environment through cooling\ntowers, flue gas, or by other means. By contrast, CHP captures some or all of\nthe by-product heat for heating purposes, either very close to the plant,\nor—especially in Scandinavia and eastern Europe—as hot water for\ndistrict heating with temperatures ranging from approximately 80 to 130 Â°C.\nThis is also called Combined Heat and Power District Heating or CHPDH. Small CHP\nplants are an example of decentralized energy.\n\nCogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical\ngeneration. Before central stations distributed power, industries generating\ntheir own power used exhaust steam for process heating. Large office and\napartment buildings, hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and\nused waste steam for building heat. Because of the economies and high cost of\nearly purchased power, these combined heat and power operations continued for\nmany years after utility electricity became available. {{cite book |title=A\nHistory of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730-1930, Vol. 3: The\nTransmission of Power |last=Hunter |first= Louis C. |authorlink= |coauthors=\nBryant, Lynwood |year=1991 |publisher =MIT Press |location= Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, London |isbn=0-262-08198-9 |page=}} Cogeneration is still\ncommon in pulp and paper mills, refineries and chemical plants.\n\nIn the United States, Con Edison distributes 66 billion kilograms of\n350 Â°F/180 Â°C steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to\n100,000 buildings in Manhattan—the biggest steam district in the United\nStates. The peak delivery is 10 million pounds per hour (corresponding to\napprox. 2.5 GW).\n\nOther major cogeneration companies in the United States include Recycled Energy\nDevelopment {{cite web |url=http://www.recycled-energy.com |title=Recycled\nEnergy Development website}} and leading advocates include Tom Casten and\nAmory Lovins.\n\nBy-product heat at moderate temperatures (212-356Â°F/100-180Â°C) can also be used\nin absorption chillers for cooling. A plant producing electricity, heat and cold\nis sometimes called '[[trigeneration]]' or more generally\n'polygeneration' plant. Cogeneration is a thermodynamically efficient use of\nfuel. In separate production of electricity, some energy must be rejected as\nwaste heat, but in cogeneration this thermal energy is put to good use.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Cogeneration","recorded":1362508730,"links":72,"instances":["heat_transfer","thermodynamics"],"pdf":["http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/distributedenergy/pdfs/chp_report_12-08.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/distributedenergy/pdfs/chp_report_12-08.pdf","http://www.elforsk.se/nyhet/seminarie/Elforskdagen%20_10/webb_varme/d_welander.pdf","http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf","http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf","http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf","http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf","http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf","http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf","http://finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/052407testsc1.pdf","http://finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/052407testsc1.pdf","http://www.localpower.org/documents/report_worldsurvey06.pdf","http://www.localpower.org/documents/report_worldsurvey06.pdf","http://www.opet-chp.net/download/wp3/iisalmifinland.pdf","http://www.labothap.ulg.ac.be/cmsms/Staff/QuoilinS/TFE_SQ010607.pdf"],"categories":["Cogeneration|"],"headings":["Overview","Types
