{"cursor":"4057","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Co-transport', also known as coupled transport or secondary active transport,\nrefers to the simultaneous or sequential passive transfer of molecules or ions\nacross biological membranes in a fixed ratio. Permitting one ion or molecule to\nmove from the side where it is more concentrated to that where it is less\nconcentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for\nmetabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase). In cotransporters, it is used to force the\ntransport of another ion or molecule (usually) from the side where it is less\nconcentrated to that where it is more concentrated. Cotransporters can be\nclassified as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances\nmove in the same or opposite directions .\n","linknr":133,"url":"Co-transport","recorded":1362505007,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transport phenomena"],"headings":["Discovery of cotransport","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Secondary_active_transport","Molecule","Ion","Biological_membrane","Entropy","Energy","Metabolism","ATP_synthase","Symporter","Antiporter","Robert_K._Crane","Robert_K._Crane","Robert_K._Crane","Robert_K._Crane","Cotransporter","Symporter","Sodium/phosphate_cotransporter","Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins","Glucose_transporter"]}
