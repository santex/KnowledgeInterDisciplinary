{"cursor":"2254","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, a 'closed manifold' is a type of topological space, namely a\ncompact manifold without boundary. In contexts where no boundary is possible,\nany compact manifold is a closed manifold.\n\nThe simplest example is a circle, which is a compact one-dimensional manifold.\nOther examples of closed manifolds are the torus and the Klein bottle. As a\ncounterexample, the real line is not a closed manifold because it is not\ncompact. A disk is a compact two-dimensional manifold, but is not a closed\nmanifold because it has a boundary.\n\nCompact manifolds are, in an intuitive sense, \"finite\". By the basic properties\nof compactness, a closed manifold is the disjoint union of a finite number of\nconnected closed manifolds. One of the most basic objectives of geometric\ntopology is to understand what the supply of possible closed manifolds is.\n\nAll compact topological manifolds can be embedded into \\mathbf{R}^n\nfor some n, by the Whitney embedding theorem.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Closed_manifold","recorded":1362552419,"links":21,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geometric topology","Manifolds|*"],"headings":["Contrasting terms","Use in physics"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/2/2828ad72d9bf1da250c584d5f7a0a82d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/KleinBottle-01.png/30px-KleinBottle-01.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["disk","mathematics"]],"members":["disk"],"related":["Mathematics","Topological_space","Compact_space","Manifold","Circle","Torus","Klein_bottle","Real_line","Disk_(mathematics)","Disjoint_union","Geometric_topology","Whitney_embedding_theorem","Disjoint_union","Closed_set","Shape_of_the_Universe","Ricci_curvature"]}
