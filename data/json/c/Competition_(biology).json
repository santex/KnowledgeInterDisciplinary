Limited supply of at least\none resource (such as food, water, and territory) used by both is\nrequired. Begon, M.; Harper, J. L.; Townsend, C. R. (1996) [[Ecology:\nIndividuals, populations and communities]] Blackwell Science. Competition\nboth within and between species is an important topic in ecology, especially\ncommunity ecology. Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic\nfactors that affect community structure. Competition among members of the same\nspecies is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between\nindividuals of different species is known as interspecific competition.\nCompetition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and\nindirect fashion.\n\nAccording to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete\nfor resources should either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is\nrarely found in natural ecosystems. According to evolutionary theory, this\ncompetition within and between species for resources plays a very relevant role\nin natural selection, however, competition may play less of a role than\nexpansion among larger groups such as families.\n","linknr":500,"url":"Competition_(biology)","recorded":1362509298,"links":45,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","animal","ecology","biological","mammalian_reproduction"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Competition","Biological interactions"],"headings":["Types of competition","Evolutionary strategies","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Clone_war_of_sea_anemones_2-17-08-2.jpg/220px-Clone_war_of_sea_anemones_2-17-08-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Hirschkampf.jpg/220px-Hirschkampf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/3/3234a77b42c176b977451d7657e1ed73.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["territory","animal"],["fitness","biology"],["resource","biological"],["territory","animal"],["community","ecology"],["mechanism","biology"],["rut","mammalian_reproduction"],["trait","biological"],["resource","biology"]],"members":["mechanism","resource","fitness","territory","community","trait","rut"],"related":["Territory_(animal)","Tide_pools","Biological_interaction","Organism","Species","Fitness_(biology)","Limiting_factor","Resource_(biological)","Food","Water","Territory_(animal)","Species","Ecology","Community_ecology","Biotic_component","Abiotic_component","Community_(ecology)","Intraspecific_competition","Interspecific_competition","Competitive_exclusion_principle","Adaptation","Extinction","Evolutionary_theory","Natural_selection","Mechanism_(biology)","Rut_(mammalian_reproduction)","Aggression","Limiting_resource","Natural_resource","Tree","Light","Water","Nutrient","Soil","Root","Fecundity","Population","Cheetah","Lion","Intraguild_predation","Oecologia","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Natural_selection","Trait_(biological)","Island_biogeography","Robert_MacArthur","E._O._Wilson","Robert_MacArthur","E._O._Wilson","Princeton_University_Press","R/K_selection_theory","Eric_Pianka","Algebra","Population_dynamics","Pierre_François_Verhulst","Population_growth_rate","Population","Carrying_capacity","Ecological_niche","Offspring","Probability","Parental_investment","Biological_interaction","Character_displacement","Minimum_viable_population","Resource_(biology)","Resource_partitioning"]}
