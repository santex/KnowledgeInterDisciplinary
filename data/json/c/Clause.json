{"cursor":"25977","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn grammar, a 'clause' is the smallest grammatical unit that can express a\ncomplete proposition. For this basic definition in terms of a proposition,\nsee Kroeger (2005:32). A typical clause consists of a subject and a\npredicate, For a definition of the clause that emphasizes the subject-\npredicate relationship, see Radford (2004327f.). where the predicate is\ntypically a verb phrase â a verb together with any objects and other modifiers.\nHowever the subject is sometimes not expressed; this is often the case in null-\nsubject languages, if the subject is retrievable from context, but it also\noccurs in certain cases in other languages such as English (as in imperative\nsentences and non-finite clauses).\n\nA simple sentence usually consists of a single finite clause with a finite\nverb that is independent. More complex sentences may contain multiple\nclauses. Main clauses (= matrix clauses, [[independent clauses]]) are those\nthat could stand as a sentence by themselves. Subordinate clauses (= embedded\nclauses, [[dependent clauses]]) are those that would be awkward or\nnonsensical if used alone.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Clause","recorded":1362565566,"links":39,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntactic entities"],"headings":["Two major distinctions","Clauses according to a distinctive syntactic trait","Clauses according to semantic predicate-argument function","Representing clauses","Clauses vs. phrases","Non-finite clauses","Notes","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Clause_trees_1%27.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Clause_trees_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Clause_trees_3%27.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subject","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["sentence","linguistics"],["argument","linguistics"],["adjunct","linguistics"],["copula","linguistics"],["government","linguistics"],["selection","linguistics"],["control","linguistics"],["pro","linguistics"],["sentence","linguistics"]],"members":["pro","government","sentence","object","subject","adjunct","copula","argument","predicate","selection","control"],"related":["Grammar","Proposition","Subject_(grammar)","Predicate_(grammar)","Verb_phrase","Verb","Object_(grammar)","Null-subject_language","English_grammar","Imperative_mood","Non-finite_clause","Sentence_(linguistics)","Finite_verb","Dependent_clause","Independent_clause","Finite_verb","Non-finite_verb","Subject-auxiliary_inversion","Subject-auxiliary_inversion","Relative_clause","Wh-word","Relative_pronoun","Argument_(linguistics)","Adjunct_(linguistics)","Predicative_expression","Subordinate_conjunction","Predicative_expression","Copula_(linguistics)","Dependency_grammar","Government_(linguistics)","Selection_(linguistics)","V2_word_order","Phrase_structure_grammar","X-bar_theory","Non-finite_verb","Finite_verb","Gerund","Small_clause","Control_(linguistics)","PRO_(linguistics)","Government_and_Binding_Theory","Minimalist_Program","Head-Driven_Phrase_Structure_Grammar","Construction_Grammar","Dependency_grammar","Small_clause","Constituent","Adverbial_clause","Dependent_clause","Relative_clause","Sentence_(linguistics)","T-unit","Thematic_equative","Balancing_and_deranking"]}
