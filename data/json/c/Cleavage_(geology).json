Generally these structures are formed in fine grained rocks composed\n  of minerals affected by pressure solution.\n\nCleavage is a type of rock foliation, a fabric element that describes the way\nplanar features develop in a rock. Foliation is separated into two groups:\nprimary and secondary. Primary deals with igneous and sedimentary rocks while\nsecondary deals with rocks that undergo metamorphism as a result of deformation.\nCleavage is a type of secondary foliation associated with fine grained rocks.\nFor coarser grained rocks, schistosity is used to describe secondary foliation.\n\nThere is a variety of definitions for cleavage which may cause confusion and\ndebate. The terminology used in this article is based largely on Passchier and\nTrouw (2005). They state that cleavage is a type of secondary foliation in fine\ngrained rocks characterized by planar fabric elements that form in a preferred\norientation. Some authors chose to use cleavage when describing any form of\nsecondary foliation.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Cleavage_(geology)","recorded":1362540630,"links":24,"instances":["geology","geotechnical_engineering","geology","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.bgs.ac.uk/SCMR/docs/papers/paper_3.pdf"],"categories":["Structural geology","Petrology","Geology terminology"],"headings":["Types of cleavage","Formation","Relationship to Folds","Engineering considerations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Cleavage_modes_EN.svg/300px-Cleavage_modes_EN.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Continuous_spaced_cleavage.jpg/220px-Continuous_spaced_cleavage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Slaty_cleavage.jpg/220px-Slaty_cleavage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Spaced_cleavage.jpg/220px-Spaced_cleavage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Anticline_with_axial_planar_cleavage.JPG/260px-Anticline_with_axial_planar_cleavage.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["foliation","geology"],["foliation","geology"],["fabric","geology"],["discontinuity","geotechnical_engineering"],["foundation","engineering"]],"members":["foliation","discontinuity","fabric","foundation"],"related":["Pencil_cleavage","Diagenesis","Foliation_(geology)","Bedding","Structural_geology","Petrology","Metamorphism","Pressure_solution","Foliation_(geology)","Fabric_(geology)","Schist","Diagenesis","Dynamic_recrystallization","Finite_strain","Plastic_crystal","Dynamic_recrystallization","Thermodynamic_free_energy","Hornfels","Geotechnical_engineering","Discontinuity_(Geotechnical_engineering)","Tunnel","Foundation_(engineering)","Slope_stability_analysis","Dynamic_quartz_recrystallization"]}
