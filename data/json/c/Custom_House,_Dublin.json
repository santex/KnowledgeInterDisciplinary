In 1781 he\nappointed James Gandon as architect, after Thomas Cooley, the original architect\non the project, had died. This was Gandon's first large scale commission. The\nnew Custom House was unpopular with the Dublin Corporation and some city\nmerchants who complained that it moved the axis of the city, would leave little\nroom for shipping, and it was being built on what at the time was a swamp.\nPurchase of land was delayed and proved exorbitant and the laying of foundations\nwas disrupted by the High Sheriff and members of the Dublin Corporation with a\nmob of several thousand. However, Beresford was determined to complete the\nproject and ignored the protests. Sarah Atkinson, Essays, 1896. p.402\n\n\n\n\nFor his assistants Gandon chose Irish artists such as Meath stone-cutter Henry\nDarley, mason John Semple and carpenter Hugh Henry. Every available mason in\nDublin was engaged in the work. When it was completed and opened for business on\n7 November 1791, it cost Â£200,000 to build – a huge sum at the time. The\nfour facades of the building are decorated with coats-of-arms and ornamental\nsculptures (by Edward Smyth) representing Ireland's rivers. Another artist,\nHenry Banks, was responsible for the statue on the dome and other statues.\n\n\nAs the port of Dublin moved further downriver, the building's original use for\ncollecting custom duties became obsolete, and it was used as the headquarters\nof local government in Ireland. During the Irish War of Independence in 1921,\nthe Irish Republican Army burnt down the Custom House, in an attempt to\ndisrupt British rule in Ireland. Gandon's original interior was completely\ndestroyed in the fire and the central dome collapsed. A large quantity of\nirreplaceable historical records were also destroyed in the fire. Despite\nachieving its objectives, the attack on the Custom House was a setback for the\nIRA as a large number of Volunteers were captured either during the attack or\nwhen falling back. Michael Collins: A Life by James A. Mackay (ISBN 1-85158-857-\n4), page 199\n\nAfter the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it was restored by the Irish Free State\ngovernment. The results of this reconstruction can still be seen on the\nbuilding's exterior today – the dome was rebuilt using Irish Ardbraccan\nlimestone which is noticeably darker than the Portland stone used in the\noriginal construction. This was done as an attempt to promote Irish resources.\n\nFurther restoration and cleaning of the stonework was done by an Office of\nPublic Works team in the 1980s.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Custom_House,_Dublin","recorded":1374546809,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/The_Custom_House","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Custom_House,_Dublin&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Custom_House_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:CustomHouseDublin.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/CustomHouseDublin.JPG/250px-CustomHouseDublin.JPG","/wiki/File:CustomHouseDublin.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Irish_language","/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government","/wiki/River_Liffey","/wiki/Custom_House_Quay","/wiki/Butt_Bridge","/wiki/Talbot_Memorial_Bridge","#cite_note-craig-1","/wiki/John_Beresford_(statesman)","/wiki/James_Gandon","/wiki/Dublin_Corporation","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Dublin-Custom-House-Panorama-2012.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Dublin-Custom-House-Panorama-2012.JPG/750px-Dublin-Custom-House-Panorama-2012.JPG","/wiki/File:Dublin-Custom-House-Panorama-2012.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Liberty_Hall","/wiki/International_Financial_Services_Centre","/wiki/Heraldry","/wiki/Edward_Smyth_(sculptor)","#cite_note-craig-1","/wiki/File:Dublin_Customs_House_at_night.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Dublin_Customs_House_at_night.jpg/250px-Dublin_Customs_House_at_night.jpg","/wiki/File:Dublin_Customs_House_at_night.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Burning_of_the_Custom_House","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Ardbraccan#Ardbraccan_stone","/wiki/Portland_stone","/wiki/Office_of_Public_Works","/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-craig_1-0","#cite_ref-craig_1-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/James_A._Mackay","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1851588574","/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=edit&section=2","http://www.environ.ie/en/AboutUs/HistoryofDepartment/TheCustomHouse/","http://archiseek.com/2010/1791-custom-house-customhouse-quay-dublin/","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=The_Custom_House&params=53.348544_N_-6.253147_E_type:landmark_region:IE","/wiki/Template:Irish_governmental_buildings","/wiki/Template_talk:Irish_governmental_buildings","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Irish_governmental_buildings&action=edit","/wiki/%C3%81ras_an_Uachtar%C3%A1in","/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Ireland","/wiki/Chapel_Royal_(Dublin_Castle)","/wiki/Chichester_House","/wiki/Chief_Secretary%27s_Lodge","/wiki/Collins_Barracks_(Dublin)","/wiki/Dublin_Castle","/wiki/Farmleigh","/wiki/Four_Courts","/wiki/General_Post_Office_(Dublin)","/wiki/Government_Buildings","/wiki/Green_Street_Court_House","/wiki/Irish_Houses_of_Parliament","/wiki/Leinster_House","/wiki/Little_Ratra","/wiki/Steward%27s_Lodge","/wiki/Under_Secretary%27s_Lodge","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dublin_Custom_House","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&oldid=554652886","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Dublin_(city)","/wiki/Category:Visitor_attractions_in_Dublin_(city)","/wiki/Category:Custom_houses","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_November_2011","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Irish-language_text","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Custom+House&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Custom+House","/wiki/The_Custom_House","/wiki/Talk:The_Custom_House","#","/wiki/The_Custom_House","/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Custom_House&action=his
