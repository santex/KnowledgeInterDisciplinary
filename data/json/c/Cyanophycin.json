{"cursor":"3165","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Cyanophycin', or multi-L-arginyl-poly (L-aspartic acid), is a non-protein, non-\nribosomally produced amino acid polymer composed of an aspartic acid backbone\nand arginine side groups.\n\nCyanophycin was first detected in 1887 by an Italian scientist (Borzi, 1887) and\ncan be found in most cyanobacteria and a few heterotrophic bacteria such as\n[[Acinetobacter]] sp. Cyanophycin is largely insoluble under\nphysiological conditions and is accumulated in the form of granules in the\ncytoplasm during phosphate or sulfur starvation, generally in the early and mid-\nstationary phase. It is used as a nitrogen- and possibly carbon-storage compound\nand also serves as a dynamic buffer for fixed nitrogen in cyanobacterial\nheterocysts. Nitrogen and carbon are mobilized from cyanophycin by intracellular\ncyanophycinase in the form of aspartate-arginine dipeptides.\n\nCyanophycin is synthesized from arginine and aspartate in an ATP-dependent\nreaction catalyzed by a single enzyme, cyanophycin synthetase.\nCyanophycin is of potential interest to biotechnology as a source of\npolyaspartic acid. Due to its unusual polyamphoteric character, cyanophycin is\nsoluble in water under acidic (0.1 M HCl) and alkali conditions. Heterologous\nexpression of cyanophycin synthetase allows production of cyanophycin in a\nnumber of biotechnologically relevant bacteria such as [[Escherichia coli]] and\n[[Corynebacterium glutamicum]].\n","linknr":132,"url":"Cyanophycin","recorded":1362505761,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptides"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Cyanophycin.svg/200px-Cyanophycin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Amino_acid","Polymer","Aspartic_acid","Arginine","Side_group","Cyanobacteria","Heterotrophic","Cytoplasm","Heterocysts","Cyanophycinase","Dipeptide","Adenosine_triphosphate","Catalysis","Enzyme","Cyanophycin_synthetase","Biotechnology","Polyaspartic_acid","Polyamphoteric"]}
