This refers to the [[in vitro]]\nassessment of material to determine whether it releases toxic chemicals in\nsufficient quantities to kill cells either directly or indirectly through the\ninhibition of cell metabolic pathways. Cell culture evaluations are the\nprecursor to whole animal studies and are a way to determine if significant\ncytotoxicity exists for the given material. Cell culture assays are standardized\nby ASTM, ISO, and BSI (British Standards Institution.)\n","linknr":116,"url":"Cell_culture_assays","recorded":1362481323,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Cell biology","Cell culture|*"],"headings":["Methods"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biomaterials_Testing","Cytotoxicity","ASTM","International_Organization_for_Standardization","British_Standards_Institution","Fibroblasts","Agar","Fibroblasts","Vital_stain","Vital_stain","Microscopy","Fibroblasts","Physiological_saline","Vital_stain","Agar","Agar"]}
