Note airbags.]] The 'CST-100' (Crew Space Transportation)\ncrew capsule is a spacecraft design proposed by Boeing in collaboration with\nBigelow Aerospace as their entry for NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev)\nprogram. Its primary mission would be to transport crew to the International\nSpace Station,  and to private space stations such as the proposed\nBigelow Aerospace Commercial Space Station. [http://bigelowaerospace.com/orbital-complex-\nconstruction.php Bigelow Aerospace â Next-Generation Commercial Space Stations:\nOrbital Complex Construction], Bigelow Aerospace, accessed 2010-07-15.\n\nOutwardly it would look much like the Orion, a spacecraft being built for NASA\nby Lockheed Martin. The exact dimensions have not\nbeen released, but the capsule would be larger than the Apollo command module\nand smaller than the Orion capsule.  The CST-100\nwould be able to support larger crews of up to 7 people as\nthe result of greater habitable interior volume and the reduced weight of\nequipment needed to support an exclusively low-Earth-orbit configuration. It is\ndesigned to be able to remain on-orbit for up to seven months and for\nreusability for up to ten missions.

In the second phase Boeing\nwas awarded $93 million for further development. On\nAugust 3, 2012, NASA announced the award of $460 million to Boeing to continue\nwork on the CST-100 under the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCAP)\nProgram.

The initial\nlaunch vehicle would be the Atlas V. \n","linknr":313,"url":"CST-100","recorded":1362267912,"links":39,"instances":["launch_abort_system","spacecraft","spacecraft"],"pdf":["http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Lindenmoyer_C3PO.pdf","http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Lindenmoyer_C3PO.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/444144main_NNJ10TA03S_boeing_saa.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/444144main_NNJ10TA03S_boeing_saa.pdf","https://www.aiaa.org/uploadedFiles/About-AIAA/Press_Room/Key_Speeches-Reports-and-Presentations/Keith_Reiley.pdf","http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Keith_Reiley.pdf"],"categories":["Bigelow Aerospace","Boeing","Proposed spacecraft","Manned spacecraft","Human spaceflight","Supply vehicles for the International Space Station","Private spaceflight"],"headings":["History","Design heritage","Testing","Manufacturing in OPF-3","Technology partners","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Boeing_crew_capsule_CCDEV.jpg/250px-Boeing_crew_capsule_CCDEV.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/CST-100_at_Delamar%2C_2012.jpg/220px-CST-100_at_Delamar%2C_2012.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/CST-100_pressure_vessel.jpg/220px-CST-100_pressure_vessel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/RS-88_test_firing.jpg/220px-RS-88_test_firing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["las","launch_abort_system"],["dream_chaser","spacecraft"],["orion","spacecraft"]],"members":["las","orion","dream_chaser"],"related":["Boeing","Bigelow_Aerospace","Evolved_Expendable_Launch_Vehicle","Atlas_V","Airbags","Space_capsule","Boeing","Bigelow_Aerospace","NASA","Commercial_Crew_Development","International_Space_Station","Bigelow_Commercial_Space_Station","Orion_Multi-Purpose_Crew_Vehicle","Lockheed_Martin","Commercial_Crew_Development","CCiCAP","Atlas_V","Delta_IV","Falcon_9","Robert_Bigelow","Kármán_line","CCDev","Space_Act_Agreement","LAS_(Launch_Abort_System)","CCiCAP","Apollo_program","Space_Shuttle","International_Space_Station","Orbital_Express","Orion_Lite","Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System","RS-88","Test_article","Parachute","Mojave_Desert","California","Space_Florida","Orbiter_Processing_Facility-3","Bigelow_Aerospace","Aerojet","Alliant_Techsystems","Bigelow_Commercial_Space_Station","SpaceX_Dragon","NewSpace","SpaceX","Dream_Chaser_(spacecraft)","NewSpace","Sierra_Nevada_Corporation","Orion_(spacecraft)","NASA","Lockheed_Martin","Orion_Lite","NewSpace","Bigelow_Aerospace","Lockheed_Martin","Crew_Exploration_Vehicle","Low_Earth_Orbit","Private_spaceflight"]}
