{"cursor":"33874","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Computational chemistry' is a branch of chemistry that uses principles of\ncomputer science to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses the results of\ntheoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to\ncalculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. Its necessity\narises from the well-known fact that apart from relatively recent results\nconcerning the hydrogen molecular ion (see references therein for more details),\nthe quantum n-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed\nform. While its results normally complement the information obtained by chemical\nexperiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical\nphenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.\n\nExamples of such properties are structure (i.e. the expected positions of the\nconstituent atoms), absolute and relative (interaction) energies, electronic\ncharge distributions, dipoles and higher multipole moments, vibrational\nfrequencies, reactivity or other spectroscopic quantities, and cross sections\nfor collision with other particles.\n\nThe methods employed cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases the\ncomputer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase\nrapidly with the size of the system being studied. That system can be a single\nmolecule, a group of molecules, or a solid. Computational chemistry methods\nrange from highly accurate to very approximate; highly accurate methods are\ntypically feasible only for small systems. ''Ab initio'' methods are based\nentirely on theory from first principles. Other (typically less accurate)\nmethods are called empirical or semi-empirical because they employ experimental\nresults, often from acceptable models of atoms or related molecules, to\napproximate some elements of the underlying theory.\n\nBoth ab initio and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations. These range\nfrom simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or\nfaster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example,\nperiodic boundary conditions), to fundamental approximations to the underlying\nequations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all. For example,\nmost ab initio calculations make the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which\ngreatly simplifies the underlying SchrÃ¶dinger equation by assuming that the\nnuclei remain in place during the calculation. In principle, ''ab initio''\nmethods eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as\nthe number of approximations is reduced. In practice, however, it is impossible\nto eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains. The goal\nof computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the\ncalculations tractable.\n\nIn some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the\nlong-time phase space behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational\nstudies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical\napproximations to the potential energy surface are employed, as they are\ncomputationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer\nsimulations of molecular dynamics. Furthermore, cheminformatics uses even more\nempirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like machine learning based on\nphysicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict\nthe binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.\n","linknr":451,"url":"Computational_chemistry","recorded":1362509741,"links":47,"instances":["physics","quantum_mechanics","chemistry","chemistry","physics","physics","chemistry","mathematics","software","physics_and_chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf","http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf","http://www.chemicalvision2020.org/pdfs/compchem.pdf","http://www.wtec.org/molmodel/mm_final.pdf"],"categories":["Computational
