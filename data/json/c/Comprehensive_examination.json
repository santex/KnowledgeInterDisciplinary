At some institutions it is\nknown as a preliminary examination and abbreviated as \"prelims\", general\nexaminations and abbreviated as \"generals\", or as a major field examination.\n\nThe form and general requirements for the comprehensive exam varies according to\nthe faculty or department, degree sought, university, and country, but typically\ntests knowledge of the student's subject area and two or more related areas, and\nmay be used to determine a candidate's eligibility to continue his or her course\nof study. Typically, comprehensive exams consist of three written exams and an\noral examination, however some programs require only written or oral\nexaminations.\n\nIn some university departments, graduate students seeking a PhD must take a\nseries of written cumulative examinations on the subject of their study in the\nfirst year or two of the PhD program. These cumulative exams are often given on\na pass/fail basis and a graduate student who seeks to continue in the PhD\nprogram must pass a minimum number of these cumulative exams. After this minimum\nnumber of cumulative exams is passed, this degree requirement is considered to\nbe met, and the PhD student no longer takes these exams but continues work on\nother PhD requirements.\n\nComprehensive examinations are typically based on a reading list agreed upon by\nthe student and his or her committee, which is staffed by the primary supervisor\nand several advisors, normally professors at the university, but not necessarily\nin the same faculty. This reading list may comprise dozens or hundreds of books\nand other works.\n\nThere is no standard definition for what such exams entail, with some\nuniversities having almost no exam, whilst at other universities the process is\nquite rigorous. The exams thus take a number of forms, including an informal\nmeeting of just a few hours, a critical review of one's academic portfolio, the\nsubmission of an academic paper which may take several hours or months to write,\nor a series of proctored exams taking anywhere from a few to as many as thirty-\nsix hours.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Comprehensive_examination","recorded":1362565636,"links":16,"instances":["west_virginia","division"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Academia","Examinations"],"headings":["Canada","United States","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["faculty","division"],["bethany_college","west_virginia"]],"members":["bethany_college","faculty"],"related":["Examination","Prelims","Faculty_(division)","Academic_degree","University","Country","Doctor_of_Philosophy","Kenyon_College","Bethany_College_(West_Virginia)","The_Catholic_University_of_America","Maryville_College","Occidental_College","Criswell_College","Reed_College","The_University_of_the_South","Eckerd_College","Millsaps_College","Hanover_College","Wabash_College","Rosemont_College","The_University_of_Virginia","University_of_Alabama_at_Birmingham","Final_examination","Educational_assessment","Oral_exam"]}
