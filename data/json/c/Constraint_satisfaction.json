{"cursor":"13053","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In artificial intelligence and operations research, 'constraint satisfaction' is\nthe process of finding a solution to a set of constraints that impose conditions\nthat the variables must satisfy. A solution is therefore a vector of variables\nthat satisfies all constraints.\n\nThe techniques used in constraint satisfaction depend on the kind of constraints\nbeing considered. Often used are constraints on a finite domain, to the point\nthat constraint satisfaction problems are typically identified with problems\nbased on constraints on a finite domain. Such problems are usually solved via\nsearch, in particular a form of backtracking or local search. Constraint\npropagation are other methods used on such problems; most of them are incomplete\nin general, that is, they may solve the problem or prove it unsatisfiable, but\nnot always. Constraint propagation methods are also used in conjunction with\nsearch to make a given problem simpler to solve. Other considered kinds of\nconstraints are on real or rational numbers; solving problems on these\nconstraints is done via variable elimination or the simplex algorithm.\n\nConstraint satisfaction originated in the field of artificial intelligence in\nthe 1970s (see for example ). During the 1980s and 1990s, embedding of\nconstraints into a programming language were developed. Languages often used for\nconstraint programming are Prolog and C++.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Constraint_satisfaction","recorded":1362670962,"links":10,"instances":["mathematics","production_processes","mathematics","solver","programming_language","journal","logic","computing","optimization","programming_language","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Constraint programming|"],"headings":["Constraint satisfaction problem","Constraint programming","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/f/d5fba62cf5ce69207996a12819f52e0b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["constraint","mathematics"],["variable","mathematics"],["local_search","constraint_satisfaction"],["scheduling","production_processes"],["local_search","optimization"],["optimization","mathematics"],["java","programming_language"],["unification","computing"],["substitution","logic"],["comet","programming_language"],["jacop","solver"],["constraint","mathematics"],["artificial_intelligence","journal"]],"members":["optimization","scheduling","variable","jacop","java","artificial_intelligence","substitution","unification","local_search","comet","constraint"],"related":["Artificial_intelligence","Operations_research","Constraint_(mathematics)","Variable_(mathematics)","Satisfiability","Constraint_satisfaction_problem","Search_algorithm","Backtracking","Local_search_(constraint_satisfaction)","Constraint_propagation","Variable_elimination","Simplex_algorithm","Artificial_intelligence","Programming_language","Constraint_programming","Prolog","C++","Eight_queens_puzzle","Sudoku","Boolean_satisfiability_problem","Scheduling_(production_processes)","Graph_coloring","Constraint_programming","Futoshiki","Kakuro","Search_algorithm","Backtracking","Constraint_propagation","Local_search_(optimization)","Nonlinear","Variable_elimination","Simplex_algorithm","Linear","Polynomial","Optimization_(mathematics)","NP_complete","Tractable_problem","Finite_model_theory","Programming_language","Prolog_II","Logic_programming","Prolog","C++","Java_(programming_language)","Logic_programming","Constraint_store","Unification_(computing)","Substitution_(logic)","Concurrent_constraint_logic_programming","Concurrent_process","Constraint_handling_rules","Software_library","Imperative_programming_language","Cassowary_constraint_solver","Open_source","Comet_(programming_language)","Gecode","JaCoP_(solver)","Koalog","Logilab-constraint","MINION","ZDC","Computer-Aided_Constraint_Satisfaction_Project","Imperative_programming_language","Kaleidoscope_programming_language","Functional_programming","Constraint_satisfaction_problem","Constraint_(mathematics)","Candidate_solution","Boolean_satisfiability_problem","Decision_theory","Satisfiability_modulo_theories","Artificial_Intelligence_(journal)"]}
