{"cursor":"8418","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", an example for poor construction planning and execution. [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/world/europe/mayor-to-leave-\npanel-overseeing-delayed-berlin-airport.html?ref=europe New York Times article\non the problems with the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport] ]]\n\n'Construction engineering' is a professional discipline that deals with the\ndesigning, planning, construction, and management of infrastructures such as\nhighways, bridges, airports, railroads, buildings, dams, and utilities.\nConstruction Engineers are unique such that they are a cross between civil\nengineers and construction managers. Construction engineers learn the designing\naspect much like civil engineers and construction site management functions much\nlike construction managers.\n\nThe primary difference between a construction engineer and a construction\nmanager is that the construction engineer has the ability to sit for the\nProfessional Engineer license (PE) whereas a construction manager cannot. At the\neducational level, construction managers are not as focused on design work as\nthey are on construction procedures, methods, and people management. Their\nprimary concern is to deliver a project on time, within budget, and of the\ndesired quality.\n\nThe difference between a construction engineer and civil engineer is only at the\neducational level as both disciplines are able to sit for the PE exam giving\nthem the same title of engineer. Civil engineering students concentrate more on\nthe design work, gearing them toward a career as a design professional. This\nessentially requires them to take a multitude of design courses. Construction\nengineering students take design courses as well as construction management\ncourses. This allows them to understand both the design functions as well as the\nbuilding requirements needed to design and build today's infrastructures.\n","linknr":395,"url":"Construction_engineering","recorded":1362563056,"links":28,"instances":["contract","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Construction and extraction occupations","Engineering disciplines","Civil engineering","Engineering occupations"],"headings":["Work activities","Abilities","Educational requirements","Job prospects","Remuneration","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/BBI_2010-07-23_5.JPG/300px-BBI_2010-07-23_5.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["administration","business"],["epc","contract"]],"members":["epc","administration"],"related":["Designing","Planning","Construction","Management","Infrastructures","Highways","Bridges","Airports","Railroads","Buildings","Dams","Utilities","Civil_engineers","Infrastructures","Engineer_In_Training","Construction_Communication","Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology","Engineering_mechanics","Engineering_design","Construction_management","Bachelor_of_Science","Civil_engineering","Engineering_management","Administration_(business)","Professional_engineer","Great_Depression","Architectural_engineering","Building_officials","Civil_engineering","Construction_Estimating_Software","Construction_management","Cost_overrun","Cost_engineering","Earthquake_engineering","EPC_(contract)","International_Building_Code","Structural_engineering","Work_breakdown_structure","Index_of_construction_articles"]}
