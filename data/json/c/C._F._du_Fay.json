He noted the difference between conductors and insulators,\ncalling them 'electrics' and 'non-electrics' for their ability to produce\ncontact electrification. He also discovered that alike-charged objects would\nrepel each other and that unlike-charged objects attract. He also disproved\ncertain misconceptions regarding electric charge, such as that of Dr. Stephen\nGray who believed that electric properties of a body depended on its colour. Du\nFay's observations on electricity were reported in a paper written in December\nof 1733 and printed in Volume 38 of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety in 1734. He became a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1733.\n\nDu Fay died of constipation in 1739.\n","linknr":131,"url":"C._F._du_Fay","recorded":1362485575,"links":34,"instances":["electricity","material","scientist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1698 births","1739 deaths","French chemists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Members of the French Academy of Sciences"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Charles_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Cisternay_du_Fay.jpg/150px-Charles_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Cisternay_du_Fay.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/35px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Caffeine_Molecule.png/30px-Caffeine_Molecule.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conductor","material"],["insulator","electricity"],["stephen_gray","scientist"]],"members":["insulator","conductor","stephen_gray"],"related":["Paris","Paris","France","Chemistry","Electric_charge","France","Chemist","Jardin_des_Plantes","Electricity","Glass","Resinous","Electric_charge","Conductor_(material)","Insulator_(electricity)","Contact_electrification","Stephen_Gray_(scientist)","Academy_of_Sciences","Paris","Paris"]}
