{"cursor":"26267","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'comprehensive school' is a state school that does not select its intake on\nthe basis of academic achievement or aptitude. This is in contrast to the\nselective school system, where admission is restricted on the basis of selection\ncriteria. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where\ncomprehensive schools were introduced in 1965. It corresponds broadly to the\nGerman [[Gesamtschule]] and to the high school in the United States and Canada.\nAbout 90% of British pupils attend comprehensive schools.\n\nAlthough comprehensive schools do not directly select pupils on the basis of\nacademic ability, they may be part of a system in which selection occurs via\ncatchment area. For example, school catchment areas containing expensive houses\nwill be mainly populated by wealthy parents, whose children would be expected to\nshow, on average, a high level of academic achievement at primary school. Most\ncomprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 18,\nbut in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places\nthe secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those\naged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high\nschool) and high school, respectively.\n\nSince a comprehensive school offers a full range of subjects across the academic\nand vocational spectrum, it is commonly understood that the school will need to\nbe of a large size and to take children from a wide range of abilities. In\nprinciple, it was originally conceived as a \"neighbourhood\" school, which all\nstudents in its catchment area were meant to attend, irrespective of ability and\nwithout, in most cases, any significant element of parental choice.\n","linknr":410,"url":"Comprehensive_school","recorded":1362565636,"links":26,"instances":["england_and_wales","uk","germany","germany","germany","germany","uk","england","wiesbaden"],"pdf":["http://www.vo-saar.de/dokumente/Umgang%20mit%20Heterogenitaet.pdf"],"categories":["Philosophy of education","Education in the United Kingdom","State schools in the United Kingdom","School types"],"headings":["Finland","Germany","Gibraltar","Ireland","Sweden","United Kingdom","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/IGSLO_3.JPG/220px-IGSLO_3.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Integrierte_Gesamtschule_Ludwigshafen-Gartenstadt_02.jpg/220px-Integrierte_Gesamtschule_Ludwigshafen-Gartenstadt_02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gymnasium","germany"],["helene-lange-school","wiesbaden"],["the_left","germany"],["christian_democratic_union","germany"],["free_democratic_party","germany"],["christian_democratic_union","germany"],["gymnasium","germany"],["community_school","england_and_wales"],["conservative_party","uk"],["labour_party","uk"],["conservative_party","uk"],["conservative_party","uk"],["labour_party","uk"],["academy","england"]],"members":["community_school","conservative_party","christian_democratic_union","free_democratic_party","gymnasium","the_left","labour_party","academy"],"related":["State_school","Selective_school","England_and_Wales","High_school","United_States","Canada","Secondary_school","Germany","Gymnasium_(Germany)","Realschule","Hauptschulabschluss","Realschulabschluss","Abitur","States_of_Germany","Hauptschule","Realschule","Education_in_Berlin","Education_in_Hamburg","Helene-Lange-School_(Wiesbaden)","Laborschule_Bielefeld","Mittelschule","Hauptschule","Hauptschulabschluss","Mittlere_Reife","Abitur","The_Left_(Germany)","Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","Alliance_'90/The_Greens","Christian_Democratic_Union_(Germany)","Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany)","North_Rhine-Westphalia","Abitur","Christian_Democratic_Union_(Germany)","Alliance_'90/The_Greens","PISA","Hauptschule","Realschule","Gymnasium_(Germany)","Gibraltar","Republic_of_Ireland","Patrick_Hillery","Minister_for_Education_and_Skills","Vocational_school","Voluntary_secondary_school","Community_school_(England_and_Wales)","Roman_Catholic","Protestant","Minister_for_Education_and_Skills","Vocational_Education_Committee","Second_World_War","England","Wales","Northern_Ireland","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Rab_Butler","Secondary_modern","Secondary_technical","Grammar_school","Holyhead_High_School","Anglesey","Coventry","Sheffield","Leicestershire","West_Riding_of_Yorkshire","Grammar_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom","Risinghill_School","Islington","Progressivism","Corporal_punishment","Anthony_Crosland","Labour_Party_(UK)","Circular_10/65","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Margaret_Thatcher","11-plus","Secondary_modern","Grammar_schools","Liverpool_Institute","Telford","Crawley","London_Borough_of_Haringey","Leicestershire","London_Borough_of_Merton","London_Borough_of_Croydon","Cumbria","Sheffield","Suffolk","Derbyshire","Bedfordshire","Newcastle-upon-Tyne","Havering","Hampshire","Lincoln,_Lincolnshire","Hertfordshire","Cambridgeshire","Nottinghamshire","Retford","Northamptonshire","Shropshire","Ealing","Portsmouth","Leicester","Essex","Peterborough","West_Sussex","Worcestershire","Inner_London_Education_Authority","Cheshire","Barrow_in_Furness","Norfolk","James_Callaghan","Ruskin_College","A.E._Dyson","Rhodes_Boyson","Secondary_school","League_tables","Conservative_Party_(UK)","Labour_Party_(UK)","City_Technology_College","Academy_(England)","Specialist_school","United_Kingdom","Grammar_school","Grammar_school","Ability_grouping","Scotland","Scottish_Government","Specialist_school","Campaign_for_State_Education","BBC_Radio_4"]}
