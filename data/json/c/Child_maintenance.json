Child maintenance is paid\ndirectly or indirectly by an obligor to an obligee for the care and support of\nchildren of a relationship that has been terminated, or in some cases never\nexisted. Often the obligor is a non-custodial parent. The obligee is typically a\ncustodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian, or the state.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, a custodial parent may pay child support to a non-\ncustodial parent. Typically one has the same duty to pay child support\nirrespective of sex, so a mother is required to pay support to a father just as\na father must pay a mother. Where there is joint custody, the child is\nconsidered to have two custodial parents and no non-custodial parents, and a\ncustodial parent with a higher income (obligor) may be required to pay the other\ncustodial parent (obligee).\n\nIn family law, child support is often arranged as part of a divorce, marital\nseparation, dissolution of marriage, annulment, determination of parentage or\ndissolution of a civil union and may supplement alimony (spousal support)\narrangements. [http://www.ag.gov.bc.ca/family-\njustice/law/child/definition.htm Definition of child support:] \"Child support is\nthe legal right of a child to receive financial support from his or her parents.\nThat right exists whether or not the child's parents were ever married and\nwhether or not they ever lived together. That right continues until the child\nturns 19 years old. If the child is still dependent at age 19 or older - owing\nto illness or disability, or because the child is still in school, for example -\nthen the right to financial support will continue.\" British Columbia Attorney\nGeneral, Canada [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/fct/glossary.htm\nDefinition of child support:] \"Financial support paid by a parent to help\nsupport a child or children of whom they do not have custody.
