She was convicted of the November 4,\n1997, murder of her two preschool-aged children, Justin and Shelby Alexis Riggs.\nThe children were killed in their beds at the family's Sherwood, Arkansas home.\nThe murder plan involved giving the children undiluted potassium chloride just\nafter giving them amitriptyline to sedate them. However,\nthe potassium chloride was not diluted properly and it burned her son's veins,\ncausing Justin terrible pain but not death. [http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/riggs629.htm\n\"Christina Marie Riggs\"] Office of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney\nShe eventually smothered him when the injection was ineffective. She then\nsmothered her daughter Shelby, without injecting her, after seeing the pain that\nthe drug caused Justin. She laid the children on her bed,\ncovered them with a blanket, and wrote suicide notes.\nShe then attempted suicide by taking twenty-eight amitriptyline pills and\ninjecting herself with undiluted potassium chloride. Nineteen hours later,\nRiggs' mother discovered her unconscious on the floor of her home.\n\nChristina was suffering from a very deep depression and apparently did not want\nto have her children split up after her own suicide. The children had different\nfathers.\n\nAt her June 1998 trial, Riggs contended she was not guilty by reason of\ninsanity, but the Pulaski County jury convicted her. During the penalty phase,\nRiggs would not allow attorneys to put on a defense, saying she wanted a death\nsentence. She was executed with a potassium chloride injection, the same\nsubstance with which she attempted to kill her children.\n\nRiggs was placed in the Arkansas Department of Correction system and held at the\nMcPherson Unit, which included the female death row, until her\nexecution.
