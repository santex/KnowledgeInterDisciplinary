{"cursor":"6216","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'cut-elimination theorem' (or 'Gentzen'sHauptsatz') is the central result\nestablishing the significance of the sequent calculus. It was originally\nproved by Gerhard Gentzen 1934 in his landmark paper \"Investigations in\nLogical Deduction\" for the systems LJ and LK formalising intuitionistic and\nclassical logic respectively. The cut-elimination theorem states that any\njudgement that possesses a proof in the sequent calculus that makes use of the\n'cut rule' also possesses a 'cut-free proof', that is, a proof that does not\nmake use of the cut rule.\n\nA sequent is a logical expression relating multiple sentences, in the form\n\" A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots \\vdash B_1, B_2, B_3, \\ldots \", which is to\nbe read as \"A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots proves B_1, B_2, B_3,\n\\ldots \", and (as glossed by Gentzen) should be understood as\nequivalent to the truth-function \"If (A_1 and A_2 and A_3 \\ldots )\nthen (B_1 or B_2 or B_3 \\ldots ).\" Wilfried Buchholz, [http://www.mathematik.uni-\nmuenchen.de/~buchholz/articles/beweisth.ps Beweistheorie] (university lecture\nnotes about cut-elimination, German, 2002-2003) Note that the left-hand\nside (LHS) is a conjunction (and) and the RHS is a disjunction (or).\n\nThe LHS may have arbitrarily many or few formulae; when the LHS is empty, the\nRHS is a tautology. In LK, the RHS may also have any number of formulaeâif it\nhas none, the LHS is a contradiction, whereas in LJ the RHS may have only none\nor one formula: here we see that allowing more than one formula in the RHS is\nequivalent, in the presence of the right contraction rule, to the admissibility\nof the law of the excluded middle. However, the sequent calculus is a fairly\nexpressive framework, and there have been sequent calculi for intuitionistic\nlogic proposed that allow many formulae in the RHS. From Jean-Yves Girard's\nlogic LC it is easy to obtain a rather natural formalisation of classical logic\nwhere the RHS contains at most one formula; it is the interplay of the logical\nand structural rules that is the key here.\n\n\"Cut\" is a rule in the normal statement of the sequent calculus, and equivalent\nto a variety of rules in other proof theories, which, given\n\n: (1)  \\Gamma \\vdash A,\\Delta\n\nand\n\n: (2)  \\Pi, A \\vdash \\Lambda\n\nallows one to infer\n\n: (3) \\Gamma, \\Pi \\vdash \\Delta,\\Lambda.\n\nThat is, it \"cuts\" the occurrences of the formula \"A\" out of the inferential\nrelation. The cut-elimination theorem states that (for a given system) any\nsequent provable using the rule Cut can be proved without use of this rule.\n\nFor sequent calculi that have only one formula in the RHS, the \"Cut\" rule\nreads, given\n\n: (1)  \\Gamma \\vdash A\n\nand\n\n: (2)  \\Pi, A \\vdash B\n\nallows one to infer\n\n: (3) \\Gamma, \\Pi \\vdash B.\n\nIf we think of B as a theorem, then cut-elimination in this case\nsimply says that a lemma A used to prove this theorem can be\ninlined. Whenever the theorem's proof mentions lemma A , we can\nsubstitute the occurrences for the proof of A . Consequently, the\ncut rule is admissible.\n\nFor systems formulated in the sequent calculus, analytic proofs are those\nproofs that do not use Cut. Typically such a proof will be longer, of course,\nand not necessarily trivially so. In his essay \"Don't Eliminate Cut!\" George\nBoolos demonstrated that there was a derivation that could be completed in a\npage using cut, but whose analytic proof could not be completed in the lifespan\nof the universe.\n\nThe theorem has many, rich consequences:\n* A system is inconsistent if it admits a proof of the absurd. If the system has\n  a cut elimination theorem, then if it has a proof of the absurd, or of the\n  empty sequent, it should also have a proof of the absurd (or the empty\n  sequent), without cuts. It is typically very easy to check that there are no\n  such proofs. Thus, once a system is shown to have a cut elimination theorem,\n  it is normally immediate that the system is consistent.\n* Normally also the system has, at least in first order logic, the subformula\n  property, an important property in several approaches to proof-theoretic\n  semantics.\n\nCut elimination is one of the most powerful tools for proving interpolation\ntheorems. The possibility of carrying out proof search based on resolution, the\nessential insight leading to the Prolog programming language, depends upon the\nadmissibility of Cut in the appropriate system.\n\nFor proof systems based on higher-order typed lambda calculus through a\nCurry–Howard isomorphism, cut elimination algorithms correspond to the\nstrong normalization property (every proof term reduces in a finite number of\nstep into a normal form).\n","linknr":125,"url":"Cut-elimination_theorem","recorded":1362674371,"links":13,"instances":["term_rewriting","mathematics","logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theorems in the foundations of mathematics","Proof theory"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/8/018ba2da3acbfe78289ac4e1b904f1af.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/5/065775997fdbcb83ddbe8936e67e4f2c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/5/065775997fdbcb83ddbe8936e67e4f2c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/5/065775997fdbcb83ddbe8936e67e4f2c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/5/065775997fdbcb83ddbe8936e67e4f2c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/b/3/db3c50ea8f168b0027a6989565bd5571.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/2/f029a0836f80da00966cc4bcdf8e8b7f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/0/2a0034d12f2c8ca64cdfeb55a534519c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/6/3167513b86817b9e9052b902b4e1291e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/2/002387a04004f1a2e3a567a2678ba796.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/2/322eb692ce8022df9314caf2fbc5b269.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/5/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tautology","logic"],["lemma","mathematics"],["normal_form","term_rewriting"]],"members":["normal_form","lemma","tautology"],"related":["Sequent_calculus","Gerhard_Gentzen","Intuitionistic_logic","Classical_logic","Sequent","Tautology_(logic)","Contradiction","Law_of_the_excluded_middle","Jean-Yves_Girard","Sequent_calculus","Proof_theory","Lemma_(mathematics)","Admissible_rule","Analytic_proof","George_Boolos","Consistency_proof","Subformula_property","Proof-theoretic_semantics","Craig_interpolation","First-order_resolution","Prolog","Higher-order_typed_lambda_calculus","Curry&ndash;Howard_isomorphism","Normal_form_(term_rewriting)","Gentzen's_consistency_proof","Peano's_axioms"]}
