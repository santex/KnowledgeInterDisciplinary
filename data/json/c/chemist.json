Chemists study the composition of\nmatter and its properties such as density and acidity. Chemists carefully\ndescribe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the\nlevel of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure\nsubstance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties.\n\nChemists use this knowledge to learn the composition, and properties of\nunfamiliar substances, as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities\nof useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances\nand useful processes. Chemists may specialize in any number of subdisciplines of\nchemistry. Materials scientists and metallurgists share much of the same\neducation and skills with chemists. The work of chemists is often related to the\nwork of chemical engineers, which are primarily concerned with the proper\ndesign, construction and evaluation of the most cost-effective large-scale\nchemical plants and work closely with industrial chemists on the development of\nnew processes and methods for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals and\nrelated products.\n",
