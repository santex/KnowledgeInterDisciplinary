{"cursor":"1144","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" wearing the coppola.]] The 'coppola' is a traditional kind of flat cap\n typically worn in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th\n century, the coppola began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a\n driving cap, usually worn when at the wheel driving the car. The coppola is\n usually made in tweed.\n\nThe origin of the name coppola is likely to be a Sicilian adaptation of the\nEnglish word cap, itself coming from the Latin word \"caput\" (head). By\nextension, coppola is also Sicilian for [[head]]. The word coppola then became\npopular also in the rest of Italy, and was quickly acquired by Italian language\nby extension. Today, the coppola is widely regarded, at least in Italy, as a\ndefinitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Coppola_(cap)_","recorded":1362566484,"links":19,"instances":["cloth"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Culture of Sicily","Caps","Italian clothing"],"headings":["Source"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Uomo_siciliano.jpg/111px-Uomo_siciliano.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Sicily_%28revised%29.svg/30px-Flag_of_Sicily_%28revised%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tweed","cloth"]],"members":["tweed"],"related":["Flat_cap","Sicily","Flat_cap","Tweed_(cloth)","Latin","Sicilian_language","Italian_language"]}
