The ODTR was\nestablished in 1997 to take over the licensing and regulatory functions of the\nMinister for Transport, Energy and Communication which related primarily to\nbroadcasting and communications. The first (and only) Director of\nTelecommunications Regulation was Etain Doyle, who was subsequently appointed\nChairperson of ComReg, on its establishment.\n\nUnder the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA20Y2002.html Communications\nRegulation Act, 2002] the Minister for Communications, Marine, and Natural\nResources appoints the chairperson and up to two other commissioners of ComReg.\nCurrently the commissioners are Mike Byrne, Kevin O'Brien and Alex Chisholm\n(Chairperson) www.comreg.ie Sectors regulated by ComReg include post,\ntelecoms, internet, cable television, terrestrial television, radio and domain\nname under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 (No. 20 of 2002), S.I. No.\n510 of 2002 Communications Regulation Act 2002 (Establishment Day) Order 2002\nand other acts. For a full list of legislation underpinning ComReg's\nresponsibilities see:[http://www.comreg.ie/about_us/legislation.501.html]\n\nComReg set prices, allocate frequencies, and issue licenses to those involved in\nthese sectors and provides statistical data, consumer product price comparisons\nto assist consumers in achieving value for money on a fair basis. In relation to\nterrestrial television and radio, the commission acts in conjunction with the\nBroadcasting Commission of Ireland soon to be revised as the Broadcasting\nAuthority of Ireland. The BCI grants programme contracts to radio and television\nstations other than those operated by RTÃ, TG4. Until the Broadcasting Act 2009\nwas enacted TV3 was the only terrestrial TV channel regulated by the BCI. After\nthe enactment the RTÃ and TG4 Authorities were disbanded and now come under the\nBroadcasting Authority of Ireland's new remit. For more on the BAI see\nBroadcasting Authority of Ireland.\n\nComReg is also tasked with enforcing wireless telegraphy legislation, in\nparticular the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, in relation to use of the radio\nspectrum, which includes actions against pirate radio stations, distributors of\nmobile phone repeaters and other unlicensed users of radio spectrum.\n\nIn September 2004, ComReg launched their consumer driven website, AskComreg.ie.\nSince then it has added ComStat.ie[http://www.comstat.ie] to provide market\ncommunications industry statistics to industry and academia and CallCosts.ie\n[http://www.callcosts.ie] which provides the tariff models of all telecoms\nproducts for consumers to compare product prices and make the best choices for\nthemselves.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Commission_for_Communications_Regulation","recorded":1375073753,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","/wiki/Template:Cleanup/doc","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit","/wiki/File:Commission_for_Communications_Regulation_Ireland.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Commission_for_Communications_Regulation_Ireland.png","/wiki/Types_of_business_entity","/wiki/Regulatory_agency","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Competition_regulator","/wiki/Broadcasting","/wiki/Telecommunications","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Chairperson","http://www.comreg.ie/","/wiki/Irish_language","/wiki/Communication","/wiki/Regulatory_agency","/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport","/w/index.php?title=Etain_Doyle&action=edit&redlink=1","http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA20Y2002.html","/wiki/Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources","/wiki/Alex_Chisholm","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Mail","/wiki/Telecoms","/wiki/Internet","/wiki/Cable_television","/wiki/Terrestrial_television","/wiki/Radio","/wiki/Domain_name","http://www.comreg.ie/about_us/legislation.501.html","/wiki/Broadcasting_Commission_of_Ireland","/wiki/Broadcasting_Authority_of_Ireland","/wiki/Raidi%C3%B3_Teilif%C3%ADs_%C3%89ireann","/w/index.php?title=Telif%C3%ADs_na_Gaeilge&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Broadcasting_Act_2009","/wiki/TV3_(Ireland)","/wiki/Broadcasting_Authority_of_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=Wireless_Telegraphy_Act,_1926&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pirate_radio","http://www.comstat.ie","http://www.callcosts.ie","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Communications_in_Ireland","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit&section=3","http://www.comreg.ie/","http://www.askcomreg.ie","http://www.callcosts.ie","http://www.comstat.ie","http://www.comwreck.com","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&oldid=537743292","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Communications_authorities","/wiki/Category:Government_agencies_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Media_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Communications_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Telecommunications_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland","/wiki/Category:Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_March_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_without_a_reason_field_from_March_2009","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_March_2009","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Irish-language_text","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Commission+for+Communications+Regulation&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Commission+for+Communications+Regulation","/wiki/Commission_for_Communications_Regulation","/wiki/Talk:Commission_for_Communications_Regulation","#","/wiki/Commission_for_Communications_Regulation","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Commission_for_Communications_Regulation&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special
