It was originally released in September\n1979 on the Island Records label (ILPS 9573) in the UK and on Antilles (AN 7077)\nin the U.S. Although it only made a brief impact on the UK top 30 at the time,\nin 2004 it was voted at no 58 in the Observer's list, The 100 Greatest British\nAlbums. }}\n\nThe album was re-released on CD in Europe in 1990 and in 2000 within the Island\nMaster series (IMCD 90 and IMCD 275). In 2005 Koch Records licensed the master\nto Cut from Island Def Jam (who still held the rights to the album) and\nreissued the album on CD for the first time ever in the United States;\npreviously, the album had been only available to Stateside fans on CD as an\nEnglish import, since the album's original American release (on the Island\nsubsidiary Antilles, during Island's association with Warner Bros. Records) had\nlong since gone out of print.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Cut_(The_Slits_album)","recorded":1362674412,"links":21,"instances":["drummer","season","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Slits albums","1979 debut albums","Island Records albums","Universal Deluxe Editions"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Cut_%28The_Slits%29.jpg/220px-Cut_%28The_Slits%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","season"],["palmolive","musician"],["budgie","drummer"]],"members":["budgie","spring","palmolive"],"related":["Album","The_Slits","Spring_(season)","Post_punk","Island_Records","Dennis_Bovell","Allmusic","BBC_Music","Robert_Christgau","Pitchfork_Media","Pitchfork_Media","Rolling_Stone","Album","The_Slits","Island_Records","United_Kingdom","United_States","The_Observer","Koch_Records","Island_Def_Jam_Records","Warner_Bros._Records","Viv_Albertine","Tessa_Pollitt","Ari_Up","Palmolive_(musician)","I_Heard_It_Through_the_Grapevine","Barrett_Strong","Norman_Whitfield","Ari_Up","Singing","Viv_Albertine","Guitar","Tessa_Pollitt","Bass_guitar","Budgie_(drummer)","Drum_kit","Dennis_Bovell","Pennie_Smith"]}
