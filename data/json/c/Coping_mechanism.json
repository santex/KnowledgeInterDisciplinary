Psychological coping mechanisms are\ncommonly termed coping strategies or coping skills. Unconscious or non conscious\nstrategies (e.g., defense mechanisms) are generally excluded. The term coping\ngenerally refers to adaptive or constructive coping strategies, i.e., the\nstrategies reduce stress levels. However, some coping strategies can be\nconsidered maladaptive, i.e., stress levels increase. Maladaptive coping can\nthus be described, in effect, as non-coping. Furthermore, the term coping\ngenerally refers to reactive coping, i.e., the coping response follows the\nstressor. This contrasts with proactive coping, in which a coping response aims\nto head off a future stressor.\n\nCoping responses are partly controlled by personality (habitual traits), but\nalso partly by the social context, particularly the nature of the stressful\nenvironment.
