Note the rhizomatious stems by which the plant reproduces.]] A 'clonal\ncolony' or 'genet' is a group of genetically identical individuals, such as\nplants, fungi, or bacteria, that have grown in a given location, all originating\nvegetatively, not sexually, from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in\nsuch a population is referred to as a 'ramet'. In fungi, \"individuals\" typically\nrefers to the visible fruiting bodies or mushrooms that develop from a common\nmycelium which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the\nsoil. Clonal colonies are common in many plant species. Although many plants\nreproduce sexually through the production of seed, reproduction occurs by\nunderground stolons or rhizomes in some plants. Above ground, these plants\nappear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected\nand are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to\nrecognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also\nsexually reproducing.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Clonal_colony","recorded":1362480612,"links":19,"instances":["plant","biology","tree"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant reproduction","Plant morphology","Mycology"],"headings":["Methods of establishment","Record colonies","Examples","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Clonal_colony_of_Iris_germanica.jpg/220px-Clonal_colony_of_Iris_germanica.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["colony","biology"],["pando","tree"],["kerria","plant"],["pando","tree"]],"members":["kerria","colony","pando"],"related":["Rhizome","Genetics","Plant","Fungi","Bacteria","Vegetative_reproduction","Fungi","Fruiting_bodies","Mushroom","Mycelium","Soil","Colony_(biology)","Species","Sexual_reproduction","Seed","Plant_reproduction","Stolon","Rhizome","Woody_plant","Root","Shoot","Basal_shoot","Tree","Shrub","Branch","Layering","Willow","Blackberry","Vine","Adventitious","Plant_stem","Hedera","Trumpet_vine","Wisteria","Fern","Herbaceous","Flowering_plant","Rhizome","Goldenrod","Stolon","Strawberry","Grass","Storage_organ","Bulb","Corm","Plantlet","Apomixis","Dandelion","Quaking_Aspen","Pando_(tree)","Wasatch_Mountains","Utah","USA","Largest_organism","Mass","King's_Lomatia","Tasmania","List_of_long-living_organisms","Earth","Marine_botany","Mediterranean_Sea","Plant_nutrition","Bayberry","Black_locust","Bladdernut","Blueberry","Devil's_Club","Forsythia","Hazelnut","Honey_locust","Kentucky_coffeetree","Kerria_(plant)","Asimina_triloba","Pando_(tree)","Poplar","Sassafras","Sumac","Sweetshrub"]}
