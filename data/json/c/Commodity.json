Karl Marx, \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\"\n  contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29\n  (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 269. Economic commodities\n  comprise goods and services. Karl Marx, \"Outlines of the Critique of\n  Political Economy(Rough Draft of 1857-1857)\" contained in the Collected Works\n  of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28 (International Publishers: New\n  York, 1986) p. 80.\n\nThe more specific meaning of the term commodity is applied to goods only. It is\nused to describe a class of goods for which there is demand, but which is\nsupplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. http://beginn-\nersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm A commodity has\nfull or partial fungibility; that is, the market treats its instances as\nequivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. \"From the taste of\nwheat it is not possible to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French\npeasant or an English capitalist.\" Karl Marx, \"A Contribution to the\nCritique of Political Economy\" contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and\nFrederick Engels: Volume 29, p. 270. Petroleum and copper are other\nexamples of such commodities, {{cite book\n  | last = O'Sullivan first = Arthur authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n  | coauthors = Steven M.

Items such as stereo systems,\n  | on the other hand, have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the\n  | brand, the user interface, the perceived quality, etc. And, the demand for\n  | one type of stereo may be much larger than demand on the other.\n\nIn contrast, one of the characteristics of a commodity good is that its price is\ndetermined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical\ncommodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. Generally, these\nare basic resources and agricultural products such as iron ore, crude oil, coal,\nsalt, sugar, tea, coffee beans, soybeans, aluminum, copper, rice, wheat, gold,\nsilver, palladium, and platinum. Soft commodities are goods that are grown,\nwhile hard commodities are the ones that are extracted through mining.\n\nThere is another important class of energy commodities which includes\nelectricity, gas, coal and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic\nthat it is usually uneconomical to store; hence, electricity must be consumed as\nsoon as it is produced.\n\nCommodification (also called commoditization) occurs as a goods or services\nmarket loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of\nthe intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As\nsuch, goods that formerly carried premium margins for market s have become\ncommodities, such as generic pharmaceuticals and DRAM chips. Another example is\nthe credit card product, where all suppliers offer almost identical interest\nrates, fees, rewards programs, and bait & hook incentive models for new\ncustomers. Since the core credit card product is essentially identical, the only\nremaining market differentiators are branding & customer service.\n\nThere is a spectrum of commodification, rather than a binary distinction of\n\"commodity versus differentiable product\". Few products have complete\nundifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be\ndifferentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil\nfuel, wind, solar). Many products' degree of commodification depends on the\nbuyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are\nconsidered by many customers as completely undifferentiable and fungible; lowest\nprice is the only deciding factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take\ninto consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental\nsustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as\n\"organic versus not\" or \"cage free versus not\" count toward differentiating\nbrands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or forestry council\ncertification count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.\n","linknr":305,"url":"Commodity","recorded":1362560669,"links":49,"instances":["finance","economics","marxism","company","economics","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Commodities used as an investment|*","Business terms","Commodities"],"headings":["Etymology","Global commodities trading company","Commodity trade","Inventory data","Commodities in Marxism","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Mate_mit_Stengeln.jpg/150px-Mate_mit_Stengeln.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Coffee_Beans_Photographed_in_Macro.jpg/100px-Coffee_Beans_Photographed_in_Macro.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics"],["service","economics"],["good","economics"],["good","economics"],["derivative","finance"],["gunvor","company"],["diversification","finance"],["commodity","marxism"]],"members":["derivative","good","commodity","gunvor","service","diversification"],"related":["Yerba_mate","Coffee","Tea","Caffein","Cash_crop","Economics","Wants","Needs","Good_(economics)","Service_(economics)","Good_(economics)","Good_(economics)","Qualitative_data","Product_differentiation","Market","Fungibility","Petroleum","Copper","Brand","Spot_market","Derivative_(finance)","Agriculture","Iron_ore","Crude_oil","Coal","Salt","Sugar","Tea","Coffee_bean","Soybean","Aluminum","Copper","Rice","Wheat","Gold","Silver","Palladium","Platinum","Mining","Coal","Commodification","Commoditization","Intellectual_capital","Profit_margin","Market","Generic_drug","Dynamic_random-access_memory","Organic_food","Free-range_eggs","Reuters","Vitol","Glencore_International_AG","Trafigura","Cargill","Archer_Daniels_Midland","Gunvor_(company)","Mercuria_Energy_Group","Noble_Group","Louis_Dreyfus_Group","Bunge_Limited","Wilmar_International","Olam_International","Commodities_exchange","Chicago_Board_of_Trade","Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange","Dalian_Commodity_Exchange","Global_Board_of_Trade","Euronext.liffe","LIFFE","Kansas_City_Board_of_Trade","Bursa_Malaysia","London_Metal_Exchange","New_York_Mercantile_Exchange","National_Commodity_Exchange_Limited","Multi_Commodity_Exchange","International_Indonesian_Forex_Change_Market","Marché_à_Terme_International_de_France","Commodity_markets","Economic_efficiency","Market_segmentation","Supply_and_demand","Economic_equilibrium","Price","Commodity_price_index","Diversification_(finance)","Inflation","Pension_funds","Sovereign_wealth_funds","Inventory","Stockout","Convenience_yield","Adam_Smith","Economic_rent","Economic_profit","Labor_economics","David_Ricardo","Labor_theory_of_value","Adam_Smith","David_Ricardo","Karl_Rodbertus-Jagetzow","2000s_commodities_boom","Commercial_off-the-shelf","Commodity_(Marxism)","Commodity_currency","Commodity_fetishism","Commodity_markets","Commodity_money","Commodity_price_index","Jim_Rogers","List_of_traded_commodities","Standardization","Trade"]}
