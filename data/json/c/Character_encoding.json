{"cursor":"21594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'character encoding' system consists of a code that pairs each character from\na given repertoire with something elseâsuch as a bit pattern, sequence of\nnatural numbers, octets, or electrical pulsesâin order to facilitate the\ntransmission of data (generally numbers or text) through telecommunication\nnetworks or for data storage. Other terms such as 'character set', 'character\nmap', 'codeset', and 'code page' are used almost interchangeably, but these\nterms have related but distinct meanings described below.\n\nEarly character codes associated with the optical or electrical telegraph could\nonly represent a subset of the characters used in written language, sometimes\nrestricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low\ncost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more\nelaborate character codes (such as Unicode) which represent more of the\ncharacters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally-\naccepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.\n","linknr":539,"url":"Character_encoding","recorded":1362560204,"links":49,"instances":["computing","encoding","mathematics","computing","command","ansi_code_pages"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Character encoding|","Natural language and computing|Encoding"],"headings":["History","Code unit","Unicode encoding model","Character sets, code pages, and character maps","Character encoding translation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","computing"],["octet","computing"],["function","mathematics"],["octet","computing"],["file","command"],["tron","encoding"],["code_page#windows","ansi_code_pages"]],"members":["octet","tron","function","character","file"],"related":["Code","Character_(computing)","Bit","Number","Octet_(computing)","Data","Telecommunication_network","Computer_data_storage","Telegraphy","Unicode","Morse_code","Baudot_code","American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange","ASCII","Unicode","Morse_code","Latin_alphabet","Arabic_numeral","Telegraph_key","Baudot_code","Émile_Baudot","ASCII","Control_code","Integer","IBM","Extended_Binary_Coded_Decimal_Interchange_Code","EBCDIC","Writing_system","CJK_characters","Bacon's_cipher","Braille","International_maritime_signal_flags","Chinese_telegraph_code","Hans_Schjellerup","US-ASCII","UTF-8","EBCDIC","UTF-16","UTF-32","Unicode","Universal_Character_Set","Byte","Windows_code_page","Latin_alphabet","Greek_alphabet","Cyrillic","Diacritic","Typographic_ligature","Glyph","ISO/IEC_8859-1","Function_(mathematics)","UTF-8","UTF-16","Endianness","ISO/IEC_2022","Standard_Compression_Scheme_for_Unicode","Binary_Ordered_Compression_for_Unicode","Punycode","Comparison_of_Unicode_encodings","Unicode","XML","Computer_science","Byte_oriented","Code_point","Windows_code_page","Octet_(computing)","CCSID","Code_word","HTTP","MIME","Unicode","Code_page_437","Cross-platform","Web_browser","Iconv","Luit","International_Components_for_Unicode","Mozilla","File_(command)","Linux","Microsoft_Windows","Alt_code","Character_encodings_in_HTML","Code_page","Mojikyo","TRON_(encoding)","TRON_project","Han_Unification","Universal_Character_Set_characters","Windows_code_page","Charset_sniffing","ISO/IEC_646","ASCII","Extended_Binary_Coded_Decimal_Interchange_Code","EBCDIC_37","EBCDIC_930","EBCDIC_1047","ISO/IEC_8859","ISO/IEC_8859-1","ISO/IEC_8859-2","ISO/IEC_8859-3","ISO/IEC_8859-4","ISO/IEC_8859-5","ISO/IEC_8859-6","ISO/IEC_8859-7","ISO/IEC_8859-8","ISO/IEC_8859-9","ISO/IEC_8859-10","ISO/IEC_8859-11","ISO/IEC_8859-13","ISO/IEC_8859-14","ISO/IEC_8859-15","ISO/IEC_8859-16","Code_page_437","Code_page_737","Code_page_850","Code_page_852","Code_page_855","Code_page_857","Code_page_858","Code_page_860","Code_page_861","Code_page_862","Code_page_863","Code_page_865","Code_page_866","Code_page_869","Windows-1250","Windows-1251","Windows-1252","Windows-1253","Windows-1254","Windows-1255","Windows-1256","Windows-1257","Windows-1258","Mac_OS_Roman","KOI8-R","KOI8-U","KOI7","MIK_Code_page","Indian_Script_Code_for_Information_Interchange","Tamil_Script_Code_for_Information_Interchange","Vietnamese_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange","JIS_X_0208","Shift_JIS","Code_page_932","Extended_Unix_Code","ISO/IEC_2022","JIS_X_0213","Shift_JIS","Extended_Unix_Code","ISO/IEC_2022","List_of_GB_standards","GB_2312","GBK","GB_18030","Big5","Code_page_950","HKSCS","KS_X_1001","ISO/IEC_2022","Unicode","UTF-8","ANSEL","ISO/IEC_6937"]}
