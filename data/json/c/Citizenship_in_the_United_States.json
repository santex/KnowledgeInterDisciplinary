Citizenship is understood as a \"right to have rights\" since it serves as\na foundation for a bundle of subsequent rights, such as the right to live and\nwork in the United States and to receive federal assistance. {{cite news |author = Robert Heineman (book reviewer) |title =\nDownsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its\nPublic (book) by Matthew A. Crenson and Benjamin Ginsberg |quote = The\nwithholding tax has made the voluntary component of tax collection much less\nimportant, and the professional military has limited the need for citizen\nsoldiers. |publisher = The Independent Institute |date = 2004-07 |url =\nhttp://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=221 |accessdate = 2009-12-\n16 }}\n\nThere are two primary sources of citizenship: birthright citizenship, in which a\nperson is presumed to be a citizen provided that he or she is born within the\nterritorial limits of the United States, Note: A person is presumed to be a\nfull citizen in the sense of having a duty to pay some types of taxes and serve\non juries, upon reaching the age of majority. At present the age of majority is\n18 years. and naturalization, a process in which an immigrant applies for\ncitizenship and is accepted. These two pathways to citizenship are specified in\nthe Citizenship Clause of the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment which reads:\n\n\n\nNational citizenship signifies membership in the country as a whole; state\ncitizenship, in contrast, signifies a relation between a person and a particular\nstate and has application generally limited to domestic matters. State\ncitizenship may affect (1) tax decisions and (2) eligibility for some state-\nprovided benefits such as higher education and (3) eligibility for state\npolitical posts such as U.S. Senator.\n\nIn Article One of the Constitution, the power to establish a \"uniform rule of\nnaturalization\" is granted explicitly to Congress.\n\nU.S. law permits multiple citizenship, so a citizen of another country may\nretain their previous citizenship after becoming a citizen of the United States,\nand retain their US citizenship when becoming the citizen of another country,\nshould that country's laws allow it. Citizenship can be renounced by American\ncitizens who also hold another citizenship via a formal procedure at a US\nEmbassy, See ; \"Giving Up US Citizenship: Is it Right for You?\"\nhttp://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article14.html and it can also be\nrestored.\n","linknr":752,"url":"Citizenship_in_the_United_States","recorded":1362555209,"links":27,"instances":["political_scientist","united_states","law","united_states","united_states","pundit","united_states","law","united_states","decision_making","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immigration
