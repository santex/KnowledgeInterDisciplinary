It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an\necclesiastical parish.\n\nA civil parish can range in size from a large town with a population of around\n80,000 to a single village with fewer than a hundred inhabitants. In a limited\nnumber of cases a parish might include a whole city where city status has been\ngranted by the Monarch. Reflecting this diverse nature, a civil parish may be\nknown as a '[[town]]', village, '[[neighbourhood]]' or '[[community]]' by\nresolution of its parish council. Approximately 35% of the English population\nlive in a civil parish.\n\nIn 2012, Queens Park became the first civil parish in Greater London.
