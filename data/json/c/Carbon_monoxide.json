It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in\nhigher concentrations, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism\nin low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In\nthe atmosphere it is spatially variable, short lived, having a role in the\nformation of ground-level ozone.\n\nCarbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, connected by a\ntriple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent\nbond. It is the simplest oxocarbon, and isoelectronic with the cyanide ion and\nmolecular nitrogen. In coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is\ncalled carbonyl.\n\nCarbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing\ncompounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide\n(CO 2), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion\nengine in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, carbon monoxide burns\nwith a blue flame, producing carbon\ndioxide. [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide â\nMolecule of the Month], Dr Mike Thompson, Winchester College, UK. Coal\ngas, which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and\nheating, had carbon monoxide as a significant constituent. Some processes in\nmodern technology, such as iron smelting, still produce carbon monoxide as a\nbyproduct.\n\nWorldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to\nphotochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about 5 x\n10 12 kilograms per year. Other natural sources of CO\ninclude volcanoes, forest fires, and other forms of combustion.\n\nIn biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme\noxygenase 1 and 2 on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown. This process produces a\ncertain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not\nbreathe any carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is\na normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate\ninflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and\nhydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical\nattention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known\nto act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and promoters of neovascular\ngrowth. Clinical trials of small amounts of carbon\nmonoxide as a drug are ongoing.\n","linknr":1075,"url":"Carbon_monoxide","recorded":1362512812,"links":102,"instances":["geology","fuel","medical","data_page","medicine","unit","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxocarbons","Hazardous
