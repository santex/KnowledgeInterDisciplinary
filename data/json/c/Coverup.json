In a\npassive cover-up information is simply not provided; in an active cover-up\ndeception is used.\n\nThe expression is usually applied to people in positions of authority who abuse\ntheir power to avoid or silence criticism or to deflect guilt of wrongdoing.\nThose who initiate a cover up (or their allies) may be responsible for a\nmisdeed, a breach of trust or duty or a crime.\n\nWhile the terms are often used interchangeably, 'cover-up' involves withholding\nincriminatory evidence, while '[[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]' involves\nreleasing misleading evidence.\n",
