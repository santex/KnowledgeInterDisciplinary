The 4-mile (6.5 km) river runs along the boundary between Hendricks\nTownship and Moran Township, with the mouth on Lake Michigan about two miles\neast of Epoufette and about four miles west of Brevort.\n\nIt drains part of the Little Brevoort wetland through a steep-sided limestone\ngorge into northern Lake Michigan. The river's drainage is largely located\nwithin the Lake Superior State Forest and is administered by the Michigan\nDepartment of Natural Resources.\n\nCut River is notable for two features:\n\n* The Cut River Bridge, carrying U.S. Highway 2 over the Cut River close to its\n  mouth, is one of the longest truss arch bridges in the United States, and is\n  the eighth longest bridge in Michigan. Completed in\n  1947, the bridge is 641 feet (195 m) long, and rises\n  140 feet (43 m) above the base of the gorge. Parking is available at both ends\n  of the bridge, and there is a pedestrian footpath on the north side of the\n  bridge, offering a good view of the gorge. Locals call\n  the bridge \"the million dollar bridge over a two-bit creek.\"\n\n* The Cut River gorge is well adapted to growth of mature sugar maple specimens.\n  The bridge and footpath, which rise just above treetop level, offer good views\n  of the gorge during the autumn color season. Hiking trails descend from both\n  ends of the bridge down into the river valley, with a spur to the Lake\n  Michigan shoreline. \n\nIt should not be confused with the natural waterway that runs between Higgins\nLake and Houghton Lake in the lower peninsula of Michigan, which is also called\n\"Cut River\"\n","linknr":118,"url":"Cut_River","recorded":1362674456,"links":13,"instances":["michigan"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geography of Mackinac County, Michigan","Rivers of Michigan"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Cut_River.jpg/200px-Cut_River.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["houghton_lake","michigan"]],"members":["houghton_lake"],"related":["United_States","Michigan","Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan","Mackinac_County,_Michigan","Lake_Michigan","Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan","U.S._state","Michigan","Hendricks_Township,_Michigan","Moran_Township,_Michigan","Lake_Michigan","Epoufette,_Michigan","Brevort,_Michigan","Wetland","Lake_Superior_State_Forest","Michigan_Department_of_Natural_Resources","Cut_River_Bridge","U.S._Route_2_in_Michigan","Truss_arch_bridge","Sugar_maple","Higgins_Lake","Houghton_Lake_(Michigan)"]}
