Some authors use the terms \"convex polytope\"\nand '\"convex polyhedron\"' interchangeably, while others prefer to draw a\ndistinction between the notions of a polyhedron and a polytope.\n\nIn addition, some texts require a polytope to be a bounded set, while others Mathematical Programming, by Melvyn W. Jeter (1986) ISBN 0-8247-7478-\n7, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ofrBsl61lq8C&pg=PA67&dq=%22unbounded+conve-\nx+polyhedron%22&sig=ACfU3U1Yv3iG-XIn3hiuh84nK2e8UIcdAA#PPA68,M1 p. 68]\n(including this article) allow polytopes to be unbounded. The terms\n\"bounded/unbounded convex polytope\" will be used below whenever the boundedness\nis critical to the discussed issue. Yet other texts treat a convex n-polytope as\na surface or (n-1)-manifold.\n\nConvex polytopes play an important role both in various branches of mathematics\nand in applied areas, most notably in linear programming.\n\nA comprehensive and influential book in the subject, called Convex Polytopes,\nwas published in 1967 by Branko GrÃ¼nbaum. In 2003 the 2nd edition of the book\nwas published, with significant additional material contributed by new\nwriters.\n\nIn GrÃ¼nbaum's book, and in some other texts in discrete geometry, convex\npolytopes are often simply called \"polytopes\". GrÃ¼nbaum points out that\nthis is solely to avoid the endless repetition of the word \"convex\", and\nthat the discussion should throughout be understood as applying only to the\nconvex variety.\n\nA polytope is called full-dimensional, if it is an n-dimensional object in\n'R' n.\n","linknr":254,"url":"Convex_polytope","recorded":1362665958,"links":15,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","geometry","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","order","set_theory","geometry","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polytopes","Convex geometry"],"headings":["Examples","Definitions","Properties","Algorithmic problems for a convex polytope","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/3dpoly.svg/220px-3dpoly.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/e/0/ae0a429c9bfd578da7794e66eb4ea7cc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/0/e305b58d743fd6493e8d86f269f2e02a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/b/69b646c748f4e69fc1aaf64dcc0c01ba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/b/69b646c748f4e69fc1aaf64dcc0c01ba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Pyramid_face_lattice.svg/360px-Pyramid_face_lattice.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/a/2aa44a932cf01d3f28cd91e3d77fb19d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ray","geometry"],["half-space","geometry"],["prism","geometry"],["prism","geometry"],["intersection","set_theory"],["half-space","geometry"],["vertex","geometry"],["facet","geometry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["face","geometry"],["half-space","geometry"],["facet","mathematics"],["vertex","geometry"],["edge","geometry"],["ridge","geometry"],["lattice","order"],["ball","mathematics"],["manifold","mathematics"]],"members":["facet","ray","ridge","matrix","manifold","face","ball","lattice","intersection","prism","edge","vertex"],"related":["Polytope","Convex_set","Polyhedron","Bounded_set","Mathematics","Linear_programming","Branko_Grünbaum","Discrete_geometry","Polyhedron","Half-plane","Angle","Polygonal_chain","Ray_(geometry)","Convex_polygon","Half-space_(geometry)","Polyhedral_cylinder","Prism_(geometry)","Polyhedral_cone","Prism_(geometry)","Intersection_(set_theory)","Half-space_(geometry)","Convex_hull","Convex_hull","Vertex_(geometry)","Facet_(geometry)","Closed_half-space","Linear_inequality","Branko_Grünbaum","Volker_Kaibel","Victor_Klee","Günter_M._Ziegler","System_of_linear_inequalities","Matrix_(mathematics)","Affine_subspace","Convex_sum","Conical_sum","Direction_vector","Simplex","Convex_combination","Vector_spaces","Linear_combination","Face_(geometry)","Half-space_(geometry)","Facet_(mathematics)","Vertex_(geometry)","Edge_(geometry)","Ridge_(geometry)","Linearly_independent","Hasse_diagram","Eulerian_poset","Lattice_(order)","Isomorphism","Polyhedral_graph","Hassler_Whitney","Simple_polytope","Computational_complexity","Graph_isomorphism_problem","Simplicial_polytope","Homeomorphism","Ball_(mathematics)","Manifold_(mathematics)","Euler_characteristic","Fundamental_group","N-sphere","Tessellation","Elliptic_space","Spherical_tiling","Simplicial_complex","Simplex","Affinely_independent","Simplex","Vertex_enumeration_problem","Convex_hull_algorithms","Convex_polygon","Polygon","Time_complexity","Big_Oh_notation","Oriented_matroid","Nef_polyhedron","Komei_Fukuda"]}
