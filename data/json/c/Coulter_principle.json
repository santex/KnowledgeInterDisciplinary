As fluid containing particles or\ncells is drawn through each microchannel, each particle causes a brief change to\nthe electrical resistance of the liquid. The counter detects these changes in\nelectrical resistance.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Coulter_principle","recorded":1362481292,"links":17,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory equipment","Counting instruments"],"headings":["Coulter principle","Development","Experimental considerations","Major applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Particle_Transit_Channel.gif/150px-Particle_Transit_Channel.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Coultercounter.jpg/150px-Coultercounter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Coulter_geometries.png/220px-Coulter_geometries.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Coulter-counter_hg.jpg/220px-Coulter-counter_hg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cell_counting","Electrolyte","Cell_(biology)","Bacteria","Prokaryote","Virus","Review_of_Scientific_Instruments","Electric_current","Electrical_impedance","Wallace_H._Coulter","Hematology","Complete_blood_count","Microscope","Flow_cytometry","CASY_cell_counting_technology","Scanning_Ion_Occlusion_Sensing","ASTM_International","Hemocytometer"]}
