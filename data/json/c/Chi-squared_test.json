{"cursor":"6351","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n: \"Chi-squared test\" is often shorthand for [[Pearson's chi-squared test]].\n\nA 'chi-squared test', also referred to as 'chi-square test' or ' \\chi^2 test', is any statistical hypothesis test in which the\nsampling distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when\nthe null hypothesis is true, or any in which this is asymptotically true,\nmeaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) can be\nmade to approximate a chi-squared distribution as closely as desired by making\nthe sample size large enough.\n\nSome examples of chi-squared tests where the chi-squared distribution is only\napproximately valid: *Pearson's chi-squared test, also known as the chi-squared\ngoodness-of-fit test or chi-squared test for independence. When the chi-squared\ntest is mentioned without any modifiers or without other precluding context,\nthis test is usually meant (for an exact test used in place of \\chi^2 , see Fisher's exact test). *Yates's correction for\ncontinuity, also known as Yates' chi-squared test. *CochranâMantelâHaenszel chi-\nsquared test. *McNemar's test, used in certain 2 Ã 2 tables with\npairing *Linear-by-linear association chi-squared test *The portmanteau test in\ntime-series analysis, testing for the presence of autocorrelation *Likelihood-\nratio tests in general statistical modelling, for testing whether there is\nevidence of the need to move from a simple model to a more complicated one\n(where the simple model is nested within the complicated one).\n\nOne case where the distribution of the test statistic is an exact chi-squared\ndistribution is the test that the variance of a normally distributed population\nhas a given value based on a sample variance. Such a test is uncommon in\npractice because values of variances to test against are seldom known exactly.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Chi-squared_test","recorded":1362483644,"links":31,"instances":["statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical tests","Non-parametric statistics","Categorical data"],"headings":["Chi-squared test for variance in a normal population","Chi-squared test for contingency table example","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/1/3f1654642bee437631079661bd54ddc4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/1/3f1654642bee437631079661bd54ddc4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg/32px-Fisher_iris_versicolor_sepalwidth.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degrees_of_freedom","statistics"],["degrees_of_freedom","statistics"]],"members":["degrees_of_freedom"],"related":["Statistical","Hypothesis_test","Sampling_distribution","Chi-squared_distribution","Null_hypothesis","Chi-squared_distribution","Pearson's_chi-squared_test","Fisher's_exact_test","Yates's_correction_for_continuity","Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel_statistics","McNemar's_test","Linear-by-linear_association_chi-squared_test","Portmanteau_test","Time-series_analysis","Autocorrelation","Likelihood-ratio_test","Statistic","Chi-squared_distribution","Sample_variance","Normal_distribution","Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)","Dispute_claim_is_valid","Contingency_table","Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)","Statistically_significant","P-value","G-test","Wald_test"]}
