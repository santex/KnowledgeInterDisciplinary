Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear\nsounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by\nmice and other small game. They can see in near darkness. Like most other\nmammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.\n\nDespite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication\nincludes the use of a variety of vocalizations (meowing, purring, trilling,\nhissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-\nspecific body language.<ref name=\"Moelk\" />\n\nCats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and\nshown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to\ncontrol the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, and the abandonment\nof former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide,\nrequiring population control.<ref name=\"Rochlitz\"></ref>\n\nSince cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to\nhave been domesticated there,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{Cite news |url=\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/science/29cat.html |title=Study Traces Cat's\nAncestry to Middle East |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |date=29 June 2007 |work=New\nYork Times |publisher=NYTC |location=New York |accessdate=2 April 2008}}</ref>\nbut there may have been instances of domestication as early as the\nNeolithic.<ref name=\"ChinaDaily\">{{Cite news |title=Meet Helen and Aphrodite,\nCyprus's Indigenous Cats |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2009-\n11/03/content_8904093.htm |work=China Daily |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=3\nNovember 2009}}</ref>\n\nA genetic study in 2007 revealed that domestic cats are descended from African\nwildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BCE, in the Middle East.<ref\nname=\"NYT\" /><ref name=\"9500 years\">{{cite web |title=Oldest Known Pet Cat? 9500-year-\nold Burial Found on Cyprus |url=\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0408_040408_oldestpetcat.html\n|accessdate=6 March 2007 |date=8 April 2004 |work=National Geographic News\n|publisher=National Geographic Society }}</ref> According to [[Scientific\nAmerican]], cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found almost\nevery place where people live.<ref name=\"SciAm\">{{cite web |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taming-of-the-\ncat |title=The Evolution of House Cats |work=Scientific American |first=Carlos\nA. |last=Driscoll |coauthors=Clutton-Brock, Juliet; Kitchener, Andrew C.;\nO'Brien, Stephen J. |publisher=Nature Pubg.
