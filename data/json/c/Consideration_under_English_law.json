{"cursor":"22699","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Consideration in English law' is one of the three main building blocks of a\ncontract. Consideration can be anything of value (such as an item or service),\nwhich each party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange if the\ncontract is to be valid. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement\nis not legally a binding contract. In its traditional form, expressed as the\nrequirement that in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must\nhave given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised\nin exchange or return for the promise. A contract must be \"met with\" or\n\"supported by\" consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has\nprovided consideration can enforce a contract. In other words, if an arrangement\nconsists of a promise which is not supported by consideration, then the\narrangement is not a legally enforceable contract. Mutual promises constitute\nconsideration for each other. (\"I promise you that I will do X, in consideration\nfor which you promise me that you will do Y\").\n\nIn Australia, the bargain theory of consideration prevails, where the act or\nforbearance of one party or promise thereof is the price for which a promise\nis bought.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Consideration_under_English_law","recorded":1362572427,"links":15,"instances":["miscellaneous_provisions_act_1989","law","rights_of_third_parties_act_1999"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English contract law"],"headings":["Value","Adequacy","Illusory consideration","Privity","Pre-existing duties","Estoppel","Deeds and formality","Alternatives","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/50px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["contracts","rights_of_third_parties_act_1999"],["equity","law"],["law_of_property","miscellaneous_provisions_act_1989"]],"members":["law_of_property","equity","contracts"],"related":["English_contract_law","Quid_pro_quo","Australia","Executory_contract","Tweddle_v_Atkinson","Privity_in_English_law","Contracts_(Rights_of_Third_Parties)_Act_1999","Baltic_Sea","House_of_Lords","Equity_(law)","Promissory_estoppel","Law_of_Property_(Miscellaneous_Provisions)_Act_1989","English_contract_law","JH_Baker"]}
