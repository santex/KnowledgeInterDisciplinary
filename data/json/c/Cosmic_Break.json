Cosmic Break is the sequel to another game\n  by CyberStep, called C21 Steel Battle Chronicles, but contains more anime-\n  styled characters, deeper developed story lines and offers thus more\n  immersion. Several story lines have also been made into mangas and short\n  movies, which are connected to some of the quests in the game. As is the case\n  with GetAmped2, Cosmic Break also has various NPCs and playable characters\n  voiced by famous Japanese voice-over artists. Among these are Rie Tanaka (Icy,\n  Ivis), Akio Åtsuka (Draken), Takeshi Kusao (Lios), Asami Shimoda (Crimrose,\n  Lily Rain), Atsuko Tanaka (Koko Gaap, Winberrl) and Daisuke Sakaguchi (Jikun\n  Hu).
