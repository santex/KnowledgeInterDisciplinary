It\ninvolves recording, analysing, sorting, summarising, calculating, disseminating\nand storing data. Because data are most useful when well-presented and actually\ninformative, data-processing systems are often referred to as information\nsystems. Nevertheless, the terms are roughly synonymous, performing similar\nconversions; data-processing systems typically manipulate raw data into\ninformation, and likewise information systems typically take raw data as input\nto produce information as output.\n\nData processing may or may not be distinguished from data conversion, when the\nprocess is merely to convert data to another format, and does not involve any\ndata manipulation.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Computer_data_processing","recorded":1362477427,"links":29,"instances":["software","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer data"],"headings":["Scientific data processing","Commercial data processing","Data analysis","Processing","Elements of data processing","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","computing"],["dap","software"]],"members":["dap","process"],"related":["Process_(computing)","Computer_program","Data","Data_conversion","Information","Information_system","Data_conversion","Data","File_format","Data_manipulation","Information_systems","Data_analysis","Integer","Fixed-point_arithmetic","Binary-coded_decimal","Floating-point","DAP_(software)","Gretl","PSPP","Fact","Data_processing_system","Pressure","Light","Observation","Electrical","Nervous_system","Sense","Somatosensory_system","Sound","Visual_perception","Information_processing_system","Data_summarization","Data_aggregation","Data_validation","Crosstab","Statistical_analysis","Electronic_data_processing","Two_pass_verification"]}
