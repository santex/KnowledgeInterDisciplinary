From 1919 through\n  1928, Galloway played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1919â27) and Detroit\n  Tigers (1928). He batted and threw right-handed. In a ten-season career,\n  Galloway was a .264 hitter with 17 home runs and 407 RBI in 1076 games.\n\nA native of Clinton, South Carolina, Galloway was the starting shortstop for\nthe Philadelphia Athletics during six seasons until an unfortunate accident\nshorted his promising career. He debuted with the A's in 1919, becoming a\nregular in 1921.\n\nGalloway appeared in the AL Most Valuable Player ballot for three consecutive\nyears (1922â24). His most productive season came in 1922, when he posted career-\nhighs in batting average (.324), runs (83), hits (185) and triples (nine), and\nalso led the American League in games played (155).\n\nIn 1927, Galloway was seriously injured when an errant pitch during a batting\npractice fractured his skull. He played for the Detroit Tigers a year later, but\nhis career ended after just 53 games.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Galloway returned to Clinton and coached for the\nPresbyterian College, where he graduated in the 1910s. He also worked as a\ntalent scout for the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Athletics and Milwaukee\nBraves. Galloway was a baseball icon in his homeland, where he died at age 73.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Chick_Galloway","recorded":1375076658,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/Clinton,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Clinton,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/Oakland_Athletics","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Batter_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Games_played","/wiki/Clinton,_South_Carolina","/wiki/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Coach_(baseball)","/wiki/Presbyterian_College","/wiki/Scout_(sport)","/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds","/wiki/Atlanta_Braves","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=edit&section=1","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/galloch01.shtml","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/G/Galloway_Chick.stm","http://www.historicbaseball.com/players/g/galloway_chick.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&oldid=565907558","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Detroit_Tigers_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Athletics_players","/wiki/Category:Cincinnati_Reds_scouts","/wiki/Category:Milwaukee_Braves_scouts","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Athletics_scouts","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_shortstops","/wiki/Category:People_from_Laurens_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Presbyterian_Blue_Hose_baseball_players","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:1896_births","/wiki/Category:1969_deaths","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chick+Galloway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chick+Galloway","/wiki/Chick_Galloway","/wiki/Talk:Chick_Galloway","#","/wiki/Chick_Galloway","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chick_Galloway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chick_Galloway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&oldid=565907558","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5096111","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chick_Galloway&id=565907558","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chick+Galloway","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chick+Galloway&oldid=565907558&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Chick_Galloway&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5096111#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Galloway","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["baseball","baseball","baseball",
