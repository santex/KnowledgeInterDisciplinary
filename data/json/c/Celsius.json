{"cursor":"29119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n calibrated in degrees Celsius]] 'Celsius', also known as 'centigrade', is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. It is\n named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701â1744), who developed a\n similar temperature scale. The 'degree Celsius (Â°C)' can refer to a specific\n temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature\n interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. The unit was\n known until 1948 as \"centigrade\" from the Latin centum translated as 100 and\n gradus translated as \"steps\".\n\nFrom 1743 until 1954, 0 Â°C was defined as the freezing point of water and\n100 Â°C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one\nstandard atmosphere with mercury being the working material. Although these\ndefining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international\nagreement the unit \"degree Celsius\" and the Celsius scale are currently defined\nby two different temperatures: absolute zero, and the triple point of VSMOW\n(specially purified water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic\ntemperature with symbol K. Absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible at\nwhich matter reaches minimum entropy, is defined as being precisely 0 K and\nâ273.15 Â°C. The temperature of the triple point of water is defined as\nprecisely 273.16 K and 0.01 Â°C.\n\nThis definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as\nprecisely 1 part in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between\nabsolute zero and the triple point of water. Thus, it sets the magnitude of one\ndegree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. Additionally, it\nestablishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being\nprecisely 273.15 degrees Celsius ( 0 K}} and 273.15 K}}).\n","linknr":493,"url":"Celsius","recorded":1362486087,"links":113,"instances":["phase_transition","unit","properties","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.imeko.org/publications/tc12-2004/PTC12-2004-PL-001.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070307055524/http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.05/papers/magnum95icept.pdf","http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.05/papers/magnum95icept.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070307055524/http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div836/836.05/papers/magnum95icept.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"],"categories":["SI derived units","Units of temperature"],"headings":["History","Name and symbol typesetting","Temperatures and intervals","Coexistence of Kelvin and Celsius scales","Melting and boiling points of water","Worldwide adoption","Conversion table between the different temperature units","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Pakkanen.jpg/170px-Pakkanen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Celsius_original_thermometer.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Unicode_%C2%B0C_comparison.svg/40px-Unicode_%C2%B0C_comparison.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/f/9afba8fae51c8410958edafb9029769f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/63010677956f0109c4b8a12a5c863cb2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/4a1bc9d993390bb02b954f391d486109.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/679a3f079df98e13aa9b9998d666f74d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/ff07074aa057e2d611835ea2573f8977.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/b4202afeab2685128448a478eb6159e1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/c7f769257e42d9377cef3ebefe6c4e4a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/ade5a2d897e1d47e3c70556a1ea7e61a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/e0be2e083efe2751ea8c5b29b2cce215.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/SI_base_unit.svg/75px-SI_base_unit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interval","mathematics"],["atmosphere","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["sublimation","phase_transition"],["atmosphere","unit"],["water","properties"],["water","properties"]],"members":["sublimation","atmosphere","water","interval"],"related":["Unit_of_measurement","Temperature","Sweden","Anders_Celsius","Interval_(mathematics)","Uncertainty","Atmosphere_(unit)","Absolute_zero","Triple_point","Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water","Kelvin","SI","SI_base_unit","Thermodynamic_temperature","Entropy","Triple_point","Sweden","Anders_Celsius","Atmosphere_(unit)","BIPM","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","Square_centimeter","KPa","Lyon","Jean-Pierre_Christin","Don_Rittner","Infobase_Publishing","Manhattan","New_York_City","Mercury_thermometer","Paris","Neuchâtel","Carolus_Linnaeus","Thermometry","International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures","BBC_Weather","Gradian","Kelvin","Fahrenheit","Liquid_nitrogen","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Dry_ice","Triple_point","Normal_human_body_temperature","Boiling_point","Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water","Atmosphere_(unit)","ITS-90","SI_base_unit","NIST","International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures","Degree_symbol","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","BIPM","Unicode","Unicode_compatibility_characters","CJK","Fullwidth","Canonical_decomposition","Unicode_normalization","Heat_capacity","Gallium","Triple_point","Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water","VSMOW","Absolute_zero","Water_(properties)","Water_(properties)","CGPM","Thermodynamic_temperature","International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","Light_temperature","Metric_system","Fahrenheit","Weather_forecasting","The_New_York_Times","Absolute_zero","International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990","Comparison_of_temperature_scales","Thermodynamic_temperature"]}
