It is larger than a bus stop, which is usually simply\n a place on the roadside, where buses can stop. It may be intended as a\n terminal station for a number of routes, or as a transfer station where the\n routes continue.\n\nBus station platforms may be assigned to fixed bus lines, or variable in\ncombination with a dynamic passenger information system.<ref></ref> The latter\nrequires fewer platforms, but does not supply the passenger the comfort of\nknowing the platform well in advance and waiting there.\n",
