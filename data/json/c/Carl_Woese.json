A\n  Pronunciation Guide to Names of Public Figures] July 15, 1928 â\n  December 30, 2012) was an American microbiologist and biophysicist. Woese was\n  famous for defining the Archaea (a new domain or kingdom of life) in 1977 by\n  phylogenetic taxonomy of 16S ribosomal RNA, a technique pioneered by Woese\n  which revolutionized the discipline of microbiology. He was also the originator of\n  the RNA world hypothesis in 1977, although not by that name. He held the Stanley O. Ikenberry Chair and was\n  professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at\n  UrbanaâChampaign. {{cite web\n  |url=http://news.illinois.edu/NEWS/06/0519woese.html |title=U. of I.\n  microbiologist Carl Woese elected to Royal Society |accessdate=2009-03-02\n  |work=News Bureau, University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign |date=2006-05-\n  19 }}\n","linknr":1081,"url":"Carl_Woese","recorded":1362483861,"links":61,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1928 births","2012 deaths","American microbiologists","American scientists","Amherst College alumni","Deerfield Academy alumni","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","MacArthur Fellows","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","National Academy of Sciences laureates","National Medal of Science laureates","People from Syracuse, New York","University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty","Leeuwenhoek Medal winners"],"headings":["Life and education","Work and discoveries","Honors and scientific legacy","Selected publications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Carl_Woese.jpg/220px-Carl_Woese.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Phylogenetic_tree.svg/450px-Phylogenetic_tree.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"]],"members":["domain","kingdom"],"related":["Syracuse,_New_York","Urbana,_Illinois","Urbana,_Illinois","United_States","Microbiology","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana–Champaign","Ernest_C._Pollard","Archaea","Leeuwenhoek_Medal","Selman_A._Waksman_Award_in_Microbiology","National_Medal_of_Science","Crafoord_Prize","Microbiologist","Biophysicist","Archaea","Domain_(biology)","Kingdom_(biology)","Phylogenetic","Taxonomy","16S_ribosomal_RNA","RNA_world_hypothesis","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana–Champaign","Deerfield_Academy","Massachusetts","Mathematics","Physics","Amherst_College","Biochemistry","William_M._Fairbank","Biophysics","Yale","Ph.D.","Biophysics","Yale_University","Virus","Ionizing_radiation","Pediatrics","General_Electric_Research_Laboratory","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana–Champaign","Pancreatic_cancer","Genetic_code","General_Electric","Knolls_Atomic_Power_Laboratory","Amino_acids","Nucleobase","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Base_pair","Proline","Pasteur_Institute","Paris,_France","Sol_Spiegelman","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana–Champaign","Tenure","George_E._Fox","Taxonomy","Three-domain_system","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Prokaryote","Tree_of_life","Biogeochemical","Ecologists","Conservationists","Evolution","Salvador_Luria","Ernst_Mayr","Scientific_community","Extremophile","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Horizontal_gene_transfer_in_evolution","RNA_world","MacArthur_Fellowship","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Leeuwenhoek_Medal","Selman_A._Waksman_Award_in_Microbiology","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","National_Medal_of_Science","Crafoord_Prize","Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","Foreign_member_of_the_Royal_Society","Stanford_University","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder","Charles_Darwin","Mark_Buchanan","Karl_Stetter","George_E._Fox","Norman_R._Pace","Bacterial_phyla","Thomas_Gold","PubMed","Current_Biology","Syracuse,_New_York","Urbana,_Illinois"]}
