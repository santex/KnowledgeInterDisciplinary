{"cursor":"16763","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the mathematical area of order theory, 'completeness properties' assert the\nexistence of certain infima or suprema of a given partially ordered set (poset).\nThe most familiar example is the completeness of the real numbers. A special use\nof the term refers to complete partial orders or complete lattices. However,\nmany other interesting notions of completeness exist.\n\nThe motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great\nimportance of suprema (least upper bounds, joins, \" \\vee \") and\ninfima (greatest lower bounds, meets, \" \\wedge \") to the theory of\npartial orders. Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least\nelement from the set of upper bounds. On the one hand, these special elements\noften embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given\napplication (such as being the least common multiple of a set of numbers or the\nunion of a collection of sets). On the other hand, the knowledge that certain\ntypes of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider\nthe computation of these elements as total operations on a partially ordered\nset. For this reason, posets with certain completeness properties can often be\ndescribed as algebraic structures of a certain kind. In addition, studying the\nproperties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Completeness_(order_theory)","recorded":1362374630,"links":10,"instances":["structure","order_theory","mathematics","order_theory","mathematics","order_theory","mathematics","order","order_theory","set_theory","order_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Order theory"],"headings":["Types of completeness properties","Relationships between completeness properties","Completions of domains","Completeness in terms of universal algebra","Completeness in terms of adjunctions","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/7/727ea4c8c49862411edae46adf506e3e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/a/1ba4f06f68614e5da79a8ebd378d532a.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["join","mathematics"],["meet","mathematics"],["union","set_theory"],["duality","order_theory"],["lattice","order"],["identity","mathematics"],["lattice","order"],["boolean_algebra","structure"],["completion","order_theory"],["ideal","order_theory"],["distributivity","order_theory"],["limit-preserving_function","order_theory"]],"members":["boolean_algebra","distributivity","meet","completion","join","identity","lattice","ideal","union","duality"],"related":["Mathematics","Order_theory","Infimum","Supremum","Completeness_of_the_real_numbers","Complete_partial_order","Complete_lattice","Suprema","Join_(mathematics)","Infima","Meet_(mathematics)","Least_common_multiple","Union_(set_theory)","Poset","Algebraic_structure","Duality_(order_theory)","Empty_set","Least_element","Greatest_element","Lattice_(order)","Mathematical_induction","Semilattice","Semilattice","Complete_lattice","Directed_set","Directed_complete_partial_order","Domain_theory","Complete_partial_order","Bounded_complete","Total_order","Chain_complete","If_and_only_if","Axiom_of_Choice","Denotational_semantics","Actor_model","Order_theory","Actor_model","Algebraic_structure","Universal_algebra","Identity_(mathematics)","Semilattice","Lattice_(order)","Heyting_algebra","Boolean_algebra_(structure)","Galois_connection","If_and_only_if","Product_order","Heyting_algebra","Completion_(order_theory)","Lower_set","Subset","Ideal_(order_theory)","Lower_set","Powerset","Completely_distributive_lattice","Distributivity_(order_theory)","Category_theory","Morphism","Categorical_formulation_of_order_theory","Limit-preserving_function_(order_theory)","Total_order"]}
