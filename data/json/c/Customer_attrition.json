{"cursor":"10434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Customer attrition', also known as 'customer churn', 'customer turnover', or\n'customer defection', is the loss of clients or customers.\n\nBanks, telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV\ncompanies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer\nattrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business\nmetrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the \"...cost of retaining\nan existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.\" Companies from these\nsectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting\nclients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a\ncompany than newly recruited clients.\n\nCompanies usually make a distinction between 'voluntary churn' and 'involuntary\nchurn'. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to\nanother company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to\ncircumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility,\ndeath, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications,\ninvoluntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts\ntend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to\nfactors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as\nhow billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.\n\nWhen companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the\ndistinction between 'gross attrition' and 'net attrition'. Gross attrition is\nthe loss of existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for\ncontracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross\nattrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original\nlocation. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a\nweighted calculation called 'Recurring Monthly Revenue (or RMR)'. In the 2000s,\nthere are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can\nmine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are\nassociated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or\ntechnical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies.\nMore sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models\nthat predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn.\nSince these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors,\nthey are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the\nsubset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Customer_attrition","recorded":1362554906,"links":10,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business intelligence","Business terms"],"headings":["Retail services applications","Research on customer attrition","Predicting customer attrition","Reducing customer attrition","See also","References","Additional reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["metric","mathematics"]],"members":["metric"],"related":["Bank","Internet_service_providers","Pay_TV","Insurance","Metric_(mathematics)","Cash_flow","EBITDA","Customer_service","Business_intelligence","Data_mining","Predictive_analytics","Customer_retention","Financial_services","Predictive_analytics","Business_model","Retail","Telecommunications","Churn_rate","Online_banking","Customer_relationship_management","Demography","Business","Marketing","Customer_service","The_International_Customer_Service_Institute","Churn_rate"]}
